It would symbolize the West\u2019s solidarity with our embattled Ukrainian ally, our rejection of Russia\u2019s seizure of Crimea, and our defiance of the Kremlin\u2019s arrogant, violent, lawless behavior. And it would serve as powerful evidence that, when it comes to standing up for the free world, Donald Trump is not, after all, Vladimir Putin\u2019s poodle.In other words, don\u2019t count on it.That\u2019s the coy promise of a future kiss, not a line drawn in the sand. Trump\u2019s diplomats, particularly U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley, have been tougher. But even she urged that matters be addressed in an obscure and toothless venue called \u201cthe Normandy Four Format,\u201d where Russia has a seat \u2014 and effectively a veto \u2014 while the U.S. has neither. Had Barack Obama behaved similarly (as he mostly did during the Crimean and Donbass crises), conservatives would have been in full throat, decrying weakness, appeasement and American retreat.Hence the only other sensical hypothesis \u2014 namely, Trump\u2019s self-interest \u2014 which even conservatives need to admit has become much more plausible following Michael Cohen\u2019s guilty plea this week. The president\u2019s former fixer now admits that he lied to Congress over the timing and extent of his efforts to make contacts and win contracts in Moscow on behalf of the Trump Organization, which lasted until at least June 2016, after Trump had essentially clinched the Republican nomination for president. By then questions about his Russia ties were fast becoming a political liability.Now the president and his apologists are mounting an astonishing defense \u2014 accusing Cohen of being a liar while insisting there was nothing wrong with the very business dealings Trump previously lied about. If Cohen is lying, why does the president now freely admit to the truth of Cohen\u2019s claims? If there was nothing wrong with the dealings, why did candidate Trump repeatedly deny them?None of this amounts to impeachable offenses \u2014 yet. But it is squalid, smelly and suspicious, and another reminder of why Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation of Trump\u2019s finances is no fishing expedition. Any Republican who claims to be alarmed by Putin\u2019s aggression in Ukraine, Syria, Salisbury or Menlo Park can\u2019t be serious if he isn\u2019t willing to protect that investigation from its principal enemies, starting with the president and his acting attorney general.Kasparov\u2019s good advice on Russia policy needs a corollary. We need a naval flotilla to help break Putin\u2019s efforts to strangle Ukraine. We also need its political equivalent to break the president\u2019s efforts to strangle the special counsel. The Flake-Coons bill just strangled in the Senate would have been a start.Advertisement"}

But it\u2019s capable of performing different styles and dynamics, and it can eke out a decent \u201cJingle Bells:\u201dFor inspiration, Ms. Hughes and her collaborators turned to the human hand.\u201cWe don\u2019t just have intelligence in our brain \u2014 we have intelligence distributed throughout the whole of our body,\u201d Ms. Hughes said, adding that much of \u201cintelligence arises from physical structure and mechanics.\u201d For that reason, her team designed a mechanical hand with bones and ligaments placed as they are in nature.Next, they evaluated how hard or soft different components needed to be. In the absence of motors, these varying levels of stiffness generate complexity. \u201cWe wanted to replicate how the human hand is strong and powerful, but also capable of performing light and delicate movements,\u201d Ms. Hughes said.The researchers fabricated the hand with a 3-D printer that blended hard plastic and soft rubber in different ratios to create ligaments and joints with varying degrees of stiffness. Then they attached the hand to a robot arm that is commonly used in industrial assembly lines.Her team broke piano playing into three types of movement: single finger strikes, jumps and sliding thumb movements. They used three musical excerpts to gauge their robot\u2019s abilities.The first, from \u201cToccata,\u201d by the Italian composer Scarlatti, requires a series of punctuated, or staccato, raps, usually performed with the index finger. The engineers found that keeping this forefinger very stiff came closest to approximating how a human would play the notes. They made the surrounding digits less stiff, to ensure that the robot could also play progressions that were soft and slurred, or legato.Next, the researchers used \u201cAlligator Crawl,\u201d by the American jazz pianist Fats Waller, to study their robot\u2019s ability to play octaves. Big jumps, they found, require stretchy ligaments in the valleys between fingers but moderately stiff joints in the fingers themselves to ensure clear notes on landing.Finally, Ms. Hughes\u2019s team turned to the thumb, an especially complex digit. \u201cRhapsody in Blue,\u201d by the American composer George Gershwin, helped them model how a thumb skates across keys to create a slide in pitch, called a glissando. Low stiffness in the thumb joints \u2014 the lowest the researchers tested \u2014 helped create a smooth glissando. It also allowed the index finger to cross over the thumb, a tricky maneuver that pianists employ often to flow between keys more easily.Compared with many previous piano bots, this one showed flexibility in volume control, thumb movements and playing both staccato and legato, Ms. Hughes said. She next plans to add sensors, motors and components that act like tendons, which will help create a wider range of behaviors.Ultimately, she hopes to create a robot that can play piano expressively, rather than just focusing on rigid accuracy.\u201cWe\u2019re going beyond simply treating notes as a list of instructions,\u201d she said. \u201cPiano playing is an art. We\u2019re trying to introduce that complexity, depth and artistry into our robot\u2019s behavior.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Markets in Europe and Asia, however, ended Monday in the red.Among other technology stocks, Microsoft shares climbed 2.6 percent and Facebook rose more than 3 percent.

British lawmakers had been expected to vote on the plan on Tuesday.In London, the FTSE 100 dropped about 0.8 percent. The pound also fell against the dollar, hitting its lowest level since April 2017.Economic data released on Monday also provided investors with more evidence of a slowdown among export-based economies. Figures from Japan showed that the country\u2019s economy shrank more in the third quarter than initially reported, and data from China revealed a sharp slowdown in trade last month.Energy producers, meanwhile, tumbled along with crude oil prices. Exxon Mobil shares fell 1.4 percent. Financial stocks also fared poorly.In a sign that investors were less worried about the situation, semiconductor companies, which rely on supply chains in Asia and have become a barometer of investor sentiment about United States-China relations, rose on Monday. Advanced Micro Devices, for example, rose 2.7 percent.But China is just one of several worries investors are fixated on. Others are rising interest rates and already sluggish sectors of the American economy, like housing and autos.\u201cInvestors are focused on a lot of these walls of worry that are out there,\u201d said Michael Gibbs, director of portfolio and technical strategy at the brokerage firm Raymond James in Memphis. \u201cUntil we get some clarity on some of those, the market\u2019s going to continue to struggle.\u201dMatt Phillips contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Mr. Kosinski is an assistant professor at Stanford University\u2019s Graduate School of Business.As a data scientist, I am shocked that anyone continues to believe this claim. Each time you click on a Facebook ad, Facebook sells data on you to that advertiser. This is such a basic property of online targeted advertising that it would be impossible to avoid, even if Facebook somehow wanted to.Or even better, let Mr. Zuckerberg explain, as he did to the Senate in April: \u201cWhat we allow is for advertisers to tell us who they want to reach, and then we do the placement. So, if an advertiser comes to us and says, \u2018All right, I am a ski shop and I want to sell skis to women\u2019 \u2026 we can show the ads to the right people without that data ever changing hands and going to the advertiser.\u201d Let\u2019s take a closer look at Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s ski shop example. The ski shop pays Facebook to show a targeted ad to women and sends the women to the ski shop\u2019s website if the women click on the ad. Mr. Zuckerberg describes this process as showing \u201cthe ads to the right people without that data ever changing hands and going to the advertiser.\u201d But this isn\u2019t true: If a ski shop pays Facebook to show an ad only to women, then Facebook automatically reveals to the ski shop that all people who clicked on the link must be women. And in practice, the advertisers make requests that are much more nuanced. They may ask Facebook to show their ad to \u201cliberal Latina women without college education who live in San Antonio and recently got married.\u201d And then they might place a separate ad that is shown only to \u201cconservative African-American women with college educations who live in Austin and are single.\u201d When you click on an ad and are sent to an advertiser\u2019s website, the advertiser knows which ad you saw and thus which bucket you fall in.Facebook has a lot of data on their users and is eager to monetize it. The advertisers are encouraged to selectively target people according to a mind-boggling range of personal characteristics. Some, such as age, gender or location, are not overly intimate. Others, such as your political views, family size, education, occupation, marital status or interest in a gay dating app, are highly personal. But Facebook is extremely clever at dodging this issue. When the company argues that it is not selling data, but rather selling targeted advertising, it\u2019s luring you into a semantic trap, encouraging you to imagine that the only way of selling data is to send advertisers a file filled with user information. Congress may have fallen for this trap set up by Mr. Zuckerberg, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to. The fact that your data is not disclosed in an Excel spreadsheet but through a click on a targeted ad is irrelevant. Data still changes hands and goes to the advertiser. Facebook's claiming that it is not selling user data is like a bar\u2019s giving away a free martini with every $12 bag of peanuts and then claiming that it\u2019s not selling drinks. Rich user data is Facebook\u2019s most prized possession, and the company sure isn\u2019t throwing it in for free.Importantly, this problem is not limited to Facebook. Other Big Tech companies, including Google and Amazon, have similar ad platforms. If a platform can be used to target specific users, then it reveals those users\u2019 data. The advertiser could easily create its own data file based on this information, or merge the information with any other data it has on a customer.To address this problem, we need to offer users both transparency and control. Before being directed to an advertiser\u2019s site, users should be told which of their traits were used in targeting them. They should also be warned that, if they continue, these traits will be revealed to the advertiser.Facebook cannot be trusted to fix this problem itself. Would you trust Big Tobacco\u2019s claims about lung cancer? What about Big Sugar\u2019s claims about obesity? Then why would you believe what Big Tech has to say about data privacy? Markets, including the market for consumer data, do not work efficiently when a company like Facebook is allowed to abuse its market position to ignore its users\u2019 rights, needs and wishes. Policymakers have no choice but to step in, restore the balance of power and protect citizens\u2019 privacy.Michal Kosinski is an assistant professor at Stanford University\u2019s Graduate School of Business.

{"Headline": "Chaos? A Trump Specialty ", "Date": "2018-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs usual, the drama is all about the president.Ms. Cottle is a member of the editorial board.\u2019Twas the week before Christmas, and all through the House, not a creature was stirring \u2014 even though a chunk of the federal government is set to shut down at week\u2019s end unless Congress and President Trump reconcile his demand for additional border-wall funding with Democratic lawmakers\u2019 position that they\u2019d rather eat their own toenails than approve a penny for his folly.Ordinarily, the strategy in such a situation is for each team to try to hang a shutdown around the neck of the other. Mr. Trump made that impossible for Republicans last Tuesday when, during a televised sit-down with Democratic congressional leaders, he said he\u2019d be \u201cproud\u201d to \u201ctake the mantle\u201d for grinding government operations to a halt. \u201cI\u2019m not going to blame you for it,\u201d he promised the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer.At that moment, you could almost see Mr. Schumer and the House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi, begin to quiver with glee.Republicans, by contrast, promptly began lamenting that no one had any clue how to avert the looming crisis. On the Senate side, Mr. Schumer\u2019s office has maintained that everything depends on whether the Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, can persuade the president to embrace a deal that Democrats can live with. The offer currently on the table is for a one-year \u201ccontinuing resolution,\u201d or C.R., that would delay the fight by temporarily funding parts of the government at current levels.By Tuesday, the president had reversed course and begun searching for a way out of the hole he\u2019d dug \u2014 but in a way that wouldn\u2019t look like he was caving. His press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said he\u2019d be open to something resembling the bipartisan compromise hammered out by Senate appropriators earlier this year, which included $1.6 billion to fortify existing barriers. The rest of the $5 billion, she said, could be siphoned from other agencies, an idea that prompted immediate blowback from Democrats. Mr. Schumer and Ms. Pelosi also smacked down Mr. McConnell\u2019s offer of a spending plan that contained an extra $1 billion for what they deemed an immigration \u201cslush fund.\u201d Lawmakers from both parties say some kind of continuing resolution is still the most likely way forward. But what exactly the president would agree to remains foggy, and Ms. Sanders refused to provide any clarity at a press briefing Tuesday afternoon. Whatever his plan \u2014 assuming he has one \u2014 the president is clearly looking to wring every ounce of drama he can from this game of chicken. These standoffs jibe neatly with his belief that negotiations, and life in general, are a never-ending battle of nerve. He lives to make the other side blink and is eager to signal that he\u2019ll do whatever it takes to get his way \u2014 even when he ultimately winds up capitulating.Chest thumping and trash talking remain central to Mr. Trump\u2019s brand as a disrupter. His followers thrill to him precisely because of his pugilistic, vaguely unhinged personality. The more he rails against politics as usual, the more his base swoons.As for those who see Mr. Trump as behaving like a petulant toddler, he doesn\u2019t have to face their electoral judgment for another two years, an eternity in politics.And even if he winds up backing down \u2014 as he has before and seems likely to do in this case as well \u2014 he\u2019ll simply spew a bunch of nonsensical double talk and alternative facts and declare victory. In any event, he has ensured that this holiday season\u2019s drama is, once more, all about him.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Screen Time Bad for Kids\u2019 Brains?", "Date": "2018-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA study featured on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d is sure to alarm parents. Here\u2019s what scientists know, and don\u2019t know, about the link between screens, behavior, and development.A generation ago, parents worried about the effects of TV; before that, it was radio. Now, the concern is \u201cscreen time,\u201d a catchall term for the amount of time that children, especially preteens and teenagers, spend interacting with TVs, computers, smartphones, digital pads, and video games. This age group draws particular attention because screen immersion rises sharply during adolescence, and because brain development accelerates then, too, as neural networks are pruned and consolidated in the transition to adulthood.Yes, but so does every other activity that children engage in: sleep, homework, playing soccer, arguing, growing up in poverty, reading, vaping behind the school. The adolescent brain continually changes, or \u201crewires\u201d itself, in response to daily experience, and that adaptation continues into the early to mid 20s.What scientists want to learn is whether screen time, at some threshold, causes any measurable differences in adolescent brain structure or function, and whether those differences are meaningful. Do they cause attention deficits, mood problems, or delays in reading or problem-solving ability?Even if scientists found strong evidence of a single, measurable effect \u2014 if, say, three hours of daily screen time was associated with a heightened risk of being diagnosed with A.D.H.D. \u2014 such a clear association wouldn\u2019t necessarily suggest there were any consistent, measurable differences in brain structure.Individual variation is the rule in brain development. The size of specific brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex, the rate at which those regions edit and consolidate their networks, and the variations in these parameters from person to person make it very difficult to interpret findings. To address such obstacles, scientists need huge numbers of research subjects and a far better understanding of the brain.Yes. The ongoing A.B.C.D. study expects to follow 11,800 children through adolescence, with annual magnetic resonance imaging, to see if changes in the brain are linked to behavior or health. The study began in 2013, recruiting 21 academic research centers, and initially focused on the effects of drug and alcohol use on the adolescent brain. Since then, the project has expanded, and now includes other targets such as the effects of brain injury, screen time, genetics, and an array of \u201cother environmental factors.\u201dBut the accuracy of self-reported screen time estimates is hard to ascertain. And the association between small differences in brain structure and how people actually behave is even more vague. As a result, researchers effectively are multiplying one uncertain relationship by another, and need to make statistical adjustments. Clear conclusions are extremely hard to come by, and complicated by the fact that a brain scan is no more than a snapshot in time: a year from now, some of the observed relationships could be reversed. The authors acknowledge as much. \u201cThis diversity of findings provides an important public health message, that screen media activity is not simply bad for the brain or bad for brain- related functioning,\u201d they concluded. It\u2019s probably both bad and good for the brain, depending on the individual and his or her viewing habits. Many people who are socially isolated, as a result of abuse, personal quirks or developmental differences such as Asperger\u2019s syndrome, establish social networks through their screens that would be impossible to find in person.Most parents are probably already aware of the biggest downside of screen time: the extent to which it can displace other childhood experiences, including sleep, climbing over fences, designing elaborate practical jokes and getting into trouble. Indeed, many parents \u2014 maybe most \u2014 watched hours of TV a day themselves as youngsters. Their experiences may be more similar to their children\u2019s than they know.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why I\u2019ll Enjoy Reflecting on Tennis in the Off-Season ", "Date": "2018-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySportingThe 2018 season is over. Will the Big 3 still stand tall next year, or will we finally get a long-awaited youthful sea change? Mr. Phillips is the author of \u201cThe Circuit: A Tennis Odyssey.\u201dOn my 11th birthday I gave myself a precious gift: I sneaked in some late-night TV time. Wrapped in a blanket in the messy, improvisational way of children, I sat with my knees tucked under my chin determined to watch \u201cMonday Night Football.\u201dI wasn\u2019t even that into football, but the chance to steal a little taste of what I thought looked like adulthood was too good for me to pass up. I didn\u2019t know any better, and how I wish I had. Because that was the night, on what at first seemed an innocuous play and another quarterback sack for Lawrence Taylor, when the Washington Redskins\u2019 quarterback, Joe Theismann, had his lower leg snapped in two. I don\u2019t know whether I decided that night that sports and birthdays don\u2019t mix or it was decided for me. But on the 33 birthdays that have come and gone since then, I avoid sports.That is, with one exception. Tennis. Watching tennis has tended to soothe rather than agitate me. Tennis has bridged the gap between that young version of myself and whatever stage of life I\u2019m at now. And so, as my wife ran yet another weekend race in Central Park and our daughters did the millions of things that they tend to do on a Sunday morning, I spent the first daylight hours of my birthday under the spell, for one last time, of the 2018 tennis season.The old guard of the men\u2019s tour once again split the biggest prizes in the game among themselves. Including the 2004 season, 60 Grand Slam tournaments have been played. Roger Federer, Rafa Nadal and Novak Djokovic have won 50 of those. You read that right: 50. For two seasons running, all of the Grand Slams have been won by these three players.When Roger Federer won the first Grand Slam of 2018, the Australian Open, and Rafa Nadal won the second, the French Open, it seemed to me like we were well on our way to seeing more of Federer and Nadal dominate. In 2017, Djokovic had mysteriously fallen apart, and the first half of this year bore all the signs of a continuation of his wane. I missed him. The ruthless, millimetric precision of his game is something you appreciate most after it has been gone for a while.It wasn\u2019t gone for long. For most of the second half of 2018, the stage lights fixed themselves back on the 31-year-old Serb. Djokovic seemed not only unbeatable but practically unplayable. He won his fourth Wimbledon title; he followed up by winning the prestigious warm-up to the U.S. Open in Cincinnati, the U.S. Open after that and then one of the biggest prizes of the fall, the Shanghai Masters, where he audaciously lost neither a set nor a service game.The year had one more twist: youth. Brave, resilient youth. In the finals of big tournaments, no less. I was excited to catch a glimpse of it.The temptation is strong to embrace these results as signs of some long-awaited sea change. Are these results the dawn of a new age for the talented young players to challenge for Grand Slam titles?I\u2019m not buying it. I\u2019m buying it a little. No, I\u2019m not buying it. O.K., maybe this time. Who knows? But it has been so long since a young player has turned a major victory into the fuel for a sustained run in major tournaments. Haven\u2019t we heard the enthused prophesies bestowed now on Zverev and (somewhat now) on Khachanov before? Still, now on the other side of 30 and carrying the mileage of a long season in his head and body, an in-form Djokovic couldn\u2019t beat back the surging tide of talented youth. (The only other loss for Djokovic after his Wimbledon resurgence was in Toronto against 20-year-old Stefanos Tsitsipas of Greece.)Tsitsipas, Khachanov and Zverev are different types of players cut from a similar physical mold: Tsitsipas is 6-foot-4, while Khachanov and Zverev are both 6-foot-6. Professional men\u2019s tennis players may not be better these days, but they certainly are bigger. And in each of their matches against Djokovic, especially the final two against Khachanov and Zverev, the young players brought a physicality to their matches that sufficed when and how experience could not.Maybe this is where the reign of Roger, Rafa and Novak is now heading: Maybe now, after a decade of seeing a few players win just about every important tournament, these upstart post-Grand Slam uprisings are the first step to whatever it is in tennis that\u2019s coming next.And yet, when the lights have gotten hottest and the matches have grown to their longest, the same players have been standing there in the end. I saw it on Djokovic\u2019s face as, unimpressed with waiting at the net for Zverev to rise to his feet and meet him at the net for the post-match handshake, he crossed over to Zverev\u2019s side of the court, looking down at him with a wry and friendly smile on his face but with another expression in his eyes.I don\u2019t quite have the words for it, but come January in Melbourne, we\u2019ll know what it meant.Advertisement"}

Does that work?\u201dWeekend Update Jokes of the WeekAt the \u201cWeekend Update\u201d desk, the anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che continued to riff on a calamitous week for the Trump administration.Jost:This last week was a pretty bad year for Donald Trump. Think about what\u2019s currently under investigation for him: Trump\u2019s campaign, his transition, his inauguration, his business and his presidency. So everyone check your cards because you might have impeachment bingo. In fact, Trump has reportedly told people close to him that he\u2019s worried he will get impeached. And by people close t him, I of course mean Sean Hannity and Colonel Sanders. This is a lot of legal trouble for any president. I mean, I\u2019m no lawyer but neither is Trump\u2019s lawyer. This week, Michael Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison and he claimed he only committed his crimes out of a blind loyalty to Trump. But Cohen was clearly a crook before he met Donald Trump. You know how I know? He was hired by Donald Trump. The only questions on a trump job application are, \u201cDo you do crimes?\u201d And \u201cWanna do more?\u201dChe:President Trump responded to Michael Cohen\u2019s sentencing by tweeting, \u201cI never directed Michael Cohen to break the law. He was a lawyer and he is supposed to know the law.\u201d Fair. But you know who else is supposed to know the law? The friggin\u2019 president of the United States. I can\u2019t get past that. I mean, the pope should know the bible. Santa should know the meaning of Christmas. The president should know the law. Dude, we are paying you money for this.Reason to Stay Up Until 1 A.M. of the WeekAs McKinnon opened the show, she said, \u201cWhat a dreadful week it\u2019s been. My Brexit deal is falling apart.

{"Headline": "A Different Kind of Sheet Pan Supper", "Date": "2018-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Good AppetitePork loin roasted on a bed of cider-moistened apples and onions is a wintry dish suitable for entertaining or a cozy Sunday supper. My old rule of thumb used to be that when I wanted to roast a big hunk of meat, I\u2019d reach for my roasting pan to get the job done. With its deep sides and sturdy handles, the pan is easy to maneuver in and out of the oven, and is spacious enough to hold a bevy of veggies underneath the meat, which then browns gloriously on top.But what\u2019s the point of rules that you can\u2019t occasionally break? Sometimes, a shallow-sided sheet pan works better, like when you want the liquid in the bottom of your pan to condense and evaporate, forming the basis for a heady sauce. And such is the case in this recipe for pork loin with cider, apples and onions, roasted directly and unapologetically on a rimmed sheet pan.The downside of a sheet pan is that once you add the cider, the pan can overflow. The trick is to arrange the pork and vegetables on the pan, and transfer it to the oven before pouring in the liquid. Watch as you pour, adding just enough to coat the apples and onions, but not so much that liquid sloshes over the sides when you push the oven rack in. Then keep an eye on it; if the pan starts to burn, tip in a bit more cider.While this recipe does require your attention, the results are worth it: juicy roast pork \u2014 infused with the flavor of rosemary, fennel and cinnamon-laced cider \u2014 served with meltingly tender browned onions and apples.Because the combination of pork and caramelized apples is such a rich one, I pair it with tangy pickled apples and green chiles that come together in under 10 minutes (plus a couple hours\u2019 pickling time). The piquant apples and chile bits can be eaten alongside the meat while the brine gets drizzled on top for an even sharper jolt.And if the whole sheet-pan thing seems too precarious, and you\u2019d rather cook the meat in a roasting pan, you can. The apples and onions may not get quite as golden, but it will still be a sweet and snappy dish no matter how you roast it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Wine Thief", "Date": "2018-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNicolas DeMeyer was a scammer. Or a hero for the age of inequality. Or a young man haunted by the death of a dear friend. Or all of these things.He had no Facebook, Instagram or Twitter account. Close friends can barely recall what he did for a living between 1999, when he graduated from Vassar College, and 2008, when he became the personal assistant to David Solomon, now the C.E.O. of Goldman Sachs.There were evasions and white lies \u2014 in college, Mr. DeMeyer said he was the son of German nobility \u2014 but for the most part, Mr. DeMeyer\u2019s flights of fancy seemed relatively harmless.Then, in January 2018, after 14 months of traveling the world, he was arrested by federal agents at Los Angeles International Airport before he could even collect his luggage. His crime? Looting $1.2 million of wine from the cellar of Mr. Solomon\u2019s home in East Hampton.Nine months later, Mr. DeMeyer was in New York for a scheduled court appearance, and was expected to plead guilty. Instead, he jumped to his death from the 33rd floor of the Carlyle Hotel. Had he robbed a random 0.1 percenter, it would have been easy simply to take the word of people who knew Mr. DeMeyer and described him as a modern-day Tom Ripley, just another grifter undeserving of empathy. But Goldman Sachs is a flash point in the rise of economic inequality \u2014 and Mr. DeMeyer lifted more than 500 bottles of Mr. Solomon\u2019s wine without anyone noticing. So perhaps there was a certain inevitability to the recasting of Mr. DeMeyer as Butch Cassidy in Herm\u00e8s sneakers. His long con made Mr. DeMeyer\u2019s tale something of a parable of our age, a dark fantasy for millions of people who serve the plutocrat class and dream of getting even. \u201cYou never knew the truth of things with Nick. The appearance of things was very important to him,\u201d said Andrew Fitzpatrick, who went to high school with Mr. DeMeyer in Findlay, Ohio (population estimate: 40,000), and for a little more than a year was his best friend.Back then, Mr. DeMeyer was Nickolas Meyer. His parents were divorced and he was mostly raised by his mother, Jane Rettig, the owner of a local self-storage business.According to friends, he got through geometry by obtaining an advance copy of the final exam from an upperclassman, and he won an award for his French mostly by charming his teacher.Mr. Fitzpatrick said that Mr. DeMeyer drove a white Mustang to school, shopped for clothes at Benetton and The Limited, and had a girlfriend named Pamela, who was \u201cthe right girl to date \u2014 trendy, popular and doing the \u2018Clueless\u2019 look before the movie came out. She had gorgeous red hair and drove a convertible. We would leave school during lunch, and drive around in her car singing Abba and talking about how we had to get out of this town.\u201dIn a rare photo from Findlay High School\u2019s 1995 yearbook, Mr. DeMeyer looked Kennedy-esque in a dark ribbed sweater and a white button-down, a backpack hanging from a shoulder.Things ended poorly for the trio, Mr. Fitzpatrick said: \u201cOne day, I was in the cafeteria, and Nick walked up to me and said \u2018You have to decide: Are you my friend or Pamela\u2019s?\u2019 I said \u2018Well, Pamela never asked me anything like that, so I guess her.\u2019 But I never understood how he could just cut me out of his life in an instant like I didn\u2019t matter.\u201dVassar College, once known as the alma mater of Jacqueline Onassis and Meryl Streep, was, by the time Mr. Meyer arrived in 1995, a haven for worldly artistic kids who were too urban for Kenyon and Oberlin but didn\u2019t have the grades or scores for Brown or Yale.What students at Vassar lacked in drive, they made up for in black eyeliner. On campus, in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., Mr. DeMeyer drove a black BMW, carried his books in a black Louis Vuitton knapsack and kept a stuffed animal in his dorm room named Aloysius, after the one in \u201cBrideshead Revisited.\u201d He also started dating guys.He dropped the k from Nickolas and changed his last name to Von Meyer. Eventually, he settled on DeMeyer.\u201cI can\u2019t say I was friends with Nick, but you couldn\u2019t help but notice him on campus,\u201d said Carl Cade, who graduated in 2000. \u201cI even bought the German nobility act, despite that I looked him up in the Vassar directory and wondered how the hell a German noble was from Findlay, Ohio. It didn\u2019t really stand out because there were so many of us who were scholarship kids pretending to be posh and there were so many of us who were rich kids pretending to be street. Vassar was a grifter\u2019s dream. I remember he once announced that he was getting rid of a Gucci camel coat and whoever came over first would get it free.\u201dRay Windsor, another classmate, doesn\u2019t buy the idea that Mr. DeMeyer was a Mr. Ripley in waiting. \u201cHe was well dressed for no other reason than that he liked being an aesthete,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was an art history major!\u201dBut Mr. Windsor does recall that there were gaps in Mr. DeMeyer\u2019s story. The first several years they were friends, Mr. Windsor was under the impression Mr. DeMeyer\u2019s father worked in real estate and lived in Germany, possibly in a castle.Mr. DeMeyer\u2019s mother ultimately told Mr. Windsor that the story was untrue. \u201cShe told me he just was a regular old dad in Ohio and asked me to please not say anything because Nicolas was going to tell me himself,\u201d Mr. Windsor said. \u201cAnd then Nicolas did, about six months later.\u201dThere was never really any question Mr. DeMeyer would come to New York after college. It was less clear what he planned to do there.Mr. Windsor recalls hearing about an internship at The New Republic, some time spent working at an art gallery. The two hung out together at gay bars like the Cock, Boiler Room and Phoenix. \u201cI think he was always kind of supported by his family,\u201d Mr. Windsor said. Then Mr. DeMeyer moved to Rome for a graduate degree. By the time Mr. Windsor visited him in 2005, Mr. DeMeyer was fluent in Italian. He also had a new boyfriend, Sandro Ribeiro, a handsome Brazilian. They lived in a small stylish apartment in Trastevere.The couple moved back to New York in 2007 and took an apartment in the Meurice, a prewar building on West 58th Street. There, they entertained debutantes, gay men and night life characters.After Mr. DeMeyer went to work for Mr. Solomon and his wife as the couple\u2019s personal assistant, he and Mr. Ribeiro often stayed at the Solomons\u2019 Hamptons home.Mr. DeMeyer seemed to know a lot about art, furniture and movies. \u201cHe would show us trailers for obscure foreign gay films,\u201d said Ash Blount, who became a friend around 2009. \u201cFor someone who I assumed was just another trust fund baby, he actually had a lot of depth.\u201dBut his snob side did come out.Once Mr. Blount, who lived in Brooklyn, arrived at Mr. DeMeyer\u2019s with a shoulder bag. \u201cHe cracked this joke like, \u2018That\u2019s one of the great things about living in Manhattan. I never need to pack a bag.\u201d\u201cHe put it away, opened something better and said, \u2018We just got back from Rome,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Blount, who now wonders whether the wine was stolen.The two fell out in 2010 or so. \u201cI would call and say \u2018I\u2019m in your neighborhood.\u2019 He would say \u2018I\u2019m in Rome,\u2019\u201d Mr. Blount said. \u201cThat\u2019s how we lost touch.\u201dMr. Windsor\u2019s relationship with Mr. DeMeyer was severed by one boozy night in 2012. \u201cThere was an incident that was half my fault and half his,\u201d Mr. Windsor said.\u201cAli Can seems great,\u201d Mr. DeMeyer wrote in an email in 2009. \u201cAs fun and silly as ever.\u201dThe next year, Mr. Ertug died by suicide, jumping from the window of his Central Park West apartment. According to people who knew him at work, before this event he\u2019d become fixated on an oligarch who\u2019d lost interest in him.Following Mr. Ertug\u2019s death, Mr. DeMeyer joined Mr. Blount, Mr. Windsor and a couple other Vassar graduates in Central Park\u2019s Sheep Meadow, where they drank wine, looked up at Mr. Ertug\u2019s apartment and told stories about their friend.But there was also, Mr. Blount thought, a manic quality that suffused Mr. Ertug\u2019s life. When Mr. DeMeyer died in a similar fashion eight years later, the parallels were hard to ignore.Wine theft became Mr. DeMeyer\u2019s primary source of income in January 2014, according to prosecutors\u2019 court filings. Over the next two years, they said, he stole more than 500 bottles from Mr. Solomon without even arousing suspicion. Most bottles were sold to a wine distributor in North Carolina named Ryan Chaland, who runs the wholesaler Wine Liquidators.Mr. Albright was pleased to get his hands on such exceptional stock but found it strange that the bottles had wound up with a dealer like Mr. Chaland. \u201cThey really aren\u2019t wines that would typically go to a liquidator,\u201d he said.Worried that they might be counterfeits, Mr. Albright put out calls to colleagues, who discovered from the serial numbers that they were real but stolen.Mr. Solomon initially had no idea the wine was even missing, until he heard from his dealer asking if he knew the bottles had been sold. He did not. He also did not suspect Mr. DeMeyer, who calmly led East Hampton detectives around Mr. Solomon\u2019s wine cellar on Nov. 7, 2016.But the next day Mr. DeMeyer was back in New York, and his demeanor changed.He promised to pay the Solomons back and made a plan to meet Mary in the morning at his bank. Then he left the restaurant, headed to Kennedy Airport, and used his American Express card to purchase a $5,300 plane ticket to Rome.A week later, prosecutors said, he called Mary and again confessed to stealing from her. He said he left for his \u201chome in Italy\u201d because he was scared of being arrested and couldn\u2019t bear the idea of going to prison. A criminal investigation was already underway. The Solomons\u2019 insurance company was involved. Mary told him the decision to press charges wasn\u2019t up to her.Mr. DeMeyer did not have a home in Italy. He did have a pair of $17,500 checks from Wine Liquidators that he left with his mother. Over the next year, she slowly deposited money into his bank account.Mr. DeMeyer spent November and December in Rome and Capri. In January 2017 he traveled to Marrakesh for a friend\u2019s birthday party. In February, he went to Rio and Buenos Aires, then back to Rio. The relationship between Mr. DeMeyer and his longtime partner Mr. Ribeiro busted up, and Mr. DeMeyer started seeing someone new. The new couple spent part of that summer together in Zurich.Around that time, investigators discovered $153,000 in checks and wire transfers from Wine Liquidators to Mr. Ribeiro\u2019s J.P. Morgan account from 2014 to 2016. Hundreds of other bottles had been stolen. It wasn\u2019t until September that Mr. DeMeyer was indicted \u2014 on one charge of interstate transportation of stolen property. Four months later, he nonchalantly returned to the United States and was arrested \u2014 likely a surprise to him, as his indictment had been sealed. According to Sabrina Shroff, the lawyer who took his case, he was in Los Angeles to meet someone about a job prospect.At his bail hearing \u2014 which took place after weeks of bouncing between jails \u2014 she pointed out that he\u2019d traveled the world under his own name. \u201cAt any point, they could\u2019ve put a flag on him, put up a request for a warrant, put up an Interpol warning, arrested him and brought him here. They seemed to have done no such thing, and I\u2019m kind of confused as to why,\u201d Ms. Shroff said. \u201cAll of his travel was transparent and open and clear.\u201dHe was not happy to be back in the hometown he had spent his life running away from. Conor Corcoran, a Vassar classmate, was one of many who said he was unsurprised that Mr. DeMeyer had turned to white-collar crime.\u201cThe character of a man who lifts a million dollars\u2019 worth of hooch was on display in Poughkeepsie 20 years ago,\u201d he said, calling Mr. DeMeyer a \u201csocially carnivorous\u201d \u201ctalented Mr. Ripley type\u201d who \u201cwas always peddling a patently false image of himself.\u201d\u201cHe was not a mean guy,\u201d Mr. Corcoran said, \u201cbut there was a beady quality to him. Something was off.\u201dMr. Fitzpatrick, who Mr. DeMeyer mistreated all those years before, mostly agreed. But he also felt a hint of admiration for Mr. DeMeyer\u2019s chutzpah.\u201cBefore he died, everyone I know was like, \u2018Go girl, get the money,\u2019\u201d Mr. Fitzpatrick said. \u201cThere was a part of me that was cheering him on and rooting for him. This guy from Goldman Sachs was so rich, he never even noticed any of the wine was missing. Had Nick not stolen seven really rare bottles, he could still be doing this and the guy would have no idea.\u201dOn Oct. 9, Mr. DeMeyer was in New York for his hearing, staying at the Carlyle.Mr. DeMeyer\u2019s death seemed senseless to his friends. \u201cHe would have done a year or two and people would have embraced him because the whole city operates on avaricious class aspirational indentured servitude,\u201d Mr. Corcoran said. \u201cSomebody would have taken him in.\u201dMr. Windsor, drawing a comparison to the jail time served by Martha Stewart, said: \u201cIt could have been not the end but the beginning of something far greater.\u201d There was also the way Mr. DeMeyer reportedly made guards witness his death. That really bothered Mr. Corcoran, who saw it as yet another act of disassociation and self-absorption, a thing for others to \u201ccarry\u201d with them for the rest of their lives.Back in college, Mr. DeMeyer and Mr. Windsor had read Andrew Holleran\u2019s \u201cDancer From the Dance,\u201d a novel about gay life in the 1970s that ends with the protagonist killing himself to avoid old age and icy stares.Mr. Windsor memorialized Mr. DeMeyer on Facebook last month with a quotation from the book: \u201cDreams are all equipped with revolving doors. Someone is always walking into the one you are leaving.\u201dHe added some words of his own: \u201cAnyone who walked in to Nicolas\u2019s life felt like they were in a dream. He was so exceedingly charming and elusive.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the year Carl Cade graduated from Vassar. It was 2000, not 1996.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hundreds of Complaints Flood In About New York Store Signs, but From Whom?", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe calls to 311 started to pick up steam about a year ago.They were complaints about an arcane New York City statute requiring special permits for businesses to hang signs or awnings larger than six square feet.The caller \u2014 or callers \u2014 was clearly targeting certain commercial strips, making complaints in batches, as on Nov. 26, when calls came in reporting 25 businesses along a two-block stretch of Eighth Avenue in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. The businesses did not have a license for their signs, the complaints said.But it wasn\u2019t just a couple of days of calls, city data shows. In Brooklyn, the hardest-hit borough, 234 calls about illegal signage were made to New York City\u2019s help line in November \u2014 compared with 23 the same month last year. And the calls are still coming in.\u201cI feel they came after us,\u201d said Waddah Mubarz, a travel agent with offices in Bay Ridge and near Atlantic Terminal in Brooklyn, and on White Plains Road in the Bronx. He received violations in all three places.\u201cIt\u2019s so expensive,\u201d he groaned. \u201cBut we have to pay it.\u201dThe law about permits is meant to ensure signs are properly installed, so that one doesn\u2019t, say, suddenly fall off and hit someone on the head. Once a complaint to 311 about unlicensed signs or awning is filed, the city is required to investigate and may issue violations that carry a minimum fine of $6,000. Replacing a sign can cost thousands more.Many store owners have pre-emptively taken their signs down out of fear of being reported.The missing signs are unmissable. Local joints are left to advertise with concrete bald spots, patchy from where brackets were hastily torn down. Uncovered fluorescent tubes that once gently backlit a deli\u2019s name glare at neighbors passing by.But who was responsible? Who was the mystery caller? And why?Could it be someone who stood to gain, like a sign hanger? Maybe someone with a vendetta? A local busybody, incensed about infractions against the municipal code? Or could it be real estate developers looking to push tenants out?Whatever the motive behind the calls, businesses that have received violations and some local officials are asking why the city is allowing 311 to be used like a weapon against mom-and-pop shops.\u201cPeople are afraid,\u201d said Zaid Nagi, vice president of the Yemeni American Merchants Association, who owns three cellphone businesses (with signs still hanging) in the Bronx. \u201cThey are asking, why is New York City pushing the little guy out?\u201dWhen Jamil Essa took over a used car dealership on the eastern border of Sunset Park 11 years ago, he simply slapped the name of his dealership, Luxury 1 Auto Sales, onto the existing sign, which he said was erected decades earlier.No one ever mentioned it was a problem. Then all of a sudden, he said, he got a visit from the Department of Buildings and a citation for an unlicensed sign that will result in a $6,000 fine.\u201cYou didn\u2019t say nothing in 40 years and now you\u2019re coming to punish people,\u201d he lamented.\u201cWe are not targeting businesses around the city for sign-enforcement efforts; rather, our inspectors typically investigate sign complaints in a neighborhood when they are in the area for other matters,\u201d Mr. Rudansky said in a statement.The agency maintains that it cannot ignore 311 complaints for potentially illegal or unsafe activity because of what someone might think a 311 caller\u2019s motive is, nor should it try. It\u2019s important to keep the information anonymous so that tenants and others can report issues without fear of reprisal, officials say.But City Council members say the city should enact a moratorium on violations regarding signs and awnings and waive fees and penalties as it conducts outreach and education among merchants about the requirements.Brooklyn accounted for more than half of the approximately 1,900 total complaints about signs to 311 so far this year, more than double the usual number. The Sunset Park neighborhood was hardest hit, and Bay Ridge and Bensonhurst \u2014 as well as Cypress Hills and East New York \u2014 also received many complaints.In Queens, the complaints have more than doubled since the previous year, and there was a smaller increase in the Bronx. The number of complaints in Staten Island and Manhattan has been consistent with last year.\u201cThe Department of Buildings has to hit the pause button,\u201d said Mr. Brannan, who represents the area around Bay Ridge. His wife\u2019s small business received a sign complaint after he spoke out about the issue, and he believes a political opponent was behind the call. He was among the officials and merchants who held a rally about the issue at City Hall on Wednesday.Councilman Rafael Espinal, who represents Cypress Hills and surrounding areas, introduced a bill this year calling for a moratorium after businesses in his district received a wave of sign violations. The legislation has new momentum and will most likely go to a vote on Dec. 20, his office said.At SAS Italian Records in Bensonhurt, a local fixture selling music and Italian trinkets, Silvana Conte, 62, said she had heard \u201ca million different things\u201d about the fines from fellow business owners, including rumors that the city was going to start requiring costly annual permits for signs. (The city denies this.)An adult day care center across the street had taken its awning down, and another neighbor had hired an architect.\u201cI wish the city would try and help out the small-business owners,\u201d Ms. Conte said. \u201cIt\u2019s just impossible to survive.\u201dDown the street, Alexandr Choklin, 66, an assistant in a Chinese acupuncture and herb shop, shook his head when he was asked about its missing awning. It had once advertised the business\u2019s services in English, Chinese and Russian.\u201cWe\u2019re a small business,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot afford a $6,000 fine.\u201dAfter hearing about fines from other businesses, Mr. Choklin asked his son to look up the regulations online. When it was unclear whether they might get a grace period to make sure the paperwork was in order, they decided to take the sign down.\u201cWho supports the city? Small businesses,\u201d Mr. Choklin said. \u201cWhen we\u2019re gone, what is the city going to do?\u201dJennifer Collins, 44, a receptionist from Bay Ridge who had stopped in at SAS, asked a more immediate question: \u201cHow are you going to find the stores if they don\u2019t have a sign up?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A.I. as Talent Scout: Unorthodox Hires, and Maybe Lower Pay", "Date": "2018-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne day this fall, Ashutosh Garg, the chief executive of a recruiting service called Eightfold.ai, turned up a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that piqued his interest.It belonged to a prospective data scientist, someone who unearths patterns in data to help businesses make decisions, like how to target ads. But curiously, the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 featured the term \u201cdata science\u201d nowhere.Instead, the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 belonged to an analyst at Barclays who had done graduate work in physics at the University of California, Los Angeles. Though his profile on the social network LinkedIn indicated that he had never worked as a data scientist, Eightfold\u2019s software flagged him as a good fit. He was similar in certain key ways, like his math and computer chops, to four actual data scientists whom Mr. Garg had instructed the software to consider as a model.The idea is not to focus on job titles, but \u201cwhat skills they have,\u201d Mr. Garg said. \u201cYou\u2019re really looking for people who have not done it, but can do it.\u201dThe power of such technology will be immediately apparent to any employer scrambling to fill jobs in a tight labor market \u2014 not least positions for data scientists, whom companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon are competing to attract.Thanks to services like Eightfold, which rely on sophisticated algorithms to match workers and jobs, many employers may soon have access to a universe of prospective workers \u2014 even for hard-to-fill roles \u2014 whom they might not otherwise have come across.And while that could also help some candidates, there\u2019s a potential downside for job seekers: Such algorithms may also lower wages in these fields, said Bo Cowgill, an economist at Columbia University who has studied the use of artificial intelligence in hiring.\u201cYou get the more nontraditional, equally qualified, equally high-performing people,\u201d Mr. Cowgill said. But the employer \u201cdoesn\u2019t seem to have to compete for them as much.\u201dFor years, employers and online intermediaries have used algorithms to help fill job openings, but their methods were often crude. A computer would identify key words on r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, then determine whether those words corresponded to text in job descriptions.While this approach can be more efficient than manually searching a site like LinkedIn, it has drawbacks. Applicants can game the process by larding their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s with terms the machines are likely to be looking for. Conversely, poorly worded job listings could cause computers to overlook qualified candidates.But recent advances in a form of artificial intelligence known as deep learning have made the machines used by some companies, like Eightfold and the online job hub ZipRecruiter, far more powerful. Instead of simply scanning words on a page and matching them to words in a job description, a machine can now identify skills and aptitudes that don\u2019t explicitly appear on a candidate\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9.To illustrate, Mr. Garg points out that about 90 percent of software engineers at the financial software company Intuit in Mountain View, Calif., know the programming language Java, according to data Eightfold has analyzed. That means the machine is on safe ground inferring that an Intuit software engineer knows Java, even if he or she doesn\u2019t list the skill on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9.By performing a similar exercise across an entire r\u00e9sum\u00e9, the company\u2019s software can build a detailed profile of a job applicant. It can extract more than the usual amount of information from categories like education (certain disciplines at less prominent universities, like natural-language processing at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, produce high-achieving workers) and even hobbies (chess players tend to be good at coding, basketball players at sales).Eightfold, which is based in Silicon Valley, also makes a clever trade with clients: to improve its results, Eightfold asks clients to use its human-resources software, which imports employee data in anonymous form. This includes information on how workers with different backgrounds perform in different jobs, and how much they earn.Eightfold can then use this data to better predict performance \u2014 say, how well an Intuit software engineer who plays chess and graduated from the University of Massachusetts might do at Amazon or Microsoft.Intuit did not respond to a request for comment.The software tool can be especially powerful to an employer intent on expanding a search beyond candidates with conventional experience and qualifications. In that case, a recruiter can specify criteria (like industry and location, and even how likely the candidate is to accept an offer) that would turn up less traditional r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.Claudia Villanueva, a recruiting and diversity official at AdRoll Group, which helps clients with digital ads and marketing, said she recently used Eightfold when trying to fill a financial-planning position. The top candidate had experience in industries the tech world often shuns, like manufacturing. But the Eightfold algorithm flagged her as a winner.\u201cThe tech industry sometimes has a hard time moving past tech experience,\u201d Ms. Villanueva said. \u201cWe keep hiring the same people in the industry. To me this is a really interesting example of how we broke that cycle a bit.\u201dIn the case of the Barclays analyst, Eightfold\u2019s software pegged him as a budding data scientist partly because he had a master\u2019s degree in statistics and knew computer programming languages like C++ and Matlab, even though he had no apparent background in data science.\u201cWe have gone ahead and analyzed tens of millions to hundreds of millions of profiles of people to see how people have moved in their career,\u201d Mr. Garg said. \u201cYou can predict what they\u2019re likely to do next very easily.\u201d He conceded that the approach worked less well in new or obscure fields with limited data.Steve Goodman, the chief executive of Restless Bandit, another firm that applies artificial intelligence to recruiting, compared the exercise of finding nontraditional candidates to filling a professional sports roster.Sports franchises tend to pay far more for free agents who leave their previous team than for players they draft out of college or high school, because the free agents have a record. But if computers were able to predict the performance of draft picks with relative precision, this could change their calculus. The price of free agents might drop, and the price of signing a draft pick would rise. This is, in effect, what software can accomplish using artificial intelligence.\u201cWe surface people we think would be good draft picks,\u201d rather than people doing the same jobs, Mr. Goodman said. \u201cThis person is a little more junior, but based on their career track, people who look like them are cheaper and better for you.\u201dMr. Cowgill, the Columbia economist, said this logic was largely correct, but with one key wrinkle: According to his research, the gains to the less obviously qualified candidates unearthed by machines can be so large that they offset smaller losses to conventional candidates.In fields requiring fewer technical skills, on the other hand, wages could fall significantly.Consider, say, senior marketing jobs, for which large companies often require a master\u2019s degree in business administration. If machines can reliably identify less experienced, less credentialed candidates who are likely to excel, it could depress wages.\u201cThat could happen in labor markets with the realization that you don\u2019t need anything special here,\u201d Mr. Horton said.Perhaps the greatest concern is a basic methodological point \u2014 call it the N.B.A. problem. If you were studying National Basketball Association players to figure out what makes one great, you would find almost no correlation between performance and height. Almost everyone in this rarefied world is taller than average. And those who aren\u2019t compensate with other gifts, like unusual speed and athleticism.If, on the other hand, you selected people at random from the general population and gauged their basketball potential, you would find that it was highly correlated with height.The concern is that machines are, in effect, only studying N.B.A. players \u2014 the people who already have jobs at a company, or even the people who sought jobs \u2014 not the general population.Mr. Cowgill believes there are solutions. He wrote a paper showing that seemingly unqualified applicants whom a company accidentally interviews allow a machine to simulate a crude randomized experiment, helping the company learn more about what makes a good employee.But perhaps more telling is that sophisticated technology companies are already using artificial intelligence to help fill jobs. Mr. Garg, who worked as a research scientist at Google for four years, says the company uses such techniques in its recruiting.Google says it uses machines to take a second look at r\u00e9sum\u00e9s in its database that human recruiters may have missed for a limited set of roles.The advantage that a vendor like Eightfold has, Mr. Garg asserted, is access to internal data at dozens of other companies, something even Google can\u2019t claim. \u201cWe now can build much deeper models than these companies can build by themselves,\u201d he said.Cade Metz contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s that he\u2019s a malignant one.Opinion ColumnistDear Anonymous,In September, you acknowledged that you were a member of the \u201cquiet resistance\u201d within Donald Trump\u2019s administration. You told us that you and others were \u201cworking diligently\u201d to \u201cfrustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations.\u201d You said that while you agreed with many of the president\u2019s policies, you were appalled by the president\u2019s amorality, his chaotic management, his \u201crepetitive rants,\u201d his fondness for dictators.You also believed that your efforts to resist Trump were often successful. On foreign policy, you noted, the administration\u2019s policies were far more sober and serious than the president\u2019s reckless rhetoric.You were wrong. This week proves it. Assuming you haven\u2019t departed the administration already, now would be the time for you to go. Ditto for all of your fellow \u201cresisters.\u201dThis is the central lesson of James Mattis\u2019s stunning resignation on Thursday. Secretaries of defense come and go \u2014 we\u2019ve had five in the last eight years \u2014 and some of them run afoul of the president they serve.A president who sticks it to his own team while sticking with a foreign strongman is not worth sticking by.Mattis also resigned because he has concluded that the problem with Trump isn\u2019t that he\u2019s an empty vessel. It\u2019s that he\u2019s a malignant one.But our Commodus-in-Chief isn\u2019t just an irascible buffoon whose worst impulses can be confined to Twitter but whose policy instincts largely align with yours. Trump thinks of himself as a man of ideas. Withdrawal from Syria, along with partial withdrawal from Afghanistan, is consonant with the quasi-isolationism he\u2019s preached for decades. He is sympathetic to Erdogan, as he is to other tyrants, because he is indifferent to considerations of human rights and civil liberties.Above all, he\u2019s against \u201cmeddling,\u201d whether it\u2019s meddling in the affairs of others \u2014 or having others meddle in his. The Trump Doctrine is the doctrine of unaccountability.It\u2019s also the doctrine of dishonor. And this is what should most concern you and whatever is left of your in-house resistance. The United States is about to abandon our allies to the tender mercies of thugs. We are breaking our word to those who helped us decimate the Islamic State. We are standing aside so that Erdogan, Bashar al-Assad, Vladimir Putin, and the Taliban can roll in, and ISIS can fight on.For Mattis, who first became a Marine during the Vietnam era, memories of what befell our betrayed allies from that conflict can\u2019t be far from his mind. Nobody should expect the secretary to carry out a policy that would keep him from looking a comrade-in-arms in the eye.So it is with you, Anonymous, wherever you might work in the administration. Until now, you may have convinced yourself that real honor lay in putting up with it \u2014 with the craziness of your boss and the disdain of your neighbors \u2014 because the good of the country (as you see it) demanded it. And until now, you had Mattis to serve as your role model.But Mattis is going. And the argument can no longer be sustained. If Trump is capable of doing this to Mattis, what\u2019s to keep him from soiling your carpet, too? And even if he never gets to it, you must know by now that you are no longer keeping a bad thing from getting worse. All you are doing is disguising how bad it is, thereby helping it to become worse.Advertisement"}

And it\u2019s not just because they like to play.Those who had experienced serious illness and trauma said their stuffed animals helped them cope in the hospital or after the deaths of loved ones. Here is a selection of comments and photos from adult stuffed animal lovers. Their responses have been lightly edited and condensed for clarity. Tell us about your favorite stuffed animal and how long they have or did remain part of your life.I went through a personal crisis earlier this year and talking with my stuffies has been one way I have coped with the trauma. Certainly maintaining a relationship with my stuffed animals is not a substitute for the other steps I have taken to get through a difficult time in my life, including seeing a therapist, staying busy with work, spending time with friends and family, and being part of a faith community. But talking to my stuffies is unique in this sense: Everyone gets along! There is no arguing, no hostility, no judging, and no anger. We sometimes get sad together, but then we offer comfort. No, I am not delusional. I understand fully that in recovering from my life crisis I have needed to rely on a variety of coping skills. The nice thing about talking with my stuffed animals is that it is a time of the day when the focus is on everyone being nice to each other!Two years ago, UPS lost an enormous duffel bag that contained, among other things, a teddy bear my mom received when she was 18. That bear got me through high school, college, and taking the LSAT. I thought I\u2019d have him forever. It\u2019s silly, but I miss that bear so much.Last year I realized that I\u2019d somehow lost my childhood Teddy in a reshuffling of boxes from storage.I found myself feeling almost sickened \u2014 had he inadvertently ended up with the stuff that went to Goodwill? Would they have recognized his intrinsic value (unlikely!) or just chucked him? Of all the things I\u2019ve lost over the years, this loss bothered me the most, and months later I could still hardly bear to think about it. Then in another go-through of the storage unit, there he was after all, in another box.The relief of that buoyed me for months \u2014 and actually, continues to and seems to have put things in permanent perspective. Lost my good birding binoculars? Pfff \u2014 replaceable! Obviously somewhere in me the conviction I held 60 years ago when I fought with my sister as she told me our bears weren\u2019t really real after all still holds in a way; Teddy sits in my closet now, comfortably seated, where I can see him, on the shelf.I paid more than I care to admit to have my stuffed elephant shipped home from a conference in Vegas after forgetting it in the hotel. She goes on all business trips with me.I had a house fire that tragically took our beloved pets, as well as the majority of our belongings. It was absolutely awful, but soon afterward my dear cousin picked through the wreckage and found my cherished stuffed sheep, Baa, (who I had had since babyhood) totally intact. We all cried tears of joy, he was a light in the darkness. My mom washed him a million times with special detergents to rid him of the smoke smell, and he permanently resides next to my bed now.I received a teddy bear when I was between four- and five-months old. Nounou is now 40 years old. It\u2019s been completely flattened by years of me using it as an extra cushion when I sleep, its lost eyes and nose in the laundry. But it\u2019s still my best source of comfort today.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will Trump in 2019 Be Untamed or Contained?", "Date": "2018-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe political scenarios for another strange Trumpian year.Opinion ColumnistBack then the Trump tamers were his fellow Republicans \u2014 the mix of senators and cabinet officials who had steered his actual administration (not the Twitter version) into the channels of a semi-normal G.O.P. presidency. Back then you could make a list of the wilder Trump campaign promises (or threats) and note how few of them had actually been implemented or pursued. Back then you could look at Trump\u2019s economic agenda and his foreign policy and see something influenced more by Paul Ryan and James Mattis than by the president\u2019s distinctive impulses.That was 10 months ago, and since then the Trump-administration world that I described has been deconstructed, piece by piece. The normalizing figures have departed or been unceremoniously dumped \u2014 whisk, H.R. McMaster and Gary Cohn; goodbye, Jeff Sessions; time\u2019s up, John Kelly \u2014 and their provisional replacements have more of the island-of-misfit-toys feel that characterized Trump\u2019s inner circle in the 2016 campaign.Meanwhile all year there has been more and more overt Trumpishness in the administration\u2019s policy moves \u2014 the trade warring, the end of the Iran deal, the performative cruelty and performative militarization at the border, the made-for-reality-TV dealmaking with North Korea, the president\u2019s strange fanboy encounter with Vladimir Putin.So here we are, with Trump finally unbound, just as everyone who once opposed him had feared. Except that Trump unbound is also Trump hemmed in \u2014 no longer steered by the departing General Mattis or guided by the unlamented Speaker Ryan, but opposed directly by a Democratic House armed with subpoena power and prepared for political war. And Trump unbound is also Trump alone, his electoral mystique gone with the midterms and Senate Republicans more inclined to distance themselves the further off the policy reservation he goes and not even Chris Christie willing to take the job of managing his White House.So the president is at once more dangerous and less so, more unconstrained and yet easier to balk, more liberated and more isolated \u2014 a strange state of affairs even by the strange standards of this administration. And to save myself the embarrassment of future mea culpas, I won\u2019t make predictions but just offer scenarios for how this combination might shape the next exciting year of Trump.The first possibility, and to my mind the least likely, is a return to (relative) normalcy. In this scenario Trump reacts to indicators he understands, the jittery stock market above all, by containing his impulses a little more, finding (somewhere) a new set of establishment hands to guide him, making the necessary deals with House Democrats, and hunkering down to survive what the Mueller investigation has to throw at him. D.C. politics becomes, by this presidency\u2019s standards, strangely boring; there is a grind of subpoenas and scandals but Republicans stick with Trump; there is zero policy progress and a basic Democratic advantage but no dramatic change.I find this scenario less likely than does Drew, but more likely than the return to normalcy. However it coexists with a third possibility that might be termed the Trump Vindicated scenario (or, for true Trump haters, the LOL Nothing Matters scenario), in which Trump unbound turns out to be no more unpopular than the tamed-by-the-establishment version, his preferred policies prove less destabilizing than all the wise men fear, and we get a 2019 in which Trump flails around but his approval ratings actually go \u2026 up?This possibility is, I think, a somewhat underrated one, because some (not all!) of Trump\u2019s Trumpiest ideas are either more sensible or more popular than the establishment alternative. Paul Ryan\u2019s agenda dragged down Trump\u2019s approval ratings, not the other way around, and the Kim Jong-un summit was as popular as anything he\u2019s done. Even in the chaotic controversies of the last few weeks there is at least a case for pulling out of Syria, perhaps a stronger one for pulling out of Afghanistan, certainly a case that the Fed\u2019s interest rate policies are hurting both stocks and workers \u2026 and little evidence that swing voters will be furious with Trump for ending poorly understood military missions or picking fights with central bankers.And of course the man and the crisis might meet. So the final possibility worth considering as 2019 dawns is the same one that informed my opposition to Trump two years ago, which is that we should fear most from an unbound Trump isn\u2019t bad policy or sleaze or norm violations. It\u2019s that with Mattis gone and McMaster gone and Cohn gone and Kelly going and only Mulvaney and Jared and Steve \u201cAll is well!\u201d Mnuchin at battle stations, the equivalent of 9/11 or the financial crisis will come along and things will get very, very dark before there\u2019s even time to read the full text of the 25th Amendment.On that note, Happy New Year, America. And stay frosty out there, Mike Pence.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When the Bubble Bursts, Consider the Anti-Bubble", "Date": "2018-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere are nations and industries in sound economic shape that are ignored by investors because they are not all about tech. Maybe that is about to change. Mr. Sharma, the author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is a contributing opinion writer.One answer, in any transition period like this one, is to look to anti-bubbles. Bubbles are driven by hype about the hot new thing and defined by mania, including unusually heavy trading and prices rising at an unusually rapid pace and reaching a level that can\u2019t be justified by underlying growth in the economy or company. Anti-bubbles are the mirror image, taking shape in overlooked corners of the world and defined by light trading, with prices stagnating at low levels despite solid growth in the economy or company.To be clear, anti-bubbles do not include legacy companies like department stores and newspapers whose very existence has been thrown into doubt by competition from tech giants. Anti-bubbles encompass countries and companies that would seem to have bright futures but that struggle to attract the attention of investors.Historically, the biggest stock market returns came in the fastest-growing economies. But that pattern changed in recent years, as investors chased technology at the expense of everything else. The highest returns came in slow-growth countries such as Taiwan. The lowest came in fast-growing economies like the Philippines. The reason: Taiwan is a tech-driven economy, the Philippines is not.But as big tech begins to crack, that behavior is beginning to change. Stock markets from the Philippines to Indonesia have started to emerge from anti-bubbles. And in the United States, sound industries that had been left in the dust by the tech giants are starting to make a comeback among investors, too, including telecommunications, real estate and consumer staples. It is not clear where they go from here, but it is not unusual for stocks caught in an anti-bubble one decade to perform well the next.In the 1980s, Japan was widely predicted to be the next dominant economic superpower. Though it accounted for only 15 percent of global economic output, Japan was sucking in nearly half of all the money invested in stock markets worldwide. The United States, where the economy was almost twice as large and growing robustly, was struggling in vain to escape the shadow cast by Japan. It was trapped in that era\u2019s anti-bubble. By the end of the decade, however, the Japan bubble had popped and the United States was poised to take center stage. The next big bubble rose in the United States during the tech craze of the late 1990s, which generated another series of anti-bubbles, particularly in companies and countries that relied for growth on commodities like oil and iron ore. By the end of the decade, big oil companies and commodity-driven economies from Brazil to Russia, rocked by sinking prices, had fallen off the radar of global investors, and their stock prices were dragging bottom. Though the boom in this period was lifting a particularly broad segment of companies and countries, anti-bubbles were as usual forming in overlooked corners of the world. Tech firms, in particular, had been shunned since the dot-com bust, and their stocks were lagging behind the rest of the market. A decade later, dot-com survivors like Apple and Amazon were at the forefront of a new tech boom. If the mood of a bubble is manic, as overexcited investors drive daily trading volumes skyward, the mood of an anti-bubble is the opposite, marked by little trading at all. In a telling sign of the current anti-bubbles, the markets of the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia together trade less than $1 billion a day, compared with about $6 billion a day for Apple alone.There are many more anti-bubbles. Poland is a high-growth economy with low debt and a small deficit that is also light on technology companies. Yet among emerging markets, Poland continues to stumble along at lows last seen in the early 1990s, when it was struggling to recover from the fall of Communism. Mexico is another economy facing no obvious threat of financial crisis. Yet money has fled its stock market, helping to drive the peso close to lows last seen during the \u201ctequila crisis\u201d of 1994.The bright side of anti-bubbles is that they are very cheap places to go on vacation. In Mexico City, travelers can get a fancy hotel room for the equivalent of $80, a fancy meal for $15.Anti-bubbles share one thing with bubbles: They don\u2019t last. Eventually, people recognize that prices are out of whack, and adjust accordingly. They go back to looking for inexpensive growth stories, and find them among the forgotten countries and companies.Bubbles are compelling drama, in which the lead characters are always racing excitedly toward a sudden fall. Much less has been written about anti-bubbles, which are in their way equally compelling tales of underdogs moving quietly toward surprising comebacks. The big book on anti-bubbles doesn\u2019t yet exist, but this would be a good moment for it to be written.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mapping the Brain\u2019s Genetic Landscape", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor the past two decades, scientists have been exploring the genetics of schizophrenia, autism and other brain disorders, looking for a path toward causation. If the biological roots of such ailments could be identified, treatments might follow, or at least tests that could reveal a person\u2019s risk level. Now, using more advanced tools, brain scientists have begun to fill out the picture. In a series of 11 papers, published in Science and related journals, a consortium of researchers has produced the most richly detailed model of the brain\u2019s genetic landscape to date, one that incorporates not only genes but also gene regulators, cellular data and developmental information across the human life span.The work is a testament to how far brain biology has come, and how much further it has to go, toward producing anything of practical value to doctors or patients, experts said.\u201cThe effort that has gone into the collection and analysis of these data is truly impressive,\u201d said Kevin Mitchell, an associate professor of genetics and neurology at Trinity College, Dublin, who was not involved in the project. The data, he added, \u201crepresent a hugely valuable resource.\u201d Whether that resource will help scientists determine any biological cause, Dr. Mitchell cautioned, remains an open question. The new model was based in part on analyses of nearly 2,000 human brains, from people with and without diagnoses, collected over decades. In one of the papers, a research team led by Mark Gerstein, a professor of bioinformatics at Yale University School of Medicine, began by combining all those genes, as a group, and calculating the combined added risk they impart into a single coefficient. That calculation on its own barely beats a random guess in assessing added risk.In another report, investigators delivered a clearer picture of brain development over the human lifetime. The brain is continually adapting, or \u201crewiring,\u201d itself through life, particularly in utero and through adolescence, generating an ever-transforming genetic, cellular and genetic landscape that had defied the tools of modern science.\u201cHaving this insight will help us establish some potential causes and what they mean for neuropsychiatric disorders, and create new, testable hypotheses,\u201d Dr. Sestan said.The result from all this work is a computer model for brain genomics that scientists can search \u2014 a database akin to Google Earth that charts specific genetic addresses in the brain and reveals which genetic and biological processes are active there, and at what point during maturation.Dr. Matthew State, chair of the department of psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco, and a co-author on two of the papers, said: \u201cEssentially what these papers do is lay out cellular and molecular landscape at a resolution that\u2019s never existed before. I see it as foundational work, and an investment that will pay off in giving us a far richer context to develop new hypotheses and study these disorders.\u201dFor the time being, those hypotheses are unformed. And, for all the coordination and dazzling science on display, there is a long way to go before any practical payoff arrives, some experts said.An earlier version of this article misstated the number of people whose cells were analyzed in a study. It was dozens of people of all ages, not exactly 1,866 people. Additionally it misstated the source of single cells examined for patters of gene expression. The people the cells came from did not have a particular disorder.Advertisement"}

The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average, both of which also include the biggest tech companies, are not far behind after falling 17.5 percent and 16.3 percent from their respective highs. After a month of heavy losses, stocks are on track for their worst year since 2008.Bear markets in stocks are rare but have the power to spread gloom through the economy. In the last 20 years, there have been only two \u2014 one that began with the financial crisis in 2007, and the other that started with the dot-com bust in 2000. Market downturns can gather steam even without strong evidence that economic and corporate fundamentals are weakening.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a feedback loop,\u201d said Robert Shiller, a professor of economics at Yale University. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening right now, we\u2019ve seen some declines, and that emboldens some pundit to say, \u2018This is it.\u2019 They get attention, it puts thoughts in people\u2019s minds and they start thinking, \u2018Maybe I should exit.\u2019\u201dThe Nasdaq is not the only group of stocks in such distress. The Russell 2000 index, which tracks shares of smaller companies, entered a bear market earlier this week. Seven of the S&P 500\u2019s 11 industrial sectors are also at the level, led by energy stocks, which are down 28 percent from their highs earlier this year. That\u2019s in large part because oil has been in a bear market since November.If the broader stock market declines by more than 20 percent this year, it would end what was, by some measures, the longest bull run in history. From March 2009 until its peak in September, the S&P 500 surged 333 percent, a rally that provided a silver lining to the lackluster years that followed the financial crisis of 2008. Investors enjoyed trillions of dollars of gains from the stock market.Those profits are not close to being wiped out. The stock market is still well above where it was even at the start of 2017. But the longer bear markets last, the more pessimism they spread.The mood in the markets can change. The most recent bear markets have not lasted as long as some others in the past. During the two previous bear markets, the Federal Reserve acted quickly to stimulate the economy by slashing interest rates. Investors came to believe that corporate profits would recover and dived back into stocks.The current stock plunge is taking place at a time when the central bank is signaling that it will keep raising interest rates because the economy remains strong, with unemployment near 50-year lows. But on Friday, an influential Fed policymaker said the central bank would keep a close eye on financial markets as it set interest rates.\u201cWe\u2019re going to go into the new year with eyes wide open, willing to read the data, listen to what people are saying, and to reassess the economic outlook,\u201d John Williams, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in an interview with CNBC.The sudden downturn in technology stocks has many of the attributes of the sell-offs that periodically smash hot sectors in the stock market. But it also signifies how investors have taken a dimmer view of corporate America and the broader economy.They are far below those levels now. Apple is now worth around $715 billion. Amazon has lost nearly a third of its value since hitting its high, and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, is down 23 percent.Trade tensions and a possible slowdown in the global economy are prompting investors to wonder whether technology companies will grow as fast as expected. Expectations that iPhone sales in China could slow eroded Apple\u2019s value, while Facebook\u2019s slip-ups over data privacy and misinformation have drawn scrutiny from angry governments and made investors nervous.\u201cYou can\u2019t grow at huge percentages forever,\u201d Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said of the tech sell-off. \u201cPlus, I think that whether it\u2019s regulation, whether it\u2019s fear of the global slowdown, those kinds of things have played into it.\u201dAnd there is also the simple fact that they had risen so far so fast. When fear descends on the market, investors often sell the shares that have gone up the most, and at its August high, the Nasdaq was up more than 50 percent from the date on which President Trump was elected.\u201cToo many people had piled on the same side of the boat,\u201d said Lori Calvasina, head of United States equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets in New York. \u201cTypically when that happens, the boat tips over.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Are Taxi Drivers in New York Killing Themselves?", "Date": "2018-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThree taxi owners and five other professional drivers have died by suicide over the last year. It has prompted a flurry of legislation to improve working conditions for drivers.Each case is different and it is difficult to know why someone decides to take their life. Most of the drivers were immigrants in their 50s and 60s, some of whom had told friends and family that they were having a difficult time making a living as Uber began to dominate the ride-hailing industry.Here\u2019s what we know about Mr. Kim and the broader crisis:But Mr. Kim had complained to friends this year that he could not find fares. He began working more often, eventually driving seven days a week. Still, his friends were surprised by his death.A group of drivers recently held a vigil at Flushing Meadows Corona Park in Queens to remember him. Mr. Kang said he misses seeing Mr. Kim at the airport taxi lot.\u201cHe was a generous person and always bought coffee for us,\u201d he said. Two other drivers who took their lives also owned taxi medallions: Nicanor Ochisor, who was from Romania, and Kenny Chow, who was from Burma. Both told friends they were worried about paying off their debt. Corey Johnson, the Council speaker, said the city was also looking at options to help medallion owners saddled with massive debt, from a partial bailout to a hardship fund. The New York Taxi Workers Alliance, a group that represents drivers, is urging the city to work with banks and philanthropic groups to write off 20 percent of taxi owners\u2019 outstanding debt. At the vigil for Mr. Kim, the group\u2019s leader Bhairavi Desai had a message for taxi drivers who are struggling: The city is finally addressing the problem and things will get better soon.\u201cWe know change is coming,\u201d she said.\u201cPlease know that your 3 decades (or more!) of service are appreciated and that my life has been made better by your having worked the streets,\u201d the letter says.Advertisement"}

After a season of feasting with friends and family, it\u2019s a welcome meal for one that tastes like an indulgence but leaves you feeling great.It also fits just about any New Year\u2019s resolution to eat well, a nod to its origins. Around 1900, Dr. Maximilian Bircher-Benner popularized Swiss-German m\u00fcesli by serving it at his sanitarium in the Alps. He mixed water-soaked oats, grated apple and nuts with condensed milk and yogurt. This modern version forgoes the one-note sweetness and pasty thickness of the original. Instead, it layers flavors and textures like crackling nuts, chewy fruit, seeds and oats suspended in milk with the loose swish of melted ice cream.This recipe tastes better than m\u00fcesli \u2014 and most other overnight oats \u2014 because of salt, which draws out the grain\u2019s inherent sweetness. But its play of creamy and crunchy is what will help it win the year. A two-to-one ratio of milk to oats softens the oats without causing them to clump. Tiny seeds also prevent the oats from gluing together, and dried fruit lends a satisfying chew while infusing the milk with natural sugar. Finally, the nuts give this a crisp finish, especially when added just before eating. (You can even sprinkle a tiny pinch of nuts over each spoonful to maximize the crunch.) If you like your oats hot, heat them up. For more sweetness, add fresh fruit, more dried fruit, or brown sugar, honey or maple syrup. The greatest joy in this jar may just be making it your own.Advertisement"}

The normal human mind can cope with only so much drama before it gets overloaded. Mr. Trump grasps better than most that a single scandal is cause for public outrage, while a million scandals is a statistic.There\u2019s no doubt that Mr. Trump was upset about conservatives trashing him for flirting with a wall-free spending bill.

The less popular he becomes with the bulk of the nation, the more vital it is for him \u2014 emotionally and politically \u2014 to keep his base happy.But it\u2019s also true that revving up the wall fight allows Mr. Trump to divert attention from so much of the other drama threatening to swallow him up.And, of course, hovering above it all, the president\u2019s legal troubles keep mounting as the Russia investigation churns on.Faced with all that, who wouldn\u2019t rather throw himself into a fight \u2014 maybe even shut down parts of the government \u2014 over a border wall?

He brought to life, in astoundingly granular detail, the anguish of a would-be suicide bomber in Iraq.Except, it turns out, much of it was invented.\u201cSpiegelgate,\u201d as it has been dubbed on social media, is one of Germany\u2019s biggest postwar journalism scandals, potentially spanning seven years and many dozens of articles. Coming at a moment when public trust in journalism is already low, it could hardly have arrived at a worse time.Untruths and half-truths circulate liberally on social media platforms, and populists on both sides of the Atlantic have been aggressively trying to discredit and intimidate the mainstream media.\u201cTrump and populists everywhere will be popping the corks,\" she added.It did not take long before far-right activists took to social media and reveled in the news.Tino Chrupalla, another AfD lawmaker, wrote on Facebook: \u201cThe accusation of the \u2018lying press\u2019 is clearly fair in this case.\u201dThe loss of credibility is dangerous at a time when democracy depends more than ever on the ability of journalists to hold power to account, Ms. Pohl said.\u201cImagine what will happen if tomorrow a Spiegel reporter says he overheard members of the AfD crack anti-Semitic jokes: Who will believe them?\u201d she said.Ullrich Fichtner, who is taking over as one of three editors-in-chief at the Spiegel in January, said the magazine would take a hard look at what went wrong.But he also vowed not to allow the scandal to stop his journalists from conducting aggressive investigations of the powerful.\u201cYes, journalism is on the defensive, with an economic crisis and with all the attacks on us every day,\u201d Mr. Fichtner said. \u201cBut we must not be meek.\u201dMr. Fichtner said Der Spiegel would appoint a committee to look at its fact-checking and research department, long a proud institution of the magazine. Where improvements can be made, Der Spiegel will make them, he said.Der Spiegel described its own scandal as a \u201clow point\u201d in the history of the magazine, which was founded just after World War II.Mr. Relotius, 33, had \u201ccommitted his deception intentionally, methodically,\u201d inserting into his articles made-up dialogue, people he had never met and \u201ccomposite characters of people who actually did exist but whose stories Relotius had fabricated,\u201d Der Spiegel said in its apology to readers.He had been writing for the magazine since 2011, and has admitted to making up parts of at least 14 articles in Der Spiegel, the magazine said. But the full extent of his fraud remains unclear. Mr. Relotius wrote almost 60 articles for Der Spiegel, and as a freelancer he also wrote for a variety of other respected German-language newspapers and magazines.On Thursday, it emerged that he had also faked part of at least two interviews he conducted for the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, a large daily newspaper based in Munich.His inventions were at times gratuitous and other times breathtaking. In one article he made up an entire telephone interview with the parents of Colin Kaepernick, a former American football player.In another, he invented \u201cGayle Gaddis,\u201d a religious woman from Missouri whose mission in life was to attend executions across the country. The five-page article was fabricated from beginning to end, Der Spiegel said.The scandal has prompted a debate about narrative journalism, a genre that has become more popular in recent years and, some argue, has increased the scope for journalistic fraud.\u201cPurists say narrative journalism has blurred the line between providing objective facts and subjective interpretation,\u201d said Carsten Reinemann, a journalism professor at the University of Munich, though he also cautioned against discarding the genre altogether.Mr. Fichtner of Der Spiegel spoke of a \u201ccrisis of narrative journalism.\u201d\u201cWe have to ask ourselves whether we got carried away in storytelling forms that seduce authors to make the stories better than they already are,\u201d he said.He spoke of his own experience as a judge for journalism awards. \u201cThere is a tendency in recent years to make these narrative stories perfect,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are looking for seamless plausibility and a density of detail that can be baffling.\u201dNarrative journalism \"has to become more humble,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause sometimes it might just be too good to be true.\u201dThe article that eventually was Mr. Relotius\u2019s downfall was a beautifully crafted, intimate profile of a border militia in Arizona he had never met. A colleague of his, who co-wrote the story from the other side of the Mexican border, became suspicious.\u201cRelotius\u2019s story ended with a gunshot by the militia men,\u201d Juan Moreno, the colleague, said in an interview with S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung. But the shot only appeared in the second draft. \u201cWhen I\u2019m witnessing when someone is shooting at Mexicans I\u2019m not keeping that for my second draft, it\u2019s more likely to be my lede.\u201dThere were other elements of the article that did not fit, but when Mr. Moreno alerted Der Spiegel of his suspicions, he was stonewalled initially.Mr. Relotius was not just a valued reporter. He also put a lot of effort into covering his tracks. He set up fake email accounts from sources to show his editors that he had met them. He asked colleagues to refrain from translating certain pieces into English or posting them online.\u201cWith hindsight, there was a pattern, but at the time the pattern was not discernible,\u201d Mr. Fichtner said. \u201cWe have a system that was most probably flawed.\u201d But, he added, \u201cwe also had a particular perpetrator who was brilliantly exploiting the loop holes in the system.\u201dChristopher F.

{"Headline": "Amid Russia Tensions, Ukraine Moves Toward Separate Church", "Date": "2018-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Ukraine took a major step on Saturday toward establishing its own, autonomous Orthodox Church, setting the stage for increased tensions with Russia by altering a centuries-old religious tradition under which the Kiev church answered to Moscow.Some 190 bishops, priests and other church figures spent the day closeted in St. Sophia\u2019s Cathedral in downtown Kiev to elect the newly unified Ukrainian church\u2019s head, Metropolitan Epiphanius. He is scheduled to travel in January to Istanbul, the historical seat of the Eastern Orthodox Church, to receive an official order granting autonomy.Hundreds of supporters of the move cheered and some wept as President Petro O. Poroshenko, who had attended the session, emerged from the cathedral to announce that Ukraine had a new church leader.Quoting from the national poet, Taras Shevchenko, Mr. Poroshenko said that \u201cUkraine will no longer drink Moscow poison from the Moscow cup,\u201d and he called on supporters to remember the day\u2019s events as \u201cthe final acquisition of independence from Russia.\u201dMany of the faithful have long been hesitant about breaking the church\u2019s historical ties with Moscow. But Russia\u2019s fostering of a violent separatist movement in eastern Ukraine since 2014 and its seizure of Crimea the same year invigorated the move for a church independent of the Russian Orthodox Church.Opponents of the Russian church in Ukraine said some priests had refused to perform last rites for soldiers killed in the fighting in eastern Ukraine, and some had even criticized the dead, accusing them of participating in a fratricidal war.The step toward independence is sure to antagonize both Russian President Vladimir V. Putin and Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, who have pursued a \u201cRussian World\u201d alliance of states bound to Moscow by tradition, culture and religion.\u201cWhat kind of church is this?\u201d Mr. Poroshenko said in his speech, noting that he would travel with the new leader of the Ukrainian church to collect the autonomy order, known as the Tomos of Autocephaly. \u201cThis is a church without Putin. What kind of church is this? It is a church without Kirill. What kind of church is this? It is a church without prayers for the Russian government and Russian military.\u201dRussia has criticized the move toward autonomy for months, calling it a campaign ploy by Mr. Poroshenko, who faces a difficult re-election in March. That impression was fed by Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s speech, which was devoted to the break with Russia.\u201cNot a word about Christ, just \u2018Farewell, unwashed Russia\u2019 and so forth,\u201d wrote Sergei Chapnin, a Russian religious scholar and frequent critic of the Moscow church hierarchy, on Facebook.Ukraine has imposed martial law on 10 provinces that face areas with Russian military presence, and both sides have accused the other of mustering forces for an attack.One new source of tension will be the division of valuable church property in Ukraine, including a historic monastery in the center of Kiev.The church in Ukraine has been notoriously fractious, with three separate Orthodox branches emerging after the country\u2019s 1991 political independence from Russia. Only one is loyal to Moscow.Few of the 89 bishops loyal to Moscow attended Saturday\u2019s session because the Russian church had threatened to ostracize those who participated, leaving unclear the true extent of clerical support for an autonomous church.The issue has also created a split between Moscow and the Orthodox mother church, the Constantinople Patriarchate. The Russian church moved in October to sever ties with the mother church, accusing it of violating canonical law by not seeking its permission before allowing the Ukrainians to pursue independence.Both the Russian and Ukrainian churches would forfeit a lot.The Russian Orthodox Church, which puts its membership at 150 million, will lose up to 30 to 40 percent of its most ardent followers; around 16 percent of Ukrainians attend church regularly, compared with half that in Russia. Perhaps more important, a smaller church could undermine Moscow\u2019s longstanding effort to portray itself as the protector of all 300 million Orthodox Christians worldwide.Russia has characterized the change as the biggest schism since the Eastern and Western churches divided in 1054. The two sides have argued over the degree of supervision the mother church originally granted to the Moscow Patriarchate in 1686.But the ecumenical patriarch, Bartholomew, considered first among equals in the church hierarchy, also has much at stake. The Russian Orthodox Church has the wealth and political backing needed to assert itself globally.There was no immediate reaction from the Russian government or the church. Critics of the Kremlin said it had brought the problem on itself by allowing the bloodshed in eastern Ukraine to drag on.\u201cThat which was created over hundreds of years was destroyed by Putin and his idiots in four years,\u201d Aleksei A. Navalny, Russia\u2019s most prominent opposition figure, wrote on Twitter. \u201cPutin is the enemy of the Russian World.\u201dOne condition for receiving autonomy was the election of the new leader of a unified Ukrainian church.\u201cToday is a truly historic event,\u201d Metropolitan Epiphanius told the crowd, saying the church would welcome all believers. \u201cWe were able to overcome various temptations, disagreements and unite in one church.\u201dAt 39, Epiphanius is relatively young, and his close relations with Filaret \u2014 the metropolitan, or church leader, who has long led the fight to separate from Russia \u2014 have prompted some analysts to suggest that Filaret would retain power in Kiev. Others called Epiphanius a compromise choice likely to forestall bickering among the church elders.The decision Saturday is just one step in a process that may be drawn out over years, if not decades, to create a single, national Orthodox church in Ukraine.Vladimir V. Fesenko, a political scientist who heads the Penta center in Kiev, said that considering the nose-dive that Ukrainian-Russian relations took with the outbreak of fighting in 2014, it is hard to imagine them getting much worse.\u201cAn independent church was created today, but it is only the start of a long process of unification,\u201d he said.Follow Neil MacFarquhar on Instagram: @nytmacfarquharIuliia Mendel contributed reporting from Kiev, Ukraine, and Sophia Kishkovsky and Ivan Nechepurenko from Moscow.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Discount Older Voters. They Could Decide the White House. ", "Date": "2018-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThose age 50-plus voters split their votes evenly between Democrats and Republicans. The party that maximizes its share of those high-turnout voters wins an emerging swing constituency, and especially in key battleground states.Older Americans\u2019 collective voting clout has usually been fragmented by more salient variables of race, religion, ideology-party, class, gender or family status. But that is changing: Age and race have begun to coalesce in a manner that should alarm Democrats.Since well before Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy, significant majorities of 50-plus whites have favored Republican presidential candidates. They have been a major reason for that party\u2019s control of a substantial majority of statehouses and governors\u2019 mansions, and because they constitute a significant percentage of the voters in states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, they pose a roadblock on a Democratic presidential candidate\u2019s route to the Electoral College. In 2018, 59 percent of whites 45 to 64 years old voted Republican, as did 56 percent of whites over 65. (In the past two presidential contests, about 60 percent of white baby boomers and a slightly higher percentage of voters over 65 voted for Mitt Romney and Mr. Trump.)To do this, Democrats must remind voters of the party\u2019s heritage and re-emphasize the wildly popular landmark New Deal and Great Society programs: Medicare and Social Security.A strong stance on entitlements by the party will mobilize older Americans to defend Medicare and Social Security when \u2014 and not if \u2014 the next recession or fiscal debt crisis forces congressional discussions of entitlement \u201creforms\u201d (i.e., reductions).Yet Medicare and Social Security are so universally popular that nearly all major electoral subgroups \u2014 even majorities of Tea Party members \u2014 oppose entitlement-tampering or reductions. Medicare and Social Security will wax ever larger in aging Americans\u2019 lives. Far fewer workers in the private sector are retiring with lifetime \u201cdefined benefit\u201d pensions; many more will rely on a fragile, unstable, highly unequal \u201cdefined contribution\u201d system of individual retirement accounts linked to stock market gyrations.And Democrats need to groom new congressional senior citizen champions to make these pitches. Who is the next Ted Kennedy? Given the age of Democrats like Joe Biden, they have several strong potential candidates.The Brookings Institution demographer William Frey has described an already simmering \u201cracial generation gap.\u201d Data supports that description: A 2017 Pew Research Center poll found that young or liberal respondents (or both) substantially favor Medicare for All, while older respondents, especially conservatives, oppose the idea. Many polls also find that younger Americans have more positive attitudes toward immigrants and immigration than older whites. Those issues are related: Older Americans probably suspect (as was the case with the Affordable Care Act) that Medicare for All might produce \u201csocialized medicine\u201d that could shift Medicare resources from seniors to younger populations. In addition, these fears and resentments would be compounded if the resources were stretched to include millions of unauthorized immigrants who would become eligible for universal health care through citizenship.Mr. Trump has already articulated such fears and previewed a likely Republican strategy to attack Medicare for All as a \u201csocialist\u201d scheme that will bankrupt Medicare: At a September rally in Montana, he said that Democrats want to turn the country into (socialist) Venezuela, destroying Social Security, and that \u201cthey say \u2018Medicare for All\u2019 until they run out of money, which will be the third day, and it will be Medicare for nobody.\u201dDemocrats might look to health care proposals like those permitting early Medicare buy-in for citizens over 50 or 55 while working to expand and improve the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid.Mr. Trump, the rare Republican candidate to promise \u201chands off\u201d Medicare and Social Security, understands senior power potential and obviously knows how to exploit social divisions. Democrats have the opportunity not only to foil such efforts but also to make considerable inroads into the his voter base by addressing the well-founded economic anxieties and fears of all aging Americans.The party must not merely protect but celebrate the nation\u2019s two most successful \u2014 and Democratic \u2014 social programs, while also sensitively advocating immigration and health care reforms.An earlier version of this article mischaracterized the system of individual retirement accounts for many retiring private sector workers. They are \"defined contribution,\" not \"defined benefit.\"Advertisement"}

The images invite interpretation rather than simple consumption: the hard lines and almost, but not quite, closed doors of a dark hallway, with light pushing through, hint at accessibility and lack thereof: a door ajar, an invitation to entrance at the same time that it might well close, shutting us out.Juan, who was born in El Salvador, writes entirely in Spanish and his passages are untranslated. Jake, who was born in the United States, writes entirely in English. His passages are also untranslated. The couple invites us to consider how we read and misread each other. They agree that \u201cwe are, and love is, fundamentally untranslatable. And there are ways in which we remain, always, unknown to each other.\u201dYet for all its quiet intimacy, their love has unsettling moments. Jake recalls a moment of violent reaction as he and Juan once walked hand in hand in New York City. The couple were followed, harassed and verbally assaulted. This is a brutal reminder that love is never solely private, never only ours \u2014 that we have to constantly endure what others think of us. As Jake reflects, this is one element of the \u201clegacy of trauma that informs queer relationships.\u201dJuan and Jake do not avoid love\u2019s hardships in their photo book. As surely as it is joy and plenty, love is loss and mourning. Love is a thousand goodbyes, literal leave-takings (Jake and Juan navigated a long-distance romance for much of their relationship). Love is also the hundred-minute ways we \u2014 often unwittingly \u2014 leave, abandon and hurt each other. Given the space between us, love is always and already long-distance, even when you share a bed. Loss is not just of the other: Juan notes that we lose \u2014 and gain \u2014 ourselves in relation. Love necessarily entails a loss of self, the ways we lose ourselves in another and misidentify ourselves in the other\u2019s gaze.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s a good exercise, gets the mind working nicely and helps in the matter of kitchen confidence as well. Try a free-form pasta puttanesca: olive oil, garlic, anchovies, canned crushed tomatoes, pitted black olives, capers and red-pepper flakes, to serve over linguine or spaghetti or bucatini or whatever dried pasta you happen to have in the house. I like it with shells sometimes, for how the olives get lost in them.It\u2019s simple work: Saut\u00e9 the anchovies and a lot of garlic in a lot of olive oil while your salted pasta water comes to a boil in a big pot. (How many anchovies? How many you got? I go minimum four, and same with cloves of garlic.) When the fish are melted and the garlic\u2019s gone gold, add the tomatoes and stir everything together. Let that simmer a while, get a little thicker, then add the olives and capers and red-pepper flakes until it\u2019s as fiery as you like. Taste for salt and pepper.

It\u2019s the kind of quick-cooking dish that is infinitely adaptable, a blank canvas for all my dinner dreams. The thing is, once this sauce is done and poured over the salmon, the rest takes care of itself. Throw it into a 325-degree oven for 10 to 15 minutes, then it\u2019s ready to be dressed up or down, eaten alone or in the company of others, consumed that evening or the next day as part of a definitely not-sad desk lunch.While eating a fillet of salmon all on its own with a glass of wine might seem kind of chic, you\u2019ll likely want to serve it with something else, like a fluffy bowl of rice or grains, quickly saut\u00e9ed greens or a bowl of roasted vegetables.It feels surprisingly elegant and thoughtful, the kind of meal that was cooked by a person who loves spending hours in the kitchen, but maybe, today, just didn\u2019t feel like it.Salmon is the rare fish that pairs as well with red wine as with white. With this dish and its acidic butter sauce, however, white is the way to go. Chardonnay would be my choice. It goes wonderfully with salmon, particularly a good white Burgundy. Try a St.-Aubin or a Meursault, or a Pouilly-Fuiss\u00e9. You could drink an Oregon chardonnay as well, or one of the more restrained bottle from California or Australia. Other options? How about a gr\u00fcner veltliner or a rich Austrian riesling. If you don\u2019t mind a little sweetness, a German sp\u00e4tlese riesling might go really well, particularly with the heat of the harissa. If you do prefer a red, pinot noir is generally delicious with salmon. You could also try a good cru Beaujolais.

Be the Highest Bidder", "Date": "2018-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere is a wasp named after William Shakespeare, a horse fly named after Beyonc\u00e9 and a lichen named after Dolly Parton.In trying to make sense of the 1.3 million species that humans have identified, scientists have a long tradition of bestowing new discoveries with a scientific name. Think Tyrannosaurus rex or Felis silvestris catus.The privilege of naming a new species typically lies with the person who discovered it. Only in the past few decades have researchers started to delegate that task to someone else: the highest bidder.On Saturday, Rainforest Trust, a conservation nonprofit based in the United States, will complete its auction of the rights to name 12 newly discovered plant and animal species from South America. The winners can name them after their mother, their pet dog, a car company \u2014 pretty much anything. The group says the money will be used to buy land where that species lives in an effort to save it from extinction.But some scientists chafe at the idea of selling the rights to name a species, and see it as the latest example of Westerners co-opting developing countries\u2019 biodiversity. Others worry it will turn species exploration into a cutthroat commercial endeavor.\u201cIf we leap into something and don\u2019t anticipate what can go wrong, then we\u2019re leaving ourselves vulnerable,\u201d said Douglas Yanega, an entomologist and taxonomist based in California. \u201cThere are so many possible ways that it can go badly.\u201dUp for auction are four frogs of varying shades, four species of orchid and a reddish ant with a trap-jaw. There\u2019s also a gray forest mouse with impressively long whiskers, a wormlike amphibian and a burnt-orange salamander with tiny legs.Paul Salaman, the chief executive of Rainforest Trust, is familiar with the objections to species-naming auctions. In the early 1990s, these auctions were a new concept when Dr. Salaman, a field biologist, sold the rights to name a species of songbird he discovered in Colombia. There were some conservationists who were outraged at the idea of giving companies the chance to impose their brand on the natural world, he said.Dr. Salaman\u2019s counterargument is that the threats to these species posed by climate change and industrial blights, like logging, are far more pressing than the threat of artificial names.\u201cThe name itself doesn\u2019t really matter,\u201d Dr. Salaman said. \u201cThe key is the funding to save the species.\u201dWhen someone discovers a new species of plant or animal, the protocol is to publish a peer-reviewed paper in a scientific journal that establishes the evidence behind the discovery and unveils the name to the world.Dr. Lim, a taxonomist in Singapore, said it bothered her that bidding on these auctions seemed to be driven by the attractiveness of the species, perpetuating disproportionate funding shortages for research on species that are less pleasing to the human eye.Dr. Salaman said that in the current auction, the species considered to be more attractive, like the Ecuadorean frog, were estimated to close at higher prices.\u201cThe highest-selling names are the adorable creatures or the lovely flowers,\u201d Dr. Lim said. \u201cBut the groups that are most under threat aren\u2019t particularly lovely. Like the worms.\u201dShe is also skeptical about Westerners spending tens of thousands of dollars for the opportunity to name a species that is part of another country\u2019s ecosystem and culture. She said her uneasiness stemmed, in part, from the long history of white European expeditioners claiming the biodiversity of other continents as their own.Dr. Salaman countered that many of the species on the auction block were discovered, in part, by scientists native to that home country who want to fend off extinction.Juan Guayasamin, an evolutionary biologist specializing in amphibians, said that as long as the money raised by the auction was going to a noble cause \u2014 like funding conservation \u2014 then he would not be bothered by foreigners naming species native to Ecuador, his home country.\u201cWhat we gain is far more important,\u201d said Dr. Guayasamin, who is with the Universidad San Francisco de Quito. \u201cFinding funds is really a problem we struggle with a lot.\u201dMost taxonomists agree that funding for their work has been increasingly elusive, and that the scope of their mission \u2014 cataloging the world\u2019s species \u2014 is unbelievably vast.But Dr. Yanega, who is also a commissioner with the nomenclature commission, fears that if species-naming auctions go mainstream, they have the potential to do more harm than good to scientists\u2019 collective project of describing the world\u2019s species. For one, Dr. Yanega said, turning species naming into a profitable endeavor could encourage fraudulent taxonomists to churn out what they claimed were discoveries to make themselves money unless scientists can develop safeguards.And in a community that relies on collaboration, making species naming a lucrative practice could make scientists secretive about their work and covetous of their own specimens, which are usually shared liberally with other researchers, Dr. Yanega said.\u201cIt could become cutthroat,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery man for himself.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Women\u2019s March Roiled by Accusations of Anti-Semitism", "Date": "2018-12-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWithin days of Donald J. Trump\u2019s election, a diverse group of women united by their concern about the incoming administration gathered at a restaurant in New York to plan a protest march in Washington. They had seen the idea floating on Facebook and wanted to turn it into a reality.The unity did not last long. Vanessa Wruble, a Brooklyn-based activist, said she told the group that her Jewish heritage inspired her to try to help repair the world. But she said the conversation took a turn when Tamika Mallory, a black gun control activist, and Carmen Perez, a Latina criminal justice reform activist, replied that Jews needed to confront their own role in racism.The women who gathered that night would go on to organize one of the biggest protests in American history, remarkable not just for its size, but for its inclusive nature. The event on Jan. 21, 2017, inspired thousands of women who had never been involved in politics before to pour their energy into helping Democrats win elections this fall.Ms. Mallory, meanwhile, who is now co-president of the Women\u2019s March group, has been criticized for attending an event by Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam who has been widely reviled for making anti-Semitic remarks. Ms. Mallory has called Mr. Farrakhan \u201cthe GOAT,\u201d or \u201cgreatest of all time,\u201d on social media.Rachel O\u2019Leary Carmona, chief operating officer of the Women\u2019s March group, cast the controversy as the growing pains of a new organization that is struggling to build a diverse coalition. She said steps were being taken to ensure that Jewish women felt welcome, including giving Women\u2019s March leaders education about anti-Semitism and adding Jewish women to the organization\u2019s \u201cunity principles,\u201d which highlight groups that are considered especially vulnerable.Ms. Mallory and Ms. Perez say they categorically condemn anti-Semitism, and that when they asked Ms. Wruble to leave the group, it had nothing to do with her being Jewish. But they acknowledged that the role of Jewish women was discussed in that first meeting.\u201cSince that conversation, we\u2019ve all learned a lot about how while white Jews, as white people, uphold white supremacy, ALL Jews are targeted by it,\u201d Ms. Mallory said in a statement to The New York Times.The allegations of anti-Semitism are particularly painful because Women\u2019s March organizers made a commitment from the beginning to work across racial and religious lines, and to be led by what they considered the most \u201cmarginalized\u201d women.Now Women\u2019s March activists are grappling with how they treat Jews \u2014 and whether they should be counted as privileged white Americans or \u201cmarginalized\u201d minorities, especially in the aftermath of the October mass shooting in Pittsburgh, when 11 people were gunned down at their synagogue.Ms. Wruble, a central organizer of the march, says she agrees that white women, including Jews, should grapple with their racial privilege. She put out a call for women of color to join the planning team and was connected with Ms. Mallory and Ms. Perez. At that first meeting, Ms. Wruble said, they seemed to want to educate her about a dark side of Jewish history, and told her that Jewish people played a large role in the slave trade and the prison industry.\u201cI was taken aback,\u201d said Ms. Wruble in her first extensive interview about her experience organizing the Women\u2019s March. \u201cI thought, \u2018Maybe there are things I don\u2019t know about my own people.\u2019\u201dShe said she went home that night and searched Google to read about the Jewish role in the slave trade. Up popped a review of \u201cThe Secret Relationship Between Blacks and the Jews,\u201d a 1991 book by Mr. Farrakhan, which asserts that Jews were especially culpable. Henry Louis Gates Jr., a Harvard professor, has called the book the \u201cbible of the new anti-Semitism.\u201dMs. Wruble said she did not dwell on the issue because she wanted to work together on the march, which was only two months away. Ms. Mallory and Ms. Perez brought a friend on board, Linda Sarsour, a Palestinian-American activist. The three women \u2014 and another woman named Bob Bland, a white fashion designer who created one of the first Facebook pages about the march \u2014 became the event\u2019s official leaders. They were widely featured in the press as the public face of the movement.Behind the scenes, Ms. Wruble said she felt cast aside.At one point, Ms. Wruble said she asked about security for the march and was told by the leaders that the Nation of Islam would be providing it.\u201cI said, \u2018You are going to open up the march to intense criticism,\u2019\u201d Ms. Wruble said, warning that it would be a red flag for Jews. She said they dismissed her concerns in a heated email exchange and accused her of unfairly maligning the Nation of Islam.As the march grew closer, Ms. Perez gathered a diverse group of activists who created a set of \u201cunity principles\u201d that would tie all marchers together and highlight those viewed as the most vulnerable at the time.\u201cWe must create a society in which all women \u2014 including Black women, Indigenous women, poor women, immigrant women, disabled women, Muslim women, lesbian, queer and trans women \u2014 are free,\u201d it read.Ms. Wruble noticed that Jewish women were not included, but said she was too busy with logistics for the march to focus on it.In an interview, Ms. Mallory and Ms. Perez said that they work in communities where Mr. Farrakhan is respected for his role in rehabilitating incarcerated men. They attended the 20th anniversary of the Million Man March in 2015, which Mr. Farrakhan planned.But they said they did not subscribe to his views about Jewish people and never mentioned the slave trade in that first meeting with Ms. Wruble.\u201cIt never happened,\u201d Ms. Perez said.They also denied telling Ms. Wruble that she could not be an official leader of the march because she is Jewish.In fact, they said, they urged her to be more assertive if she wanted public recognition. \u201cA closed mouth does not get fed,\u201d Ms. Mallory told Ms. Wruble in an email viewed by The Times.Ms. Mallory said the Nation of Islam was not hired for security. An internal document obtained by The Times said that the Women\u2019s March group does not ask the religious affiliation of contractors, but said that because private security firms employ a large number of Nation of Islam members, \u201cit is likely\u201d that some members of the sect have provided security for Women\u2019s March events.Even though the march was a success, Ms. Wruble said that she felt angry and that the event\u2019s official leaders were more focused on celebrity than building the movement. She also felt they were unwilling to confront their own bias against Jews. At a meeting days after the march, an argument broke out between Ms. Wruble and the other leaders.Ms. Mallory and Ms. Perez began berating Ms. Wruble, according to Evvie Harmon, a white woman who helped organize the march, and who attended the meeting at Ms. Mallory\u2019s apartment complex.Ms. Mallory denied that she disparaged Ms. Wruble\u2019s Jewish heritage in that meeting, but acknowledged telling white women there that she did not trust them.\u201cThey are not trustworthy,\u201d she said, adding that Ms. Wruble gossiped behind the backs of the other march leaders instead of confronting them when she had an issue. \u201cEvery single one of us has heard things that offended us. We still do the work.\u201dShortly after that meeting, Ms. Mallory, Ms. Perez and Ms. Sarsour decided they did not want to work with Ms. Wruble anymore.On her way out, Ms. Wruble texted a senior adviser to the organization with a warning: \u201cThe one thing I would suggest you discuss with them is the anti-Semitic piece of this,\u201d she wrote. \u201cTheir rhetoric around this stuff will hurt the movement.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Duckweeds can reproduce by copying themselves, so if one duckweed lands where a duck relieves itself, it\u2019s capable of eventually creating a dense mat of duckweeds where there were none before. Understanding how this little plant travels may help scientists develop strategies for containing forms of duckweed that have become invasive species in some environments.To study how ducks and geese might be spreading seeds or pieces of plants between bodies of water, graduate student Giliandro Silva at the Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos in southern Brazil had been collecting and freezing their feces to examine later on. However, when he took a look inside, he was shocked to see the globes of whole duckweed plants, intact after having been swallowed and passing through the birds\u2019 digestive systems.Another sampling run to get fresh, unfrozen duck feces allowed Mr. Silva and his colleagues to test whether the plants were alive. They placed duckweeds salvaged from three separate birds\u2019 feces in Petri dishes and waited to see whether they would grow.The duckweeds soon began to replicate themselves. Seven duckweed globules were soon discovered in one dish where only one had been before, leading the scientists to conclude that they were unharmed by the corrosive acids of the birds\u2019 stomachs and perfectly able to grow. That means that researchers and conservation groups interested in how this duckweed spreads in its native environment and in places where it\u2019s an invader will have to take into account this unexpected mode of travel.The traditional wisdom is that only seeds can be spread in bird feces because their tough outer casings can protect them from the dangers of digestion. But in recent years, Andy Green, a professor at the Estacion Biologica de Donana in Spain and one of the paper\u2019s authors, and his collaborators have found that the spores of ferns and even fragments of moss taken from bird feces are still viable, suggesting the phenomenon may be more general than previously thought. Not every stool will contain duckweed, and not every duckweed that\u2019s swallowed will survive. But some will.\u201cWhat does it take to go through a bird and come out alive?\u201d asked Dr. Green. \u201cRight now we don\u2019t know.\u201dHe speculates that small round objects may have a leg up, as they have less of a chance of getting stuck in a bird\u2019s gizzard, and also that rapid digestion is key. If the duckweeds spent days in the bird, for instance, they might not still be viable when they emerge.Dr. Green is curious whether larger duckweeds and other plants can be carried this way. \u201cThe next question for me will be to try to show that that\u2019s happening here in the U.K. or in Spain as well with these other plants,\u201d he said.\u201cIt\u2019s just another piece of the jigsaw\u201d of how plants move around.Advertisement"}

Individual-1 is clearly a wannabe dictator who has contempt for the rule of law, not to mention being corrupt and probably in the pocket of foreign powers. But he\u2019s also lazy, undisciplined, self-absorbed and inept. And since the threat to democracy is much broader and deeper than one man, we\u2019re actually fortunate that the forces menacing America have such a ludicrous person as their public face.Yet those forces may prevail all the same.What we\u2019ve seen instead are coups of a subtler form: takeovers or intimidation of the news media, rigged elections that disenfranchise opposing voters, new rules of the game that give the ruling party overwhelming control even if it loses the popular vote, corrupted courts.Does a lot of this sound familiar? It should. You see, Republicans have been adopting similar tactics \u2014 not at the federal level (yet), but in states they control. As Levitsky and Ziblatt say, the states, which Justice Louis Brandeis famously pronounced the laboratories of democracy, \u201care in danger of becoming laboratories of authoritarianism as those in power rewrite electoral rules, redraw constituencies and even rescind voting rights to ensure that they do not lose.\u201dThus, voter purges and deliberate restriction of minority access to the polls have become standard practice in much of America. Would Brian Kemp, the governor-elect of Georgia \u2014 who oversaw his own election as secretary of state \u2014 have won without these tactics? Almost certainly not.And the G.O.P. has engaged in extreme gerrymandering. Some people have been reassured by the fact that the Democratic landslide in the popular vote for the House did, in fact, translate into a comparable majority in seats held. But you get a lot less reassured if you look at what happened at the state level, where votes often weren\u2019t reflected in terms of control of state legislatures.Let\u2019s talk, in particular, about what\u2019s happening in Wisconsin.In other words, Wisconsin is turning into Hungary on the Great Lakes, a state that may hold elections, but where elections don\u2019t matter, because the ruling party retains control no matter what voters do.But this may be no more than a respite. For whatever may happen to Donald Trump, his party has turned its back on democracy. And that should terrify you.The fact is that the G.O.P., as currently constituted, is willing to do whatever it takes to seize and hold power.

But their expansion into urban areas has presented a dilemma: How can humans and coyotes coexist peacefully?Montreal\u2019s new plan \u2014 the first of its kind in the province of Quebec \u2014 involves teaching citizens and city employees different techniques to frighten away coyotes.That includes blowing a whistle, clapping your hands, waving your arms, shouting and \u2014 for those in cars \u2014 honking horns, Ms. Thuillier said. Throwing objects is also permitted \u2014 but not to hit coyotes, only to scare them away.Coyotes that bite people will most likely be euthanized, she added.In April, the city set up a coyote hotline to gather better data. Residents may also report sightings using an online form.Montreal officials have deployed teams of specialists over two one-week periods to make noise and scare coyotes away from the parks, and they are asking residents to avoid leaving out garbage that could attract them.Coyotes are typically reclusive, but those that have adapted to urban settings have often lost their fear of humans.Over the summer, Ms. Thuillier said, one coyote could be seen lounging at a popular park.\u201cIt\u2019s not normal to see a coyote just lying in the sun when 100 people are passing by,\u201d she said.Coyotes have lived in Montreal since 1973, city officials said, a result of their continuing movement eastward throughout North America as they have spread from grasslands and prairies into forested habitats and large urban centers.The study examined the genotypes of nearly 400 coyotes and identified a few genetic variations associated with \u201chabituation to novel environments and spatial learning.\u201d The study did not include behavior data, however, and the researchers said it was still unclear how any mutations might affect the coyote\u2019s ability to disperse over a wide area.Finding ways to make coyotes fear humans again is \u201ctricky,\u201d said Roland Kays, an ecologist at North Carolina State University and the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. \u201cBecause out in the wild in rural areas if a coyote gets bold and hangs around people, it\u2019s going to get shot,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd in urban areas that just doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\u201cPeople have to change what they do to make sure coyotes don\u2019t see us as a food source or just a play to get what they need: food, water or shelter,\u201d Scott Gilmore, deputy executive director of Denver Parks and Recreation, said in an interview on Wednesday.The city\u2019s strategies appear to be working, Mr. Gilmore said.\u201cRecently we have not had a lot of incidents at all,\u201d he said.Stewart Breck, a researcher for the United States Department of Agriculture National Wildlife Research Center who has studied coyote hazing in Denver, said that the hazing was effective in the short term and was recommended to protect people and their pets.It is a tough thing to study.\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to get an objective measure of behavior on these animals,\u201d Dr. Breck said.Not only are wild coyotes difficult to observe, \u201cthey\u2019re amazingly tuned in to people watching them,\u201d he added. \u201cSo when you watch them, you change their behavior.\u201dMost coyotes do not attack humans or pets, and they can help control rodent and Canada geese populations, said Lynsey White, the director for humane wildlife conflict resolution at The Humane Society of the United States.It is the actions of people, she said, that often lead to problematic coyote behavior.\u201cI have found over and over again that the best approaches for solving conflicts are to change human behavior,\u201d she said.Lara Takenaga contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Tech That Was Fixed in 2018 and the Tech That Still Needs Fixing", "Date": "2018-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech fixFrom Facebook to creepy online ads, the worst tech of the year made the internet feel like an unsafe place to hang out. Yet there were some products that were fixed, our personal tech critic writes.Personal technology was so awful this year that nobody would think you were paranoid if you dug a hole and buried your computer, phone and smart speaker under six feet of earth.Facebook made headlines week after week for failing to protect our privacy and for spreading misinformation. Juul, the e-cigarette company under investigation for marketing products to teenagers, emerged as the Joe Camel of the digital era. And don\u2019t get me started on just how intrusive online advertising has become.On the other hand, there was good technology this year that improved how we live, like parental controls to curb smartphone addiction and a web browser with built-in privacy protections.For the last two years, I\u2019ve reviewed the tech that needed the most fixing and the tech that was fixed for the first time. This year, I\u2019m repeating the tradition in hopes that the list of lows gets shorter and the list of highs gets longer over time. The bottom line: Social media companies demonstrated they could barely be trusted with our data and were still trying to get a handle on all of their issues. Unfortunately, there is no simple solution for problems like hate speech and misinformation. And keeping our information private is not really in the interest of many of these companies, which use our data to target us with digital advertising. Speaking of which: Online ads became so intrusive in 2018 that they increasingly ruined people\u2019s web-browsing experiences and raised more hackles about privacy.The online ads industry became so good at tracking our web browsing activities that it increasingly knew precisely what we were thinking about buying. If you did a web search for a blender, for example, you could be certain that a digital ad for that blender would follow you around. In addition, the autoplay videos embedded on many news sites were ruthless about shouting for our attention while draining our batteries and burning through data plans.These fixes are not ideal because they take a long time to put in place, and blocking ads hurts media businesses. That means there\u2019s work to do on this yet.The Food and Drug Administration this year announced restrictions that allowed stores to sell most flavored e-cigarettes only in areas where minors were not permitted. The agency also said it was investigating whether Juul, which accounts for more than 70 percent of e-cigarette sales, intentionally marketed its products to youths. Juul has since suspended its social media promotions. E-cigarettes notwithstanding, at least parents can worry less about their children\u2019s addiction to smartphones. This year, Apple released Screen Time, a feature for people to set restrictions on the amount of time they spend on their iPhones. The software includes the ability for parents to remotely monitor and limit their children\u2019s iPhone use.Firefox could still be better. Chrome, for instance, is still faster at loading some web pages. But after a harsh year when consumers lost faith in how companies like Facebook managed their data, it feels heartening to know that someone in the tech industry is making a browser for the people.So did we get to a shorter list of personal tech lows and a longer list of highs? Not quite. I guess there\u2019s always next year. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Genetically Modified People Are Walking Among Us", "Date": "2018-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bynews analysisAnd, so far, they\u2019re just fine. America needs a sober debate about the pros and cons of Crispr instead of a paranoid ban on the technology. Mr. Zimmer is a science columnist for The New York Times. But in some ways this news is not new at all. A few genetically modified people already walk among us.In the mid-1990s, fertility doctors in New Jersey got an idea for how to help women have children. They suspected that some women struggled to become pregnant because of defective material in their eggs.To rejuvenate them, the doctors drew off some of the jellylike filling in eggs donated by healthy women and injected it into the eggs of their patients before performing in vitro fertilization.The researchers did not ask the Food and Drug Administration for permission to try out the procedure. Only after their patients started having healthy children did they share the news that it seemed to work. Once the word got around, would-be parents streamed into clinics to try the procedure themselves.But other people reacted with shock rather than excitement. Our cells generate fuel in miniature factories called mitochondria. And each mitochondrion carries its own small set of genes. The New Jersey fertility doctors might have created children with the DNA of three people, not two.The F.D.A. was not pleased. It sent the clinics letters demanding that they apply to test the method as if it was a new experimental drug. Those bureaucratic hurdles were so daunting that the clinics stopped injecting eggs.By then, perhaps a dozen children had been born with a mixture of DNA. Maybe there are more \u2014 no one knows for sure.Like the DNA in our chromosomes, the DNA in our mitochondria can mutate. Mutations can cause symptoms ranging from blindness to early death, and women pass them down to their children. An estimated one in 5,000 people suffer from a mitochondrial disease, and for a vast majority, there are no effective treatments. Scientists wondered if they could erase these diseases by swapping mitochondria.Tests of this so-called mitochondrial replacement therapy, carried out on mice and monkeys, offered encouraging results. But when scientists approached the United States government about trying it out on human eggs, they got shut down.It wasn\u2019t just the possible medical risks that worried people. Many saw it as an affront to human dignity.\u201cIt is a macabre form of eugenic human cloning,\u201d declared a Nebraska congressman, Jeff Fortenberry, at a hearing in 2014.This history echoed loudly this week, when Dr. He, an assistant professor at the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, told the world that he had made gene-edited babies by altering the DNA of human embryos with a new technology called Crispr. He cut out a small portion of DNA from a gene called CCR5. People who are missing this chunk of genetic material appear to be resistant to infections with H.I.V. Dr. He reasoned that genetically modified babies would resist the virus, too.I got in touch with Glenn Cohen, a professor at Harvard Law School who studies reproductive technologies, to ask him to guess what happens next. His forecast sounded like a repeat of the mitochondrial replacement story.\u201cMy sense of what will happen is that across the world there will be strong regulatory action,\u201d Professor Cohen told me. He predicted a blanket ban of the technology. \u201cPeople are scared, and when they are scared they make decisions that are not so subtle.\u201d Fortunately, history offers us a different path. We need only look at what happened to mitochondrial replacement therapy in Britain.When British scientists raised the idea of using the procedure on human eggs, the country conducted a serious, open conversation about the pros and cons. The health department conducted a long investigation. Parliament held a public debate. And in 2015 it passed a law approving the procedure.This February the authority announced that it was for the first time approving the use of mitochondrial replacement therapy on two women at a fertility clinic in Newcastle. On Thursday, a representative at the authority declined to say whether children had yet been born as a result.It\u2019s only natural for the world to focus its attention on the two babies born in China. But these babies in Britain deserve our attention, too. We can choose which ones represent the future.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "My Country Is Sliding Toward Chaos", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the days before Congo\u2019s elections, President Joseph Kabila\u2019s forces have brazenly attacked and killed peaceful opposition supporters. He must resign.Mr. Mukwege, a doctor and activist from Congo, won the 2018 Nobel Prize for Peace.This article has been updated to reflect news developments.BUKAVU, Democratic Republic of Congo \u2014 Congo is sliding toward chaos as outgoing President Joseph Kabila has failed to keep his promise to organize free, transparent and fair elections, which were scheduled to be held on Dec. 23. Even though the country\u2019s Constitution limits presidents to two consecutive terms, Mr. Kabila has stayed in office since the end of his second term in 2016, lamely citing conflict and unpreparedness for elections as his excuses. With great reluctance and after substantial outside pressure, Mr. Kabila agreed not to run again.Yet when the government has permitted opposition rallies, the opposition candidates have been greeted by huge, boisterous crowds in cities across Congo, showing the broad and deep dissatisfaction with Mr. Kabila\u2019s rule and the desire for genuine change.Recently, an extremely suspicious fire broke out at a government depot in Kinshasa and destroyed election materials and, reportedly, around 8,000 electronic voting machines. I fear this fire might be used as a pretext for delaying the elections.Congo remains one of the world\u2019s poorest countries: the infant mortality rate in my country is among the worst in the world \u2014 almost every tenth child born in the country dies before she is five. Indicators of health, nutrition, and education are equally grim.My country has already paid an immense human cost since war began in 1996 with over 4 million people displaced within the country and around 6 million dead. Hundreds of thousands of women have suffered almost unimaginable sexual violence. The perpetrators have often been powerful local leaders and their henchmen, whose positions make them immune from prosecution.For two decades, I have been working as a doctor with a dedicated team of colleagues to heal victims of this ceaseless violence in my country. I realized years ago that these problems could not be solved in the operating room, but that we had to combat the root causes of these atrocities. The way forward is for the Congolese people to freely elect their leaders at every level, from the local mayor to the president. But Mr. Kabila intends the opposite result.Election materials have yet to be distributed in many places, particularly in the rural areas. We fear that no credible voting will occur in much of Congo. As long as the current leadership remains in place, any electoral scenario will only lead to more violence, more instability and a greater risk of a collapse into dictatorship.The United States and other world powers must apply pressure against President Kabila now, to make clear that violent attacks by government forces against innocent civilians is unacceptable.If Mr. Kabila and his corrupt generals ignore this, the United States and other countries should make it clear that swift, international action, including the broadening and deepening of existing sanctions, will be the initial response by the international community.Congo needs another path, one that leads to genuinely free and fair elections and ends the pattern of government violence against citizens. President Kabila now must resign, and his corrupt group of cronies must be replaced. Congo desperately needs a technocratic caretaker government to reorient the government while overseeing the holding of free and fair elections.The Congolese people are ready to build a state in the heart of Africa where the government serves its people, not its rulers. A state that is based on the rule of law, capable of bringing lasting and harmonious development not only for Congo but also for all of Africa. A state where political, economic and social actions are based on a people-centered approach to restore human dignity to all citizens.Denis Mukwege, a gynecologist and human rights activist from Congo, received the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Global Growth Cools, Leaving Scars of \u201908 Unhealed", "Date": "2018-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySo much for all that.Yet in declaring that \u201cthe global expansion has peaked,\u201d the brains at the O.E.C.D. effectively concluded that the current situation is as good as it gets before the next pause or downturn. If this is indeed the high-water mark of global prosperity, that is likely to come as a shock to the tens of millions of people who have yet to recover from the devastation of the Great Recession.Though the slowdown appears mild, it also holds the potential to intensify the widespread sense of grievance roiling many societies, contributing to the embrace of populists with autocratic impulses. In an age of lamentation over economic injustice, and with political movements on the march decrying immigrants as threats, weaker growth is likely to spur more conflict. Slower growth is not going to make anyone feel more secure about the prospect of robots replacing human hands, or jobs shifting to lower-wage lands.\u201cIt\u2019s just going to exacerbate the tensions that have led to the socioeconomic and political problems we have seen in the United States and parts of Europe,\u201d said Thomas A. Bernes, an economist at the Center for International Governance Innovation, a Canadian research institution. \u201cInequality is going to become even more pronounced.\u201dIn Greece, Spain and Italy, the youth unemployment rate is stuck above 30 percent. In Britain, the typical worker has not seen a pay raise in more than a decade, after accounting for inflation. South Africa\u2019s economy is smaller today than it was in 2010, and now the country is ensnared in recession.In the United States, the unemployment rate has plunged to 3.7 percent, its lowest level since 1969. Yet so many people have given up looking for work that less than two-thirds of the working age population was employed as of October, according to the Labor Department. That was a lower share than before the 2008 financial crisis.\u201cWe see a lost generation,\u201d said Swati Dhingra, an economist at the London School of Economics. \u201cThere was already wage stagnation and productivity stagnation. The trade war has exacerbated all of that.\u201dThe biggest risk to global growth appears to be that the trade war is, at least in part, working as designed.But it has thrown sand in the gears of China\u2019s industrial juggernaut. As of September, China\u2019s rail freight usage, bank lending and electrical consumption had increased about 9 percent compared with the previous year, down from a pace of more than 11 percent in January.China\u2019s growth was already slowing as its leaders seek to transition from an economy powered by prodigious exports, in enterprises that have spewed pollution, toward a cleaner future propelled by domestic consumption. But the American tariffs have prompted multinational companies to shift orders from Chinese factories to plants in other lands, from Vietnam to Mexico. Uncertainty over the future has postponed some business.\u201cThere\u2019s now potential for bad news on the trade front to trigger shifts in equity markets and a pullback on investment,\u201d said Steven J. Davis, an international business expert at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.Given that China is the world\u2019s second largest economy, the consequences of its slowing ripple out widely, helping explain a pronounced drop in factory orders in Germany. American farmers have suffered lost sales as China has responded to tariffs by slapping duties on imports from the United States, not least on soybeans. Stock markets and oil prices have plunged in part on fears that China will buy fewer goods.In lifting interest rates, the American central bank has been acting under the accepted wisdom that too much easy money sloshing around for too long tends to produce trouble, from higher prices to financial mischief. Yet the effect of raising rates is to limit American economic growth, hence Mr. Trump\u2019s unhappiness.The European Central Bank has also been withdrawing the cheap money it unleashed to attack the crisis, phasing out purchases of bonds. This has made credit more expensive across the continent, depriving businesses of capital needed to finance expansions. And that has muted once-hopeful talk that Europe had finally transcended the torpor of the last decade.\u201cIt\u2019s a bit like watching a heavily overweight bird try to take off,\u201d said Peter Dixon, a global financial economist at Commerzbank AG in London. \u201cIt staggers to the end of the runway and starts to take off but never really soars.\u201dThe same can be said for the global economy. It is clearly far removed from the terrifying days of the financial crisis. Yet it never really got its groove back enough to generate impressive numbers of jobs, or put meaningful pay increases in the pockets of ordinary people.And now, despite all that, leaner times are unfolding.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "End the Innovation Obsession", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome of our best ideas are in the rearview mirror. Mr. Sax is an author. TORONTO \u2014 A year ago I stepped into the Samcheong Park Library in Seoul, South Korea, and saw the future. The simple building in a forested park had a nice selection of books, a cafe at its center and a small patio. Classical music played while patrons read, reclining on extra-deep window benches that had cushions to sit on and tables that slid over their laps so that they could sip coffee and eat cheesecake while gazing at the leaves changing colors outside. Seoul is one of the most modern cities in the world, a place suffused with the latest inescapable technology. This library was specifically designed as an antidote to that.\u201cWhat\u2019s so innovative about that?\u201d a friend who works for the library here in Toronto asked when I showed her pictures. Innovation to her meant digital technology, from drones and movie-streaming services and 3D printers, which the library was constantly showing off.\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t they both be innovative?\u201d I asked.We are told that innovation is the most important force in our economy, the one thing we must get right or be left behind. But that fear of missing out has led us to foolishly embrace the false trappings of innovation over truly innovative ideas that may be simpler and ultimately more effective. This mind-set equates innovation exclusively with invention and implies that if you just buy the new thing, voil\u00e0! You have innovated! Each year businesses, institutions and individuals run around like broken toy robots, trying to figure out their strategy for the latest buzzword promising salvation.[Discover the most compelling features, reporting and humor writing from The New York Times Opinion section, selected by our editors. Sign up for the Sunday Best newsletter.]True innovation isn\u2019t just some magic carnival of invention, like a Steve Jobs keynote with a pretty toy at the end. It is a continuing process of gradual improvement and assessment that every institution and business experiences in some way. Often that actually means adopting ideas and tools that already exist but make sense in a new context, or even returning to methods that worked in the past. Adapted to the challenges of today, these rearview innovations have proved to be as transformative as novel technologies.Look no farther than the streets of New York, which have been radically redesigned over the past decade to accommodate cyclists and pedestrians with bike lanes and car-free zones. These ideas aren\u2019t new. They were espoused by city planners and activists more than half a century ago, when Robert Moses was crisscrossing the city with expressways, bulldozing neighborhoods in the name of the car\u2019s transformational technology. At the time Jane Jacobs and other advocates of slower, friendlier streets were dismissed as Luddites. It took more than 50 years of evidence, accidents and political courage to realize what a colossal mistake the Moses approach was and to begin to undo that with proven ideas in people-centric urban planning that aim to bring cities back to those who live in them.Perhaps the best examples of rearward innovation are edible. The culinary story of the past several decades is dominated not by the scientific improvements we were promised, but by a return to food and drink\u2019s more delicious past. Traditional cooking, craft beer, heirloom vegetables and grass-fed beef have brought food forward by turning back. We take this as gospel today, but during the 1980s, when pioneering artisan bakers like Nancy Silverton and Jim Lahey were trying to get the world to abandon Wonder bread for traditional sourdough, their ideas were radical and innovative, and ultimately changed the way many of us cook, shop and eat.These innovations aren\u2019t mired in the past. They are solutions firmly focused on the future \u2014 not some technocentric version of it, where we invent our way to utopia, but a human-centric future that reflects where we\u2019ve been, what we\u2019ve learned and how we actually want to live. If that means we build more libraries in parks, then we are moving in the right direction.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Screening for Suicide Risk, Facebook Takes On Tricky Public Health Role", "Date": "2018-12-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA police officer on the late shift in an Ohio town recently received an unusual call from Facebook.Earlier that day, a local woman wrote a Facebook post saying she was walking home and intended to kill herself when she got there, according to a police report on the case. Facebook called to warn the Police Department about the suicide threat.The officer who took the call quickly located the woman, but she denied having suicidal thoughts, the police report said. Even so, the officer believed she might harm herself and told the woman that she must go to a hospital \u2014 either voluntarily or in police custody. He ultimately drove her to a hospital for a mental health work-up, an evaluation prompted by Facebook\u2019s intervention. (The New York Times withheld some details of the case for privacy reasons.)Facebook has computer algorithms that scan the posts, comments and videos of users in the United States and other countries for indications of immediate suicide risk. When a post is flagged, by the technology or a concerned user, it moves to human reviewers at the company, who are empowered to call local law enforcement.But other mental health experts said Facebook\u2019s calls to the police could also cause harm \u2014 such as unintentionally precipitating suicide, compelling nonsuicidal people to undergo psychiatric evaluations, or prompting arrests or shootings.And, they said, it is unclear whether the company\u2019s approach is accurate, effective or safe. Facebook said that, for privacy reasons, it did not track the outcomes of its calls to the police. And it has not disclosed exactly how its reviewers decide whether to call emergency responders. Facebook, critics said, has assumed the authority of a public health agency while protecting its process as if it were a corporate secret.Facebook said it worked with suicide prevention experts to develop a comprehensive program to quickly connect users in distress with friends and send them contact information for help lines. It said experts also helped train dedicated Facebook teams, who have experience in law enforcement and crisis response, to review the most urgent cases. Those reviewers contact emergency services only in a minority of cases, when users appear at imminent risk of serious self-harm, the company said.\u201cWhile our efforts are not perfect, we have decided to err on the side of providing people who need help with resources as soon as possible,\u201d Emily Cain, a Facebook spokeswoman, said in a statement.Facebook said its suicide risk scoring system worked worldwide in English, Spanish, Portuguese and Arabic \u2014 except for in the European Union, where data protection laws restrict the collection of personal details like health information. There is no way of opting out, short of not posting on, or deleting, your Facebook account.A review of four police reports, obtained by The Times under Freedom of Information Act requests, suggests that Facebook\u2019s approach has had mixed results. Except for the Ohio case, police departments redacted the names of the people flagged by Facebook.In one case in May, a Facebook representative helped police officers in Rock Hill, S.C., locate a man who was streaming a suicide attempt on Facebook Live. On a recording of the call to the police station, the Facebook representative described the background in the video \u2014 trees, a street sign \u2014 to a police operator and provided the latitude and longitude of the man\u2019s phone.The Police Department credited Facebook with helping officers track down the man, who tried to flee and was taken to a hospital.\u201cTwo people called the police that night, but they couldn\u2019t tell us where he was,\u201d said Courtney Davis, a Rock Hill police telecommunications operator, who fielded the call from Facebook. \u201cFacebook could.\u201dThe Police Department in Mashpee, Mass., had a different experience. Just before 5:16 a.m. on Aug. 23, 2017, a Mashpee police dispatcher received a call from a neighboring Police Department about a man who was streaming his suicide on Facebook Live. Officers arrived at the man\u2019s home a few minutes later, but by the time they got to him, he no longer had a pulse, according to police records.At 6:09 a.m., the report said, a Facebook representative called to alert the police to the suicide threat.Scott W. Carline, chief of the Mashpee Police Department, declined to comment. But he said of Facebook, \u201cI\u2019d like to see them improve upon the suicide prevention tools they have in place to identify warning signs that could potentially become fatal.\u201dFacebook\u2019s Ms. Cain said that, in some cases, help unfortunately did not arrive in time. \u201cWe really feel for those people and their loved ones when that occurs,\u201d she said.The fourth case, in May 2017, involved a teenager in Macon, Ga., who was streaming a suicide attempt. Facebook called the police after officers had already found the teenager at her home, a spokeswoman for the Bibb County sheriff\u2019s office said. The teen survived the attempt.Some health researchers are also trying to predict suicide risk, but they are using more transparent methodology and collecting evidence on the results.\u201cIn this climate in which trust in Facebook is really eroding, it concerns me that Facebook is just saying, \u2018Trust us here,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Marks, a fellow at Yale Law School and New York University School of Law.Facebook\u2019s Ms. Cain disagreed that the program amounted to health screening. \u201cThese are complex issues,\u201d she said, \u201cwhich is why we have been working closely with experts.\u201dDoris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}

Unlike America, China is standing behind its tech firms, because it knows that the competition is global, and it wants to win.\u201dBut to accept this argument would be a mistake, for it betrays and ignores hard-won lessons about the folly of an industrial policy centered on \u201cnational champions,\u201d especially in the tech sector. What Facebook is really asking for is to be embraced and protected as America\u2019s very own social media monopolist, bravely doing battle overseas. But both history and basic economics suggest we do much better trusting that fierce competition at home yields stronger industries overall.That\u2019s the lesson from the history of Japanese-American tech competition. During the 1970s and into the \u201980s, it was widely believed that Japan was threatening the United States for supremacy in technology markets. The Japanese giant NEC was a serious challenger to IBM in the mainframe market; Sony was running over consumer electronics, joined by powerful firms like Panasonic and Toshiba. These companies enjoyed the support of the Japanese state, through the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which pursued a nationalistic industrial policy thought to be infallible.That\u2019s the risk of a governmental embrace of companies like Facebook, Apple and Google. While they may now seem as extraordinary as IBM did in the 1970s, they might not seem that way a decade from now. And if no one can imagine doing social networking better than Facebook, remember that no one dreamed that the personal computer, once little more than a toy for hobbyists, would displace the mighty mainframe.If we give these companies a pass when it comes to antitrust enforcement, allowing them to dominate their markets and buy up their competitors, America may lose what has been its signature advantage: its willingness to allow the new to replace the old, to accept rebellion and change \u2014 the industrial version of Thomas Jefferson\u2019s cycle of rebellion and the \u201cblood of patriots.\u201dAnd then, as Zuckerberg has prophesied, the future of tech may very well belong to China after all.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Democrats Are Lining Up to Run for President. Can They Avoid Debate Chaos?", "Date": "2018-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith 12 or more candidates likely to enter the 2020 race, the party needs to find a way to manage them.Mr. Greenberg, a professor of history and of journalism and media studies at Rutgers, is the author of \u201cRepublic of Spin: An Inside History of the American Presidency.\u201dThe Democrats have too much of a good thing: More than a dozen creditable candidates are looking to run for president in 2020. A large field isn\u2019t in itself worrisome, since the party needs a strong crop to choose from to oust what will probably be a weakened but still formidable President Trump. The problem is the selection process itself \u2014 and in particular the pre-primary debates from which most voters will form their views of the candidates.Obviously, it\u2019s a recipe for chaos to have 10 candidates, let alone a dozen, on the stage at once \u2014 as the Republican Party learned the hard way in 2016. But you can\u2019t ruthlessly exclude candidates, either, at least not without depriving some talented dark horses of the chance to reach the front of the pack.What Democrats desperately need is a balanced, deliberative process. They must let candidates prove that they have the charisma to take on our reality-show president and the experience to repair the country after taking office. And they have to give voters a genuine opportunity to see the contenders\u2019 key personal qualities as well as the meaningful policy differences among them.So what should the Democrats do?First, they should learn from the Republicans\u2019 mistakes in 2016, when flawed debate rules may have helped Donald Trump trounce a raft of seasoned public officials. Faced with more candidates than a single debate could withstand, the Republicans initially relegated lower-polling candidates to an \u201cundercard\u201d that aired before the main event. No one watched it, and the participants \u2014 who included senators and governors with as much claim to consideration as those in the top tier \u2014 lost any chance to improve their lots.Even so, the main debates were still too frenzied to offer any coherent discussion. Making matters worse, other ill-advised rules rewarded Mr. Trump with disproportionate airtime. Favoring fireworks over forensics, the debates catered to the imperatives of cable television, not the voters.To avoid such a circus, the Democrats should decree that no debate will have more than six participants. In a 90-minute program, even a roster capped at six would allow the candidates just 15 minutes apiece to present themselves to the public.The party should also recognize that early poll numbers mostly reflect nothing more than name recognition and the recency of someone\u2019s appearance in the news. For that reason, establishing tiers is a bad idea, at least until the campaign season is far along, at which point the field will most likely have narrowed, allowing for face-to-face matchups between the heaviest hitters.If, as seems likely, more than six Democrats enter the race, the whole pool should be randomly sorted into two groups. Group A can debate in prime time during Week A, Group B in prime time during Week B. If the aspirants climb to more than 12, a third debate could be held during Week C.For the next month\u2019s cycle, candidates should be re-sorted into entirely new groups, to create new pairings. This egalitarian format would de-emphasize pre-existing notoriety and highlight the qualities of assertiveness, vision, eloquence and policy fluency that contribute to leadership.Of course, this six-people-per-stage formula can only accommodate about 18 candidates. The Democratic National Committee will also need rules about who gets to participate at all.To be as inclusive as possible, it should admit any current or former national officeholders, governors or mayors of big cities. Non-politicians, like the hedge-fund manager and possible candidate Tom Steyer, or politicians of lower rank, like the West Virginia State Senator Richard Ojeda, could still earn a slot by clearing a given threshold in reputable polls.Democrats should further nix two Republican rules from 2016 that rewarded theater and played into Mr. Trump\u2019s hands.The first rule stationed the highest-polling contender at center stage, reinforcing his advantages. Instead, the candidates\u2019 placement should be randomized anew with each contest.The 2016 rules also held that a candidate attacked by name would always get to respond, allowing Mr. Trump to bluster on before some rivals spoke at all. The 2019 rules should prohibit anyone from speaking twice in a given round until each participant speaks once. At a round\u2019s end, anyone called out by name can briefly reply \u2014 once.Other problems in 2016 stemmed from letting the individual cable news networks sponsor and run debates, instead of covering them. The networks thus geared the broadcasts toward ratings rather than public edification. This time, the Democratic National Committee should partner with groups like the League of Women Voters or the Council on Foreign Relations and invite all broadcast news outlets to air them. Questioners should be drawn from not just one network\u2019s stars but also the vast reservoir of newspaper, magazine and radio journalists who report on politics.The imperatives of cable television, which thrives on simplified story lines and high-decibel confrontation, don\u2019t necessarily align with the goals of the candidates, who seek a fair chance to get their message out, or of voters, who want to size up the candidates as people and educate themselves about salient differences in their policies and values. By choosing a patient, more thoughtful process, the Democratic Party has a chance not just to fight for democracy but also, in doing so, to exemplify its finer values.David Greenberg is a professor of history and of journalism and media studies at Rutgers University and the author of \u201cRepublic of Spin: An Inside History of the American Presidency.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Two Leading Intellectuals Analyze What Ails America", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionAmong President Trump\u2019s major accomplishments is the booming industry in books about him, his administration, the state of democracy in America, the rise of autocracy in America and abroad, the reasons for his rise, the bases of his support, the state of the Republican Party, the state of his mental health or lack thereof, the chaos in his White House and so on. Not all are strictly about Trump \u2014 the fact is the conditions and dynamics that brought us Trump long preceded him, and the changes in the fabric of our Republic are paralleled by changes in other longstanding democracies around the globe.Wolfe describes and examines a host of postwar political thinkers, many of whom, like Hannah Arendt and Joseph Schumpeter, had come from the horrors of Europe, but he focuses even more on a core group of American-born intellectuals like Richard Hofstadter, Daniel Bell, Lionel Trilling, Nathan Glazer, Irving Kristol, Seymour Martin Lipset and Reinhold Niebuhr, those he calls \u201cmature liberals.\u201d They set out the values and behaviors that embody what Wolfe views as political maturity, taking on both the world-government left and the populist, demagogic right.Wolfe is at his best when he is discussing these writers, first-class thinkers who responded powerfully to their era\u2019s challenges. He contrasts their response to what he sees as the lamer reaction of the contemporary intellectual community to Trump \u2014 and suggests we no longer have a core of all-star intellectuals but instead a shallower group of \u201cthought leaders.\u201d And he tries to draw lessons from the writing of the old school of mature liberals to apply to the present day, a time, he says, when our political immaturity has led to the politics of petulance.Wolfe notes, of course, that McCarthyism lost, which he attributes in large part to the eloquent and sustained pushback from these public intellectuals (although he stresses that it had taken the horrors of a depression and a huge war to remind liberals of their calling and responsibility). He lays out the conditions that led to our current crisis, but implies that these days we have neither the impetus from horrific conditions nor the intellectual heft to transcend Trump and Trumpism and to move beyond our current \u201cimmature democracy.\u201dCertainly, there are reasons this era is different, but blaming a lack of intellectual heft both overemphasizes the importance of intellectuals and largely dismisses a pretty impressive collection of present-day thinkers, including many of the Never-Trumpers calling for a reassertion of conservative values from the right, and scholars of political thought, race and authoritarianism showing courage and fortitude from the center and left. He also does not give enough emphasis to other conditions: the rise of partisanship extending even to the courts, the importance of tribal media in a new communications age, the obliteration of campaign finance rules that had put some limits on the power of the oligarchic class.Focused as he is on ideas, Wolfe does not end with a series of reforms to reverse our decline. Instead, he offers advice to his readers: Don\u2019t be petulant, appreciate the nobility of politics, trust experts, avoid conspiracy theorizing, don\u2019t believe candidates who promise only good news, pay attention to political debates, be sensitive to norms and not just laws. All good ideas, but Wolfe has no road map or magic wand to get most Americans to buy into them.\u201cAmerica, Compromised\u201d is about the country in the Trump era, but not about Trump. Indeed, Lessig would have written much the same book if Hillary Clinton were president and if Democrats had control of both houses of Congress. His focus is not on bad people doing bad things, but on how incentives across a range of institutions have created corruption, with deleterious consequences for the nation.For Congress, Lessig notes that the framers were deeply concerned about corruption, but rarely focused on the evils of individual quid pro quos. They worried about institutions, the danger of politicians becoming dependent on forces beyond the voters who elected them \u2014 or, as Madison wrote, \u201cthe people alone.\u201d Congress, Lessig believes, is corrupt even though the overwhelming majority of congresspeople are not.The institutional corruption here comes from political money. It corrupts the agenda, the issues that get the focus and attention, and moves Congress away from the needs and concerns of the voters. While our political institutions were not all or mainly linked to voters, at least not directly, the House of Representatives is and was meant to be a channel for the voices of the people. It has become something else entirely. Similarly, Lessig\u2019s chapter on the media, in which he examines technology meeting market forces, reinforces the sense of dysfunction that flows from distorted incentives. One need only look at Facebook for a current example.With regard to finance, Lessig examines in different ways the 2008 collapse, from banks to ratings agencies that gave AAA ratings to entities that were absurdly dangerous. These agencies were created in the 19th century, and have had impeccable reputations because of their perceived independence and objectivity. But, Lessig says, the big three ratings agencies, designated as official by the Securities and Exchange Commission, compete to get the lucrative business of analyzing securities. Good ratings mean more business. Bad ratings, not so much. With financial institutions playing one agency off against the others, the results were predictable. Lessig quotes Roger Lowenstein, the author of a book on Wall Street: \u201cImagine the big rating agencies as three competitive saloons standing side by side, with each free to set its own drinking age. Before long, 9-year-olds would be downing bourbon.\u201d The ratings failures were key contributors to the financial collapse. Individuals in the agencies did not take bribes \u2014 it was the perverse incentives that corrupted the institutions.In his essay on the academy, Lessig first writes scathingly of the psychiatric profession. In the era of miracle medications promising relief or cures, psychiatry has become captive to the pharmaceutical industry, altering the ways diseases have been classified and drugs prescribed.Some of Lessig\u2019s toughest words are for his own profession, the law. Lawyers used to prosecute white-collar crime, without partisanship or other biases. But somehow, in the aftermath of the catastrophic financial crisis in 2008, not a single individual miscreant was brought to the bar of justice. Why? Start with the fact that the gap between the incomes of prosecutors and lawyers in firms has ballooned; a prosecutor now struggles for a good life relative to his or her law school colleagues in the private sector. That has led to a revolving door between prosecutors\u2019 offices and white-collar defense firms. Being \u201chirable\u201d means public officials can\u2019t be too hard on firms they might eventually join. It is not a matter of greed, but of distorted incentives leading to unsettling behavior.What to do? Lessig examines a range of ways to de-corrupt institutions. As with so many efforts, it is hard to find remedies that are realistic and practical. Still, some of Lessig\u2019s ideas are not just pie in the sky. He recommends public financing for campaigns; delinking rating agencies and experts offering testimony from those paying for it; and using in-depth polls to gauge public opinion on key issues as a kind of shadow government.That two impressive public intellectuals like Alan Wolfe and Lawrence Lessig are weighing in on the challenges of our times, joining so many others, is reassuring. \u201cThe Politics of Petulance\u201d and \u201cAmerica, Compromised\u201d join an impressive array of books and essays that may, someday, have a future intellectual historian using them as examples to lament the fact that his or her contemporaries are not as eloquent or important as the group that arose in the Trump era to combat the threats to our way of life.Norman J. Ornstein is a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and a co-author of \u201cOne Nation After Trump: A Guide for the Perplexed, the Disillusioned, the Desperate and the Not-Yet-Deported.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In France, School Lessons Ask: Which Twitter Post Should You Trust?", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVAULX-EN-VELIN, France \u2014 A group of teenagers recently swarmed into a room at Coll\u00e8ge Henri Barbusse near Lyon, France, for a class typically dedicated to learning Spanish. But on that Wednesday, an unusual lesson awaited them.Five posts from Twitter were up on the board. The assignment: Decipher whether they were trustworthy or suspect.\u201cShe picks a topic, she exaggerates things, and then people will say, \u2018She\u2019s right, I should vote for her,\u2019\u201d Ms. Houbiri said.At the front of the class, Sandra Laffont, a journalist teaching the workshop, nodded and said, \u201cPoliticians may sometimes exaggerate reality because their goal is to convince people that their ideas are the right ones.\u201dThe class was part of a novel experiment by a government to work with journalists and educators to combat the spread of online misinformation. France is coordinating one of the world\u2019s largest national media and internet literacy efforts to teach students, starting as early as in middle school, how to spot junk information online.Since 2015, the French government has increased funding for courses about the downsides of the online world. About 30,000 teachers and other educational professionals receive government training on the subject every year. In some places, the local authorities require young adults to complete an internet literacy course to receive welfare benefits, such as a monthly stipend.The French Culture Ministry has doubled its annual budget for the courses to 6 million euros (about $6.8 million), and the Education Ministry is adding an elective high school course on the internet and the media to the national curriculum, making it available to thousands of students. Some educators are calling for the courses to be mandatory, taught alongside history and math.\u201cThe younger you start, the better,\u201d said Serge Barbet, who heads Clemi, the main program within the Education Ministry coordinating the effort. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve been pushing for more media education in recent years. It\u2019s become a vital need and a threat.\u201dOutside France, internet literacy programs are also growing, but have largely been left to groups, such as the News Literacy Project in the United States, that are funded by foundations and companies like Facebook and Google. European Union officials this month called on countries in the bloc to expand education programs as part of a push against misinformation and election interference.France\u2019s centralized strategy is \u201cquite unique\u201d and \u201cabsolutely noteworthy,\u201d said Renee Hobbs, a professor at the University of Rhode Island who specializes in media literacy.The government points to Ms. Laffont\u2019s program as a model and has provided an annual injection of tens of thousands of euros since 2017 to help it grow. Now 155 journalists volunteer, including many from Le Monde, France\u2019s leading newspaper, and the group held about 500 workshops with students this year.Ms. Laffont keeps lessons simple. She incorporates Twitter and YouTube, and shares links to websites that students can use as references to check facts. She also explains the basics of how journalists gather and confirm facts, hoping that may help reverse some students\u2019 mistrust of the media, as well as help them develop a more critical eye for what they see online.\u201cWe realized that we had to go back to the fundamentals before even mentioning fake news and conspiracy theories: what\u2019s news, who makes it, how do you check the sources,\u201d Ms. Laffont said.There is little research to gauge whether these lessons work. Technology trends move fast, and courses can quickly become outdated. Even basic infrastructure can be a problem: Before the class at the Henri Barbusse middle school, teachers struggled to get the internet access working.Guillaume Chaslot, a French engineer who helped develop YouTube\u2019s recommendation algorithm, said the efforts were worthwhile but wondered how effective they would be against Facebook and Google. Their algorithms put a priority on engagement, he said, meaning false and sensationalistic content from questionable sources can spread quickly.\u201cI don\u2019t think you solve the problem with these trainings,\u201d Mr. Chaslot said. \u201cThe power is the platforms. It\u2019s a mismatch.\u201dBut educators said the workshops helped people realize they must take responsibility for their online behavior, particularly in lower-income areas where young people are more vulnerable.At a recent internet literacy workshop outside Paris, students were asked to write their own false news article.

{"Headline": "A Food Reporter\u2019s Newest Tool to Reach Across India: WhatsApp", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTimes InsiderI understood the reach of WhatsApp from personal experience: It\u2019s the only way I stay in touch with my cousins in Delhi. It\u2019s how my parents catch up with their school friends in Mumbai. WhatsApp is linked to your phone number, and from there you can call or text anyone in the world. Even my great-aunt, who lives in Dallas (but grew up in Jaipur) and recently got her first smartphone, can easily navigate WhatsApp.Cellphones are cheap in India, and many come with WhatsApp pre-installed. And thanks to a 2015 government initiative called Digital India, Wi-Fi is everywhere. The sheer number of people in India on WhatsApp has the potential to greatly expand journalists\u2019 ability to report in the country. Reporters can now reach parts of India that have no local airport or cell towers, and talk to people who don\u2019t own computers.Of course, the flip side is that WhatsApp can be and has been deployed in malicious ways to manipulate elections and spread false news. But reporting this story was a reminder that these platforms can unite people in meaningful ways.I started by searching Indian newspapers for any mention of food-related WhatsApp groups, and then I put out a call to my family members, friends and colleagues who lived in India. Among others, I learned about Baliraja, a WhatsApp support forum for farmers in India (suicides by farmers with unpaid debts are a huge issue in the country), and PB Kitchen, a group for the women in an apartment complex in the southern state of Kerala that allowed them to buy and sell one another\u2019s homemade food.But I didn\u2019t know how I would be able to get in touch with these sources. I didn\u2019t have the budget to travel to far-flung corners of India to reach people, some of whom had no internet presence.WhatsApp is not a searchable database \u2014 that is, you can\u2019t type in someone\u2019s name and find a number, or find a group without having been invited to it. But by putting out a call on the app, my mom\u2019s friend Sunitha, who lives in Kerala, a state with a population of 33 million, was able to get contact information for Bharathy Gopalakrishnan, the founder of PB Kitchen.I instinctively contacted potential sources via email first, because that\u2019s my primary mode of communication as a journalist. Not everyone had email addresses, however, and those I did email weren\u2019t particularly responsive. So I reached out on WhatsApp, and people responded immediately, and at all hours of the day and night.Many of the people I was interviewing were homemakers, farmers and young cooks who didn\u2019t own computers or have email on their phone. Noshirwan Mistry, a mango farmer who uses WhatsApp for making sales, said he didn\u2019t get cell service in the town where he grows his fruit. But he and everyone else all had WhatsApp.Out of my small apartment in New York, I was able to talk, with a clear connection, to a mango salesman on the outskirts of Mumbai, a farmer in rural Pune and an enterprising homemaker in Kerala, who all depend on the same app to communicate.In the end, I conducted about 16 interviews, most all on WhatsApp \u2014 far more than I would have been able to do without the app. I also joined food-related WhatsApp groups to research the story. (My phone battery would drain in hours.)When the story came out, my WhatsApp was immediately flooded with excited notes and clapping emojis from my sources. \u201cP.B. ladies, we r international now!\u201d wrote one of the members of PB Kitchen on the group chat. Another member of the group messaged that her friend all the way in Nigeria had read the article.It was wonderful to get all these notes, but I was mainly relieved that because I was done reporting the story, I could finally turn off my WhatsApp notifications. My battery would live to see another day.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "I\u2019m for Affirmative Action. Can You Change My Mind? ", "Date": "2018-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHE STONEI have a rational argument for my position. But I want to hear yours. Mr. Gutting is a emeritus professor of philosophy at Notre Dame. Affirmative action for minorities in college admissions is once again under serious challenge. For many opponents, the heart of the case against is made by Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019s pithy comment \u201cThe way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.\u201d The dictum seems to be trivially true \u2014 a repetition of the same claim in almost the same words, what logicians call a tautology, like a dog is a dog.Of course, the claim is not quite that simple. In context, it\u2019s clear that Chief Justice Roberts means \u201cThe way to stop discrimination against any given race is to stop discriminating against all races.\u201d This is not a tautology, but it does seem plausible: If you think it\u2019s wrong to discriminate against minority applicants, shouldn\u2019t you also think it\u2019s wrong to discriminate against majority (white) applicants? If so, you shouldn\u2019t support affirmative action, since it allows admitting minorities rather than whites precisely because of their race.I don\u2019t want to deny the strength of this argument. It seems implicit in, for example, the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which says it is illegal to \u201cto discriminate against any individual \u2026 because of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u201d And over the past 50 years, the idea that race should not matter in judgments of merit has become widely accepted among Americans. Affirmative action, however, denies this: When the purpose is sufficiently worthy, it\u2019s right to prefer minority over majority applicants (and even to prefer some minorities over other minorities, such as Asian-Americans).Making the case for affirmative action requires admitting that the minority students chosen will not fully meet the standard criteria of admission. How can this be anything other than unjust discrimination? Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor suggests an answer in her response to Chief Justice Roberts\u2019s famous comment: \u201cThe way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to speak openly and candidly on the subject of race, and to apply the Constitution with eyes open to the unfortunate effects of centuries of racial discrimination.\u201dThe last step, then, in the defense of affirmation action in college admissions is an appeal to the moral demand to compensate for the damage done to by minorities by a long history of racial discrimination. Sotomayor elaborates: \u201cRace matters in part because of the long history of racial minorities being denied access to the political process. \u2026 Race also matters because of persistent racial inequality in society \u2014 inequality that cannot be ignored and that has produced stark socioeconomic disparities \u2026. Race matters because of the slights, the snickers, the silent judgments that reinforce that most crippling of thoughts: \u2018I do not belong here.\u2019\u201dWhat exactly is the logic here? We know the horrors of slavery, Jim Crow and lynchings, but how could they connect to the somewhat less than stellar academic records of middle-class black students who might not make the cut at Harvard? The connection would have to lie, as Sotomayor suggests, in the present-day residues, the stubborn structural effects of centuries of mistreatment, gradually diminishing but still an undeserved burden.The burden shows up in both economic and social terms. The wealth (total value of home, savings, investments, etc.) of middle-class white families is about four times that of middle-class black families. This gives white families a decided edge in their ability to survive financial setbacks and resources to provide a better education for their children. Similarly, due to restrictive real estate practices, wealthier blacks still often live in poorer neighborhoods than comparable whites do, reducing educational and cultural opportunities. There are also psychological effects: Black children live in a world where their very appearance presents them as \u201cothers,\u201d often objects of either uneasy suspicion or patronizing sympathy.So it\u2019s hard to deny that blacks as a whole face a distinctive set of disadvantages that are primarily due to the still effective legacy of slavery. But why think affirmative action will be an appropriate remedy? Chief Justice Roberts and others suggest that simply knowing that they are at an elite school in large part because of their race will increase minority students\u2019 alienation and self-doubt. To this, one common response is that athletes and legacy admissions don\u2019t seem bothered by such concerns. But they at least can see their admission as due to their own or their families\u2019 distinctive achievements. On the other hand, why shouldn\u2019t black students be proud to see themselves as very talented people who are a vanguard in one small effort to undo the evils of their history? And shouldn\u2019t they expect that their children and grandchildren will move further and further toward a world where that history will eventually become truly past?I think I\u2019ve made a strong case for affirmative action, although I can see how some readers might reasonably oppose it. To those who do, I would ask that you reflect on the way affirmative action could be a viable step toward closing our painful racial divide. To that end, I invite you to make your case clearly and concisely in the comments. We will collect some of the most persuasive in a follow-up post in The Stone next week. Gary Gutting is an emeritus professor of philosophy at Notre Dame and the author, most recently, of \u201cTalking God: Philosophers on Belief,\u201d a collection of interviews with philosophers on religion.

That\u2019s why I\u2019m asking governments, companies and citizens across the globe to commit to a set of core principles for the web.But we must not give up on the promise of the web. All technologies come with risks. We drive cars despite the possibility of serious accidents. We take prescription drugs despite the danger of abuse and addiction. We build safeguards into new innovations so we can manage the risks while benefiting from the opportunities.The principles specify that governments are responsible for connecting their citizens to an open web that respects their rights. They say that internet companies must play their part in making sure the web is safe, accessible and protects user data. They make it clear that individual citizens have a responsibility to act with compassion and challenge negative behavior they wouldn\u2019t tolerate offline. Most importantly, the principles say that we have to stand up and fight for a web that serves everyone.

It puts the world\u2019s information at our fingertips and connects us with friends and family across the globe. It powers social movements and has created countless new industries, fueling widespread innovation.As a comparatively young invention, this is just the beginning of what the web has to offer.

{"Headline": "The Steady Bedlam of the Trump White House", "Date": "2018-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMaking sense of the never-ending turnover in the administration.Contributing Opinion WriterWhat are we to make of all this turnover in the Trump White House? Clearly, James Mattis\u2019 departure is gravely concerning \u2014 he was the last grown-up, and while not much is known about acting secretary designee Patrick Shanahan, his experience in military technology isn\u2019t likely to calm jitters in world capitals about whether Mr. Mattis\u2019 successor can check the president\u2019s impetuous behavior.Other departures are less obviously chilling. In a normal administration, a president hiring his third chief of staff in under two years would launch a flotilla of news stories speculating about that president\u2019s stability and willingness to submit to a certain degree of order. But we have a president who gleefully flaunts his instability and thirst for disorder every day, so these stories are very old news.Among the 65 Trump A Team members, they find, 42 positions have turned over, for a rate of 65 percent. Seventeen of these vacancies occurred because the person was promoted, 14 because the person \u201cresigned under pressure\u201d and 11 because the person simply resigned.The 14 are, of course, the most interesting for our purposes, with their departures labeled in the report by the slightly ominous acronym \u201cRUP.\u201d Some of the better-known ones: Sean Spicer, the little-mourned (except by reporters who now have to deal with Sarah Huckabee Sanders) first press secretary; Reince Priebus, the first chief of staff; the alt-rightist Steve Bannon; and the tell-all memoirist Omarosa Manigault.The 65 percent turnover rate for the first two years is considerably higher overall than that of Mr. Trump\u2019s five immediate predecessors. In Barack Obama\u2019s first two years, his A Team turnover rate was 24 percent (Mr. No Drama!). George W. Bush\u2019s rate was 33 percent. Bill Clinton\u2019s was 38 percent. George H.W. Bush\u2019s was 25 percent. And Ronald Reagan\u2019s was 57 percent, his year-two turnover rate being actually just a bit higher than Mr. Trump\u2019s.With respect to the second category of appointees tracked in the Brookings study, Cabinet officials, here again Mr. Trump had the most departures. He lost 12 Cabinet secretaries in his first two years, according to the study (released before Mr. Mattis made 13). Mr. Obama lost four, Mr. Clinton six, and Mr. Bush the younger just one. Of the 12, eight were RUPs, and many of them left in quite dramatic fashion: Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency who leased a townhouse from a lobbyist for around one-third the going market rate, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who was on the receiving end of torrents of presidential Twitter abuse until he finally said \u201cenough.\u201dAdd to all that the fact of the Robert Mueller investigation, which veritably ensures that anyone who accepts a White House position today will spend years paying for the pleasure. First, literally, as any Trump White House aide is bound to need to lawyer up and eventually pay tens of thousands of dollars in legal bills. And second, reputationally; that parachute on which officials of administrations from both parties typically float off to lush corporate sinecures is, in this administration, made not of gold but of lead.But there\u2019s an even more sobering angle to the Mueller part of this story, for the potential Trump staffer who can think ahead. Anyone who goes to work in that White House should assume that he or she will witness acts that are, shall we say, irregular at best. If it were me, I\u2019d assume that fate would one day place me in the position of either having to tell prosecutors some very gruesome truths about what I saw or not telling them and risking jail time. Who wants that?In any event, there seems almost no chance that this administration will stabilize. If we extrapolate the Brookings numbers out, Mr. Trump is on track to have a four-year turnover rate of greater than 100 percent \u2014 that is, to have all 65 A Team positions change hands at least once.Yes, that\u2019s troubling, certainly in the case of Secretary Mattis. In other instances, though, let\u2019s face it \u2014 the staff hardly matters. Mr. Trump is more influenced by whoever is on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d on any given morning than who\u2019s in the office down the hall. That\u2019s a kind of steadiness, I suppose. But it\u2019s steady bedlam, and it\u2019s just getting worse.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Four Seasons Returns. But Can It Come Back?", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRestaurant ReviewWhen you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.I know people who will never eat at the Four Seasons because they don\u2019t want to give Mr. Niccolini their money. I understand this. I also know people in the food media who think the Four Seasons should not get any coverage as long as Mr. Niccolini owns a piece of it. I understand this, too, but it\u2019s not my view.Their stance rests, I think, on the idea that writing about powerful men who have been accused of abusing women amounts to condoning the abuse and helping the abusers stay in power. While it\u2019s true that media attention is often like oxygen to restaurants, critics have the power to tell a story other than the one the restaurant is pushing. Even when we\u2019re not writing a pan, a fair assessment often requires weaving shining threads with ugly ones.The ugliest threads at the Four Seasons happen to be ugly enough to make many people stay away. But there is beauty in the fabric, too.Most of this happened some time ago. In its last years in the Seagram Building, the Four Seasons had become a shabby but lovely museum of midcentury architecture and design, with martinis that I didn\u2019t mind overpaying for and food that I did. I was curious about its new incarnation, which opened in August, and curiosity is as good a reason as any for a critic to swing into action.He works on a grander scale now, with more expensive ingredients and more delicate treatments that still betray his creative streak. He roasts duck because the Four Seasons is famous for it, and makes fresh pasta and risotto because the captains in their black jackets need some place to shave all those white truffles. For all intents and purposes, though, he has turned the Four Seasons into a seafood restaurant, and a very good one.Some of the cooking is boring in the right way. I don\u2019t want surprises in Dover sole \u00e0 la meuni\u00e8re, and I didn\u2019t get any. It was flawless. The duck will surprise only people who don\u2019t know that duck meat cooked to well-done bastes in its own fat until it is almost a warm confit. Other dishes were boring in the usual sense. The mustard sauce poured around the golden crab cake tasted like cream that was shown a picture of a mustard jar.This being the Four Seasons, the history would have to mention the new restaurant\u2019s interior. It reminded me of the old Philip Johnson dining rooms without making me sad to be here instead of there, a trick I had thought was impossible. The bronze bead curtains have transformed into strings of gilded glass baubles; the flatware and glasses pay homage to the vintage designs used at the original restaurant; and the bar is once again a four-sided island in the middle of a lounge. For the first time you can eat a real meal there, while you watch the Grand Central-bound commuters outside and the cotton candy-bound regulars inside, generally a mature group in tightly knotted ties or heels that echo down the corridor to the dining room like the ticking of a grandfather clock.All of this and a generous budget (the prices are as exclusionary as ever) could make for a few hours of celebratory sightseeing of a kind that is quickly disappearing from the city. The Four Seasons offers an escape from the outside world. Escaping from what\u2019s inside, however, takes a mental effort that is beyond me and will probably be beyond many others as well, whether Mr. Niccolini is in sight or not. During my three meals, I never saw him.Restaurants, even grand ones like the Four Seasons, are intimate places; eating is an act that requires trust and a sense of safety. We want to get up from the table feeling restored on all fronts except the financial one. Mr. Niccolini\u2019s actions have done serious damage to his power to provide that feeling, even as he and Mr. von Bidder have made the restaurant better than it has been in years.This review will not be tied up with a bow.

{"Headline": "Spread the Digital Wealth", "Date": "2018-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere are plenty of ways to deliver tech jobs to rural communities.Mr. Khanna, a Democrat, represents Silicon Valley in the U.S. House.One key question for the United States in the 21st century is whether noncoastal towns and rural communities, including many communities of color, will be able to participate in the digital revolution. We know that almost all Americans are avid consumers of technology, but many lack the opportunity to do the creative work that fuels our digital economy.Economists keep telling those left out of our digital future to move to the tech hubs. Sometimes I wonder if they have ever been to places like Jefferson, Iowa, or Beckley, W.Va. If they visit, they will realize that many people there are not looking to move. They are proud of their small-town values and enjoy being close to family. They brag that their town doesn\u2019t need many traffic lights. And they worry about a brain drain.These places also are not looking to become the next Silicon Valley. They are self-aware enough to recognize that there are benefits for the world\u2019s top engineers and computer scientists to flock to Palo Alto, Calif., or Austin, Tex. They understand why venture capitalists betting millions of dollars would want to be close to the start-ups they fund to have some control and accountability. But the choice facing small towns should not be binary \u2014 it should not be \u201cadopt the Silicon moniker or miss out on the tech future.\u201dSmall towns can also sustain entrepreneurial activity that is tailored to their needs. Consider the fifth-generation internet service provider in Jefferson, Iowa, that was willing to make a bet on investing in fiber to serve a 4,200-person town. Jefferson is not chasing brand-name venture capitalists on Sand Hill Road but is seeking more modest investments in local businesses that will solve local problems.Finally, the federal government can change incentives. When awarding federal software contracts, agencies should give favorable consideration if at least 10 percent of the work force is rural. We should, moreover, adopt stronger Equal Employment Opportunity reporting requirements for companies on the number of programmers they hire by country and location.When I was in Beckley to visit the new tech campus, I was reminded of the story of John F. Kennedy\u2019s visit to West Virginia during his 1960 campaign, when coal miners enthusiastically supported his vision for going to the moon. Our nation has always had a love affair with innovation. I saw that spark in the Beckley students, many from coal mining families, who were eager to show off their tech projects.One of the most popular teachers was a Pakistani-American woman, with a thick accent, who was teaching software design. When some of the Beckley students asked me what more they should do to bring tech, I joked that they would be wise to open up a few more Pakistani or Indian restaurants. There was awkward silence and then laughter. If we can figure out how to give more Americans a shot in tech, a shot at the ordinary jobs that don\u2019t necessarily afford rock star status or come with generous stock options but that can sustain middle-class life, then we might just take a step toward stitching our nation back together.Advertisement"}

Certainly, some criticism of Israel is anti-Semitic, but it\u2019s entirely possible to oppose Jewish ethno-nationalism without being a bigot. Indeed, it\u2019s increasingly absurd to treat the Israeli state as a stand-in for Jews writ large, given the way the current Israeli government has aligned itself with far-right European movements that have anti-Semitic roots.The interests of the State of Israel and of Jews in the diaspora may at times coincide, but they\u2019ve never been identical. Right-wing anti-Semites have sometimes supported Zionism because they don\u2019t want Jews in their own countries \u2014 a notable example is the Polish government in the 1930s.Decades later, such a statement from the committee \u2014 or any major, mainstream Jewish organization \u2014 would be unthinkable. A consensus set in \u201cthat Jewish identity can be reduced to Israelism,\u201d Eliyahu Stern, an associate professor of modern Jewish history at Yale, told me. \u201cThat\u2019s something that takes place over the second half of the 20th century in America.\u201dUntil fairly recently, it was easy enough for many liberals to dismiss consistency on Israel as a hobgoblin of little minds. A binational state might sound nice in theory, but in practice is probably a recipe for civil war. (Even the Belgians have trouble managing it.) The two-state solution appeared to offer a route to both satisfying Palestinian national aspirations and preserving Israel\u2019s Jewish, democratic character.At times, I\u2019ve agreed with those who see something disproportionate in the left\u2019s fixation on Israel. But the oft-heard argument that other peoples are suffering more than the Palestinians can be a form of weaponized whataboutism, meant to elide the unique role America plays as Israel\u2019s protector.Netanyahu, then, seems to understand that being pro-Israel and pro-Jewish are not the same thing. Liberal American Jews, particularly younger ones, are learning that lesson as well. Some staunch Zionists are bad for the Jews \u2014 witness Steve King, the Republican congressman from Iowa who invokes his support for Israel when he\u2019s called out for his blatant white nationalism. At the same time, people with an uncompromising commitment to pluralistic democracy will necessarily be critics of contemporary Israel. That commitment, however, makes them the natural allies of Jews everywhere else.Advertisement"}

Last Thursday, it performed its third execution in four months.Presumably this is the same thinking behind the position taken by 51 death-row prisoners in Alabama who want to die in an untested nitrogen gas chamber rather than by either the electric chair or lethal injection.Nitrogen gas. That\u2019s where we are in the whole ungodly machinery of capital punishment: Human beings are choosing to die by nitrogen gas.The three men Tennessee most recently executed were all convicted of especially brutal murders \u2014 in Mr. Irick\u2019s case the rape and murder of a little girl left in his care; in Mr. Miller\u2019s the murder of his girlfriend, a young woman with cognitive disabilities. Mr. Zagorksi murdered two men who were meeting him to buy a hundred pounds of marijuana with cash. Death-row inmates are not sympathetic figures.For many anti-abortion Christians, there\u2019s no contradiction between taking a \u201cpro-life\u201d position against allowing a woman to choose whether to continue a pregnancy and taking a \u201ctough on crime\u201d position whose centerpiece is capital punishment. An unborn fetus, they argue, is innocent while a prisoner on death row is by definition guilty.There are numerous pragmatic reasons to abolish the death penalty. It doesn\u2019t deter crime. It doesn\u2019t save the state money. It risks ending an innocent life. (The Death Penalty Information Center lists the names of 164 innocent people who have been exonerated after serving years on death row. The most recent, Clemente Javier Aguirre, was released from a Florida prison just last month.) It is applied in a haphazard and irrational manner that disproportionately targets people of color. It puts prison staff in the untenable position of executing a human being they know personally and often truly care for.But the real problem with the death penalty can\u2019t be summed up by setting pros and cons on different sides of a balance to see which carries more weight. The real problem of the death penalty is its human face.Advertisement"}

Mrs. Hasina, 71, is the first leader in Bangladesh\u2019s history to win three consecutive terms, but she has increasingly been accused of autocratic behavior.The opposition leader Kamal Hossain denounced the \u201cfarcical election\u201d on Sunday night as the results streamed in. The Election Commission said it was looking into reports of irregularities.\u201cNews of vote robberies have come from almost all constituencies,\u201d Mr. Hossain told journalists Sunday night. \u201cWe reject the announced result of this election.\u201dAt least 17 people died in election-related violence across the country, according to the police, though that was less than in previous voting. But if the opposition were to take to the streets, many fear that deadlier clashes would break out given Bangladesh\u2019s history of political violence.In past elections, the Awami League and the largest opposition group, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, carried out brutal campaigns to suppress each others\u2019 voters. The country has vacillated between the two parties\u2019 rule since democracy was restored in 1991 when a series of military dictatorships came to an end.Mrs. Hasina brushed off those accusations ahead of the polls. And the Awami League praised the election when polling stations closed on Sunday.\u201cThis election has proved that a free, fair and neutral election is possible under a partisan government,\u201d said H.T. Imam, an adviser to Mrs. Hasina.Mrs. Hasina has been credited with fostering economic and social development that has lifted Bangladesh from one of the poorest and least developed countries in the world to one that outperforms neighbors like India and Pakistan in some development measures, including gender equality and economic growth.During nearly 10 years of Mr. Hasina\u2019s governance, per capita income has increased by nearly 150 percent, while the share of the population living in extreme poverty has shrunk to about 9 percent from 19 percent, according to the World Bank.But under Mrs. Hasina, the government has also become increasingly heavy-handed about dissent. The police have continued to arrest critics without warrants and have detained citizens who disparage her government in Facebook posts or in media interviews.Allies of Mrs. Hasina, including the opposition leader Mr. Hossain, split with the premier to oppose her in the election, denouncing what they described as her authoritarian tendencies that they warned would harden should she win a third term.The opposition pitted the polls as Bangladesh\u2019s last chance to salvage democracy, claiming that the governing party was sacrificing citizens\u2019 personal freedoms and liberties in exchange for economic growth. Although the Bangladesh Nationalist Party had a poor human rights track record when in power, they vowed that they would change their ways, and made delivering good governance a centerpiece of their campaign.At the very least, democracy advocates critical of both the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and the Awami League had hoped that the opposition would perform better in Sunday\u2019s elections to provide a strong check to Mrs. Hasina\u2019s third term. But the opposition only managed to win seven seats in parliament.\u201cIf I can provide food, jobs and health care, that is human rights,\u201d Mrs. Hasina said. \u201cI know my country, and I know how to develop my country. My biggest challenge is that no one is left behind.\u201dJulfikar Ali Manik reported from Dhaka, Bangladesh, and Maria Abi-Habib from Goa, India.Advertisement"}

", "Date": "2018-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDays after the police yanked a baby from a woman in a welfare office, no clear word on why. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.\u201cThe most sacred duty of government is to protect people,\u201d Mayor Bill de Blasio said, \u201cespecially defenseless children. There is nothing more barbaric than separating children from their parents. There is no excuse for this horror and certainly no reason.\u201dHe\u2019s shown much less passion in his response to the arrest. For most of Monday, Mr. de Blasio said nothing about the video \u2014 even as he hosted an event celebrating the 25th anniversary of the city\u2019s police oversight board, the Civilian Complaint Review Board. It would have been the perfect moment to brief the city on the episode. Instead, he ignored a flurry of questions shouted by reporters and walked out of the room. \u201cLike anyone who\u2019s watched this video, I have a lot of questions about how this was handled,\u201d he wrote, adding that the city agencies involved would \u201cget to the bottom\u201d of what happened. Police Commissioner James O\u2019Neill also called the video \u201cdisturbing\u201d and said his department was investigating the incident. But why can\u2019t the city explain why the police were called in the first place and why Ms. Headley was being arrested, apparently for refusing to leave the office? The social services commissioner, Steven Banks, who oversees the Human Resources Administration, which administers many benefit programs, was appropriately upset.\u201cH.R.A. centers must be safe havens for New Yorkers needing to access benefits to improve their lives,\u201d Mr. Banks said. \u201cI am deeply troubled by the incident, and a thorough review was launched over the weekend to get to the bottom of what happened.\u201dHe said he would improve training for officers and other staff members to defuse difficult situations before calling the Police Department. The agency\u2019s officers who were involved in the matter have been put on leave.Mr. de Blasio\u2019s handling of the incident shows how far he has strayed from his righteous roots as a candidate promising to hold the police accountable and change the way they interact with minority residents like Ms. Headley, who is black.For years now Mr. de Blasio has been standoffish to the department, leaving his commissioner to deal with the toughest questions about policing, just as he did on Monday. That\u2019s disappointing from a mayor who said he wanted to make New York City America\u2019s fairest big city.Advertisement"}

With apologies to the listicle gods, not to mention the headline gods, I don\u2019t mean this to be a definitive list of the best things I ate this year. I change my mind too often and besides, such a list would overlap considerably with my ranking of the best new restaurants reviewed in 2018. It seems more fair, or at least more interesting, to spread the love around. So the list that follows, in alphabetical order, is drawn exclusively from places that didn\u2019t make my top 10 but still do at least one thing very, very well.In Tuscany, wild boar is typically stewed to smithereens. Boar rag\u00f9 is on the menu at Ristoro del Cinghiale, too, but the place also offers a rare opportunity to eat roasted boar. Eight ribs and their attendant loin are smeared with salt and pepper; their flavor isn\u2019t like any other meat\u2019s, but you won\u2019t be far off if you imagine prime rib crossed with heritage pork chops ($85).For purists who insist that pasta and meatballs should be separate courses, Don Angie has found an ingenious compromise: The meatballs are broken into chunks and stewed like a rag\u00f9, so they distribute themselves around the wide belts of garganelli ($25).An anomaly on a menu of Hunanese noodle soups, the Hometown Lu Fen is a nest of rice noodles splashing around not in a pool of broth but in a shallow bath of sauce. Spread over the top are beef, barbecued pork and tofu fanned out in slices like cold cuts at a buffet. A little dish of chopped pickled chiles supplies amplification ($22).Showered with chocolate malt powder and dripping with sweetened condensed milk, this tower of thick, squishy French toast is begging to be knocked over. It may not be a complete breakfast as the phrase is understood by nutritionists, but it\u2019s hard to imagine wanting more once you\u2019ve demolished it ($9).Shimmering tomato pulp, translucent garlic, basil leaves, olive oil and dark veins of dried oregano conspire to produce one of the city\u2019s benchmark pizzas, despite (or because of?) the absence of cheese. Anthony Mangieri is the Mies van der Rohe of Manhattan\u2019s pizzaioli, a God-is-in-the-details perfectionist who does his finest work when he restricts himself to the fewest elements ($19).A highly regional treat from Okinawa, this cake contains black sugar, made by boiling cane juice all the way down. The cakes are steamed, so they don\u2019t caramelize as they would if they were baked, and the molasses flavor is wonderfully dominant ($12).A paragon of the square pizza renaissance, Mama\u2019s Too builds dough flavor with a slow rise, borrows the browned-cheese fringe at the edges from Detroit, and bakes each sheet pan hard until the crust, the cheese and the natural casings on the pepperoni achieve a seismic crispness ($4.50).Sure, the city got along fine before it had a destination eel restaurant. But it\u2019s better off with one, especially one that imports Japanese eel twice a week and grills it until the lightly charred skin is just as appealing as the rich, flaky meat (available as part of a prix-fixe meal costing $55 to $95).An earlier version of this article misstated the price of the c\u00f4te de boeuf at Ferris.

{"Headline": "Yes, Russian Trolls Helped Elect Trump", "Date": "2018-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySocial media lies have real-world consequences.Opinion ColumnistRespondents were asked to rate the accuracy of statements claiming that Hillary Clinton was suffering from a serious illness, that she\u2019d approved weapons sales to the Islamic State as secretary of state, and that Donald Trump had been endorsed by Pope Francis. \u201cBelief in these fake news stories is very strongly linked to defection from the Democratic ticket by 2012 Obama voters,\u201d wrote the researchers, Richard Gunther, Paul A. Beck and Erik C. Nisbet. Even after controlling for variables like ideology, education, party identification and dislike of Clinton, they found that believing a fake news story made people who voted for President Barack Obama in 2012 significantly less likely to vote for Clinton in 2016.The study\u2019s authors don\u2019t claim a clear causal link between propaganda and voting; it\u2019s possible that people who rejected Clinton were more open to misinformation about her. It\u2019s hard to believe, however, that at least some of them weren\u2019t affected by a social media ecosystem saturated with deliberate lies.Still, many people on both the left and the right have been skeptical of the notion that Russia\u2019s industrial-scale trolling campaign made a significant difference in Trump\u2019s election. In February, the special counsel Robert Mueller indicted 13 Russians connected to the Internet Research Agency, a Russian trolling operation based in St. Petersburg. Shortly afterward, National Review\u2019s Rich Lowry scoffed that the \u201cRussian contribution on social media was piddling and often laughable.\u201dAt a conference in Germany in July, I met Denis Korotkov, a brave Russian journalist who has reported extensively on Yevgeny Prigozhin, the oligarch behind the troll factory, who was included in Mueller's February indictments. Speaking through an interpreter, he expressed incredulity at the idea that the misinformation being spread from St. Petersburg could have changed the direction of American history.But it looks increasingly as though it did. On Monday, the Senate Intelligence Committee released two reports it commissioned about the nature and scale of Russia\u2019s social media disinformation campaign. One was produced by New Knowledge, a Texas cybersecurity company, along with researchers at Columbia University and Canfield Research; the other was written by researchers at Oxford University\u2019s Computational Propaganda Project along with Graphika, a company that analyzes social media. They were based on (incomplete) data turned over to Congress by several major social media platforms, and they suggest the campaign was more extensive and sophisticated than has been previously understood.Russian propaganda, one of the reports found, had about 187 million engagements on Instagram, reaching at least 20 million users, and 76.5 million engagements on Facebook, reaching 126 million people. Approximately 1.4 million people, the report said, engaged with tweets associated with the Internet Research Agency. \u201cThe organic Facebook posts reveal a nuanced and deep knowledge of American culture, media and influencers in each community the I.R.A. targeted,\u201d it said.There is no way to quantify exactly what this barrage of disinformation and manipulation did to American politics. But it should be obvious that what happens online influences our perceptions of, and behavior in, the offline world. People have committed horrific acts of violence based on Facebook propaganda. The Islamic State has used Twitter to recruit alienated Westerners.  Looking at Israel\u2019s airstrikes on Gaza in 2012, Thomas Zeitzoff, an associate professor at American University, found that they\u2019d significantly slow when there was a sharp uptick of online support for Hamas, an indication that the Israeli Defense Forces were monitoring their reputation on social media. So-called influencer marketing wouldn\u2019t be a billion-dollar industry if corporations didn\u2019t think social media shapes behavior.In October 2016, Libby Chamberlain founded an invitation-only Facebook group called Pantsuit Nation as a safe space for supporters of Hillary Clinton. The fact that people felt like a such a space was necessary is testament to how intimidated a great many Clinton supporters were by the vicious climate online. \u201cAs much as possible,\u201d Chamberlain told The Washington Post, her group \u201cremoves the risk that they\u2019re going to be attacked for their views.\u201dSome of these attacks came from real people, but not all. In their book \u201cLikeWar: The Weaponization of Social Media\u201d \u2014 which is where I learned about Zeitzoff\u2019s study \u2014 P.W. Singer and Emerson T. Brooking described how, in the run-up to the election, \u201canti-Clinton botnets actively sought out and \u2018colonized\u2019 pro-Clinton hashtags, flooding them with virulent political attacks.\u201d These attacks helped make fervent Clinton supporters reluctant to go public online. That, in turn, created a widespread impression that Clinton lacked enthusiastic grass-roots support, which is belied by the fact that Pantsuit Nation quickly swelled to millions of members.In an election decided by a rounding error \u2014 fewer than 80,000 voters spread over three states \u2014 Russian trolling easily could have made the difference. It\u2019s mortifying and preposterous that fake news ruined America. That doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t true.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Rage of \u2018Network\u2019 Went From Prophecy to Nostalgia", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the stage adaptation of the landmark film opens on Broadway, Howard Beale\u2019s uniting anger seems almost innocent and endearing.Mr. Belcher is an editor in the Hong Kong office of the Opinion section.Who knew it would turn out to be a terrifying glimpse into a future of paranoia, rage and the power of a fourth network to not only sway public opinion but blur \u2014 or perhaps obliterate \u2014 the line between truth and fiction.Forty-two years later, \u201cNetwork\u201d is on Broadway as a play at a time where that very sentence \u2014 and dozens of others from Paddy Chayefsky\u2019s not-a-word-wasted screenplay \u2014 are almost jaw-dropping in their relevancy to today\u2019s fractured and embittered America.And as the director Ivo van Hove\u2019s new stage version proves, the power of \u201cNetwork\u201d is its portrayal of how the public feeds on the promise of a savior \u2014 even an angry one. The rage that pours out of Howard Beale, the film\u2019s fallen angel of a newsman who is pushed out of his anchor chair only to become a voice box for the fed-up average Joe and Jane, was a rare public display on a fictitious TV network that felt all too real. But in the waning days of 2018, public airing of rage is a minute-by-minute spew-fest on Twitter or your choice of the social media du jour. Somehow \u201cNetwork\u201d feels almost touchy-feely nostalgic.This is perhaps what is almost negating about adapting \u201cNetwork\u201d to the stage. Mr. van Hove and his creative team have certainly updated this version with the technology of in-your-face video and a modern TV studio set (though still set in the late \u201970s). The actor Bryan Cranston embodies Howard Beale with a similar desperation and pent-up bitterness that earned Peter Finch a posthumous Oscar for best actor. The wrinkles in Mr. Cranston\u2019s weary face are a performance unto themselves.But \u201cNetwork\u201d is a time capsule. For those of us who came of age during the glory years of the holy trinity of ABC, CBS and NBC, the power of \u201cNetwork\u201d was its absurd idea: a fourth network, fictitiously called UBS, which is the underdog network that dares to usurp that trifecta with provocative programming and what is ostensibly a reality TV show that blends news and slanted political interpretations to prey on Americans\u2019 fears. Ring a bell?So as this fourth-network scenario came true in America \u2014 along with cable TV and the present-day onslaught of premium channels and the comfortably numbing power of quality shows on HBO, Showtime, Netflix and others \u2014 \u201cNetwork\u201d has remained not just a period piece but an almost psychically inspired glimpse into the future. It is that rare gem of American cinema that is both dated and ultimately timeless and most certainly a bellwether of how America has lurched forward over the decades. Other such films could be \u201cSunset Boulevard\u201d (Hollywood abandoning its silent-film stars for sound and fury) or \u201cDr. Strangelove\u201d (an equally brilliant satire at the height the Cold War) or \u201cMidnight Cowboy\u201d (an X-rating and Best Picture Oscar winner during the tumult of the Vietnam War).Much of the success of \u201cNetwork\u201d was its relevancy to the news at the time: the post-Watergate malaise and sense of betrayal by a president who flat-out lied to the American public (imagine!); the abduction of the heiress Patty Hearst; the two attempts on President Gerald Ford\u2019s life; the rise of homegrown American terrorism by political activists; the corporate takeover of television networks. There is a sort of innocence to these events from the perspective of our far more volatile world. Kidnapped heiresses! Good heavens!Perhaps the most revealing moment in \u201cNetwork\u201d comes near the beginning when Ms. Dunaway\u2019s character and her colleague, played by Robert Duvall, realize that Howard Beale\u2019s ratings are skyrocketing \u2014 that the more he loses it on the air, the higher the ratings go. They can no longer ignore the fact that a divided, soul-crushed America wants an unhinged anchorman to lead them to salvation.\u201cWe\u2019re talking about putting a manifestly irresponsible man on network television,\u201d Mr. Duvall\u2019s character says, to which Ms. Dunaway nods ever so gentle obviousness, but tinged with menace and power.Viewed from 2018, that\u2019s a chilling moment \u2014 one burned on celluloid from the dizzying bicentennial year of 1976. People might see this film in 50 to 100 years as a nostalgic depiction of old media, complete with wisecracking journalists in period costume. Viewers may not make the connection to its prophetic vision of the future, just as we don\u2019t see, say, \u201cThe Front Page\u201d as depicting the power of newspapers in 1920s America. \u201cNetwork\u201d captures a moment in time when network television was nearing the end of its reign. Perhaps that\u2019s all its legacy will be in half a century.Ah, to see \u201cNetwork\u201d from such a viewing platform: learning life from a sarcastic cartoon rabbit and being swayed by just a TV set in your living room.David Belcher is an editor in the Hong Kong office of the Opinion section.Advertisement"}

N.A.I.P.Dozens of companies use smartphone locations to help advertisers and even hedge funds. They say it\u2019s anonymous, but the data shows how personal it is.The millions of dots on the map trace highways, side streets and bike trails \u2014 each one following the path of an anonymous cellphone user.One path tracks someone from a home outside Newark to a nearby Planned Parenthood, remaining there for more than an hour. Another represents a person who travels with the mayor of New York during the day and returns to Long Island at night.Yet another leaves a house in upstate New York at 7 a.m. and travels to a middle school 14 miles away, staying until late afternoon each school day. Only one person makes that trip: Lisa Magrin, a 46-year-old math teacher. Her smartphone goes with her.An app on the device gathered her location information, which was then sold without her knowledge. It recorded her whereabouts as often as every two seconds, according to a database of more than a million phones in the New York area that was reviewed by The New York Times. While Ms. Magrin\u2019s identity was not disclosed in those records, The Times was able to easily connect her to that dot.The app tracked her as she went to a Weight Watchers meeting and to her dermatologist\u2019s office for a minor procedure. It followed her hiking with her dog and staying at her ex-boyfriend\u2019s home, information she found disturbing.\u201cIt\u2019s the thought of people finding out those intimate details that you don\u2019t want people to know,\u201d said Ms. Magrin, who allowed The Times to review her location data.Like many consumers, Ms. Magrin knew that apps could track people\u2019s movements. But as smartphones have become ubiquitous and technology more accurate, an industry of snooping on people\u2019s daily habits has spread and grown more intrusive.By Michael H. Keller and Richard Harris | Satellite imagery by Mapbox and DigitalGlobeAt least 75 companies receive anonymous, precise location data from apps whose users enable location services to get local news and weather or other information, The Times found. Several of those businesses claim to track up to 200 million mobile devices in the United States \u2014 about half those in use last year. The database reviewed by The Times \u2014 a sample of information gathered in 2017 and held by one company \u2014 reveals people\u2019s travels in startling detail, accurate to within a few yards and in some cases updated more than 14,000 times a day.Businesses say their interest is in the patterns, not the identities, that the data reveals about consumers. They note that the information apps collect is tied not to someone\u2019s name or phone number but to a unique ID. But those with access to the raw data \u2014 including employees or clients \u2014 could still identify a person without consent. They could follow someone they knew, by pinpointing a phone that regularly spent time at that person\u2019s home address. Or, working in reverse, they could attach a name to an anonymous dot, by seeing where the device spent nights and using public records to figure out who lived there.Many location companies say that when phone users enable location services, their data is fair game. But, The Times found, the explanations people see when prompted to give permission are often incomplete or misleading. An app may tell users that granting access to their location will help them get traffic information, but not mention that the data will be shared and sold. That disclosure is often buried in a vague privacy policy.\u201cLocation information can reveal some of the most intimate details of a person\u2019s life \u2014 whether you\u2019ve visited a psychiatrist, whether you went to an A.A. meeting, who you might date,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, who has proposed bills to limit the collection and sale of such data, which are largely unregulated in the United States.\u201cIt\u2019s not right to have consumers kept in the dark about how their data is sold and shared and then leave them unable to do anything about it,\u201d he added.After Elise Lee, a nurse in Manhattan, saw that her device had been tracked to the main operating room at the hospital where she works, she expressed concern about her privacy and that of her patients.\u201cIt\u2019s very scary,\u201d said Ms. Lee, who allowed The Times to examine her location history in the data set it reviewed. \u201cIt feels like someone is following me, personally.\u201dThe mobile location industry began as a way to customize apps and target ads for nearby businesses, but it has morphed into a data collection and analysis machine.\u201cWe look to understand who a person is, based on where they\u2019ve been and where they\u2019re going, in order to influence what they\u2019re going to do next,\u201d Ms. Greenstein said.Financial firms can use the information to make investment decisions before a company reports earnings \u2014 seeing, for example, if more people are working on a factory floor, or going to a retailer\u2019s stores.By Michael H. Keller | Imagery by Google Earth\u201cThe book \u20181984,\u2019 we\u2019re kind of living it in a lot of ways,\u201d said Bill Kakis, a managing partner at Tell All.Jails, schools, a military base and a nuclear power plant \u2014 even crime scenes \u2014 appeared in the data set The Times reviewed. One person, perhaps a detective, arrived at the site of a late-night homicide in Manhattan, then spent time at a nearby hospital, returning repeatedly to the local police station.By Michael H. Keller | Imagery by Google EarthThe most prolific company was Reveal Mobile, based in North Carolina, which had location-gathering code in more than 500 apps, including many that provide local news. A Reveal spokesman said that the popularity of its code showed that it helped app developers make ad money and consumers get free services.WeatherBug, owned by GroundTruth, asks users\u2019 permission to collect their location and tells them the information will be used to personalize ads. GroundTruth said that it typically sent the data to ad companies it worked with, but that if they didn\u2019t want the information they could ask to stop receiving it.By Michael H. Keller | Satellite imagery by Mapbox and DigitalGlobeThe Times also identified more than 25 other companies that have said in marketing materials or interviews that they sell location data or services, including targeted advertising.The spread of this information raises questions about how securely it is handled and whether it is vulnerable to hacking, said Serge Egelman, a computer security and privacy researcher affiliated with the University of California, Berkeley.\u201cThere are really no consequences\u201d for companies that don\u2019t protect the data, he said, \u201cother than bad press that gets forgotten about.\u201dCompanies that use location data say that people agree to share their information in exchange for customized services, rewards and discounts. Ms. Magrin, the teacher, noted that she liked that tracking technology let her record her jogging routes.Brian Wong, chief executive of Kiip, a mobile ad firm that has also sold anonymous data from some of the apps it works with, says users give apps permission to use and share their data. \u201cYou are receiving these services for free because advertisers are helping monetize and pay for it,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cYou would have to be pretty oblivious if you are not aware that this is going on.\u201dBut Ms. Lee, the nurse, had a different view. \u201cI guess that\u2019s what they have to tell themselves,\u201d she said of the companies. \u201cBut come on.\u201dMs. Lee had given apps on her iPhone access to her location only for certain purposes \u2014 helping her find parking spaces, sending her weather alerts \u2014 and only if they did not indicate that the information would be used for anything else, she said. Ms. Magrin had allowed about a dozen apps on her Android phone access to her whereabouts for services like traffic notifications.But it is easy to share information without realizing it. Of the 17 apps that The Times saw sending precise location data, just three on iOS and one on Android told users in a prompt during the permission process that the information could be used for advertising. Only one app, GasBuddy, which identifies nearby gas stations, indicated that data could also be shared to \u201canalyze industry trends.\u201dMore typical was theScore, a sports app: When prompting users to grant access to their location, it said the data would help \u201crecommend local teams and players that are relevant to you.\u201d The app passed precise coordinates to 16 advertising and location companies.A spokesman for theScore said that the language in the prompt was intended only as a \u201cquick introduction to certain key product features\u201d and that the full uses of the data were described in the app\u2019s privacy policy.The Weather Channel app, owned by an IBM subsidiary, told users that sharing their locations would let them get personalized local weather reports. IBM said the subsidiary, the Weather Company, discussed other uses in its privacy policy and in a separate \u201cprivacy settings\u201d section of the app. Information on advertising was included there, but a part of the app called \u201clocation settings\u201d made no mention of it.Even industry insiders acknowledge that many people either don\u2019t read those policies or may not fully understand their opaque language. Policies for apps that funnel location information to help investment firms, for instance, have said the data is used for market analysis, or simply shared for business purposes.\u201cMost people don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Emmett Kilduff, the chief executive of Eagle Alpha, which sells data to financial firms and hedge funds. Mr. Kilduff said responsibility for complying with data-gathering regulations fell to the companies that collected it from people.Many location companies say they voluntarily take steps to protect users\u2019 privacy, but policies vary widely.By Michael H. Keller | Satellite imagery by Mapbox and DigitalGlobeSome companies say they delete the location data after using it to serve ads, some use it for ads and pass it along to data aggregation companies, and others keep the information for years.Several people in the location business said that it would be relatively simple to figure out individual identities in this kind of data, but that they didn\u2019t do it. Others suggested it would require so much effort that hackers wouldn\u2019t bother.It \u201cwould take an enormous amount of resources,\u201d said Bill Daddi, a spokesman for Cuebiq, which analyzes anonymous location data to help retailers and others, and raised more than $27 million this year from investors including Goldman Sachs and Nasdaq Ventures. Nevertheless, Cuebiq encrypts its information, logs employee queries and sells aggregated analysis, he said.There is no federal law limiting the collection or use of such data. Still, apps that ask for access to users\u2019 locations, prompting them for permission while leaving out important details about how the data will be used, may run afoul of federal rules on deceptive business practices, said Maneesha Mithal, a privacy official at the Federal Trade Commission.\u201cYou can\u2019t cure a misleading just-in-time disclosure with information in a privacy policy,\u201d Ms. Mithal said.Apps form the backbone of this new location data economy.The app developers can make money by directly selling their data, or by sharing it for location-based ads, which command a premium. Location data companies pay half a cent to two cents per user per month, according to offer letters to app makers reviewed by The Times.Targeted advertising is by far the most common use of the information.Google and Facebook, which dominate the mobile ad market, also lead in location-based advertising. Both companies collect the data from their own apps. They say they don\u2019t sell it but keep it for themselves to personalize their services, sell targeted ads across the internet and track whether the ads lead to sales at brick-and-mortar stores. Google, which also receives precise location information from apps that use its ad services, said it modified that data to make it less exact.Smaller companies compete for the rest of the market, including by selling data and analysis to financial institutions. This segment of the industry is small but growing, expected to reach about $250 million a year by 2020, according to the market research firm Opimas.Apple and Google have a financial interest in keeping developers happy, but both have taken steps to limit location data collection. In the most recent version of Android, apps that are not in use can collect locations \u201ca few times an hour,\u201d instead of continuously.A spokesman said the company mandates that developers use the data only to provide a service directly relevant to the app, or to serve advertising that met Apple\u2019s guidelines.Apple recently shelved plans that industry insiders say would have significantly curtailed location collection. Last year, the company said an upcoming version of iOS would show a blue bar onscreen whenever an app not in use was gaining access to location data.After examining maps showing the locations extracted by their apps, Ms. Lee, the nurse, and Ms. Magrin, the teacher, immediately limited what data those apps could get. Ms. Lee said she told the other operating-room nurses to do the same.\u201cI went through all their phones and just told them: \u2018You have to turn this off. You have to delete this,\u2019\u201d Ms. Lee said. \u201cNobody knew.\u201dSept. 12, 2018May 10, 2018May 19, 2018Advertisement"}

But then if you start off the day when it\u2019s sunny and bright, and you have dark lenses and then clouds come in, you can\u2019t see anything and it becomes dangerous. So having different lenses for your goggles that you can switch out is, I think, something that needs to be shared with the average skier.

CAIRO \u2014 To write in Egypt and about Egypt has long meant being under the scrutiny of an authoritarian state \u2014 starting in the 1950s with President Gamal Abdel Nasser, who nationalized the press, and extending to the present. If you didn\u2019t approve of the government\u2019s activities, your only option, you quickly learned, was to be noncommittal.Still, it was only for a fleeting moment in 2011, in the early days of the uprising \u2014 before any clear division between factions had become apparent \u2014 that my notebook felt like a liability: I was stopped several times on the street by police officers who were suspicious of my note-taking and interrogated me about my affiliation and intentions. In all my years of writing, it had always been clear what could and what couldn\u2019t be addressed, even when the difference between those things shifted as the political story changed. There was still a margin for challenging the status quo, to subtly suggest what could not be said \u2014 that was mostly a matter of timing and venue. Writing in English, one had more leeway. Sometimes journalists were jailed and people disappeared, but such perils didn\u2019t loom over the everyday or anyone I personally knew.For decades under past presidents, the conservative current in Egyptian society had been kept in check. But the government of Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, keen to show itself as no less religious than the Islamist leadership it ousted, has allowed the righteous to speak up. Censorship, too, can be crowdsourced.Today, the risks exist regardless of who you are, what platform you write or speak for, what language you choose to use. The bounds of right and wrong now extend beyond the parameters of a political system, to what is deemed to be moral for the culture and conscientious for the nation. This is a moment of crisis, when new forms of expression and resistance must emerge.A question occupies me today: How to silence the censor inside me when faced with a growing sense of foreboding, even at times fear? How to invent, from this moment and this pressure, something radical, bound-breaking, new?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hope for a Green New Year", "Date": "2018-12-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDemocrats can\u2019t pass legislation yet, but they can get ready for 2021.Opinion ColumnistSo the immediate consequences of the power shift in Washington won\u2019t involve actual policymaking; they\u2019ll come mainly from Democrats\u2019 new, subpoena-power-armed ability to investigate the fetid swamp of Trumpian corruption. But that doesn\u2019t mean that Democrats should ignore policy issues. On the contrary, the party should spend the next two years figuring out what, exactly, it will try to do if it gains policymaking power in 2021. Which brings me to the big policy slogan of the moment: the so-called Green New Deal. Is this actually a good idea?Yes, it is. But it\u2019s important to go beyond the appealing slogan, and hash out many of the details. You don\u2019t want to be like the Republicans, who spent years talking big about repealing Obamacare, but never worked out a realistic alternative.So what does the Green New Deal mean? It\u2019s not entirely clear, which is what makes it a good slogan: It could mean a number of good things. But the main thrust, as I understand it, is that we should make a big move to tackle climate change, and that this move should accentuate the positive, not the negative. In particular, it should emphasize investments and subsidies, not carbon taxes.It\u2019s Economics 101: A pollution tax or equivalent creates broad-based incentives in a way less comprehensive policies can\u2019t. Why? Because it encourages people to reduce their carbon footprint in all possible ways, from using renewable energy, to conservation, to shifting consumption away from energy-intensive products.The point is that going for a less-than-ideal but salable policy, at least initially, is better than letting the best be the enemy of the good. That was the lesson of health care reform: Single payer had no chance of being enacted under President Barack Obama, but a somewhat awkward public-private hybrid system that preserved employer-based insurance was (just) doable \u2014 and 20 million Americans gained coverage. Now that the principle of universal coverage is out there, a gradual transition to some version of Medicare for all is starting to look politically possible; but it was important to start with policies that achieved big progress without greatly disrupting people\u2019s lives.The majority of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions come from electricity generation and transportation. We could cut generation-related emissions by two-thirds or more simply by ending the use of coal and making more use of renewables (whose prices have fallen drastically), without requiring that Americans consume less power. We could almost surely reduce transportation emissions by a comparable amount by raising mileage and increasing the use of electric vehicles, even if we didn\u2019t reduce the number of miles we drive each year.These are gains that could be achieved with a combination of positive incentives like tax credits and not-too-onerous regulation. Add in investments in technology and infrastructure that supports alternative energy, and a Green New Deal that dramatically reduces emissions seems entirely practical, even without carbon taxes. And these policies would visibly create jobs in renewable energy, which already employs a lot more people than coal mining.Over all, however, Democrats can surely do for climate change what they did for health care: devise policies that hugely improve the situation while producing far more winners than losers. They can\u2019t enact a Green New Deal right away \u2014 but they should start preparing now, and be ready to move in two years.Advertisement"}

You can see him doing the calculations in his head, trying not to overstate a position or appear too absolute on a topic that he has not fully considered.Can a sitting president be indicted?\u201cWell, I think we\u2019re going to find that out.\u201d Later he adds, \u201cI know what I hope.

My inclination is to say no, that I would not, but I think some of that also depends on where we\u2019re at as a country.\u201dBut, as the dinner wears on, he loosens and his quickness to laugh emerges. He dispenses with the knife and fork he has been using to negotiate his roast chicken and, in a move that would have made Emily Post squirm but makes me smile, he hoists it with his hands. He is comfortable now, and this man I like: imperfect but not impertinent. Human. Relatable.We discuss Castro\u2019s rather standard Democratic stances on major issues: in favor of common-sense gun regulations, wants to roll back the Trump tax cut, and wants to take a multinational approach to the issues driving Trump\u2019s tariffs. He\u2019s in favor of universal pre-K, free public college across the board, and Medicare for all.I\u2019m listening for something enlightening, something arresting, a vision and a vocabulary that will rally and inspire. It never fully manifests. He talks of summoning a \u201ccommon sense of purpose, of common national identity.\u201d He chides Donald Trump\u2019s divisiveness and churlishness. But somehow, it all flattens for me. I\u2019m too familiar with the framing.And yet, there is something genuine about Castro, a nice guy who made it. He\u2019s not straining to impress, and that, in and of itself, is impressive.Because Castro\u2019s relative youth is so apparent in his appearance and comportment, it occurs to me that if elected, Castro, who is now 44, would become one of America\u2019s youngest presidents. And this gives me pause. There is a young man\u2019s ease and airiness about Castro, a disarming charm that arrests the attention because of its counterintuitiveness, but I struggle to imagine it in the Oval Office.Thinking about the campaign, too, it is hard to imagine Castro in a bare-knuckled brawl with Trump and the Republicans.Trump would have a field day with this.It is important to note here that Castro is unlikely to be the only young candidate this cycle. Indeed, there may be a whole raft of hopefuls in their 40s, and even 30s, who throw their hats into the ring.But youth has a way of making itself known, of peeking through the curtain of the mature persona one tries to craft.Castro\u2019s first task is to secure the nomination. One could see a scenario in which this Southern Hispanic would have particular advantages on the primary calendar, but it remains to be seen how an incredibly diverse party will respond to an incredibly diverse slate of candidates. Will people hew to tribalism and regionalism in their choices, or will those things be of little consequence in the end?Castro has been talked about for years as a rising star in the Democratic Party, one who could someday become this country\u2019s first Hispanic president.One question for me is whether this is that moment for Julian, or if interest in him peaked before his opening appeared. There are now other stories and educational pedigrees just as compelling as Castro\u2019s and they are attached to people with higher profiles, access to more donors and, quite frankly, more of a craven desire to rise to power.This nice guy may not always finish last, but can he come close enough to the top in Iowa and New Hampshire to confirm his viability?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Video of Tourist\u2019s Killing in Morocco Is Most Likely Real, Norway Says", "Date": "2018-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOSLO, Norway \u2014 The Norwegian police have concluded that footage showing the brutal killing of a Scandinavian tourist in Morocco by suspects who also filmed themselves pledging allegiance to the Islamic State is most likely authentic.It came as the Moroccan authorities announced the arrests of nine more people in connection with the killing of the university students Maren Ueland, 28, of Norway and Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, of Denmark, in a remote corner of the Atlas Mountains. Morocco considers the killings a terrorist act.Thirteen men in all have been detained in the case. Morocco\u2019s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigations said the nine new suspects had been arrested in the regions of Marrakesh, Essaouira, Sidi Bennour, Tangier and Chtouka Ait Baha. They were carrying arms and \u201csuspicious materials\u201d used in the manufacture of explosives at the time of their arrests. No further details were released.Ms. Jespersen and Ms. Ueland were attacked after setting out for a hike. Their bodies were found on Monday with stab wounds in their necks. Both women had been studying in Norway to become tour guides.On Friday, a plane took their bodies from Casablanca to Denmark. The Norwegian news agency NTB said Ms. Ueland\u2019s autopsy would be performed in her home country.In the video of the killing posted on social media, one of the victims is shown screaming while a man cuts her neck with a knife. Kripos said in its statement that \u201csome work remains on technical analysis and assessment\u201d of the footage, and that the Norwegian police were working \u201cclosely with Danish police\u201d on the case.Prime Minister Erna Solberg of Norway called the killings \u201ca senseless attack,\u201d and Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen of Denmark said on Thursday that the killings might be \u201cpolitically motivated, and thereby an act of terror.\u201dThat video, which was shared on Twitter, showed the men vowing fealty to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and saying that they \u201ccannot remain seated, witnessing the destruction caused by Crusader planes,\u201d terminology typically used by the terrorist group to refer to Western airstrikes in Iraq and Syria.Kripos said that \u201cneither Norway nor Denmark was mentioned in the video, nor was there anything specific about what action they should perform.\u201dInvestigators recovered surveillance footage showing three of the men putting up a tent near the victims\u2019 tent in an isolated area of the High Atlas Mountains, an area popular with hikers. The same men are seen leaving the area after their deaths, according to Moroccan news reports.The Norwegian authorities said they were trying to trace the women\u2019s activities before their departure for the village of Imlil. The women were found about six miles from the village.Morocco is generally considered safe for tourists but it has battled to rid some areas of Islamic extremists for years.In Norway, more than 400 people in the small town of Bryne held a parade and carried torches in remembrance of Ms. Ueland. On Facebook, Ms. Jespersen\u2019s friends and relatives said they had received tens of thousands of messages from strangers expressing their grief, many apparently from Moroccans expressing shock and offering apologies.But some friends and relatives of the victims said they were also being sent the video of what the authorities believe to be the killing of one of the women.Moroccans are also trying to stop people from spreading the video online. It is illegal in the country to publish or spread material that promotes terrorist activities.A Danish scholar on Islamic militants, Tore Refslund Hamming, said he had been approached by a person he believed to be American with a \u201cfairly senior\u201d position within the Islamic State who offered to share the suspects\u2019 allegiance video online.\u201cHe asked if I wanted the video in advance and participate in hyping the video by sharing and liking it,\u201d said Mr. Hamming, a doctoral student with the European University Institute in Florence.He said he declined, but that the video of the killing started spreading online half an hour later.A Danish Facebook manager, Martin Ruby, told Danish news outlets that the social media giant was helping the police to pull down the video \u201cas quickly as we can.\u201dHenrik Pryser Libell reported from Oslo, Norway, Martin Selsoe Sorensen from Copenhagen and Aida Alami from Paris.

{"Headline": "Will William Barr Be Trump\u2019s Roy Cohn?", "Date": "2018-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe president wants an attorney general who will defend him above all else. There\u2019s reason to worry about his new nominee.Ms. Fredrickson is the president of the American Constitution Society.One of Donald Trump\u2019s more dubious constitutional notions is that the attorney general serves to protect the president, rather than serving as a lawyer for the American people. He fired the office\u2019s previous holder, Jeff Sessions, for failing to provide him personal legal cover in the Russia investigation. Now he has selected William Barr as Mr. Sessions\u2019 replacement, and one is compelled to ask exactly what President Trump will expect from his new nominee. Because Mr. Barr previously served as attorney general, under George H.W. Bush, many observers assume the Senate might give him an easy confirmation. In fact, it should do the exact opposite.\u201cWhere\u2019s my Roy Cohn?\u201d That\u2019s the phrase attributed to President Trump at the tail end of a reported presidential rant about Mr. Sessions\u2019 decision to recuse himself from overseeing the Russia investigation. Cohn, a top aide to Senator Joseph McCarthy, was Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer and fixer throughout the 1970s, a man with a reputation for pushing legal limits and employing all manner of dirty tricks to protect his client; he ran afoul of the law himself, resulting in his disbarment in 1986. Mr. Trump\u2019s contempt for Mr. Sessions centered around his recusal and unwillingness to shield the president from the Russia investigation. In longing for a Roy Cohn replica, the president made clear that he was seeking not a skilled and experienced attorney who would help him navigate choppy legal waters but rather a legal bruiser who would stop at nothing to protect him from scrutiny. It is no stretch to think that the ability of the next attorney general to do just that might have been on the president\u2019s mind when making his selection. Matthew Whitaker, the president\u2019s pick to serve as acting attorney general, had made clear his contempt for the special counsel, Robert Mueller. There are reasons to fear that Mr. Barr was selected using the same criteria and that he too shares the president\u2019s disdain for the Russia investigation.Indeed, in 2017 Mr. Trump and Mr. Barr, then in private practice, reportedly discussed the possibility of Mr. Barr serving as Mr. Trump\u2019s private defense attorney. While no engagement resulted, it will be important to understand how far those discussions advanced and to what extent sensitive information about the Russia inquiry was exchanged.Further, Mr. Barr has made statements in the past downplaying the looming charges against the president. And he has said that the president \u201cmade the right call\u201d when he fired the former F.B.I. director, James Comey, a legally perilous decision, now that the president himself has said that the Russia investigation was on his mind when he made that move. Mr. Barr was also a key voice in President George H.W. Bush\u2019s ear in 1992 when he pardoned several figures involved in the Iran-contra affair, directly undermining the special counsel charged with that investigation (coincidentally, at the time Mr. Mueller was the head of the Justice Department\u2019s criminal division, and thus reported to Mr. Barr). We should be doubly worried about Mr. Barr\u2019s nomination in the wake of the elevation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court \u2014 both men apparently hold expansive views of presidential power, especially with regard to legal investigations of the executive branch.These are perilous times. Not since Watergate have we seen a presidency so mired in accusations of unethical and illegal behavior. And not since Watergate have we seen a president so contemptuous of the rule of law. There are serious and credible allegations against the president, members of his inner circle and his campaign staff. Already the Russia investigation has led to criminal charges against 36 people and entities, seven guilty pleas, three people being sentenced and one convicted at trial. And there is undoubtedly more to come.During Mr. Barr\u2019s confirmation hearings, senators must secure from him a firm commitment to allow the Russia investigation to continue. They must also get his assurances that Mr. Mueller\u2019s conclusions will receive a full public airing. Mr. Barr must prove his independence from the president and his willingness to hold him accountable. Failure to do so would render him unqualified for the role of the nation\u2019s top law enforcement officer.Advertisement"}

Opinion ColumnistNobody understood our relationship \u2014 least of all us.It was, admittedly, odd.\u201cI like you,\u201d the first President Bush wrote me once, after he was out of office. \u201cPlease don\u2019t tell anyone.\u201dIn decades of correspondence, he tried to figure out why we stayed in touch, beginning one note \u201cDarn you Maureen Dowd\u201d and mischievously observing in another, \u201cSometimes I found it better around my family to go \u2018Maureen who?\u2019\u201dAt times, typing on what he called \u201cmy little IBM,\u2019\u2019 he signed off \u201cCon afecto, GB,\u2019\u2019 or if I was writing critically about his sons, \u201cCon Afecto, still, just barely though! gb.\u2019\u2019 Or \u201cLove\u201d scratched out and replaced with the handwritten rebuke, \u201cnot quite there yet.\u201dI come from a line of Irish maids who worked for the first families of America, the Mellons and the Gores, wealthy, aristocratic families like the Bushes.George Herbert Walker Bush, known by his childhood nickname of Poppy, was cared for by maids and chauffeured to kindergarten at Greenwich Country Day School. His idea of cursing like a sailor entailed unleashing a string of epithets like \u201cGolly!\u201d \u201cDarn!\u201d and \u201cOh, shoot!\u201dHis father was a Wall Street banker turned Connecticut senator who was straight out of central casting: craggy, 6-foot-4, wearing gray worsted suits even in warm weather. My brothers, Michael and Martin, teenage pages at the Capitol in the \u201950s, were in awe of him. Michael was in the Senate mail room one day when the young man sorting letters held up one addressed to the Connecticut senator and mused: \u201cYou just know a guy with a name like Prescott Bush is not driving a bus.\u201dIf the Clintons are the careless Tom and Daisy Buchanan and Barack Obama is a Camus-like figure of existential estrangement and Donald Trump is a flimflam man out of \u201cHuckleberry Finn,\u2019\u2019 H.W. was Bertie Wooster, an airy WASP propelled to the top by the old boys\u2019 network.In another life, I probably would have been serving President Bush his vodka martini, made to perfection with a splash of dry vermouth, two olives and a cocktail onion.But I came along just as the old world of Ivy League white men running everything was breaking up. My mom had applied for a job as a reporter at The Washington Post in 1926 and had been told by a gruff city editor that it was too rough a trade for a young lady.But by 1988, I could be The New York Times White House reporter.At dinner one night, President Bush\u2019s pollster, Bob Teeter, had a couple of martinis and got frank with me: \u201cWe just don\u2019t see you as The New York Times White House reporter. We see you more at a newspaper like the New York Daily News or the Chicago Tribune.\u201dDumbfounded, I stammered, \u201cYou mean because I\u2019m a woman with an ethnic, working-class background?\u2019\u2019Yes, Teeter replied.And thus began the screwball story, spanning decades, mystifying everyone, of the patrician president and the impertinent reporter.He protested that his mesquite side was genuine. \u201cCan I name drop right here?\u201d he wrote me once. \u201cI am mad about Reba and she likes me, too \u2014 so there!\u201dWhat other commander in chief wore a bunny tie on Easter and a pumpkin tie on Halloween? Who else would sit in the White House reading women\u2019s magazines with his wife and then look up to ask, \u201cBar, what\u2019s a bikini wax?\u201d Who else would go to the magic shop near the White House and fill his office with items like a red rope that turned white, a calculator that squirted water and cash on a string so you could yank it back when someone tried to pick it up? He also had a crystal ball with a disembodied voice that gave Delphic answers to questions about tax increases: \u201cThe images are cloudy. Have someone else ask.\u201dWho else would send me a Polaroid of himself wearing a T-shirt that said \u201cBroccoli Lover\u201d? Or a picture of himself and Barbara parodying that famous attenuated Al and Tipper Gore convention kiss?Poppy wasn\u2019t perfect. I recoiled when he beat Michael Dukakis with the race-baiting Willie Horton campaign designed by Lee Atwater and Roger Ailes. And again when he sent his national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, to Beijing for a secret midnight champagne toast with the leaders who perpetrated the Tiananmen Square massacre. And again when he didn't do nearly enough to combat the AIDS epidemic. And again when his White House directed the defense of his Supreme Court nominee, Clarence Thomas, that tried to discredit Anita Hill. Unlike President Trump, who does his own wet work, the Bushes took the more refined route of outsourcing their ends-justify-the-means moves.Covering H.W.\u2019s White House was wildly different than covering Donald Trump\u2019s. A Trump day bursts with a fusillade of huge news stories, often starting at dawn with a crazy tweet and usually involving the amorality, criminality and vulgarity of the president and his circle. I could go for months without getting a juicy story out of 41\u2019s White House. It was often hard to even break into the paper \u2014 unless we discovered that the president showered with his dog, Millie, or that Millie was suffering from lead poisoning from licking the White House paint.In the absence of stories about impeachment, porn stars and white-collar criminal transgressions, I was left writing about Bush-speak, 41\u2019s tangled syntax. At a Knoxville high school, when he was asked about ideas to improve schools, he replied: \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to kick that one right into the end zone of the Secretary of Education.\u2019\u2019 Sometimes he forgot and read his stage directions, like: \u201cMessage: I care.\u201d As Lance Morrow wrote in Time magazine, the president treated words as \u201cperverse, buzzing little demons that need to be brushed away periodically like flies.\u201d This did not help H.W. in debates with Bill Clinton, which is why he was caught impatiently checking his watch.He shunned personal pronouns because his beloved mother, Dorothy, always warned him not to gloat or focus on \u201cthe big I.\u201d Asked what the Malta summit with Mikhail Gorbachev would mean for the world, Bush replied: \u201cGrandkids. All of that. Very important.\u201d In his State of the Union message, he asked: \u201cAmbitious aims? Of course. Easy to do? Far from it.\u2019\u2019 Once on his beloved cigarette boat, the Fidelity, he told me, \u201cCan\u2019t act. Just have to be me.\u201dDana Carvey mocked the president by standing in front of the Berlin Wall on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and intoning: \u201cBefore Bush, wall. With Bush, no wall.\u2019\u2019 Bush, who loved to laugh and who traded barbershop jokes with his Secretary of State James Baker and his image wizard Sig Rogich, ended up putting a tape of Carvey mimicking him in his presidential library. (His fondness for dirty jokes grew antiquated, colliding in the end with the #MeToo wave, for which he apologized.)After 43 became president, 41 wrote to Time\u2019s Hugh Sidey with a self-deprecating comparison to John Adams, the only other president whose son also became president: \u201cA prolific reader, he loved the classics, prided himself on his ability to speak Latin, and had a library of extraordinary proportions. I couldn\u2019t wait to stop studying Latin. Big difference there between me and John.\u201dI wrote about Bush\u2019s grueling schedule, not of governing but of sporting: shooting, casting, jogging, putting, pitching, lobbing, boating, diving and body surfing. I dug up the dirt on his floating backhand, unsteady putting stroke and a basketball shot that his son Marvin called \u201can ugly air ball.\u201d Many a summer morning at 6 a.m., I could be found on the Kennebunkport golf course, sitting cross-legged and watching Bush play \u201caerobic golf\u2019\u2019 or \u201cgolf polo.\u201dHe complained in one of his \u201cblue notes\u2019\u2019 from the Oval to his press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, that I was sitting in a \u201chinayanistic\u201d Buddha pose on the first tee, \u201coff meditating in Sri Lanka.\u201d It was giving him the yips. He worried I was trying to figure out \u201cwhat makes this crazy guy tick.\u201dOnce, to pay him back for all the break-of-day golf games, I thought it would be funny to wear a \u201cJesse Jackson for President \u201988\u201d cap and a \u201cBob Dole for President \u201988\u201d T-shirt on the course. As H.W. came hurtling down in his golf cart toward the ninth hole, I was waiting for him to see my get-up and laugh. But he didn\u2019t look my way. His golf partner, his oldest son, then known as \u201cJunior\u201d and the Roman candle in the family, did look, though, and leveled a fierce glare at me.\u201cNo worries,\u201d I comforted myself. \u201cJeb\u2019s the comer. Junior\u2019s the black sheep.\u201dH.W. used sports as a way to do personal diplomacy, playing horseshoes with heads of state at Camp David or driving them maniacally on his motorboat at Kennebunkport. (Francois Mitterrand begged off, saying he\u2019d get mal de mer.)I was in the press contingent when 41 took Hosni Mubarak to his first baseball game to see the Baltimore Orioles. The crowd cheered as Ted Williams, who was in the stands, was introduced and then reacted in flummoxed silence when the announcer boomed \u201cthe president of Egypt \u2014 Mubarak.\u201dI interviewed President Bush about popular culture and he accused me of doing a \u201cpsychoanalytical\u201d piece and trying to put him \u201con the couch.\u201d I found out that Greer Garson was his favorite actress, that he had had a crush on Doris Day as a teenage Navy pilot in World War II, that he loved glee club music, that he was a bust at the fox trot, and that he once dozed off while watching the Ronald Reagan movie \u201cSanta Fe Trail.\u201dI didn\u2019t spare the journalistic rod. When I took my mother, who was on crutches, to a White House Christmas party, President Bush kissed her sweetly. On the way home, she said, \u201cI knew he had a cold, but he was so handsome, I just went for it.\u2019\u2019 Then she glowered at me, muttering, \u201cI don\u2019t want you to write anything mean about that man ever again.\u2019\u2019Somewhere along the way, H.W. and I grew to appreciate each other.\u201cWe have a love-hate relationship,\u2019\u2019 he told me when I ran into him in 2001 at a book party in Georgetown. \u201cI talk to my shrink about it.\u201d He knew that I knew he was kidding; he avoided introspection at all costs, often ending debates in the White House by saying \u201cI\u2019m president and you\u2019re not.\u201dWhen I asked the ex-president if he would like to meet with our editorial board, he replied, \u201cOnly after 3 root canal jobs. Thanks anyway.\u2019\u2019He reminisced in one note that Arthur Sulzberger Jr. had covered his campaign a bit in 1980: \u201cWe liked him, but then he got to be an editor then top gun \u2014 publisher. A lib, yes, but not a mean one.\u2019\u2019H.W. wrote that he was not as anti-press as his sister, Nancy Ellis, who had once excoriated the Taylors, who used to own the Boston Globe. \u201cI am not like my beloved sister, who has re-cancelled her Boston Globe subscription four different times,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u201cand who took on one of the sacred Taylor family in a letter-to-the-ed as a \u2018Droopy Drawers.\u2019\u2019\u2019He would complain when I used the \u201cd word\u201d (dynasty) and when he thought I was making the family sound elitist, telling me to lay off the \u201clegacy crud\u2019\u2019 and \u201cthe Gatsby stuff,\u2019\u2019 fretting that it could hurt Jeb. He told me to ignore his stationery with the drawing of the posh Kennebunkport compound. He sometimes signed off sardonically, \u201cSincerely, My Excellency, GHWB, Eastern Elitist.\u201dMostly, he agonized about how strange it was that we stayed in touch when I was so hard on W. about the invasion of Iraq. (Even though H.W. and I both believed that ousting Saddam would cause more trouble than containing him.)\u201cWhere do you and I stand,\u2019\u2019 he pondered. \u201cIt is not hate (underlined). How can I feel a warm spot in my heart for someone who day in and day out brutalizes my son? I don\u2019t know but I do. End of Confession \u2014 Con Afecto, GB #41.\u201dAnother time, he wrote: \u201cI don\u2019t like it that you don\u2019t like my oldest son; but it\u2019s a bit of a stand off cuz he doesn\u2019t like you either. But then he doesn\u2019t know you as well as I do. Time may heal.\u201dJean Becker, 41\u2019s lovely chief of staff, joked that the former president and I needed \u201ccouples counseling.\u201dSometimes, H.W. talked about his \u201cmadness Richter scale\u201d or declared himself \u201cdouble dip angry\u201d with me after a tough column on W.\u201cYou see, I like this exchange with you, but, as confessed before, I get angry with you!\u2019\u2019 he wrote. Another time, he teased: \u201cNow I am off to the clinic to take a little Prozac, stretch out, and get some shrinkster to figure out this love/hate thing about you that plagues me.\u2019\u2019 At one point, he pleaded: \u201cDo not prescribe shock therapy.\u2019\u2019He said he preferred to keep his advice to his eldest son private, noting: \u201cI am even very careful around close friends having learned that the propensity to leak is stronger than the sex drive.\u201dBut an even funnier thing that happened in the course of this unique relationship came after the ascension of W. \u2014 whom 41 sometimes referred to in his notes as \u201cmy boy, Quincy.\u201d In 2006, 43 made a rare trip to Kennebunkport one weekend for a wedding, a christening and a funeral, and I went with the press corps. I was surprised when Karl Rove called me to tell me he was involved in a cloak-and-dagger plot with Bush senior, who wanted to meet me for coffee but didn\u2019t want his son to find out because it would irritate him.The former C.I.A. director who liked to sign his notes at the agency, \u201cHead Spook,\u2019\u2019 still had some tricks up his sleeve. I loved the idea of one president with a Secret Service detail sneaking around behind the back of another president with a Secret Service detail, when they were both staying in the same family compound in the small Maine town.Talk about Skull and Bones skulduggery. We didn\u2019t pull it off, but I liked the derring-do of it, recalling the days when President Bush used to try to lose his security detail when he was careering around in his speedboat in Maine.After he was out of office, I sent H.W. and Barbara books and small Christmas mementos. Once, I told my assistant, Ashley Parker \u2014 now a Washington Post White House reporter \u2014 to send him a glasses case embroidered with a lobster. She got distracted and sent him some cheap drugstore hand warmers that you put inside gloves.Naturally, since we\u2019re talking about the most polite man who ever lived, I soon got a thank-you note for the 50-cent present: \u201cI shall use the handwarmers as Pres. Obama comes in and we Bushes leave town,\u2019\u2019 he said.When my mom died at 97 in 2005, he sent me a kind email that made me cry.\u201cIt hurts to lose a parent,\u2019\u2019 he wrote. \u201cIt hurts an awful lot. When my own Mom died I went up to Greenwich to check on her. She was close to death and her breathing was so labored that I literally prayed to God, as I knelt right there by her bed, that she would go on to heaven. She was prepared to do just that.I flew down to Houston to have lunch with H.W. in 2011.\u201cDid you come because you think I\u2019m going to die?\u201d the then 87-year-old in a wheelchair asked me as we dined at his favorite pizza dive.No, I replied. I told him I was enlisting to go with him on his ninetieth birthday parachute jump.He spoke fondly of Bill Clinton and respectfully of President Obama. Then I asked him about Donald Trump, who was leading the birther charge against Obama. Neither of us could have imagined then that Trump would dispatch H.W.\u2019s long-nurtured dreams of his son Jeb becoming president with two words: \u201clow energy.\u201dAt the mere mention of Trump\u2019s name, 41 made a face. \u201cHe\u2019s an ass,\u2019\u2019 he snapped.When Trump began plowing his way through Republican rivals, H.W. was known to throw his shoe at the television set.The narcissistic, amoral, vulgar reality-TV president and the modest, principled, classy, old-world president could not be more different.With Poppy, there was decency and sweetness.\u201cPut it this way,\u2019\u2019 he wrote me once. \u201cI reserve the right to whine, to not read, to use profanity, but if you ever get really hurt or if you ever get really down and need a shoulder to cry on or just need a friend \u2014 give me a call.

{"Headline": "Can I Ask My Parents for an Advance on My Inheritance?", "Date": "2018-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySOCIAL Q\u2019SOur advice columnist weighs in on a reader\u2019s morbid question about money.I am buying a house. I have a plan to afford it, but it would be much easier if my parents (in their 80s) gave me an \u201cadvance\u201d on the money they will leave me. I hate to sound crass, but I\u2019d like to enjoy some of it while they\u2019re alive \u2014 maybe even host a family gathering. I asked my older sister, who has financial power of attorney for them. She thought it should be structured as a loan with a minimal interest rate. But when my parents helped with her kids\u2019 education, years ago, there was no loan. Am I being petty? I intend to speak to my parents, but I\u2019d love your input.KATHYHere\u2019s the thing about your parents\u2019 money: It\u2019s theirs! Asking for an advance on your inheritance is crass, for sure, but worse, it may hurt their feelings \u2014 as if you were licking your chops in anticipation of their death. (And I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not.) So, let\u2019s find another way.You don\u2019t say how well off your parents are, how much of their savings they may need in the future or whether the power of attorney is already in effect. If you are sure that they are still competent to make this decision and can afford it, ask for a loan. Let them decide whether to make it a gift. And drop the tit-for-tat with your sister over her children\u2019s education. That help was given at another time and probably long planned.My biggest reservation here is that many parents I know would go without to help their children (even deep into adulthood). If that sounds like yours, stick with your original plan to pay for the house yourself. There comes a time to put our parents first, after years of the reverse arrangement. That time may have come, Kathy.When I first began dating my girlfriend, about a year ago, I told her I would always cook for her. (I was a decent cook in college.) She was very into this idea. But every time I cook for her I get something wrong. She\u2019s never had a decent meal that came from my kitchen. And when she\u2019s not around, my meals come out beautifully! What can I do?SOPHIEOther than relax? This is called performance anxiety, Sophie, and many of us suffer from it. Give me a bucket of balls and a deserted tennis court, and I serve like Serena Williams. Put someone on the other side of the net, and I double-fault all afternoon.Try turning down the pressure on yourself. On the tennis court, I play points without keeping score. In the kitchen, enlist your girlfriend\u2019s help. A cassoulet made by two may be a less freighted enterprise for you. Once you\u2019ve got a few decent meals under your belt, I imagine you\u2019ll be back to cooking as well as ever. (And a nice glass of Barolo probably wouldn\u2019t hurt.)My husband, our young son and I have a house in the country, a few hours from our primary residence. We don\u2019t get there often because of our heavy workloads. But when we do, our neighbors (who also have a young child) are at our door within 10 minutes of our arrival. The kids are happy to see each other. But my husband and I would like to settle in and enjoy some downtime together rather than immediately hear stories about our neighbors\u2019 lives since the last time we saw them. How do we maintain a friendly relationship and stop the uninvited visits?ANONYMOUSHere\u2019s a wild suggestion: the truth! Boundaries don\u2019t appear by magic; we set them. The next time your neighbors bound over, say, \u201cHow nice to see you! Let us settle in, and maybe we can grab a drink later?\u201d Let the kids play. Relax with your husband. And invite the neighbors over for a glass of wine at night or coffee the next day. If you don\u2019t like them turning up uninvited, you have to let them know. Just be neighborly about it.My best friend from childhood married a dunderhead who thinks it\u2019s funny to post unflattering pictures of her on Instagram without her knowledge. The photos are often of her sleeping or wearing pajamas. He also writes posts that paint her in a poor light. Initially, he lied to her about this. (Their pastor even got involved!) But he\u2019s still posting about her regularly. I\u2019d like to rat him out. But would that be meddling in their marriage?ANONYMOUSIf your friend confided in you about this problem, it\u2019s reasonable to check in with her and let her know that the unappealing photos are still coming fast and furious. But stay out of this mess if you heard about it from a third party. Your friend is surely aware of her husband\u2019s behavior. It doesn\u2019t require mad sleuthing skills (or a friend from youth) for her to check his social media feeds occasionally and call him out on his nasty behavior.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Digital Data Gives Billboard Owners More Reason to \u2018Love a Good Traffic Jam\u2019", "Date": "2018-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdvertisingThe increasingly lengthy commute isn\u2019t just a traffic jam. It\u2019s a captive audience for advertisers.\u201cWe love a good traffic jam,\u201d said John Miller, vice president of sales and sales operations for Lamar Advertising in Baton Rouge, La. \u201cWe are all about eyeballs on billboards, and the increased amount of traffic is helping us.\u201dLamar has 175,000 billboards throughout the United States, Mr. Miller said, adding that slower traffic had helped the company\u2019s data collection program determine who was looking at the board and for how long. Using anonymous data from mobile devices and apps, Lamar has figured out how fast cars are passing by, how much \u201cdwell time\u201d drivers spend paying attention to billboards, what the demographics of the drivers are, and even where they live, travel and shop.Roughly three years ago, Clear Channel Outdoor started its own data collection service, Radar. Using global positioning data from mobile apps that require mapping \u2014 navigation, dating, shopping and restaurant ads \u2014 the service blends third-party demographic data with information about people passing billboards to determine not only where commuters will spend, but how.\u201cNow we\u2019re starting to understand what mobile devices we saw exposed to our billboards, and we look back in time and say, \u2018Where else have we seen those devices?\u2019\u201d said Dan Levi, executive vice president and chief marketing officer for Clear Channel Outdoor. \u201cIn the case of businesses trying to get people into Target, we say, \u2018What are the locations that are the most efficient in getting people whose devices we\u2019ve seen in Target?\u2019\u201dHe noted that a recent analysis of fast-food customers in Southern California had found a strong (and perhaps counterintuitive) correlation with their going to the gym, largely because commuting whittled away time for sit-down meals and other forms of exercise. It also showed that billboards for gyms worked better when placed near a commuter\u2019s workplace than near his or her home.Mr. Miller said that data could also help digital billboards, which make up 2 percent of Lamar\u2019s billboard inventory, change to meet an advertiser\u2019s needs at specific times of the day. That could mean a movie studio\u2019s billboard mocking traffic congestion at the height of rush hour, a Dunkin\u2019 billboard changing from coffee in the morning to sandwiches at night, or sequential billboards telling a story.If advertisers can\u2019t catch commuters\u2019 eyes with billboards, they are also trying to reach them through radio.For instance, iHeartMedia \u2014 which owns Clear Channel Outdoor \u2014 has spent the last three years looking at listener behavior on both its radio stations and its app. Its research has produced data that iHeartMedia now sells to advertisers along with demographic information and specific ad time.However, Robert Pittman, chairman and chief executive officer of iHeartMedia, said commuters were so bombarded with information that advertisers might get them to want a product or service in the moment but not get them to remember once they\u2019re out of their cars.Mr. Pittman said introducing a Taco Bell breakfast menu to commuters when they\u2019re hungry, suggesting they drink Bacardi rum when they get home or pitching a car dealership while they\u2019re stuck in their clunker put those advertisers foremost in a commuter\u2019s mind when they\u2019re most susceptible to persuasion.When 20th Century Fox was preparing to release the Queen biopic \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d this year, iHeartRadio stations used peak commute times to air interviews about the rock band, Mr. Pittman said. On Nov. 1, a day before the film\u2019s release, different versions of the six-minute title song played across all 650 iHeartRadio stations and sites.\u201cThe longer the commute and the more time they\u2019re in the car, the more they\u2019re looking to enjoy the experience in the car or to make it at least more tolerable,\u201d Mr. Pittman said. \u201cWe really try to make the programming that way, and we\u2019re able to bring our advertising partners into it as well.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve seen some amazing ads on my 2 train going back in the morning and coming back in the evening,\u201d Ms. Sarnoff said. \u201cIn this market, I\u2019ve seen advertisers really raise their game, and people\u2019s expectations of what people are going to see when they go into the subway are high.\u201dOutfront Media is rolling out 50,000 digital video boards at subway and rail stations in New York, the Bay Area, Washington and Boston.\u201cBrands like Casper and Seamless have becomes household names by sharing their brand stories with subway riders,\u201d Mr. Male, Outfront\u2019s chief executive, said. \u201cSmart brands like Spotify, StreetEasy and WeWork leverage consumers\u2019 predictable travel paths, frequency and time spent, and in-the-moment-in-time mentality to drive app usage, sales and site visits.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the location of the advertising technology company Intersection.

{"Headline": "France, Not Waiting for European Union, to Tax U.S. Tech Firms as \u201919 Starts", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrance has been working with other countries on a European Union-wide digital tax on companies including Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, but some members of the bloc have balked at the proposal.On Monday, he moved up that date.\u201cThe tax will be introduced no matter what on Jan. 1, and it will be for the whole of 2019,\u201d Mr. Le Maire said. A week ago, he urged the public to \u201cfight with me\u201d on the issue in an interview on French radio, during which he said, \u201cIt\u2019s time for these companies to pay the taxes that they owe.\u201dThe tax, Mr. Le Maire said, would most likely cover not only the companies\u2019 direct sales in France, but also revenue from online marketplaces and the resale of private data. He declined to discuss other details, including the means for introducing the tax or the rate of taxation.France\u2019s decision to go its own way for now did not appear to derail the European Commission\u2019s proposal.A commission spokesman noted in a statement that \u201cabout a dozen E.U. countries already have or are considering a form of taxation of digital activities.\u201dThose countries include Britain, where officials recently unveiled a proposal to impose a 2 percent tax on revenue that social media platforms, search engines and online marketplaces earn there. Spain is introducing its own 3 percent tax on online advertising services, brokering services and the resale of personal data.But, the commission spokesman noted, \u201cthe announcement by France does make it even more urgent for the E.U. to agree on a common digital services tax.\u201dMr. Le Maire said he still hoped that a union-wide agreement could be reached by March.Amazon, Apple and Twitter declined to comment. Facebook and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment, although the director general of Google France told reporters this month, \u201cGoogle will pay if a tax on revenue is put in place\u201d in France or in the European Union.Large technology companies have long avoided paying taxes comparable to other businesses in the European countries where they operate.Facebook, for instance, paid corporate taxes of \u20ac1.9 million in 2017 in France on stated revenue of \u20ac55.9 million. The company has more than 34 million users in the country, and much of its revenue was logged in Ireland. Apple paid around \u20ac19 million in 2017 taxes in France.Amazon, too, does business across the union, but has benefited by having its regional headquarters in the low-tax haven of Luxembourg. The European Commission estimates that the online retailer and other companies pay an average effective tax rate of just 9.5 percent, compared with the roughly 23 percent paid by traditional businesses.The big companies are not alone in opposing the commission\u2019s digital tax proposal. European start-ups have said it would handicap an expanding tech sector in the region that has struggled to match the scale of markets in the United States and China.France and Germany responded to such concerns by narrowing the proposal to include only larger technology companies, particularly advertising-focused companies like Facebook and Google. Those changes have not mollified everyone.France\u2019s imposition of a digital tax is one front in a wider campaign in Europe to target American technology companies amid growing concerns about their power and influence in society as well as their business practices.Germany has enacted a law requiring Facebook and Twitter to remove flagged hate speech within 24 hours or face fines. France has passed rules allowing judges to order the removal of misinformation around elections.Regulators at the European Commission have also targeted Google, Apple and Amazon for antitrust violations, imposing billions of euros in fines and orders to return unpaid taxes.The French government sued Google this year for \u20ac1.12 billion in taxes it claims the company avoided paying on advertising revenue earned. A Paris court ruled that the government could not collect because Google had declared that the revenue belonged to an Irish subsidiary. The government is appealing.Amazon reached a settlement in May over a long-running dispute with French tax authorities, who had been seeking nearly \u20ac200 million euros in back taxes, interest and penalties for the 2006 to 2010 fiscal years in relation to \u201cthe allocation of income between foreign jurisdictions.\u201d The government did not disclose the size of the settlement.And last year, the European Union\u2019s commissioner for competition, Margrethe Vestager, ordered Luxembourg to collect around 250 million euros in unpaid taxes from Amazon.Adam Satariano contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Yoda of Silicon Valley", "Date": "2018-12-17", "News": "Profiles in scienceDonald Knuth, master of algorithms, reflects on 50 years of his opus-in-progress, \u201cThe Art of Computer Programming.\u201dSupported byFor half a century, the Stanford computer scientist Donald Knuth, who bears a slight resemblance to Yoda \u2014 albeit standing 6-foot-4 and wearing glasses \u2014 has reigned as the spirit-guide of the algorithmic realm. Here is your book, the one your thousands of letters have asked us to publish. It has taken us years to do, checking and rechecking countless recipes to bring you only the best, only the interesting, only the perfect.Now 80, Dr. Knuth usually dresses like the youthful geek he was when he embarked on this odyssey: long-sleeved T-shirt under a short-sleeved T-shirt, with jeans, at least at this time of year. In those early days, he worked close to the machine, writing \u201cin the raw,\u201d tinkering with the zeros and ones. \u201cKnuth made it clear that the system could actually be understood all the way down to the machine code level,\u201d said Dr. Norvig. Nowadays, of course, with algorithms masterminding (and undermining) our very existence, the average programmer no longer has time to manipulate the binary muck, and works instead with hierarchies of abstraction, layers upon layers of code \u2014 and often with chains of code borrowed from code libraries. But an elite class of engineers occasionally still does the deep dive.\u201cHere at Google, sometimes we just throw stuff together,\u201d Dr. Norvig said, during a meeting of the Google Trips team, in Mountain View, Calif. \u201cBut other times, if you\u2019re serving billions of users, it\u2019s important to do that efficiently. A 10-per-cent improvement in efficiency can work out to billions of dollars, and in order to get that last level of efficiency, you have to understand what\u2019s going on all the way down.\u201d Or, as Andrei Broder, a distinguished scientist at Google and one of Dr. Knuth\u2019s former graduate students, explained during the meeting: \u201cWe want to have some theoretical basis for what we\u2019re doing. We don\u2019t want a frivolous or sloppy or second-rate algorithm. We don\u2019t want some other algorithmist to say, \u2018You guys are morons.\u2019\u201d Dr. Knuth\u2019s exacting standards, literary and otherwise, may explain why his life\u2019s work is nowhere near done. He has a wager with Sergey Brin, the co-founder of Google and a former student (to use the term loosely), over whether Mr. Brin will finish his Ph.D. before Dr. Knuth concludes his opus.During summer vacations, Dr. Knuth made more money than professors earned in a year by writing compilers. A compiler is like a translator, converting a high-level programming language (resembling algebra) to a lower-level one (sometimes arcane binary) and, ideally, improving it in the process. In computer science, \u201coptimization\u201d is truly an art, and this is articulated in another Knuthian proverb: \u201cPremature optimization is the root of all evil.\u201dEventually Dr. Knuth became a compiler himself, inadvertently founding a new field that he came to call the \u201canalysis of algorithms.\u201d A publisher hired him to write a book about compilers, but it evolved into a book collecting everything he knew about how to write for computers \u2014 a book about algorithms. When Dr. Knuth started out, he intended to write a single work. Soon after, computer science underwent its Big Bang, so he reimagined and recast the project in seven volumes. Now he metes out sub-volumes, called fascicles. The next installation, \u201cVolume 4, Fascicle 5,\u201d covering, among other things, \u201cbacktracking\u201d and \u201cdancing links,\u201d was meant to be published in time for Christmas. It is delayed until next April because he keeps finding more and more irresistible problems that he wants to present.In order to optimize his chances of getting to the end, Dr. Knuth has long guarded his time. He retired at 55, restricted his public engagements and quit email (officially, at least). Andrei Broder recalled that time management was his professor\u2019s defining characteristic even in the early 1980s. This decade-long detour took place back in the age when computers were shared among users and ran faster at night while most humans slept. So Dr. Knuth switched day into night, shifted his schedule by 12 hours and mapped his student appointments to Fridays from 8 p.m. to midnight. Dr. Broder recalled, \u201cWhen I told my girlfriend that we can\u2019t do anything Friday night because Friday night at 10 I have to meet with my adviser, she thought, \u2018This is something that is so stupid it must be true.\u2019\u201dWhen Knuth chooses to be physically present, however, he is 100-per-cent there in the moment. \u201cIt just makes you happy to be around him,\u201d said Jennifer Chayes, a managing director of Microsoft Research. \u201cHe\u2019s a maximum in the community. If you had an optimization function that was in some way a combination of warmth and depth, Don would be it.\u201dOf course, all the algorithmic rigmarole is also causing real-world problems. Algorithms written by humans \u2014 tackling harder and harder problems, but producing code embedded with bugs and biases \u2014 are troubling enough. More worrisome, perhaps, are the algorithms that are not written by humans, algorithms written by the machine, as it learns. All the more so if you\u2019re an algorithm versed in Knuth. \u201cToday, programmers use stuff that Knuth, and others, have done as components of their algorithms, and then they combine that together with all the other stuff they need,\u201d said Google\u2019s Dr. Norvig. \u201cWith A.I., we have the same thing. It\u2019s just that the combining-together part will be done automatically, based on the data, rather than based on a programmer\u2019s work. You want A.I. to be able to combine components to get a good answer based on the data. But you have to decide what those components are. It could happen that each component is a page or chapter out of Knuth, because that\u2019s the best possible way to do some task.\u201dLucky, then, Dr. Knuth keeps at it. He figures it will take another 25 years to finish \u201cThe Art of Computer Programming,\u201d although that time frame has been a constant since about 1980. Might the algorithm-writing algorithms get their own chapter, or maybe a page in the epilogue? \u201cDefinitely not,\u201d said Dr. Knuth.\u201cI am worried that algorithms are getting too prominent in the world,\u201d he added. \u201cIt started out that computer scientists were worried nobody was listening to us. Now I\u2019m worried that too many people are listening.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Did I Deserve It?", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byColumbia students didn\u2019t like my joke and they had the right to cut my mic. But we all should have gotten the chance to stick it out. Mr. Patel is a comedian.I\u2019ve experienced a lot of strange things while performing comedy: Rosario Dawson made fun of me while I was bombing in front of hundreds of Bernie Sanders fans. I once had to tell the crowd mid-show that the venue was closing for an impromptu health inspection. On Nov. 30, I performed stand-up as part of an annual event put on by the Asian-American Alliance at Columbia, and about 20 minutes into the show, my microphone was cut off.It wasn\u2019t because of some fire code violation, or because some violently drunk heckler and I were about to fistfight. It was because three student organizers came onstage and politely told me they were going in a different direction with the next 30 minutes of my remaining time after deciding my material was offensive.This was the joke that prompted their decision, slightly paraphrased:The joke bombed \u2014 total silence in the crowd of several hundred students \u2014 but I didn\u2019t think anything was abnormal. I wrote the joke about six years ago, and it may be hacky at this point, but I certainly don\u2019t see it as anti-anyone. While comedians can and do tailor sets for audiences \u2014 you don\u2019t do blue jokes in a room full of nuns kind of thing \u2014 for the most part you learn what works with a crowd only when it works or doesn\u2019t. This particular joke has worked at New York clubs full of gay people, black people and college students multiple times. I didn\u2019t think twice about using it in a room full of smart, progressive young adults.I carried on and went back to getting some laughs. Five minutes later, I was asked to leave.If I could afford not to perform at colleges again, I would have stopped thinking there.But I\u2019ve kept thinking about it. The student organizers were within their rights to pull me offstage; people are just as within their rights to be offended by anything, as comedians are within their rights to say anything. I believe the student leaders were wrong to cut my mic, but as a person, I cannot control how people think and how they react.I do think how people process and react has been broken. People aren\u2019t worse \u2014 the way we consume things is. It is much easier to be offended these days. On social media and with a 24-hour news cycle, we are bombarded with noise all the time, so much so it is hard to sift through and find the signal and find what is really being said. Getting the signal becomes a matter of creating shortcuts. That\u2019s why trigger warnings exist. It\u2019s when those shortcuts prevent you from listening and determining what is actually being said that they have failed you.Do I think that students missed out because I didn\u2019t finish my set? Of course I do \u2014 it\u2019s my material. Do I think maybe I would have gotten to stay if I hadn\u2019t told that joke? I don\u2019t know. The rest of my set was just me yelling, \u201cColumbia rules, Dartmouth drools!\u201dWhen you silence someone you don\u2019t agree with or find offensive, not only do you implement the tactic used by the people you disdain; you also do yourself the disservice of missing out on a potentially meaningful conversation. You cannot affect change if you are not challenged.I don\u2019t think college students and young people are \u201csoft,\u201d though. This is the generation that got a million people to march for gun control this year and somehow got my Indian-immigrant dad to recycle. You have no idea how tough you have to be to persuade a guy named Sanjay to separate plastic and glass.I have to be an optimist when it comes to considering this next generation because to be pessimistic is to think the world is ending and that we should all walk into the ever-rising plastic-filled ocean.After I was forced offstage, something unexpected happened: Notes of support flooded in. Students apologized via email and via Instagram DM. They told me: We\u2019re not all sensitive people; we can take jokes; you shouldn\u2019t have been pulled offstage, that was wrong. Three Columbia students even came to my next show to apologize in person.I was grateful. They helped me see that when older people call students today oversensitive, we do the same thing that we accuse the college students of doing \u2014 jumping to a predetermined conclusion based on the action of a small group. I\u2019ve been talking about this onstage since the night it happened, and I\u2019ve realized that this generalization about college students is not unlike racists thinking every brown person is a terrorist, or people thinking that every orange-faced, yellow-haired person is a lying idiot. Most brown people have yet to blow anything up, and most orange-faced yellow-haired people are decent Floridians.Unfortunately, the small group controls the bullhorn. I\u2019ve done shows at colleges all over the country \u2014 Alaska, Ohio, Maryland and Texas in the past year or so. They\u2019ve all been great and receptive of material that I consider more challenging than anything I did at Columbia.I do not think we should let the actions of a small group \u2014 actions that get blown out of proportion because they feed a narrative many people want to hear \u2014 paint college campuses as bad places to perform and paint this next generation as doomed. That\u2019s a scary and incorrect way to look at the world. And I\u2019m not Jerry Seinfeld. I can\u2019t afford to do that.Nimesh Patel is a stand-up comedian.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Threat in the White House", "Date": "2018-12-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith the impetuous decisions that drove Jim Mattis into retirement, President Trump does more to undermine American national security than any foreign adversary.Ms. Rice is a former national security adviser and a contributing opinion writer.This country\u2019s national security decision-making process is more broken than at any time since the National Security Act became law in 1947. Nothing illustrates this dangerous dysfunction more starkly than President Trump\u2019s reckless, unilateral decisions to announce the sudden withdrawal of all 2,000 United States troops from Syria and to remove 7,000 from Afghanistan.In a stunning tweet Wednesday, Mr. Trump declared the Islamic State defeated and promised the rapid return of all United States forces from Syria. In fact, the Islamic State is not defeated, though it is greatly weakened. The Pentagon estimates that 2,000 to 2,500 fighters continue to control territory in southeastern Syria, while tens of thousands more remain throughout Syria and Iraq. Although many militants have melted back into the population, they can re-emerge, as we saw after the American withdrawal from Iraq in 2011. Stabilizing the areas liberated from the Islamic State to prevent its revival remains as important as ever.Cutting and running from Syria benefits only militants, Turkey, President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, Russia and Iran. We are abandoning our Kurdish partners, leaving them vulnerable to Turkey\u2019s offensive, after they did the hard work of undermining the Islamic State. We are walking away from our British and French allies that deployed forces on the battlefield, and from the coalition of over 70 countries we painstakingly built to counter the Islamic State \u2014 without even the courtesy of consultation. We are leaving Israel alone to confront Iran and Hezbollah\u2019s hostility, while relinquishing our remaining influence over the future of a fractured Syria.If our national security decision-making process were even minimally functional, there would have been a carefully devised plan to execute moves, including wrongheaded ones. The plan would have included strategies for mitigating risks to our partners on the battlefield and to friendly governments; advance consultations with allies; briefings of Congress; and a press strategy.Instead, two factors combined to ensure the collapse of the decision-making apparatus.First, it appears that the national security adviser, John Bolton, rarely convenes his cabinet colleagues, known as the principals committee, to review the toughest issues. Instead, key players are cut out, as reportedly the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was from the final, fateful meeting on Syria. Mr. Bolton has not named a replacement deputy national security adviser, leaving vacant a crucial position whose holder typically coordinates the national security agencies in drafting and carrying out policy.Mr. Bolton has also taken over direct responsibility for managing everything from cyber and terrorist attacks to hurricanes and pandemics \u2014 tasks previously assigned to another top-level White House official. Mr. Bolton is also traveling abroad more than most of his predecessors, even as he is playing multiple all-consuming roles. These ill-advised choices alone would cripple national security decision-making.But a second factor \u2014 Mr. Trump himself \u2014 has dealt the death blow to effective policymaking. The president couldn\u2019t care less about facts, intelligence, military analysis or the national interest. He refuses to take seriously the views of his advisers, announces decisions on impulse and disregards the consequences of his actions. In abandoning the role of a responsible commander in chief, Mr. Trump today does more to undermine American national security than any foreign adversary. Yet no Republican in Congress is willing to do more than bleat or tweet concerns.Against this backdrop, Mr. Mattis\u2019s resignation is even more worrisome. Even though his record was mixed, he provided desperately needed reassurance to our allies, an unabashed if private counterweight to the president\u2019s worse instincts, and experience and stature too great for Mr. Bolton to ignore. His departure will leave the administration all but devoid of wise, principled leadership and the guts to check a president who consistently places politics and self-interest above national security. No one relishes keeping American service members in harm\u2019s way. American troops should not remain indefinitely in Syria or Afghanistan. Our deployment of forces, strategy and objectives should be continuously evaluated, and decisions based on conditions on the ground and our broader interests. That is what the National Security Council decision-making process is supposed to do. When it is discarded, the security of the nation and our allies is the first to suffer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Narrower Skulls, Oblong Brains: How Neanderthal DNA Still Shapes Us", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bymatterTwo genes inherited from our evolutionary cousins may affect skull shape and brain size even today. What that means for human behavior is a mystery. People who sign up for genetic testing from companies like 23andMe can find out how much of their DNA comes from Neanderthals. For those whose ancestry lies outside Africa, that number usually falls somewhere between 1 percent and 2 percent.\u201cThis study is surely a milestone,\u201d said Emiliano Bruner, a paleoanthropologist researcher at Spain\u2019s National Research Center on Human Evolution, who was not involved in the research.Neanderthals and modern humans are evolutionary cousins whose ancestors diverged about 530,000 years ago, possibly somewhere in Africa. Neanderthals left Africa long before modern humans, and their bones were found across Europe, the Near East, and even Siberia.Before they disappeared about 40,000 years ago, Neanderthals left behind signs of sophistication: spears used to hunt big game, for instance, and jewelry made of shells and eagle talons. Yet scientists still wonder just how much like us these cousins were. Did they speak a full-blown language? Did they think in symbols?One thing is clear: They were not short on brains. By measuring the volume inside Neanderthal skulls, researchers have found that their brains were as big as ours, on average, perhaps bigger.But their brains did not mimic ours. \u201cWe have roundish brains,\u201d said Philipp Gunz, a paleoanthropologist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. \u201cAll other human species have elongated brain cases.\u201dDr. Gunz and his colleagues study CT scans of fossil skulls to track brain evolution. As it turns out, the oldest skulls of modern humans, dating back 300,000 years, held elongated brains \u2014 more like those of Neanderthals than our own.But there\u2019s a gap in the fossil record after that period; the next oldest skulls that Dr. Gunz and his colleagues have studied are just 36,000 years old. These have the distinctive roundedness of living humans.Modern human skulls got rounder because certain regions of the brain changed size. At the back of the brain, for example, a part called the cerebellum dramatically expanded.As they left Africa, modern humans encountered and mated with Neanderthals, producing healthy children who inherited a set of chromosomes from each parent. Neanderthal DNA has persisted through the generations in people of non-African descent.Did Neanderthal genes affect the shape of modern human brains? The effect of any one gene would be exquisitely subtle, and so Dr. Gunz and his colleagues needed to compare a lot of brains to find it.Fortunately, a number of scientific teams had already begun building databases of brain scans and DNA from volunteers.Dr. Gunz\u2019s team studied 4,468 people in the Netherlands and Germany. They searched the DNA of the volunteers for over 50,000 common genetic markers inherited from ancient Neanderthals.Then the researchers compared the shapes of people\u2019s brains to see whether any Neanderthal gene variants were associated. Two genetic markers jumped out: People who carry them have unusual patterns of gene activity in their brains.One marker is linked to a gene called PHLPP1. It\u2019s unusually active in the cerebellum of people who carry the Neanderthal version. This gene controls the production of an insulating sleeve that wraps around neurons. Known as myelin, it is crucial for long-range communication in the brain.The other marker is linked to a gene called UBR4, which in carriers is less active in a region deep in the brain called the putamen. UBR4 helps neurons divide in the brains of children.These findings suggest that PHLPP1 and UBR4 evolved to work differently in modern human brains. The modern human version of PHLPP1 may have produced extra myelin in the cerebellum. And our version of UBR4 may have made neurons grow faster in the putamen.Why these changes? Simon Fisher, a co-author of the new study at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in the Netherlands, speculated that modern humans evolved more sophisticated powers of language. They may have also become better at making tools.\u201cThings like tool use and speech articulation are hugely dependent on motor circuitry,\u201d said Dr. Fisher. Both require the brain to send fast, precise commands to muscles. And it may be no coincidence that the cerebellum and putamen are crucial parts of our motor circuitry \u2014 the very regions that helped change the overall shape of the modern human brain.What does this research mean for people who carry the Neanderthal versions of these brain-shaping genes? There are limits to what genetics can tell us, said John Anthony Capra, an evolutionary biologist at Vanderbilt University who was not involved in the study. It\u2019s very hard to predict people\u2019s behavior from their genes, he noted \u2014 let alone try to account for a few Neanderthal genes. To learn what they are doing in the brain will require that scientists discern very faint signals amid the noise of the human genome.\u201cThat\u2019s a long way off, if ever possible,\u201d Dr. Capra said.Advertisement"}

Opinion ColumnistI have this feeling that the 2020 presidential election in the United States will be unlike any in my lifetime \u2014 and not only because it will likely involve Donald Trump running as an incumbent \u2014 he alone is a one-man, three-ring circus \u2014 but also because the huge issue that should have been the focus of the 2016 election will be unavoidable by 2020. That is: How do we govern the \u201cNext America\u2019\u2019?\u201cYou know William Gibson\u2019s line, \u2018The future is already here, it\u2019s just not evenly distributed\u2019? Well, the future is here, and now it\u2019s starting to really get distributed. This is the Next America. But our institutions and political parties have not adapted to it,\u2019\u2019 Gautam Mukunda, a Harvard Kennedy School Research Fellow and the author of \u201cIndispensable: When Leaders Really Matter,\u2019\u2019 remarked in an interview. By 2020, it will be impossible to ignore the Next America. \u201cThe basic premises of how the economy works have shifted under our feet and the government will have to respond.\u2019\u2019This Next America will raise a whole web of new intertwined policy, legal, moral, ethical and privacy issues because of changes in technology, demographics, the environment and globalization that are reaching critical mass.Where do I start? A good place is with 5G \u2014 fifth-generation wireless systems. With the two telecom giants Verizon and AT&T now beginning to deploy 5G technology across the country, the metabolism of business, entertainment, education and health care will dramatically accelerate in the Next America, beginning around \u2026 2020.Getting the most from artificial intelligence and machine learning \u2014 like deploying self-driving vehicles \u2014 requires quickly transmitting massive amounts of data with very low latency. We will have that capacity in the Next America. With 5G, a Hollywood movie that now takes six or seven minutes to download onto your iPad will take six or seven seconds and microsensors in your shirt will gather intelligence and broadcast vital signs to your doctor.As AT&T notes in one of its 5G ads, \u201cThink of this as the next frontier in untethering, giving you the ability to take the ultrafast experience you have in your home or business with you virtually anywhere.\u2019\u2019It could be as revolutionary as the internet. But it will require all kinds of new regulations to govern applications from self-driving cars to drone delivery systems to robots that will work as security guards and home health aides.An Associated Press report on Monday said that the government estimated there were currently \u201cabout 110,000 commercial drones operating in U. S. airspace, and the number is expected to soar to about 450,000 in 2022.\u2019\u2019But in fact, in the Next America, argues McGowan, the right model will be \u201ccontinuous lifelong learning\u2019\u2019 \u2014 because when the pace of change is accelerating, \u201cthe fastest-growing companies and most resilient workers will be those who learn faster than their competition.\u201dThat means that in addition to our traditional big safety nets \u2014 Social Security and Medicare \u2014 we will need new national trampolines.We will need to make some level of postsecondary education free to every American who meets a minimum grade and attendance requirement, so that every adult and every high school graduate can earn an associate degree or technical certificate free of tuition at a community college at any time.Tennessee has already done that.These same technological transformations mean the Next America will require changes in antitrust policy. Since the 1980s, antitrust policy judged if a company was getting too big largely by one question: Was the loss of competition hurting consumers through higher prices or fewer services?\u201cBut that definition is increasingly irrelevant in an age in which the most powerful companies in the world offer products and services for \u2018free\u2019 in exchange for personal data,\u201d Rana Foroohar, the Financial Times technology columnist, noted in a June 24 essay. \u201cThis has provoked calls for a return to the definition of monopoly in the 1890 Sherman Antitrust Act, which emphasizes the need to ensure that the economic power of large companies does not result in the corruption of the political process.\u2019\u2019Just one person \u2014 Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 controls Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram. The fact that he has shown himself to be much more interested in scaling his platforms than combating those who abused them for political and economic gain \u2014 and that his lieutenants were ready to go after their high-profile critics, like George Soros \u2014 should make breaking up or regulating Facebook a front-and-center issue in 2020. But just the raw political weight of behemoths like Facebook, Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Apple needs a closer look.Alas, though, the fiscal tools we need to build the Next America have been weakened by President Trump\u2019s tax cuts. The federal deficit was not supposed to hit $1 trillion until 2020, but the White House now says it will hit that number in 2019. We\u2019ve had deficits this size in response to the 2008 financial crisis, but we\u2019ve never run one so huge during a boom.That means the Next America may have to be built in the face of higher interest rates on more debt, with less fiscal ammunition to stimulate the economy should it slow down or face a crisis. So the Next America may very likely have to raise taxes or trim military spending, or Social Security or Medicare \u2014 just when all the baby boomers are retiring.In sum, the Next America requires addressing each of those issues, and many more \u2014 from climate change to zoning rules \u2014 and how they interact. So the next election must too. The craziness around Trump has delayed much of this discussion. But 2020 won\u2019t let us do that again. The Next America won\u2019t wait.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Data Scandals Stoke Criticism That a Privacy Watchdog Too Rarely Bites", "Date": "2018-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLawmakers, consumer advocates and even former commission officials were clamoring for tough action against Facebook, arguing that it had violated an earlier F.T.C. consent decree barring it from misleading users about how their information was shared.But the enforcement official, James A. Kohm, took a different view. In a previously undisclosed memo in March, Mr. Kohm \u2014 echoing Facebook\u2019s own argument \u2014 cautioned that Facebook was not responsible for the consulting firm\u2019s reported abuses. The social network seemed to have taken reasonable steps to address the problem, he wrote, according to someone who read the memo, and most likely had not broken its promises to the F.T.C.Almost alone among industrialized nations, the United States has no basic consumer privacy law. The F.T.C. serves as the country\u2019s de facto privacy regulator, relying on more limited rules against deceptive trade practices to investigate Google, Twitter and other tech firms accused of misleading people about how their information is used.But many in Washington view the agency as a watchdog that too rarely bites. In more than 40 interviews, former and current F.T.C. officials, lawmakers, Capitol Hill staff members, and consumer advocates said that as evidence of abuses has piled up against tech companies, the F.T.C. has been too cautious. Now, as the Trump administration and Congress debate whether to expand the agency and its authority over privacy violations, the Facebook inquiry looms as a referendum on the F.T.C.\u2019s future.\u201cThey have been asleep at the switch,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut Democrat and ranking member of the subcommittee charged with overseeing the agency. \u201cIt\u2019s a lack of will even more than paucity of resources.\u201dThe agency \u2014 overseen by five commissioners, three of them typically from the president\u2019s party \u2014 is habitually tight-lipped. Joseph J. Simons, the chairman, declined to comment on the Kohm memo.\u201cIf the F.T.C. had reached a conclusion that there was no case, we would have announced it,\u201d Mr. Simons said in a statement. \u201cOur investigation continues and when it is finished, you can be sure that the result of that investigation will be made public.\u201dThe agency\u2019s defenders said it had taken significant action against tech companies in recent years. Consumer advocacy groups, they said, sometimes want the F.T.C. to take on cases that its relatively narrow powers will not permit.As the federal government\u2019s main consumer protection and antitrust authority, the F.T.C. has pursued carmakers, drug companies, illegal robo-callers and bloggers who fail to disclose corporate sponsors.But it is hampered by its relatively small size \u2014 about 1,100 employees, roughly a quarter the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission \u2014 and broad mandate. Guarding consumer privacy online, just one part of its mission, can raise complex technical issues. The agency\u2019s enforcement arm, led by Mr. Kohm, doesn\u2019t have its own tech experts, instead borrowing them from other agency units. The job of chief technologist, an adviser to the F.T.C. chairman, has been vacant since April. And its lawyers are outnumbered by the armies of attorneys employed by tech giants.\u201cThey have considerably less staff than they had in the 1980s, and more responsibility,\u201d said Justin Brookman, a former F.T.C. official under the Obama administration who now works at the Consumers Union.F.T.C. officials said privacy and data security cases had gotten more attention than any others over the last decade.Still, all five commissioners agreed at the November Senate hearing that the agency needed more money and greater regulatory authority to keep up with big tech.Critics said a greater problem was cultural. The F.T.C. is haunted, for example, by a clash with Congress in the 1980s over an attempt by the agency to ban television ads for junk food directed at children, known as \u201cKidVid.\u201d Lawmakers pulled funding and severely weakened the F.T.C.\u2019s power to issue new regulations.Even today, \u201cin just about every meeting I have at the F.T.C., staff mention KidVid,\u201d said Josh Golin, the executive director of Campaign for a Commercial Free Childhood, which has filed complaints against YouTube and Facebook.Fears that Congress could again cripple the F.T.C. have made some career lawyers reluctant to take on politically sensitive cases, according to current and former employees, speaking about their experiences during the Trump and Obama administrations.\u201cThey think of themselves as deal-makers, not cops,\u201d said Matt Stoller, policy director at the Open Markets Institute, who has called for big tech platforms to be broken up and regulated. \u201cThey have an institutional culture of deference.\u201dNor did the F.T.C. penalize Facebook after it began acquiring phone numbers and other data from users of its WhatsApp subsidiary, breaking promises it had made when it acquired the messaging service. By contrast, the European Union\u2019s antitrust chief fined Facebook $122 million last year for making misleading statements about the WhatsApp acquisition.(The social network said it had notified users of the change with new terms of service and allowed them to opt out of aspects of how Facebook used the data.)Former officials say the agency struggles to enforce privacy within its traditional definition of deceptive or abusive business practices.Ashkan Soltani, who was the F.T.C.\u2019s chief technologist from 2014 to 2015, said he raised concerns about a location-tracking company, Nomi Technologies, that collected data on people without their explicit consent. He recalled resistance from Republican commissioners and from some staff members who didn\u2019t see a clear consumer harm, since Nomi\u2019s data could not identify specific individuals.Ms. Ohlhausen\u2019s staff told enforcement officials to slow down on cases, so the White House would not view her as anti-business, according to a former senior official. That official and others interviewed for this article spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe conversations that were private or involved nonpublic F.T.C. investigations.With limited resources, she said, the F.T.C. should \u201cpursue cases where the evidence of actual or likely consumer harms is strongest.\u201dBut that standard is difficult to apply against companies like Facebook and Google, whose services are free, and where it is challenging to prove that privacy lapses cause direct financial or emotional harm.Two former staffers said Mr. Kohm, who has led the enforcement division for more than a decade, had expressed skepticism about proving harm in cases against tech companies.In recent months, F.T.C. employees meeting with Mr. Kohm asked how he viewed news reports that big tech firms had tracked users\u2019 locations without clearly disclosing the practice. Mr. Kohm, whose division prosecutes boiler rooms, advertising scams, and other financial fraud schemes, responded that the tech companies were legitimate businesses offering free services, and it was unclear how they had harmed consumers, recalled one person in the meeting.Mr. Kohm declined to comment for this article. Cathy MacFarlane, an F.T.C. spokeswoman, denied in a statement that he placed a lower priority on privacy cases, saying Mr. Kohm \u201chas dedicated his career to enforcing the orders the commission obtains, not setting his own agenda.\u201dMichael LaForgia contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

After years of vicious, personal and dubious attacks spread through vast social media networks, the guilt-by-association and guilty-until-proven-innocent ethos of Italy\u2019s populists now seems to endanger one of its most prominent leaders.Late last month, the Italian news program \u201cLe Iene,\u201d or \u201cReservoir Dogs,\u201d began a series of reports that featured former employees of Mr. Di Maio\u2019s father, Antonio, recounting how they were paid partly off the books or were pressured not to report work injuries. The latest program, which aired Sunday, showed how Antonio Di Maio also appeared to have illegally built on his property outside Pomigliano D\u2019Arco, the small town where Mr. Di Maio lived with his parents until leaving for Rome to join parliament.When confronted with before-and-after aerial pictures of his father\u2019s property, the populist leader suggested the buildings were always there, just previously camouflaged. He dismissed another apparently illegal structure as a simple stable. But the reporter, who subsequently received death threats from Five Star supporters on social media, produced photos showing Mr. Di Maio and his friends at a 2013 party relaxing in a pool on the property and hanging out in the supposed stall\u2019s kitchen.As local authorities have investigated the buildings, which they want to demolish, Mr. Di Maio has acknowledged that \u201cmy father made mistakes in his life.\u201d He also added that \u201cfor years I didn\u2019t even speak with him\u201d and said that \u201cI distance myself from this behavior, but he is still my father.\u201dBut Mr. Di Maio has come under pressure.On Monday, the elder Di Maio, who dabbled in post-fascist politics, posted a painful video on his Facebook page that was subsequently spread across Five Star social media.In the video, the elder Mr. Di Maio, sitting at a desk with a fax machine, calculator and yellow Post-it Notes, woodenly reads a statement in which he begs forgiveness and describes himself as a small-business man who, \u201clike every father,\u201d did what he could to provide for his family.\u201cI\u2019m sorry for my son Luigi, who they are trying to attack,\u201d he says, insisting his son knew nothing of his misdeeds and praising his \u201chonesty, transparency and courage.\u201d He demands that critics \u201cleave my family alone\u201d but argues that he had no choice but to hire workers off the books.He signs off by apologizing, again, to his son and saying, \u201cAs a father, I can only encourage him to go ahead, not because he is my son, but because I believe he is doing good for this country, against everyone and everything.\u201dFor years, \u201ceveryone\u201d included relatives of the younger Di Maio\u2019s political enemies.Before Five Star came to power, its main target was Matteo Renzi of the Democratic Party, a former prime minister. Mr. Di Maio and the party\u2019s army of online supporters seized on investigations into his father\u2019s alleged influence-peddling as an example of the corrupt politics they promised to replace.But Italian judges in October shelved a case against Mr. Renzi\u2019s father, Tiziano, and fined Il Fatto Quotidiano, an Italian newspaper supportive of the Five Star Movement, for defaming him.\u201cI\u2019m convinced that the sins of the father should not be visited upon the sons,\u201d Mr. Renzi wrote on Facebook after the program about Mr. Di Maio\u2019s father aired. \u201cThis is something I have always said, unlike Di Maio, who understands it only now.\u201dHe went on to lament Five Star\u2019s \u201ccampaign of hate\u201d against his father, who, he wrote, has become reluctant to leave the house and worries about what his grandchildren hear about him. Mr. Renzi\u2019s father recently wrote on Facebook that if he had done what Mr. Di Maio\u2019s father had, Five Star \u201cwould already have launched an appeal on social networks for the return of the death penalty.\u201d(This week, La Verit\u00e0, another newspaper close to the populist government, alleged new improprieties, prompting Tiziano Renzi to deny that he and his son paid paperboys off the books when they operated a paper route decades ago in Florence.)After the allegations against Mr. Di Maio\u2019s father emerged, Ms. Boschi spoke straight to camera in a video posted on Twitter.\u201cI\u2019d like to look in the face Mr. Antonio Di Maio, the father of Luigi, and say I hope that he does not go through what his son and his friends put my father and my family through,\u201d she said.On Nov. 27, Mr. Di Maio faced off on television with la Repubblica\u2019s editor, Mario Calabresi, who pointed out that a lawsuit Five Star had filed against him was mistakenly addressed to his father, Luigi, a police official assassinated by left-wing terrorists in 1972, when the editor was two years old.As Five Star\u2019s popularity has slipped, political observers have begun wondering when the party, or Mr. Casaleggio, might pull the plug on Mr. Di Maio. Waiting in the wings, they say, is Alessandro Di Battista, a charismatic politician who has written a book with the subtitle, \u201ca letter to my son on the courage to change.\u201dBut if Mr. Di Battista steps onto center stage, it is likely he will also bring baggage. His father, Vittorio, kept a bust of Mussolini in his foyer and has proudly proclaimed, \u201cI\u2019m a fascist!\u201dInterior Minister Matteo Salvini, the leader of the hard right League party, seems to be enjoying Five Star\u2019s episode of \u201cFamily Feud.\u201d He shares power with Mr. Di Maio, but his support is increasing as Mr. Di Maio\u2019s fades.\u201cI am happy my father is a quiet pensioner,\u201d he said last week, \u201cwho at most volunteers in the local parish or plays bridge.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How a Crackdown on MS-13 Caught Up Innocent High School Students", "Date": "2018-12-27", "News": "FeatureThe Trump administration went after gang members \u2014 and instead destroyed the American dreams of immigrant teenagers around the country.Supported byThis article is a collaboration between The Times and ProPublica, the independent nonprofit investigative-journalism organization.Classmates came up to greet him. At 19, Alex was older than many of the other sophomores. He enrolled as a freshman when he arrived in Suffolk County on Long Island from Honduras a year and a half before. He felt good in the school from the start. A shy teenager who preferred video games and watching soccer on TV to playing it on the field, he had always been an outsider, slow to make friends. But all the immigrants in the bilingual program were outsiders, so he fit in, and he was popular for the first time in his life. In Honduras, it had felt as if teachers were preparing students to work in the fields, like everyone else. Here, in Huntington, they were always telling him that with a good education, he could do anything he wanted. The halls were decorated with inspirational posters of Latino students attending college and completing ambitious projects mixed in with images of a scowling blue devil with horns, the school\u2019s mascot.While the other students laughed and shouted in the hall, Alex (his middle name) went to his desk. He was nervous about the Regents math test. He loved all his classes but algebra. In language arts, he was learning to write essays and reading historical fiction about young people who immigrated to the United States in decades past, and he was hoping to get an A. But in algebra, he was falling behind. Now he struggled through questions that required him to calculate the diminishing earnings of a carnival-booth owner and reverse-engineer parabolas. He was relieved when the teacher called pencils down. He was sure he had gotten a lot of answers wrong, but he had two more years to pass the test before graduation.Alex sometimes lingered in the halls, but today he wanted to leave as soon as possible. A month before, he got in trouble in school for the first time, for doodling in math class. He was shocked and confused when the principal accused him of drawing gang signs and suspended him for three days. His parents assured him it was just a small setback and would be forgotten over the summer, but still, Alex was worried. Although he was in the United States legally, seeking asylum from gang persecution, his status was tenuous. The government can revoke the provisional freedom it gives to minors seeking asylum if they do something to indicate they are a danger to the community. So he had been careful to stay away from anyone who might be connected with gangs, and he had never come in contact with the police, aside from a brief chat in the cafeteria with the officer assigned to the school.Alex rode his bike the 10 minutes home. He liked to look at the big houses as he pedaled, with their lush lawns that his father and other immigrant landscapers kept immaculate. He crossed a set of train tracks that divided the older, more affluent part of Huntington from the newer part where many immigrant families lived. Alex usually rode home with a neighbor, but his friend had recently stopped going to school because he did not feel safe there. A few weeks earlier, a classmate was arrested by United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement and never came back to school. He seemed like a rule-follower, but the rumor was that he had been accused of being in the street gang MS-13. Soon after, another student was detained on his way to church. Alex figured there must be something he didn\u2019t know about them \u2014 maybe they really had done bad things. He had heard about gang killings in some other Suffolk County towns, but it all felt very far away. In a year and a half at Huntington High, he never even saw a shoving match in the halls.He unlatched the gate to the building where his family lived and left his bike unlocked on the lawn as he always did. Then he changed into a pair of gym shorts and settled in to enjoy a rare afternoon alone in the three-room basement apartment, with the TV, PlayStation and fridge full of food all to himself. His brother, who was a year younger, was still at school, and his parents were at work. If he had turned on the news, he might have learned about an initiative in New York, announced that day, called Operation Matador; ICE was partnering with police departments and officers in schools to target and detain Latino immigrants suspected of gang ties. Instead, Alex sprawled out in his room and texted a girl he had a crush on. \u201cHow did the exam go for you??\u201d he wrote, following up with heart emojis. Then he heard a soft knock. He emerged from his bedroom and, through a window in the door, saw a group of men wearing bulletproof vests.He ran back into his room and lay on the bed, holding his breath. He hoped the men would go away if they thought no one was home, but a half-hour passed, and he could still hear their muffled voices and steps. He told himself there was no reason to be afraid \u2014 his immigration case was moving forward, and he hadn\u2019t committed any crime. So he put on flip-flops and went outside. One of the men asked his name and told him they had a warrant for his arrest. He was too stunned to protest as they cuffed his hands behind his back, loaded him into an S.U.V. and drove off, with a second car in front and a third behind. A neighbor watched between the curtains as the convoy disappeared. She called his parents. They rushed home and found his keys, wallet and cellphone laid out neatly on the kitchen table.Sessions\u2019s visit was part of a continuing rhetorical war that President Trump began on the campaign trail and continued in his early months in the White House. Trump invoked the image of MS-13 gang members \u201cinfesting\u201d the country, with unnamed towns begging to be \u201cliberated,\u201d to argue for restricting immigration and tightening the rules on asylum.MS-13 was founded in Los Angeles in the 1980s by Salvadoran immigrants fleeing civil war. During a wave of deportations in the 1990s, it spread back to El Salvador and Honduras, helping to make them two of the most violent countries in the world. The gang\u2019s symbols include devil horns and the country calling codes of El Salvador and Honduras (503 and 504). In the United States, MS-13 has an estimated 10,000 members \u2014 a number that has remained stable for more than a decade. They are a mix of immigrant and American-born Latinos, based primarily in a handful of suburbs with high concentrations of Central American immigrants outside Washington, Boston, Houston, Los Angeles and New York. MS-13 accounts for less than 1 percent of the country\u2019s gang members and a similarly small share of gang murders.For about two decades, MS-13 has had a presence on Long Island, where in recent years its membership in Suffolk and Nassau Counties has numbered about 900, according to local police departments. That\u2019s less than one-fifth of Long Island\u2019s gang members, who also include Bloods and Crips. The gang is more active in Suffolk County, mostly in Brentwood and the adjoining district Central Islip, which are heavily Latino, and where MS-13 members have periodically taken part in brutal killings. In 2003, in Central Islip, members beat and stabbed to death a young man who they thought was a rival and stuffed his body in a drain pipe. Also in Central Islip, the gang shot a toddler and his mother in 2010 and left their bodies in a patch of woods.In the last few years, Long Island\u2019s MS-13 members and victims have gotten younger. In 2016, MS-13 gang members murdered five Latino Brentwood High students with bats and machetes. In 2017, the gang killed three more local Latino students and left their macheted bodies in a park in Central Islip. Some two dozen young men from Brentwood and Central Islip were eventually charged with the murders. A few were as young as 16.President Trump took office at the peak of this local wave of violence and announced that he was making the gang a federal law-enforcement priority. Trump has \u201ctaken the handcuffs off of law-enforcement officers,\u201d Thomas Homan, who served as the acting director of ICE from January 2017 to June 2018, said in July 2017. Many agents wanted to arrest and deport suspected MS-13 members under President Obama. But they were constrained by an Obama-administration policy that required ICE agents to focus on undocumented immigrants who had committed serious crimes.The sort of criminal investigations into MS-13 that the Obama administration favored take time and on-the-ground work. Immigration agents spend months mapping out networks and gathering evidence using informants and wiretaps. Under the new Trump mandate, ICE opted for a shortcut. Gang affiliation on its own is not a crime, but it can be grounds to detain undocumented immigrants or people legally seeking asylum. ICE began using what are called \u201cadministrative arrests\u201d to pursue known gang members and \u201cgang associates,\u201d who had no criminal records but who, ICE argued, were dangers to the community. To identify them, ICE agents met with police commissioners around the country and asked them to pass on names from databases that they used to track people they believed were involved with gangs.In May 2017, the New York ICE office created Operation Matador to promote information-sharing between police departments and ICE, and to allow immigration agents to go after suspected gang members who had not been charged with crimes. Nationally, some departments have been wary of cooperating with ICE, for fear of scaring away undocumented immigrants who might help in criminal investigations. Philadelphia sealed its gang database from ICE, and Portland, Ore., eliminated its database entirely. But in New York, departments in places like Suffolk County \u2014 which Trump carried in 2016 \u2014 were eager to sign up and began flagging supposed gang members for immigration detention.Under Operation Matador, ICE has arrested 816 people suspected of gang affiliation. About 170, like Alex, came to New York legally as unaccompanied minors, some of whom were also seeking asylum, and several dozen were still minors when they were detained. Roughly a dozen students from Huntington High alone were rounded up. But the evidence behind many of these arrests was unreliable. Police databases are notoriously inconsistent and opaque. People aren\u2019t told if they are listed in a database, and if they don\u2019t actually belong to a gang, it\u2019s virtually impossible to prove it and have their names removed.The local police officers who contribute names to the database rarely speak Spanish and lack training in the intricacies of transnational criminal organizations like MS-13. To become an MS-13 member, recruits have to commit a serious act of violence \u2014 like assaulting a rival gang member \u2014 and endure a group beating. But there is no process to become a \u201cgang associate\u201d \u2014 a classification used only by law enforcement. ICE designates people as gang associates if they meet two out of eight criteria, which include frequenting a known gang hangout (which can be a bus stop or a park), wearing gang colors and displaying symbols.One of the best places for tracking potential gang associates is school. But schools are prohibited by privacy laws from sharing anything beyond the most basic information about students. With Operation Matador, ICE found a way around these protections, by relying on police officers posted inside schools, known as school resource officers. They collect tips and disciplinary information from teachers and administrators and can legally share it with their departments, which can in turn pass it on to immigration agents. Without any legal changes, schools have become the start of a law-enforcement chain that lets ICE agents on transnational-crime task forces peer into hallways and backpacks without ever entering the property.Victor left for the United States in 2010, when Alex was 11, and managed to sneak across the border. He settled in Huntington because he had heard from a Honduran friend who was living there that it was a safe area with a good high school. To imagine where his father was living, Alex watched American sitcoms and a reality-TV show about a family running a pawnshop. His father sent back money for food, clothes and school supplies. But the money made the family a target for MS-13 and its rival gang, Barrio 18. Gang members mugged Alex\u2019s mother twice and killed two of his cousins. They shot his uncle dead and broke all his teeth and smashed each of his fingers. A group of gang members robbed Alex and then harassed him every time he went to the local three-room high school.In 2015, after Alex turned 17, Victor decided it was time to get his son out of danger. He saved and borrowed $4,000 to hire a coyote to bring Alex to the United States-Mexico border. On Dec. 29, 2015, Alex crossed a bridge to a checkpoint and told United States border agents that he feared for his life back home. As an unaccompanied minor, he qualified to stay in the country while his case was processed, which could take years. He was allowed to travel to his father on Long Island. It was his first time on a plane, and he spent the flight glued to the window. When he landed, Victor took him to the basement apartment he was renting in Huntington. It was smaller and darker than the house he built in Honduras, but he had painted the walls a bright yellow to make it feel cheery.Located on Long Island\u2019s northeast shore, known as the Gold Coast, a half-hour drive from where most of the MS-13 violence has occurred, Huntington is an affluent town with one of the lowest crime rates in the state. The downtown has brick sidewalks, old-fashioned street lamps and an art-house movie theater. Retirees play music on the sidewalks. People dress up to stroll past stores that include a tea bar selling matcha lattes for $6.25 a cup, a two-floor used-book store and a gluten-free bakery.Alex didn\u2019t consider waiting for the new school year to enroll in Huntington High. \u201cOf course I started classes right away \u2014 that\u2019s the point of being here,\u201d he told me in one of many conversations over the phone and in person during the last year and a half. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt happy in school.\u201dHuntington\u2019s Latino population has increased more than 70 percent in the last decade, making it one of the rare wealthy areas on Long Island that have a sizable population of recent immigrants. By the time Alex arrived, the high school was almost half Latino. The district runs a bilingual education program in which native English speakers learn alongside Spanish speakers, with instruction in both languages. The program has become so popular that English speakers are now put on a waiting list. A club pairs established immigrant students with recent arrivals to help ease the transition.Huntington High administrators say there has never been any MS-13 presence at the school. Unlike a number of other Long Island high schools, Huntington High says nothing about gang activity on its website; instead it offers guidance on throwing snowballs (\u201cdangerous\u201d) and keeping the hallways clear (\u201cessential\u201d).Alex was relieved to be away from the gangs in Honduras, and he soon stopped looking over his shoulder on the streets of Huntington. His parents had always told him that if he did well in school, he would have a good life. Now his teachers reinforced that message. He managed to finish his first semester with a B average. It was easy to imagine succeeding here. Once immigrant students learned enough English, they transferred into mainstream classes. There were asylum-seekers like him in the marching band, on the varsity soccer team and even in the student government.But the threats and violence continued in Honduras, and that summer, Alex\u2019s mother and younger brother came to Long Island, also making asylum claims. His mother got a job cleaning office buildings, and when the new school year started in 2016, she saw the boys off at 6:30 each morning. After dinner, the whole family sat around the table and talked about their days. Some nights, Alex would connect his phone to the TV, and he and his brother would sit in folding chairs watching English tutorials on YouTube.During his sophomore year, Alex learned to navigate the hallways, and he was tardy only once through the spring. He took home report cards that said he was \u201ca pleasure to teach.\u201d And he had grown close to a group of friends in his homeroom who showed off their Central American pride by dressing in the colors of their home countries\u2019 flags. They tagged themselves in group Facebook photos with the telephone calling codes for their home countries \u2014 503 for El Salvador, 502 for Guatemala and 504 for Honduras. Alex started wearing a bracelet with the blue and white of the Honduran flag. When his parents had extra money, he asked for a T-shirt, sweatshirt or backpack emblazoned with Huntington High\u2019s name and its mascot, the blue devil with horns.Alex knew that MS-13 claimed Nike Cortez shoes and blue bandannas, so he made sure to avoid them. In the spring of 2017, school security guards stopped him as he walked down the hall wearing bright blue sneakers that his mother picked out for him as a gift for accompanying her to an immigration appointment in Queens. They said the blue of the shoes was the color of MS-13. They also searched Alex\u2019s bag, on which he had written \u201c504,\u201d and found that he had doodled the name of his Honduran hometown and a devil with horns. Without explaining why, the security guards photographed the drawings before giving Alex his books back. When Alex got home that day, he buried the shoes in a closet and didn\u2019t wear them again, even on weekends.Shortly after, Alex was eating nachos with his friends in the lunchroom when the school police officer, Andrew Fiorillo, walked up to him. Fiorillo took Alex aside and asked in halting Spanish how he was doing in his classes. He said that if Alex heard anything in school, he could tell him. Then he walked Alex to class and left him at the door. Alex was confused about why Fiorillo talked to him, but he thought he seemed nice.Fiorillo, known as Officer Drew at Huntington High, is in his 40s, tall with thinning hair and a friendly face. He has worked at the school for more than a decade and is widely beloved. The Police Department pays his salary ($166,000 in 2017, including overtime). Fiorillo, who wears his full police uniform each day, told me that he sees himself more as a mentor than as a law-enforcement officer, and that he invites students to talk to him in private if they ever have a problem. Some kids run up to greet him in the halls, but immigrant students tend to keep their distance.A few weeks later, on May 4, 2017, Alex was daydreaming as his algebra teacher introduced yet another indecipherable math operation. Without thinking, he began doodling in pencil on the school calculator he was using. When the bell rang, he handed it back in. That afternoon, security staff pulled Alex out of English class and took him to the office of Brenden Cusack, the principal. When Alex walked in, he saw the calculator on Cusack\u2019s desk. Through a translator, Cusack asked Alex if he had drawn the number 504 on the case, and Alex said he had. Then Cusack produced the security guard\u2019s photos of Alex\u2019s drawing of devil horns and told him that the doodles signified MS-13.Alex told me he would never have written on a wall or desk in this American school, and he knew it was wrong to draw on the school-issued calculator, but he was surprised to be taken to the principal for something he saw as a form of fidgeting. He tried to defend himself; the devil was the school mascot, after all, and 504 was the Honduras country code. \u201cFor the police, it\u2019s a gang thing, but for us, it\u2019s about being proud of your country,\u201d he later told me. To Cusack, Alex\u2019s distinctions didn\u2019t seem to matter. The principal signed an incident report that said Alex had been caught in possession of \u201cgang paraphernalia\u201d and had been \u201cdefacing school property with gang signs.\u201d Alex says that Cusack told him that he would be suspended for three days and that the doodles would be reported to Officer Fiorillo. Though Cusack says that he wouldn\u2019t have told a student about sharing information with law enforcement, Alex remembers him saying: \u201cWe\u2019re working with police to clean up the school.\u201dThe position of school resource officer is a hybrid of conflicting roles: counselor, teacher and cop. \u201cYou have to have a person who can be caring and loving, but on the flip of a switch, turn into a law-enforcement warrior,\u201d says Mac Hardy, a spokesman for the resource officers association. They greet kids each morning and comfort those having hard days, but they are also on constant alert for threats and illegal activity. The association recommends that members receive 40 hours of training, in part to counteract the stereotype of resource officers as more akin to crossing guards than real police officers.Even as their ranks have grown, these officers have been criticized for contributing to what civil rights advocates call the school-to-prison pipeline. School administrators are allowed to talk openly with resource officers and often call them in to interview students directly. And the officers can \u2014 and do \u2014 notify their police superiors about what they learn. Studies by professors at the University of Tennessee and the University of Maryland show that when schools bring in resource officers, arrests for minor infractions tend to rise; federal school data shows that students of color bear the brunt of those school arrests. \u201cThis mix has been detrimental to black and Latino youth, frankly,\u201d Bryan Joffe, director of education at the American Association of School Administrators, says. National school-administration groups have tried to balance these concerns against fears about school shootings by advising that resource officers concentrate on outside threats rather than student misbehavior. That recommendation has mostly gone unheeded.With the introduction of initiatives like Operation Matador, school resource officers have played an increasingly important role in the detention of immigrant teenagers. They\u2019ve helped the police collect intelligence in schools without technically violating the 1974 Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (Ferpa), which bars schools from sharing student records with government agencies. In the past, if officers wanted to surveil or search students suspected of committing a crime, they had to ask for a warrant.Across the country, ICE increasingly depends on information from resource officers to identify suspected gang members. But that intelligence is often unreliable. In March 2018 in Baltimore, ICE detained a 17-year-old after the school resource officer reported that the student was part of a group that threatened a classmate. The detention lasted six months. A federal immigration judge reviewed the decision for \u201cclear error\u201d and found that one had been made. In January 2018 in Houston, ICE detained a high schooler with a 3.4 G.P.A. after a school resource officer wrote him up for fighting with another student. The student went to the officer after the fight to explain that his classmate had been harassing him, but he was arrested and transferred to ICE custody; after a student walkout at the school, supported by some teachers, he was released in April.This year, civil rights groups sued the Boston School Police, the city\u2019s school district and its superintendent, Tommy Chang, over the way information is being shared with ICE. Chang stepped down the next day. (The case is pending.) Nevertheless, ICE recently detained several Boston students, citing school incident reports. In one case, a teenager was attacked by a known gang member, and ICE used the incident to classify the victim as a gang member as well. In California, school resource officers added hundreds of names to a statewide police gang database shared with federal agencies, including ICE.Michael A. Olivas, who teaches immigration and education law at the University of Houston, says schools are violating the intent of the Ferpa school-privacy law by reporting students to immigration authorities. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to use the mechanism that is supposed to protect children,\u201d Olivas says. \u201cIf they actually announced what they are doing, which is facilitating information to immigration authorities, they would likely face all kinds of sanctions.\u201dSome police officers cautioned that these symbols could also mean a student was being pressured to join or just trying to look cool, and that symbols can have multiple meanings. The same way metalheads might draw a pentagram, or wannabe punks might draw the anarchy sign (a letter A inside a circle), some students might draw MS-13 symbols, unaware that adults could take those doodles as proof of membership. One law-enforcement officer told me about being called in by a Long Island school after a student drew the signs for both MS-13 and a rival Mexican gang in his notebook. The officer explained that a real gang member would not draw signs of a gang he wasn\u2019t a member of \u2014 the drawings were not incriminating, just dumb. But not all officers were as clear about these nuances.In Bellport and Brentwood, the towns that lost several students to MS-13 murders, the schools were particularly eager to help. Administrators held similar briefings for parents. Actions that once might not have even prompted a trip to the principal\u2019s office now might lead to a long suspension. After a police training in 2017, an assistant principal at Bellport High School checked a 15-year-old student\u2019s Facebook page and saw \u201c503\u201d superimposed on an image of the Salvadoran flag and on the hat of a video-game character. The assistant principal spoke to the school resource officer, who agreed that the image was related to MS-13. The administrator suspended the student for \u201cdisruptive incidents,\u201d even though the student pointed out that the posts had been made in middle school and said they had simply stood for El Salvador. In May 2017, a 15-year-old special-education student at the same school was suspended for five months for wearing a Chicago Bulls shirt with the team\u2019s logo, a bull with horns. School administrators began texting officers photos of drawings from students as young as fourth and fifth graders, according to a law-enforcement official who requested anonymity.In Huntington, it wasn\u2019t just school staff who wanted to help. The head of security for Huntington\u2019s two public libraries began banning students who were suspended from school for gang activity, or who he had heard were gang members. After attending a police presentation in 2016, June Margolin, the president of Huntington Matters, a civic group, said she started seeing MS-13 indicators \u2014 like photos of boys making hand signs of horns, or large groups wearing blue and white \u2014 in the profile pages of residents trying to join her Facebook group. She began flagging those profiles to the Police Department\u2019s gang unit. The high school wrote a note home to parents saying that anything the police classified as gang-related was banned, but did not specify what those things were.An English-as-a-second-language teacher at Central Islip High, who asked that she not be identified out of concern for her job, didn\u2019t join in the effort, even though MS-13 killed two of her students in 2016. \u201cI get the feeling that the police and the government want to make it bigger than it is,\u201d she told me. \u201cI think a lot of teachers were just not well equipped to make good judgment calls.\u201d One day she was working lunch duty when a school security guard told her he thought it was suspicious that a lot of the students were wearing the Salvadoran flag. \u201cThank God I was there, because I told him, \u2018Today is their Independence Day,\u2019\u2009\u201d she says. \u201cHe had no clue.\u201dIn neighboring Nassau County, where MS-13 killed nearly as many people as it did in Suffolk, the Police Department took a different approach to ICE\u2019s new focus on the gang. Police Commissioner Patrick Ryder says his school resource officers don\u2019t write up noncriminal incidents like doodles, and the department doesn\u2019t route information from schools to immigration enforcement. ICE made half as many arrests there last year as in Suffolk County. \u201cHow many kids do that because they\u2019re just knuckleheads?\u201d Ryder says. \u201cThey make a mistake, they\u2019re adolescents.\u201dThe school sent home a suspension notice in Spanish giving Alex\u2019s parents the option of meeting with the principal at 7:15 the next morning to contest the punishment. But it was too late for them to ask their bosses for time off, and they figured it would be fine. Alex had only one month of his sophomore year left and had never gotten in trouble before.It is most likely that as Alex sat at home during his suspension, Officer Fiorillo received word of the doodling incident. While Fiorillo told me he didn\u2019t remember details about Alex\u2019s case, Huntington High has a policy of calling him in as soon as a staff member sees something that could be gang-related, according to a former principal, Carmela Leonardi, who retired in 2015. \u201cThe minute you see a gang sign, you need to intervene,\u201d she says. \u201cFirst, we\u2019d try to get Drew involved, and say, \u2018Have you seen this kid outside of the school talking to people?\u2019 Because sometimes you do that in your notebook because you\u2019re trying to seem cool, or because you\u2019re a little idiot.\u201dOnce Fiorillo knew about Alex\u2019s drawings, he would have had to fill out a form and send the information on to the department\u2019s criminal-intelligence unit. Although Suffolk County school resource officers are allowed to use their judgment about reporting infractions like marijuana possession or writing on school walls their 2017 handbook requires them to write up gang activity, no matter how trivial. School resource officers are not detectives, and they don\u2019t generally go further than passing on what they are told and observe themselves, according to Gerard Gigante, Suffolk County\u2019s chief of detectives.Fiorillo says it\u2019s important to him that students not be channeled into detention \u2014 \u201cWe can\u2019t arrest our way out of problems,\u201d he told me \u2014 but at the same time, his first priority is to keep Huntington High safe. He sees his job as bridging the worlds inside and outside the school. \u201cAs a police department, we patrol many neighborhoods,\u201d he told me. \u201cAs a school resource officer, all you\u2019re doing is patrolling a school. It\u2019s no different than in the streets, just a different sector.\u201dIn the end, Alex got permission to go to school two of the three days he was suspended in order to take his exams. His classmates were surprised by his suspension. Dariana (her middle name), an undocumented immigrant who was one of the school\u2019s top students, was in Alex\u2019s world-history class sophomore year and knew that he always did the reading and paid attention. \u201cI was like, Wow, he\u2019s here trying to learn, and he\u2019s suspended just for that?\u201d she says. His classmate Rosa was also surprised. She knew him as the boy who always brought her snacks when she studied through lunch.After the suspension, Alex no longer felt safe at school. Security staff began randomly searching his backpack and carefully flipping through his notebooks. \u201cI was walking around really scared,\u201d he said. He stopped wearing his Honduran sports jerseys and his bracelet with the colors of the flag. He avoided talking to anyone he didn\u2019t already know well. He and his two best friends decided it was safest to wear all black to school to avoid being tagged as gang members. But when they showed up in their matching outfits, the security guards said they couldn\u2019t dress like that because it looked as if they were trying to start a gang.Despite all these warning signs, when the ICE agents came to Alex\u2019s house on June 14, 2017, he was shocked into silence. It was only when they were far from Huntington, passing through unfamiliar, rundown Long Island towns, that he was able to get out the words to ask why he was being arrested. Alex says the agent first asked him to guess, and then told him, \u201cWe received a report a while ago from the school that you were a gang member, and that\u2019s why.\u201d Behind the tinted windows, his confusion resolved into fear for himself and his parents. \u201cI felt so bad,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause I was thinking that my mom and dad were going to suffer.\u201dPalacios talked to Fiorillo about collecting information that was used to detain students. The school resource officer was cordial and heard Palacios out. Palacios recalls Fiorillo\u2019s saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want to argue with you, I just want to move forward.\u201d When I asked Fiorillo if he had known that his information was shared with ICE, he demurred. \u201cI can\u2019t speak to what they do, they being a federal government agency,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t work with them.\u201d Testimony at an immigration hearing by another Suffolk County school resource officer, George Politis of Brentwood High, whose information collected in school was found in ICE memos, shed some light on the process. Asked what happened after he wrote a report, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s submitted, and then I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s disseminated from there. We enter it on a computer, and then it goes to whoever wants to read it within the department.\u201dPalacios asked his client\u2019s teachers for letters of support. But the teachers refused, saying the administration wouldn\u2019t allow it. Alex\u2019s father and the parents of many of the other detained Huntington students also approached their children\u2019s teachers for letters and were also turned down. Cusack, the principal, told me he had been caught off guard by the requests and worried that having staff write about students to third parties would violate students\u2019 privacy rights.Shortly after Alex was detained, his immigration lawyer spoke to Cusack and recorded the conversation. In the recording, Cusack sounds surprised that Alex was arrested based on a suspension. \u201cWe don\u2019t send anything to Immigration and Customs,\u201d Cusack says in the recording. Then he pauses and adds, \u201cWe do have a school resource officer here who works with us.\u201d Cusack told me that he had no idea that information from the school was being channeled to ICE. He said that he never believed any of the immigrant students he suspended were gang members, and that his goal with students who drew gang symbols was to warn them away from \u201cpresenting themselves as something they are not.\u201dCusack\u2019s confusion about what information would be conveyed to ICE may have been partly a consequence of not having a formal agreement with the Police Department. The Department of Justice and the National Association of School Resource Officers recommend that police departments and school districts create formal agreements to make sure everyone understands how information will be shared. In Suffolk County, there are no such agreements in place.Palacios says he doesn\u2019t think Fiorillo or Cusack was out to get immigrant students, but he thought they had an exaggerated worry about the gang. \u201cThe fear was that we were going to get hit with a big push of MS-13 in our school district,\u201d he says. That summer, he asked for a series of private meetings with school administrators and demanded that they do more to support detained students, including allowing teachers to write letters. It is hard to prove that a student is not part of a gang. \u201cI can\u2019t say, \u2018I\u2019d like to get a letter from the leader of the MS-13 to say this kid is not a gang member,\u2019\u2009\u201d he told me. So a teacher\u2019s letter of support is crucial.In August, the A.C.L.U. brought a class-action suit on behalf of dozens of minors rounded up in ICE gang operations all over the country, demanding that they be given hearings to challenge the evidence against them. The group included the student Palacios represented and a handful of other students from Huntington High; Alex had just turned 19 when he was arrested, so he didn\u2019t qualify for the suit. Many of the minors had been sent to a high-security detention center for children in Virginia, where some were strapped to chairs with their heads covered or held naked in dark rooms. A 15-year-old Huntington student, George (his middle name), tried to kill himself twice, once by hanging himself and once by slitting his wrist.After a few weeks, the Virginia staff decided that the facility was too restrictive for the well-behaved Long Island teenagers. That summer, the director of a California detention center asked to see ICE\u2019s evidence that the detainees were gang members. When ICE wasn\u2019t forthcoming, he refused to hold them, and starting in August 2017, they were sent to a group home run by ICE in upstate New York called Children\u2019s Village.In November 2017, a federal judge ruled that ICE would have to hold individual hearings and present evidence that each minor was a danger to the community. The lead case involved a Brentwood High student, Noel (his middle name), who ICE said was dangerous because he had been seen with suspected MS-13 members and had written the number \u201c503\u201d in a school notebook. ICE labeled Noel a \u201cgang member\u201d when he was detained, then downgraded him to a \u201cprobable member\u201d and finally, on the day of his hearing, settled on calling him a person identified by a school resource officer as \u201cassociated\u201d with the gang. In an immigration courthouse in Lower Manhattan, Judge Aviva Poczter ordered Noel\u2019s immediate release, noting that 503 is a country code. \u201cI think this is slim, slim evidence on which to base the continuing detention of an unaccompanied child,\u201d Poczter said.In other hearings, ICE presented evidence pulled from the Suffolk Police Department\u2019s gang database. Again and again, judges found that the material \u2014 a student cited for a gang tattoo who didn\u2019t have a tattoo; a photo of a group of suspected gang members that did not include the student in question \u2014 was far too weak or inaccurate to detain the students. In the cases involving Huntington students, the \u201cHuntington High resource officer\u201d kept coming up. In one case, he reported that one student was \u201cfound to be in possession of MS-13 drawings in his school work.\u201d In another, he reported that a student had written \u201cMS-13\u201d on his arm. Ultimately, 30 of the 32 teenagers in the A.C.L.U. lawsuit were freed, including Palacios\u2019 client, who returned to school. But of the hundreds of people administratively detained in Operation Matador, most were not minors, and they were fighting losing battles to be allowed to challenge, or even see, the evidence against them.When the first week of school came and went and he remained in jail, he fell into despair. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much longer they\u2019ll keep me in here, or what my life will be like when I get out,\u201d he told me in a visiting room in September 2017. He wore a bunchy orange jumpsuit and canvas slip-ons that his big toe had worn a hole through; his fingernails were long and ragged because he couldn\u2019t find nail clippers. \u201cThe most important thing is to finish high school. But I don\u2019t know if the principal will let me back in.\u201dMany of the Operation Matador detainees had been moved to the same maximum-security unit, which was about the size of the Huntington High cafeteria. The detainees spent most of their time staring out the windows at sooty buildings and industrial lots or watching soccer games and soap operas on TV. Alex was rarely able to take the classes that the jail offered, because criminal inmates were given priority. \u201cEven when I get out of here, how will my mind be?\u201d Alex asked his parents in one of his nightly calls. In another he told his mother about jumping out of the way when a fight broke out in the ward, and narrowly avoiding getting blood on his shoes. He was nervous about his current cellmate, who he thought was an MS-13 member and a drug addict. He could hear the other boy muttering and pacing at night and was terrified to go to sleep locked up alone with him.To get out of detention, Alex would need a hearing. But it was held up by a jurisdictional issue: Should he be considered an unaccompanied minor, as he was when he first requested asylum, or an adult, which he was now? While this issue was disputed, ICE declined to provide any evidence to justify classifying him as an active member of MS-13. At the same time, the government had expedited his asylum case in light of his new designation as a danger to the community. He and his lawyer scrambled to get his documents in order.Around Thanksgiving, a Huntington High School bilingual-education administrator contacted Alex\u2019s father to say the school was now willing to provide a letter of support for Alex. Victor wondered if the administration might be working with ICE to set a trap for him, but nevertheless he walked the two miles to the school. He and Marina had been saving for a car, but now they had spent all that money on legal fees. In the bright administrative offices, the principal, Cusack, handed over a letter written by Alex\u2019s language-arts teacher and told Victor that he understood his plight, because he, too, had children.The letter said Alex had progressed from beginner to advanced in two years and had always been well behaved. \u201cHe is soft-spoken, polite and compliant with classroom procedures,\u201d his teacher wrote. \u201cI personally believe that this young man can have a bright future if we encourage him and guide him to make the right choices in life.\u201d Cusack walked Victor to the school door. \u201cLet me know if we can do anything more,\u201d he said. Outside, Victor turned to look back at the blue devil painted on the front of the school building that had once gleamed with the promise of his son\u2019s success.When Victor told Alex that other Huntington High students detained in Operation Matador had been released, Alex assumed that he would have his detention hearing soon and be released as well. In December 2017, while he was waiting, Alex was called to his asylum hearing in a federal immigration court in New York City. According to a transcript, the government lawyer asked him exclusively about his school suspension, his being labeled a gang member and the meaning of the number 504. Judge Lauren F. Weintraub interrupted Alex\u2019s testimony about whether he would be safe in Honduras to ask whether he had tattoos (he didn\u2019t). Asylum hearings sometimes stretch for weeks or months, but after less than an hour with Alex, the judge ordered him deported. When he got back to his cell, he lay on his bed and cried.His immigration lawyer explained that Alex could appeal the asylum denial several times, which would give him time to fight his detention. He appealed once and was rejected again in June 2018. He knew that he would be released if he accepted deportation. But he would never have a chance to contest the supposed gang evidence against him or use the teacher\u2019s letter of support. Each time Alex called home, his father pleaded with him to keep fighting, saying it would tear the family apart if he left.But Alex had now been in detention for more than a year. He rarely got out of bed until lunchtime and didn\u2019t even have access to a yard. Being locked away on a ward felt like being dead, with the world moving on without him. In his year there, six inmates and detainees had died, including three suicides. When the government sent Alex paperwork asking him to accept the deportation, he signed.His father was devastated when Alex told him, but his mother felt her son was unraveling in detention. She even wanted to give up her own asylum claim and go back to Honduras with him, but Victor insisted on keeping the rest of the family together.They planned to go to the jail on July 7, 2018, to say goodbye. Alex called them four times the day before and once that morning, asking them not to come because seeing them sad would only make him feel worse. But it was unthinkable for them to let him leave without seeing him, possibly for the last time.At the security desk, Marina showed a new state ID she had recently received. Victor presented his Honduran passport, worried every moment that the staff might ask about his legal status. They sat on opposite ends of a bench in the waiting room. \u201cAnd if he gets sick?\u201d Marina asked Victor. \u201cWho is going to take care of him?\u201d Victor didn\u2019t answer.Victor went into the windowless visiting room first. Alex had grown more than an inch since he had been arrested, but he had become so pale and thin that he looked younger to his father. Alex told Victor that he had done everything a father could do, and he shouldn\u2019t feel bad. Victor\u2019s shoulders slumped as he began to cry. \u201cDon\u2019t be sad,\u201d Alex said. \u201cI\u2019ll finally be free.\u201dHe spent his 15 minutes with his mother trying to reassure her that he would be fine and would call her every day. She rose to leave. \u201cI know we\u2019ll see each other again,\u201d she said. \u201cI just don\u2019t know when. But I know we will.\u201d She made it out the door and then leaned against the white cinder-block wall, sobbing and mopping her face with a paper towel.Noel, the lead plaintiff, switched to home schooling because he was afraid Brentwood High would hand him over to ICE again. Osmin was released and returned to Huntington High in January 2018, and has had several run-ins with security staff. This November, he says, one security staff member mimed making a phone call and said to him, \u201cYou fight again, I\u2019ll call the police, and beep beep beep, you\u2019ll be gone.\u201d He doesn\u2019t use social media anymore and sits alone at school so he can\u2019t be accused of having gang friends. He said that the students \u201cdon\u2019t talk about the people who were deported. We don\u2019t say their names, because the school is always watching us.\u201d (The Huntington Union Free School District declined to answer a series of questions, citing student-privacy issues.)George, the Huntington High student who tried to kill himself twice in detention, publicly denounced MS-13 after he returned to school. When gang members then began threatening his life, he went to the principal, Cusack, with Irma Solis, the director of the Suffolk County New York Civil Liberties Union. Cusack called in Officer Fiorillo. According to Solis, Fiorillo seemed friendly at first and asked for the names of the people threatening George. When George was too scared to tell him, Solis said, Fiorillo\u2019s manner changed. He lifted a chair and slammed it down, then jabbed a finger in George\u2019s face, saying he didn\u2019t believe him. Officer Fiorillo explained, she said, that he had already called his colleagues in the gang unit, and George needed to go to the precinct station. \u201cIt was like a switch flipped,\u201d Solis said. \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m here to help,\u2019 and then he went into this interrogation mode.\u201d (The Suffolk County Police Department said that Officer Fiorillo \u201cdid not feel as though he was intimidating but just trying to help.\u201d) George recently dropped out of school and moved away.Palacios said the student he is representing has now been denied a visa because of the gang accusations. Palacios is appealing the decision with the help of letters from Huntington High teachers, but he fears it\u2019s too late. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get the stigma off of him,\u201d he said. \u201cThat scarlet letter sits on these kids\u2019 files forever. When that happens at the immigration level, it\u2019s fatal.\u201d Cusack said he has implemented implicit-bias training for school staff and has tried to make returning students feel safe. Cusack said he does not pretend to be perfect but has tried to comfort the detained students as they have returned. \u201cI listened to their stories and shed tears with them,\u201d he said. \u201cI tried as best as I could to welcome them back and to share my sincere feeling that this is their school, that this is where they belong.\u201dBut across Long Island, immigrant students who get in trouble for minor offenses still risk the same chain of overreactions that led to Alex\u2019s deportation. In August 2018, the school district for Bellport High banned students from drawing devil horns and the numbers 503 and 504, or posting them on their private social-media pages. By December, the A.C.L.U. identified about 20 new minors around the country arrested by ICE on shaky gang claims, and it sued to force ICE to reveal the total number of minors who have been detained. ICE now says Operation Matador will be permanent on Long Island. This fall, the initiative won an annual award from the Department of Homeland Security for best new ICE program.Alex dimly remembered his aunt from childhood Christmases. She remembered him as a lively and brilliant child, but now he seemed absent and distracted. \u201cSo much time alone, it\u2019s like he\u2019s forgotten how to talk,\u201d she told me in November. Before, he could sit and concentrate for hours. Now he struggled even to read newspapers, and his hands were always in motion, fidgeting with his ears or his sleeves.Alex was scared to go outside. When he left his room, the first thing he saw was \u201cMS-13\u201d spray painted on the wall across the street. Old men with shotguns guarded small stores, young men with MS-13 tattoos on their faces and necks demanded money and a man had just been shot to death at a festival at the plaza.After a month, he fell into a routine of sleeping late, watching TV, then eating lunch by himself at the town\u2019s one sit-down restaurant. He spent his afternoons sitting on the edge of the plaza\u2019s empty planters and dried-out fountains, swinging his legs and texting with friends on Long Island, who were all out of school for the summer. Sometimes he watched Long Island TV news on his phone. He put off going back to his room until the black grackle birds began to shriek, signaling that the sun was setting and the thugs would soon come out. In the evenings, he watched more TV and continued chatting with people in the United States until it was time to go to sleep. He called his parents every night. They offered to send him the clothes and shoes he had left in Huntington, but he wasn\u2019t ready to admit he might never return to New York. He still had his phone set to East Coast time.When the school year started again, Alex began to feel desperate. His friends were all back in classes now. Some were applying to college. He began to think about trying to sneak back into the United States. He knew that he couldn\u2019t go back to Huntington High, but he figured he could at least earn enough working with Victor to take private English lessons. Alex broached the subject with his father. Victor had been feeling unbearably guilty, as if the whole family had crossed a bridge and left Alex on the other side. He agreed to help. Victor and Marina borrowed thousands of dollars and moved with Alex\u2019s brother into two rented rooms in Huntington. Toward the end of September, Victor called to say he had found a coyote.On Sept. 24, 2018, Alex set off for the United States-Mexico border. The coyote led a group of seven into the Texas desert for a five-day trek. They drank rainwater from puddles to cool down during the day and shivered in the sand at night. One night, the group was waiting to be picked up on a highway when a United States Border Patrol truck came into sight. The group turned back into the desert and ran stumbling for hours. Eventually they stopped to rest, and Alex fell asleep. He awoke to feel a German shepherd sniffing him.Under Trump\u2019s zero-tolerance policy, Alex was charged with illegal entry, a misdemeanor that carries up to a six-month prison sentence. But a federal judge agreed to release him if he pleaded guilty and accepted immediate deportation. Alex now had a criminal record as well as a 20-year ban, meaning he would be 40 before he could apply for a visa.By mid-November, Alex was back in his concrete room in La Libertad. He felt ashamed of himself and sad for his parents. \u201cAll the things they sacrificed, all the worry that they\u2019ve had, it\u2019s all my fault,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t been detained, I would have finished school, learned English and gotten a good job.\u201d He spent his first afternoon back in La Libertad sitting in the plaza, staring at the olive green mountains that rose on every side. The deal his father made with the coyote included two more chances to try to cross the border. But failing again could mean two years in prison and a lifetime ban on getting a visa.Staying in Honduras wasn\u2019t safe, either. His first weekend back, Alex scrambled up volcanic boulders for 20 minutes to a popular lookout point on the edge of a cliff. Two men soon came climbing over the rocks. They wore beanies pulled low over their eyes in the heat, and even on the uneven boulders, they walked with an unmistakable swagger. The one in front had three dots tattooed on his face, signifying the three places he was willing to go for his gang \u2014 prison, the hospital or the morgue. Alex lowered his head and quickly climbed down, terrified.\u201cBut that\u2019s like $3,\u201d Alex said. \u201cYou can\u2019t even buy a shirt with that.\u201d In the United States, he earned $90 a day doing landscaping with his father.Zavala showed Alex the rest of the campus, a set of buildings without windows or chalkboards set amid banana trees. Alex looked inside a classroom. The walls and desks, and even the teacher\u2019s table, were covered with crosshatched doodles. Someone had written out 18 in Roman numerals on the wall. It looked like a sign for the gang Barrio 18. Alex asked if there were thugs in the school, but Zavala shook his head. \u201cThe kids do that sometimes, but they\u2019re just being dumb,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are no gang members here, just people trying out pretending.\u201dAlex stopped to examine a list of people who had failed their courses that was posted on a wall. One of the classes was English. He had thought that to keep learning English, he would have to take a bus two hours to the nearest city. \u201cI think I\u2019d like to enroll here,\u201d Alex said to the guard. \u201cIt\u2019s really nice. I think it would be good to study here, if I\u2019m not too old.\u201dThe guard told Alex that he was welcome anytime, and there were even older students. But he didn\u2019t know what good it would do. \u201cThe education here doesn\u2019t get you anything \u2014 this country is full of doctors and engineers who work as taxi drivers,\u201d Zavala said. \u201cThat\u2019s why my family went to the U.S.\u201d He told Alex that he had graduated from university himself, with a degree in education, and felt lucky to have this job. The other school guard had a degree in agriculture. \u201cYou study, and for what?\u201d he said. \u201cBut a person has to do something.\u201d Alex nodded. He shoved his thumbs through the straps of his backpacks, thanked the guard and headed back down the hill to the plaza, to check in with New York.Hannah Dreier is an investigative reporter at ProPublica.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is There Any Humane Way to Kill a Mouse?", "Date": "2018-12-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGlue traps, snap traps or poison? What do you do about a pest whose only crime is being a pest? Mr. Huth is a writer. After several days, I noticed a putrid smell in the kitchen. Reluctantly, I poked my head under the sink, and there on the concrete slab was a poignant tableau: a still-life with rodents. Lying side by side were two plastic trays slathered with a thick gummy substance, and marooned in that goop were the figures of two gray mice whose tiny feet, captured midstride, had been stilled forevermore.With a hammer? A cleaver? An ice pick?My victims had already met their maker. Their corpses lay spread-eagle across the trays, flattened into the glue from tail to belly to head, their once-perky noses pinned fast. Who knew what they expected to find when they scampered onto the trays? The instructions suggested: \u201cDo not place traps where birds and nontarget animals may come into contact.\u201d This covered, presumably, kittens and toddlers. And they concluded with a refreshing frankness: \u201cConsider other traps for a more humane option.\u201dRather than sitting around moping about their fate, I went to McGuckin Hardware to see what \u201ca more humane option\u201d might look like. I found the Traps/Bait aisle teeming with devices to murder or repel both mice and rats. Here were the wooden snap traps of old, with their trip pedals and spring-loaded guillotines.

Congress should act to protect them.Ms. Savitz is a marine biologist with the conservation group Oceana.Driven by demand for shark fin soup, shark fins have become so valuable that many species of this ocean predator are being decimated. It is a particularly cruel business. Every year, tens of millions of sharks end up in the fin trade, caught by fishermen who hack off their fins and, in many cases, toss them back into the ocean to die.This practice is known as shark finning. It has been banned in the waters of the United States since 2000. But the fins of legally caught sharks can still be sold in much of the country. More troubling, thousands of pounds of fins are being imported into the United States every year \u2014 including from countries that allow finning. By imposing a nationwide ban on the trade of shark fins, Congress would remove the United States from the fin trade entirely, improve enforcement of the current finning ban and send a message to other countries that the United States condemns finning as a cruel practice that should not be allowed to continue. The legislation has the votes to pass. It deserves a vote. Advertisement"}

Its attorney general at the time, Robert Butterworth, pointing to a growing number of overdose deaths, declared that he would discover when Purdue Pharma first knew about OxyContin\u2019s abuse.Advertisement"}

Mr. Johnson said he was interested in connecting with people from other countries, \u201cand there\u2019s always the excitement that it might turn into a romantic encounter.\u201dLink Salas, the creative director for a small technology company in New York, said he used Grindr, a social networking app for gay, bisexual, and transgender men, to learn about the places he\u2019s traveling to and to meet men there. \u201cI change my profile to say I am in town and looking for someone to show me around,\u201d he said. \u201cSome guys suggest a gay neighborhood to check out or a club,\u201d he said. Some offer to meet in person. \u201cThe way you phrase your paragraph affects the responses you get,\u201d he said.And while many solo travelers may indeed be single, and thus potentially open to romantic encounters, still others are on their own because their spouses or partners are back at home, unable to make this trip.That\u2019s one factor that in 2016 led the dating site Bumble to expand its offerings to friendship (Bumble BFF) and, in 2017, to work-related connections (Bumble Bizz). Jess Carbino, a sociologist working for Bumble, said the company\u2019s research showed that more of its users were using the app to meet local residents when traveling solo. \u201cPeople in their 20s and 30s are in different places in their lives, so it can be hard to find someone to travel with,\u201d she said.Other dating app users say they stay safe when meeting strangers abroad by only meeting during daylight hours, in busy parts of town, or in places that do not serve alcohol. And they state clearly that their intent is platonic. If someone tries to push past these parameters online or in person, they advise cutting off the interaction. Sharing your location with a friend is another precaution. (The Grindr, Bumble and Tinder apps also supply advice on staying safe when meeting strangers.)To dissuade people from creating false identities that could be used for nefarious purposes, Bumble moderators ask people setting up new accounts to follow a set of prompts on camera, to ensure they are submitting an authentic photo for their profile and not copying an image from the internet. Emily Wright, a company spokeswoman, said reports of inappropriate actions are dealt with \u201cswiftly and seriously,\u201d and users who break the code of conduct can be banned from the app.While some travelers may not be looking for romance, sometimes it just happens. In 2016, Ms. Castillo met a man through Tinder while she was traveling through Europe and ended up in an 18-month relationship with him. \u201cI guess it\u2019s not the most romantic app in the world,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it does bring you some interesting possibilities and the opportunity to meet people you would have never met otherwise.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Whatever the reason, you have to navigate the journey from professional to party, choosing clothes that signal that you are polished without being boring, attractive without being provocative, and that you\u2019re looking to be promoted, not propositioned. For women, it\u2019s never easy.Men, in general, have it all figured out: a suit and a tie, and they\u2019re ready for anything from a wedding to a funeral to an office holiday party where the dress code is \u201csmart casual\u201d or \u201cfestive dressy\u201d \u2014 even if the suit is boxy or baggy, even if the tie\u2019s held together with Scotch tape. Boom. Done.My husband will spend all of five minutes getting ready. (\u201cAnd if I\u2019m overdressed,\u201d he told me, in the tones of one imparting ancient and valuable wisdom, \u201cI just take the tie off!\u201d).I, on the other hand, will consider all of my dresses and jumpsuits, maxis and midis and minis, capri pants, palazzo pants, pantsuits, tunics that make me look like Bea Arthur, high heels that make me feel like I\u2019m walking on knives, body-con dresses that work only with three layers of undergarments worn in the precisely correct order, and the pair of hand-tooled red leather cowgirl boots that looked so pretty in the catalog but made me feel as if I were dressed up as the Lone Ranger the one time I wore them outside.Here is the dark-purple dress that I adored until my daughter said it made me look like Grimace, and I can never un-hear those words. And over there is my absolute favorite stretchy, comfy black dress that fits beautifully and feels great, so much so that I wore it the last three times I had to go somewhere that wasn\u2019t swim practice drop-off or Hebrew school pickup.Clothes might make the man, but they typically have so little to say about him that when Richard Nixon was trying to show the nation his honesty by way of his modest lifestyle, he had to figuratively reach into his wife\u2019s closet and reference the \u201crespectable Republican cloth coat\u201d that Pat wore, instead of a mink. The bar for presentable is lower than the soles on a pair of FitFlop flats: Think Ed Sheeran in jeans and layered T-shirts. Think Bradley Cooper in \u201cA Star Is Born.\u201dWomen\u2019s outfits, on the other hand, do not just make a statement. They tell a story, and that story is long and involved and complicated, touching on age and class and race and sexuality. Think Beyonc\u00e9, next to Ed Sheeran, in a sculptural, ruffled, pleated, fuchsia couture gown. Think Lady Gaga, once she\u2019s been swallowed by the fame machine, in \u201cA Star Is Born.\u201dThere\u2019s also a reason that President Barack Obama could be briefed on an event, put on a suit, and go to it, while Michelle Obama had to attend the briefing but also the unofficial briefing after the briefing about clothes: Would it be raining? Would there be grass or cobblestones? Was it windy? (Pencil skirts can\u2019t be displaced by gusts.) Would she be hugging, dancing or doing push-ups?\u201cDress shabbily and they remember the dress; dress impeccably and they notice the woman,\u201d Coco Chanel once said. But what, exactly, constitutes impeccable? How are you supposed to achieve it if only a handful of designers deign to make clothes in your size? Where are the clothes that acknowledge the formality and importance of an event and also allow you to do stuff?For most of my time, these questions are theoretical. As a novelist, I spend my days in clothes that no one but my husband, my kids and my dog ever see. But this spring, I\u2019ll be on book tour: a dozen events in 10 cities in two weeks. For years, that has meant trying to come up with 14 outfits. If I wore my favorite black dress on Tuesday in Cincinnati, I\u2019d see pictures on social media on Wednesday, and I couldn\u2019t repeat the look in San Diego on Thursday \u2014 or else, I reasoned, people would think I had only one dress. I have honed all kinds of systems over the years, from shipping dirty laundry home to traveling with ridiculous amounts of luggage to spending a rare afternoon off rushing to the nearest Nordstrom, all while watching male authors throw on a button-down and call it a day.What would happen if I treated my dresses the way a man on tour might treat his suits? Could I just pack four outfits and rotate them? Could I find my own uniform?That\u2019s one way to go. The other is the path paved by Stacey Abrams when she ran for governor of Georgia this year. She did it in jewel tones, in statement necklaces and interesting necklines. She seemed, from where I was following along, to enjoy her clothes, her dresses and her necklaces and her earrings, how she felt and how she moved, and what those looks told the world about her.And so, as we\u2019re all girding our loins for this year\u2019s office party, Christmas-cookie exchange, carol sing or latke fry, wriggling into our Spanx, and asking ourselves, If I put on a different necklace, does it still look like the same black dress? a few questions to consider:If men can wear the same thing over and over, why can\u2019t we? If men have clothes that look good and let them kick a soccer ball, hold a baby or walk on cobblestones in the rain, where are ours? And finally, how would it feel if the only person\u2019s approval you sought when you looked in the mirror was your own?Jennifer Weiner is the author, most recently, of the memoir \u201cHungry Heart\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

English sparklers are a novelty no more. His ambition was to make wine, which in the 1990s meant leaving England. By age 17, he was apprenticing in France, and soon was working two harvests a year, in France and in Australia.He eventually married, bought a vineyard in C\u00f4tes de Castillon (a lesser Bordeaux region) and set about growing merlot and cabernet franc, and trying to sell the wine.In early 2010, they found a parcel with chalk-and-gravel soil on a south-facing slope in Marlow, a London bedroom community in the Thames Valley, near where Mr. Laithwaite had grown up.They snapped it up, and by May 2010, the Laithwaites had planted the first piece of what is now 16 acres of chardonnay, pinot noir and pinot meunier \u2014 the trio of grapes used for almost all Champagnes and English sparkling wines. In 2016, the Laithwaites released their first wine, a lovely 2013 sparkling ros\u00e9.The notion of English sparkling wine surprises many Americans, who still hold the notion of Britain as a culinary wasteland, with lukewarm ale the only beverage.Yet London for a generation has been one of the world\u2019s most exciting restaurant cities. And England, now in its third decade as a sparkling wine producer, is demonstrating that its bubbly output can be superb.What marks these sparkling wines as distinctively English is both a spirited, glowing acidity and an orchard-fruit freshness. When all is kept in balance, the wines can be delightful. If the acidity dominates, the wines can be astringent and rustic in an unpleasant way.Nyetimber planted the first major vineyard in Sussex specifically for sparkling wine in 1988. Long-established producers here have had an opportunity to see which grapes work best where, and to fine-tune both their viticulture and their winemaking.The 2009 was silky, creamy and fine, with great depth, length and restraint, while the 2010 Ros\u00e9, with aromas and flavors of red fruit and herbs, was long, deep and harmonious. I thought they were the best English sparkling wines I had ever tasted, but they were soon joined by others.\u201cWe don\u2019t know how good English sparkling wine can be,\u201d said Josh Donaghay-Spire, Chapel Down\u2019s head winemaker. \u201cIf we\u2019re not pushing, then what\u2019s the point? This is the birth of a viticultural region, right now. The pace of change is so rapid because everything is new.\u201dChapel Down, which makes crowd-pleasing nonvintage sparklers, has also demonstrated how expressive and beautiful its top wines can be. A 2013 Kit\u2019s Coty Vineyard blanc de blancs, from chalk soils in the North Downs of Kent, was elegant and linear, with creamy mineral flavors.The 2013 Coeur de Cuv\u00e9e is a tiny selection from the Kit\u2019s Coty Vineyard that, unlike the blanc de blancs, was entirely barrel-fermented with indigenous yeast. It was complex, pure, savory and superb.\u201cThe influx of capital and professional expertise has been a step up from untrained eccentrics,\u201d said Simon Robinson, the proprietor of Hattingley Valley, who saw winemaking as a way of diversifying his family\u2019s agricultural business.The growth in English sparkling wine is apparent all over the south of England. From Kent in the east through East and West Sussex, Hampshire, Dorset and as far west as Cornwall, new vineyards for sparkling wine are being planted at a dizzying rate. Winemakers who once imagined they were bound for France or Australia are instead staying home in England to make sparkling wine.Since 2010, the vineyard area for the three main sparkling wine grapes has more than tripled, rising to about 4,490 acres in 2017 from about 1,360 in 2010, according to Wines of Great Britain, a trade group.Most of the new vineyards are far bigger than the Laithwaites\u2019s and much better financed. Mark Driver was an investment manager and his wife, Sarah, a solicitor, when they caught the wine bug in the early 21st century. After tasting some English sparkling wines in 2009, they bought almost 600 acres in the South Downs of Sussex near Polegate, just three miles from the English Channel.Nyetimber had about 250 acres of vineyard in 2011. By 2018, it had about 420 acres, and another 210 will become productive in 2020.Nobody would mistake an English vineyard for one in Champagne. Walking through Gusbourne\u2019s Boot Hill Vineyard with the winemaker Charlie Holland on a blustery, misty fall day, I noted that the rows of vines were far wider than one would find in Champagne, and the vines trained higher on their trellises.In order to achieve ripeness in the colder English climate, the vines need to be planted less densely than in France, Mr. Holland said, to minimize the competition. And the vines need to have a denser canopy of leaves to promote photosynthesis, so the rows have to be wider apart so the leaves in one row won\u2019t shade the fruit in another.\u201cIt\u2019s not the same parameters as in Champagne, and not the same ripeness levels,\u201d Mr. Holland said.Indeed, the Champagne region was once considered a marginal climate, on the blurry edge of the line at which grapes could reliably ripen. Thirty years ago, it was a struggle. Now, with climate change, the issue is whether Champagne is getting too warm.The edge has now moved up to the south of England, where everybody agrees that the 2018 vintage was the biggest and best ever for sparkling wine.Yet 2016 and \u201917 were both lean harvests. Late spring frosts after early bud breaks kept yields low. Still, the years were not as bad as 2012, when the weather was so wretched virtually no wine was made at all.Even so, the best English producers seem to have a ready market for their wine, whether it\u2019s people looking for alternatives to Champagne or Prosecco, which is hugely popular in England, or those simply driven by curiosity.For the Laithwaites of Harrow & Hope, whose do-it-yourself, small-production setup is as different from the big English names as Champagne\u2019s grower-producers are from the big houses, selling their English wine has not been nearly as challenging as it was to sell Bordeaux.English sparkling wines are not yet widely distributed in the United States, but each year more are available and in greater numbers. Here are 10 to seek out, in alphabetical order.Advertisement"}

A sense of fate drew him inside.He was immediately struck by James Van Der Zee\u2019s photographs of Harlem residents. As he walked through the show, seeing the work of African-American photographers in a museum profoundly affected Mr. Bey\u2019s ambitions and what he thought could be possible for himself. Just the year before, his godmother had given him his first camera. Thus began his education in photography, influenced by the works of artists like Charles White, Romare Bearden and Emory Douglas, the minister of culture for the Black Panther Party whose graphic art appeared in the organization\u2019s newspaper. Mr. Bey\u2019s touchstones in photography included Roy DeCarava, Walker Evans and Gordon Parks, and even his own family\u2019s photo albums. These explorations gave him a sense of what his own subject matter could be, leading to his first series, \u201cHarlem, U.S.A.,\u201d which he spent five years making and was exhibited at the Studio Museum in Harlem in 1979.The book\u2019s cover features a striking image, from his \u201cBlack-and-White Type 55 Polaroid Street Portraits\u201d series, of a young black girl with a knife-shaped nose ring, staring directly into Mr. Bey\u2019s lens. Framing his subjects with subtlety, he concentrates on people others take for granted.\u201cAll of those Street Portraits were about giving the black subjects an affirmative space in which to present themselves to the camera and to the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThe subjects in those photographs all direct their gaze toward the camera, and by extension the viewer. I wanted the respect that I had for each of them to be the thing that the viewer was also left with.\u201d\u201cAlthough these structures are abstract, they have real implications for black life,\u201d Leigh Raiford, an associate professor of African-American Studies at University of California, Berkeley, said. \u201cWe need Bey\u2019s work to make sense of a major historical transition that other cities are also experiencing. How do you render that absence and loss? How do you image a system? What does a picture of white supremacy look like? In \u2018Harlem Redux,\u2019 you can only see through a cutout, a gate or a veil. There\u2019s a sense that there is something that keeps you from moving.\u201d\u201cWhat is so appealing to me about the Birmingham series is how he finds a visual language that forces us to recognize the past and the present, the ongoing cyclical nature of this history and its intergenerational legacy,\u201d Dr. Raiford said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t let us retreat to any sort of safe space of saying \u2018I\u2019m not implicated\u2019 or \u2018this doesn\u2019t affect me.\u2019 In that simple pairing of the elder and the youth, the symmetry of it offers that meditation of time and history demonstrating how these histories continue to work on us and through us.\u201dIn \u201cClass Pictures,\u201d Mr. Bey\u2019s portraits of high school students are paired with the subjects\u2019 words, giving self-representation and self-definition a place. The portraits are meant to be displayed both in galleries and in conversation with communities as a part of his collaborative practice, which has influenced curators and educators to consider how their work could have a greater impact, believing that young people have a rich interior life.Ultimately, his work is as an ongoing exploration of photography\u2019s possibilities, informed by his research and cultural influences. \u201cI\u2019ve also never wanted to be my own oldies show, settling into a comfortable groove,\u201d he said. \u201cI used to be a drummer, and I\u2019m very much influenced by those musicians like Miles Davis, John Coltrane and Prince who continually pushed their music forward, reinventing themselves and their ideas rather than settling into a kind of comfortable creative complacency.\u201dFayemi Shakur is a writer and visiting lecturer at Rutgers University-Newark, in the Department of Art, Culture and Media.

Let it have a second life as compost, a barrier for erosion or food for goats. Twinkling pine, spruce and fir trees bring holiday cheer to homes around the world. But with the end of festivities comes the not-so-jolly chore of disrobing and discarding these unwieldy house guests.You don\u2019t want your Christmas tree to end up in a landfill, where it will take forever to decompose. So what\u2019s the most responsible way to get rid of a Christmas tree?Take a minute to search the internet for what your town recommends, or call your local trash haulers. Many communities will collect Christmas trees curbside for two or three weeks after the holidays.Before you drag your shrub to the curb, make sure to strip the lights, ornaments and tinsel. If you wrap the tree in a plastic bag to get it out of the house, take the wrap off once it\u2019s outside.Try to find a friend with a wood chipper who can shred your tree for you. \u201cIt makes wonderful compost,\u201d said Todd Larsen, executive co-director of Green America, an environmental nonprofit based in Washington D.C.Finally, if you live in a rural area, you can simply put your tree out on your land and \u201creturn it to nature,\u201d said Eric A. Goldstein, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council. Trees fall on their own all the time and become good habitat for birds, rodents and other wildlife.The big no-no is to chuck your tree in a bag and have it go to the landfill.Landfills are packed so tightly that there\u2019s no oxygen, which organic materials need to decompose, said Jessica Davis, the director of the IUPUI Office of Sustainability in Indianapolis. Also, the lack of oxygen means that when your Christmas tree finally does decompose, it will release methane, a far more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.It\u2019s not great to burn your tree either, Mr. Larsen said. Sap and dried needles tend to crackle, pop and explode when they burn. Moreover, fir, pine and spruce trees contain a highly flammable tar called creosote, which produces soot and can lead to chimney fires.Advertisement"}

Just a decade ago, making headlines usually meant a company\u2019s gadget or software product was making a big splash and getting nice publicity. But nowadays, tech companies are more powerful than ever, and journalists are focusing on holding them accountable rather than cheerleading.The documents revealed how Facebook treated user data as a bargaining chip. The social network had a \u201cwhite list\u201d agreement with companies it favored, including Airbnb, Lyft and Netflix. The arrangement involved sharing user data with those parties that other companies were restricted from obtaining.Canada\u2019s Justice Department said she was sought for extradition to the United States but did not give a reason. The United States government has long expressed concern about Huawei\u2019s surveillance capabilities because of the company\u2019s close ties to the Chinese government.\u2022 This week there\u2019s been some buzz around 5G, the fifth-generation wireless network from cellular carriers, meaning a faster cellular connection might be closer to reality.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Philippine Journalist, a Thorn to Duterte, Turns Herself In to Face Charges", "Date": "2018-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe founder of an online news start-up critical of the Philippine government turned herself in to the authorities in Manila on Monday after a warrant for her arrest was issued over the weekend.Ms. Ressa and Rappler were charged with five counts of tax fraud last week. The penalties could include a fine along with up to 10 years of imprisonment for Ms. Ressa. They have denied the charges.The government prepared a warrant for Ms. Ressa\u2019s arrest to coincide with her return to the Philippines on Sunday evening after a weekslong trip abroad that included appearances at several high-profile journalism awards ceremonies. In Washington, Ms. Ressa received the 2018 Knight International Journalism award. In New York, she was given the Press Freedom Award by the Committee to Protect Journalists.\u201cI\u2019m going to hold my government accountable for publicly calling me a criminal,\u201d Ms. Ressa said in a brief conversation with a group of reporters who greeted her arrival at Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila late Sunday. \u201cI am not a criminal.\u201dOn Monday morning, Ms. Ressa arrived at the Pasig Regional Trial Court in Manila and provided head shots for the court and had her fingerprints taken. Her legal team filed a motion for Ms. Ressa to be set free on bail and paid 60,000 pesos, or about $1,100, to secure her release, her lawyer said by phone.It is the latest in a series of crackdowns on the news media by the Duterte government. Mr. Duterte is one of a growing group of political strongmen who rode to power in recent years on a wave of populism in their countries and in the process tightened their grip on power. When challenged by the news media, these leaders have often turned on reporters, accusing them of being dishonest and manufacturing \u201cfake news.\u201dHe has threatened several times to block the license renewal for ABS-CBN, the largest broadcast network in the Philippines. He has called reporters \u201cspies\u201d and \u201csons of bitches\u201d and made thinly veiled death threats, warning reporters that they are \u201cnot exempted from assassination.\u201dRappler, founded in 2012 as a scrappy investigative and entertainment outlet, has been a main target of his verbal abuse. Its star political reporter, Pia Ranada, in particular has been singled out. At one news conference, Mr. Duterte warned her not to go to his hometown, Davao, where he was once mayor, because \u201csomething bad will happen to you.\u201dEarlier this year, Ms. Ranada was stripped of the press pass that allows her to cover Malaca\u00f1ang Palace, the Philippine equivalent to the White House. Rappler reporters have been barred from covering any official presidential events. Such treatment has alarmed media groups.\u201cMore than his inability to tolerate dissent, Duterte\u2019s relentless persecution of the media appears to be part of the increasingly authoritarian direction his presidency has taken,\u201d the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines said in a statement on Sunday night.This year, Rappler became an official fact checker for Facebook, which has called the Philippines \u201cPatient Zero\u201d in the battle over misinformation.The charges treat Rappler as though it were a \u201cdealer in securities\u201d and not a news organization, Ms. Ressa said, adding that Rappler has paid the right taxes required of a news organization in the Philippines.Francis Lim, a lawyer for Ms. Ressa, said Monday in a statement sent by text message, \u201cThe police can no longer arrest her, as the court just approved the cash bail that she has posted for her liberty during the pendency of the case.\u201dRisa Hontiveros, an opposition senator, called the case an attempt to \u201cmuzzle the media into fear.\u201d\u201cIn his attempt to be a full-fledged authoritarian, President Duterte wants to control the free flow of information and neutralize a potential channel of criticism,\u201d Ms. Hontiveros said in an emailed statement.Speaking on Sunday night from the airport, Ms. Ressa said that her arrest would not silence her.\u201cI have been a journalist my entire life,\u201d she said. \u201cI will continue to hold the government accountable.\u201dJason Gutierrez contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Secret to Winning in 2020", "Date": "2018-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s the populism, stupid.Opinion ColumnistYoung or old? Female or male? White, black or Latino? The first stage of the 2020 presidential campaign \u2014 the jockeying stage \u2014 is underway, and Democrats are trying to figure out who the ideal candidate is.They\u2019re asking the wrong questions, though. Demographic identity matters much less than people often imagine. Think about it: Would an algorithm meant to produce the ideal candidate have spat out any of the past three presidents \u2014 a 70-year-old, orange-haired reality-television star; a law professor with the middle name Hussein; or the son of a recent one-term president with the very same name?There is only one quality \u2014 beyond, of course, charisma \u2014 that Democrats should demand in their nominee. The Democrats need a candidate who can and will run as an economic populist.They need a candidate who will organize the 2020 campaign around fighting for the little guy and gal. (And most of the potential Democratic nominees could do so.) It would be a campaign about Republican politicians and corporate lobbyists who are rigging the game, a campaign that promised good jobs, rising wages, decent health care, affordable education and an end to Trumpian corruption.The first big batch of evidence is public opinion: On economic issues, most Americans are decidedly populist.These issues are politically potent because they unite the Democratic coalition and divide the Republican coalition. The Democratic base \u2014 including Africans-Americans, Asian-Americans, Latinos, young college graduates and middle-class women \u2014 leans populist, polling shows. But so do the white-working class voters who often swing 21st-century elections.Democrats still aren\u2019t going to win a majority of the white working class. But they don\u2019t need to. They just need to avoid getting crushed. When they do that, they win elections.In southern New Mexico, Xochitl Torres Small talked about hard work and grit. In northeast Iowa, Abby Finkenauer\u2019s campaign slogan was, \u201cFighting for Iowa\u2019s Working Families.\u201d In dozens of districts, Democrats campaigned on protecting people\u2019s health insurance.And most of these candidates won. If Democrats repeat their 2018 performance in 2020, they will win the White House.This group is mostly white, mostly without a college degree and disproportionately rural, according to the analysis, by YouGov Blue and Data for Progress. On social issues, the group\u2019s attitudes look pretty Republican. Many of its members think sexism isn\u2019t that big of a problem, for instance. They express anxiety about demographic change and favor tighter border security.These are the sort of voters that some Democrats had written off as irredeemable racists. But that\u2019s a terrible mistake.On economic issues, swing voters look decidedly un-Republican. They are even more populist than loyal Democrats. By a wide margin, they favor free college, a big expansion of Medicare and federal action both to reduce drug prices and to create jobs.Trump\u2019s populism is a mirage, but many voters believed it in 2016. He was the rare Republican who criticized free trade and seemed to care more about protecting Medicare than reducing the budget deficit. Trump managed to out-populist Hillary Clinton, and it\u2019s a part of why he won.The Democratic president before Obama \u2014 Bill Clinton \u2014 ran as a populist, too. It\u2019s true he also pitched himself as a centrist rather than a liberal. But populism isn\u2019t the same as liberalism. Most voters don\u2019t tote up all of a candidate\u2019s policies and try to figure out his or her precise ideology. They care more about the values a candidate projects, and Clinton sold himself as an ally of workers.Contrast Bill Clinton and Obama with the Democrats who have lost a presidential election over the last generation: Hillary Clinton, John Kerry and Al Gore. Fairly or not, none of them figured out how to portray themselves as defenders of ordinary families.Finally, it\u2019s worth glancing at other countries where, as in the United States, the middle class has been struggling lately. Populism has also been working, for both good and ill, in many of those places.Populism takes very different forms \u2014 from odious racism to sensible economics \u2014 but there is no other political style consistently succeeding in the Western world right now.There is more than one form that a Democratic populist can take. Franklin Roosevelt, the most successful populist of the past century, was an aristocrat. Bill Clinton and Lyndon Johnson were hardscrabble Southerners. Barack Obama managed to do quite well with much of the white working class despite having one big obvious difference from them.So the need to run a populist campaign in 2020 doesn\u2019t point to any specific candidate.Yes, there are a few for whom populism would come easily, including Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. The same applies to Senator Sherrod Brown. While most Democrats were getting thumped in Ohio this year, his blue-collar style helped him win comfortably.Then there are other candidates for whom a populist campaign would be a natural outgrowth of their careers. Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota senator, has focused on the disturbing power of large corporations. Kamala Harris, the California senator, has proposed a huge middle-class tax cut.We\u2019re living in a populist era. The question is who figures out how to thrive in it. In 2016, it was Trump. It doesn\u2019t need to be in 2020.A previous version of this column misstated the title of Emmanuel Macron. He is the president of France, not its prime minister.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What the Lawless Obamacare Ruling Means ", "Date": "2018-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s not based on a solid legal argument. It\u2019s an exercise in raw judicial power. Mr. Adler is a professor of law at the Case Western Reserve University School of Law. Ms. Gluck is a professor of law and the faculty director of the Solomon Center for Health Law and Policy at Yale Law School.A ruling this consequential had better be based on rock-solid legal argument. Instead, the opinion by Judge Reed O\u2019Connor is an exercise of raw judicial power, unmoored from the relevant doctrines concerning when judges may strike down a whole law because of a single alleged legal infirmity buried within.We were on opposing sides of the 2012 and 2015 Supreme Court challenges to the Affordable Care Act, and we have different views of the merits of the act itself. But as experts in the field of statutory law, we agree that this decision makes a mockery of the rule of law and basic principles of democracy \u2014 especially Congress\u2019s constitutional power to amend its own statutes and do so in accord with its own internal rules.In this case, Texas and 19 other states argue that with zero penalty, the mandate lacks a constitutional basis because it will no longer be enforced like a tax. If that were all there was, the case would have little consequence because starting in 2019, the mandate is unenforceable.But audaciously, the states argued \u2014 and Judge O\u2019Connor agreed \u2014 that the rest of Obamacare must fall, too. They claim that the mandate is so central to the A.C.A. that nothing else in it can operate without it.That\u2019s not how the relevant law works. An established legal principle called \u201cseverability\u201d is triggered when a court must consider what happens to a statute when one part of it is struck down. The principle presumes that, out of respect for the separation of powers, courts will leave the rest of the statute standing unless Congress makes clear it did not intend for the law to exist without the challenged provision. This is not a liberal principle or a conservative principle. It is an uncontroversial rule that every Supreme Court justice in modern history has applied.Sometimes severability cases are difficult because it is hard to guess how much importance Congress attributed to one provision, especially in a lengthy law like the Affordable Care Act. But this is an easy case: It was Congress, not a court, that eliminated the mandate penalty and left the rest of the statute in place. How can a court conclude that Congress never intended the rest of the statute to exist without an operational mandate, when it was the 2017 Congress itself that decided it was fine to eliminate the penalty and leave the rest of the law intact?Congress is allowed to amend its own law, and the Constitution does not permit any court to undermine that power. Still, Judge O\u2019Connor wrote that we cannot divine the intent of the 2017 Congress because Congress didn\u2019t have the votes to repeal the entire law but wished it could. That\u2019s ridiculous. Congressional intent is all about the votes. One would not say Congress wished it could repeal the Civil Rights Act if only a minority of Congress supported such a move. It is conservative judicial doctrine 101, as repeatedly emphasized by Justice Antonin Scalia, that the best way to understand congressional intent is to look at the text Congress was able to get through the legislative process.Instead, Judge O\u2019Connor goes down a rabbit hole, hypothesizing whether the 2010 Congress would have enacted the entire law without the mandate and whether the law can function without it. What findings Congress made in 2010 are irrelevant to the interpretation of this later legislative act. Regardless, Congress\u2019s own act of 2017 makes clear Congress thinks the law works without an operational mandate. To believe otherwise is to assume Congress enacts unworkable laws and that is not what courts are allowed to presume. Judge O\u2019Connor\u2019s claim to the contrary is the equivalent of saying that your 2017 tax cut isn\u2019t valid because the 2010 Congress also enacted a tax bill, and wouldn\u2019t have included your tax cut there.What happens next? The health law is likely to continue in place while the case moves to the higher courts. California, the leader of a group of states that stepped in to defend the law because the Justice Department refused to do so, will almost certainly go to the Fifth Circuit \u2014 the federal appellate court that presides over Texas \u2014 to have the effects of the decision paused and the case reviewed. The House of Representatives will also likely join the lawsuit once the Democrats take control.If the Fifth Circuit reverses Judge O\u2019Connor, we think it unlikely the Supreme Court will take the case. If the Fifth Circuit upholds the ruling, we are skeptical a majority of the court would sustain this weak analysis.Friday was another sad day for the rule of law \u2014 the deployment of judicial opinions employing questionable legal arguments to support a political agenda. This is not how judges are supposed to act. Reasonable people may disagree on whether the health law represented the best way to reform America\u2019s health care system, and reasonable people may disagree on whether it should be replaced with a different approach. Yet reasonable people should understand such choices are left to Congress, not to the courts.Jonathan H. Adler is a professor of law at the Case Western Reserve University School of Law. Abbe R. Gluck is a professor of law and the faculty director of the Solomon Center for Health Law and Policy at Yale Law School. They filed an amicus brief together in this case.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "5 Ways Facebook Shared Your Data", "Date": "2018-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor years, Facebook gave many large technology companies special access to users\u2019 information. Here\u2019s how it worked.Yahoo said people who opted in to its new features would see their Facebook friends and the articles those friends had read, in a \u201cfacebar\u201d at the top of the Yahoo News site. To accomplish such sharing, the Netflix application had to be able to send Facebook messages. But Netflix was given the ability not only to send private messages but also to read, write and delete them, and to see all participants on a thread. A Netflix spokesman said the company was not aware it had been granted such broad powers and had used the access only for messages sent by the recommendation feature.Netflix deactivated the feature about a year after it was introduced, but documents show that the company still had access to users\u2019 messages in 2017. Spotify, which continues to offer its own similar recommendation feature, also said it was unaware of the special access.Beginning in 2010, if people visited one of those partner sites while logged in to Facebook, a blue bar on the screen would let them know the site was receiving their Facebook data to personalize what they saw. For example, people might see what movies their friends liked, or get tailored search results based on preferences gleaned from Facebook.Facebook eventually wound down instant personalization, but it continued to allow some sites, including Bing and Rotten Tomatoes, access to much of the same data they had been getting for the discontinued feature.The internal documents shed light on a Facebook feature called \u201cPeople You May Know,\u201d a friend-suggestion tool that has long confused and unsettled users. In some deals, Facebook shared information with other companies and in turn received people\u2019s contact details \u2014 data Facebook used to develop complex friend network models and suggest more connections, the documents show. The partners that fed information to the tool included Amazon, Yahoo and the Chinese company Huawei.The tool incorporated Facebook friend lists and allowed people to share articles and make recommendations to other readers. The feature was shut down in 2011, but The Times continued to have access to friend lists until 2017. The Times spokeswoman said they were unaware of the continued access and were not receiving any data for the feature from Facebook.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Beyond the Myth of the War Photographer", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bylensIn \u201cShooting War,\u201d the psychiatrist Anthony Feinstein explores the complexity of photographers\u2019 day-to-day work covering conflict and human depravity.The myth of the war photographer is hard to dispel. Infused with machismo, the Hollywood archetype is the hard-living, scarf-wearing loner dashing from one war zone to the next, with romantic partners as expendable as bullets. But clich\u00e9s ignore the doubts, fears and moral quandaries as well as the loneliness and pain that shadow those who document the depths of human depravity. Such emotional whiplash creates that other clich\u00e9 \u2014 of the tragic, fallen heroes (or heroines) broken by the horrors they\u2019ve witnessed.The reality of the war photographer is, of course, far more nuanced.\u201cUnlike soldiers, they are not schooled in violence,\u201d he writes. \u201cAnd yet their longevity on the front lines is unequaled. Time and again they return to the fray, knowing all too well the toll that in the end is likely to be exacted.\u201dDr. Feinstein is well qualified on this subject. As an unwilling conscript into the South African Army as a young doctor in 1982, he saw combat in Namibia. Decades later, he conducted the first studies on trauma among war journalists and wrote a book, \u201cJournalists Under Fire: the Psychological Hazards of Covering War,\u201d based on the results. The book was also the basis for a documentary film he produced titled \u201cUnder Fire,\u201d which was shortlisted for an Academy Award and won a Peabody Award. In Toronto, where he lives, he has provided psychological support for countless journalists, many of them photographers. (Disclosure: I have undergone therapy with Dr. Feinstein and was one of the journalists profiled in the film.)After documenting the aftermath of the Rwandan genocide, Sebasti\u00e3o Salgado felt a profound sense of sadness coupled with a conviction that mankind had lost its way. Yannis Behrakis, a Greek photographer for Reuters, survived an ambush in Sierra Leone that killed two of his colleagues, one of them his closest friend, Kurt Schork, before crawling three hours through the bush to safety. He later suffered bouts of depression so severe he could barely get out of bed in the morning. Peter Magubane, a black South African who documented inequality under Apartheid, was locked in solitary confinement for 586 days without being convicted of a crime. Another South African, Jo\u00e3o Silva, a photographer for The New York Times, spent years covering the violent end of apartheid and countless wars, losing friends along the way, until he lost both legs after stepping on an improvised explosive device in Afghanistan. Accompanying his profile are three frames he snapped in the aftermath of the blast, his legs shredded, one foot dangling.\u201cAt that time I was as broken as I had ever been,\u201d she told Dr. Feinstein. \u201cEverybody is around for the Pulitzer parties, but then you enter that darkness and find out who really loves you.\u201dConflict journalists are quick to note that what they confront pales in comparison to what the victims of war or disaster endure, Dr. Feinstein writes. Still, Santiago Lyon, who was wounded in Bosnia, reveals that he has known at least a dozen colleagues killed at work. The loss of friends and colleagues, or the loss of a job \u2014 increasingly common in an industry beset by shrinking budgets \u2014 rank among life\u2019s most stressful events, according to a study Dr. Feinstein cited.Beyond broken bodies, there\u2019s growing awareness of damage done to the soul. Those types of injury involve the transgression of an individual\u2019s moral code \u2014 by perpetrating, witnessing, or failing to prevent horrible acts, causing a crisis of conscience or emotional shame.The Australian photographer Ashley Gilbertson, for instance, is haunted by the death of an American Marine assigned to protect him in Iraq, while the French photographer Laurence Geai grapples with her inability have to stopped a mob execution in the Central African Republic.So why do photographers risk being beaten, jailed, tortured, held for ransom, and even maimed or killed? And how do they cope? By Dr. Feinstein\u2019s reckoning, they are both driven and bolstered by their convictions and principles. These act as a kind of emotional armor and a source of resilience.Mr. Gilbertson sought out the family of the Marine who died protecting him and embarked on a redemptive journey photographing bedrooms of service members who never returned from war. Ms. Geai resolved to intervene on subsequent encounters with murderous mobs. Mr. Salgado returned to his family farm. Mr. Behrakis remained creatively engaged. Mr. Magubane had the weight of history on his side. And Mr. Silva focused on his physical recovery and on what he regained each day, not on what he has lost.\u201cIt quickly dawned on me that what he had put in place was a most effective homegrown variant of cognitive behavioral therapy, in which negative ruminations are supplanted by a more forward-looking, problem-oriented way of thinking,\u201d Dr. Feinstein wrote of Mr. Silva. \u201cThere was no time for self-pity. It was all just focus on the day to day, on being strong.\u201dDr. Feinstein cites Nietzsche\u2019s idea that to profit most from existence, we must live dangerously. War offers the electrifying jolt of living on the edge, the deep friendships forged under stress, the hard partying that often follows, as well as encounters with \u201cthe nobility of the human spirit that war paradoxically unmasks,\u201d Dr. Feinstein writes, providing an antidote to the horror.\u201cThese positives surely outweigh the negatives, providing an enduring allure to those with the right temperament,\u201d Dr. Feinstein concludes.And yet, war demands a debt that never goes unpaid. Ultimately, countless factors drive photographers into war\u2019s vortex, but perhaps the simplest reason is best: There are photographs to take and stories to be told.Finbarr O\u2019Reilly is a photographer and the co-author with retired Sgt. Thomas James Brennan of \u201cShooting Ghosts: A U.S. Marine, a Combat Photographer, and Their Journey Back from War,\u201d recently published in paperback by Penguin. An earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to the photographer Carol Guzy's job loss at The Washington Post and failed to attribute the description of her reaction to it. The characterization came from Anthony Feinstein's book \"Shooting War.\"Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Presidency or Prison", "Date": "2018-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat happens if re-election is Trump's best hope of avoiding an indictment?Opinion ColumnistDonald Trump \u2014 or, as he\u2019s known to federal prosecutors, Individual-1 \u2014 might well be a criminal. That\u2019s no longer just my opinion, or that of Democratic activists. It is the finding of Trump\u2019s own Justice Department.Trump\u2019s potential criminality in this case, which raises questions about his legitimacy as president, creates a dilemma for Democrats. Assuming prosecutors are right about Trump\u2019s conduct, it certainly seems impeachable; a situation in which a candidate cheats his way into the presidency is one the founders foresaw when they were designing the impeachment process. As George Mason argued at the Constitutional Convention, \u201cShall the man who has practiced corruption, and by that means procured his appointment in the first instance, be suffered to escape punishment by repeating his guilt?\u201dBut in our current moment, removing the president through impeachment is essentially impossible, given that at least 20 Senate Republicans would have to join Democrats. Representative Jerrold Nadler, the New York Democrat who will soon lead the House Judiciary Committee, told me he wouldn\u2019t consider impeachment proceedings without at least some Republican support. There is certainly no appetite among congressional Democrats to pursue impeachment over a campaign finance case, particularly while the special counsel investigation into Russian collusion chugs on.This leaves us in a dangerous situation. Under Justice Department guidelines, sitting presidents can\u2019t be indicted. Ex-presidents, however, can. Experts on both the left and the right believe that if Trump is voted out of office in 2020, before the five-year statute of limitations on campaign finance violations runs out, he could find himself in serious legal jeopardy. The 2020 presidential election was always going to be extraordinarily ugly, but one can only imagine what Trump will do if the alternative to the White House is the big house. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous,\u201d said Swalwell, who worries that Trump could become even more erratic, making decisions to save himself that involve \u201cour troops or internal domestic security.\u201dOrdinarily, you know that a democracy is failing when electoral losers are threatened with prison. But Trump\u2019s lawlessness is so blatant that impunity \u2014 say, a pardon, or a politically motivated decision not to prosecute \u2014 would also be deeply corrosive, unless it was offered in return for his resignation.There are ways to lower the stakes somewhat. Nadler told me he plans to introduce legislation that would freeze the statute of limitations for crimes committed by presidents, so they could be charged when their terms end. Such a law would at least mean that Trump couldn\u2019t evade justice forever just by winning re-election.That would mitigate the peril to our democracy, but it wouldn\u2019t come close to eliminating it. Our best hope may lie in the emergence of irrefutable evidence of further presidential crimes, enough to finally test the tolerance of at least some fraction of Republicans. \u201cThe story\u2019s not over yet,\u201d Representative Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat and former constitutional law professor, told me. \u201cWe\u2019re just at the beginning of it. After two years of hearing people say we were all trigger-happy on impeachment, now I\u2019m hearing we\u2019re all constitutional fraidy-cats. Give us a chance to do the fact investigation and figure out what happened.\u201d Fair enough. But if the president has committed felonies, we also have to figure out how Republicans might be induced to care.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Sound of Silence", "Date": "2018-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDOMAINSHow many crazy gizmos are needed to achieve your optimum sleep environment?It lulls me to sleep nonetheless, because it blankets the din in my apartment (the ragged snore of a roommate; the clanking of the steam radiator; the cat\u2019s skidding pursuit of something only he can see). It may also soothe because it replicates an early sound environment, probably that of a Manhattan childhood, though perhaps it suggests something much, much older. Some sleep experts note that babies, their ears accustomed to the whisper of the maternal circulatory system and the slosh of the womb, sleep better accompanied by a device that mimics those familiar whooshings.My app is but one note in the mighty chorus of white-noise generators, an exploding industry of mechanical and digital devices; apps and websites, and Sonos and Spotify playlists that grows ever more refined, as if to block out the increased rate of speeding, the wrecks, on the information superhighway. The first so-called domestic white-noise machine may have been built in 1962, by a traveling salesman whose wife grew used to the air-conditioners in the motels they frequented and was unable to sleep at home. But white noise was identified by engineers as early as the 1920s, Dr. Pigeon said, and used as a test signal because, as he put it, \u201cit\u2019s the sum of all the audible frequencies in equal proportion in a single sound. It\u2019s so named because of its analogy to light, which turns white when all visible frequencies are summed up into a single beam.\u201dFred Maher is a veteran music producer and drummer who works as an audio engineer and audio-quality tester. He has what are considered golden ears, meaning he is an expert listener who can spot audio errors in music, film and television content. He also suffers from tinnitus, a condition he soothed for years with machines like the Dohm. (That device is now in the bedroom of his 6-year-old daughter, Ruby.)Sleep is inherently dangerous, said Rafael Pelayo, a clinical professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Stanford Center for Sleep Sciences and Medicine. This is why we are wired to sort sounds as we sleep, he said, to differentiate the threats, or a baby\u2019s cry, from more benign noises. \u201cHow can a mother feed her baby if the ability to wake up is not wired into our brain?\u201d Dr. Pelayo said. \u201cThe thalamus needs to decide if a noise is worth informing the cortex. There\u2019s a concept in sleep called the arousal threshold \u2014 it\u2019s the stimulus you need to go from a deep sleep to awake. It can be a loud noise, like a garbage truck, or something soft, like your partner saying, \u2018Honey, I think there\u2019s a burglar in the house.\u2019 The idea of a noise generator is to raise the background noise so you don\u2019t notice the sounds that aren\u2019t worth your attention: a snoring partner or the hotel elevator.\u201d There is no data that suggests a white-noise machine alters the frequencies of the brain, said Param Dedhia, the director of sleep medicine at the Canyon Ranch in Tucson. \u201cBut we can show that if you make a loud sound, you can affect your response to that with a noise machine. It\u2019s called auditory masking.\u201d Dr. Dedhia described its effects as a sound bubble, \u201ca force field of sound such that a noise has to be much stronger to break through.\u201d Dr. Dedhia has deployed Marpac Dohms in the bedrooms at Canyon Ranch, and also in his home, because the pool there draws an army of bullfrogs after dark. Their nightly chorus drives him bananas. \u201cOh, my friend,\u201d he said, \u201cit sounds like someone dying. I used to get my hose and spray them off the sides of the pool, but they soon were on to me, and after a while just hopped back on. So now I have my humidifier running, and the white noise right next to the bed. It\u2019s my sound bubble. We don\u2019t have to have a bug or pill for every ill if we can soothe ourselves. It\u2019s a skill, it really is. If we could all self-soothe, it would make it easier to handle other chaos.\u201dNoise is terribly subjective. There are those who love the croak of a bullfrog, and are soothed by the snores of their partner because it means they are close. Dr. Pigeon allowed that snoring was particularly tough to mask, given its locality (next to your head) and unpredictability (your ears crane for the next growl or explosive sigh). \u201cYou must convince yourself the sound of snoring is beautiful,\u201d he said. \u201cI have some people who asked me to put snoring on the website because they are used to sleeping with a partner snoring, and when that partner is gone \u2014 traveling or divorced or dead \u2014 they miss that sound.\u201dWorth a try.An insomniac himself, Dr. Pigeon is not soothed by his soundscapes because he knows them by heart and will fret over dissonances only he can perceive. \u201cA particular wave on the Irish Coast that crashes too loudly, or a bird that sings in the wrong place,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a brain that can\u2019t stop working,\u201d he added sadly. \u201cI haven\u2019t found a way to stop its chatter.\u201d\u201cOne man\u2019s castle is usually above another man\u2019s castle,\u201d Mr. Fierstein said. \u201cYou have this huge amount of real-estate appreciation, and people are paying a lot of money and as a result they feel like they can do what they want.\u201d Many co-ops and condominiums are now requiring, he said, that an acoustical consultant like himself attest that a proposed renovation, \u201cwith its media rooms and central air-conditioning, and apartment combinations that put his fancy new kitchen over your son\u2019s bedroom,\u201d will not produce any undue noises.Mr. Fierstein can design noise programs that are perfectly tuned to block the pure tones, as he put it, of outside irritants, like bus noises or building mechanicals, that can be played on any speaker system. (He described a pure tone as any sound that has a specific and constant musical pitch, and then demonstrated by making a high beeping noise into the phone.)\u201cThe way to block a noise is not to be as loud or louder\u201d than the offending sound, he said. \u201cYou also have to produce sound that\u2019s on the same frequency. One of the things that makes noise so unreasonable is the lack of control. You can\u2019t stand your neighbor\u2019s loud music even if it\u2019s your favorite artist. One benefit of masking noise is that you can call it your own.\u201dRecently Mr. Fierstein was called in to mediate a dispute between two neighbors, one of whom was so irked by the sound of the other\u2019s air-conditioner that he positioned eight white-noise machines throughout his studio apartment, the noise of which then annoyed the air-conditioner man. It was the noise-machine man who sent for Mr. Fierstein. His report noted that the air-conditioner, a window unit, was emitting \u201caudible pure tones,\u201d he said, and may have been improperly mounted, shaking the framing of the building. That would be a win for noise-machine man, though the building\u2019s management has yet to weigh in. Mr. Suarez, the technician whose recipe for a roughed-up box fan appeared on Reddit, suggested that the increased racket we hear is more often living in our heads. The noises we use to \u201cquiet\u201d them are a kind of placebo, he said. Mr. Suarez noted the constant commotions of the news cycle and social media, and made the point that we don\u2019t do enough physical activities during the day to dissipate our energies. \u201cEven if you turn off the pings on your phone and turn away from your devices,\u201d he said, speaking from his van as he drove to a job, \u201cyou\u2019re still thinking, \u2018What\u2019s happening with Facebook? With Congress?\u2019 There is so much going on, and so little resolution. When was the last time you heard the end of a story?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What We Know About Diet and Weight Loss", "Date": "2018-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter decades of research, there are shockingly few firm conclusions. You\u2019d think that scientists at an international conference on obesity would know by now which diet is best, and why. As it turns out, even the experts still have widely divergent opinions. People vary \u2014 a lot \u2014 in how they respond to dieting.Dr. George Bray, an obesity researcher who is emeritus professor at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, La., sums it up this way: \u201cEat the diet you like and stay with it.\u201dThere is nothing new in the diet universe.Many of the diets people swear by today have been around in various incarnations for decades. More than a century ago, a best-selling book, \u201cHow to Live,\u201d told Americans that the only way to lose weight was to count calories. Low-carbohydrate diets were introduced by a London undertaker, William Banting, in 1863 and became so popular that one word for dieting was \u201cbanting.\u201dDiet studies are insanely difficult.Most are short-term, and often it is hard to know if subjects really adhere to the plans they were given. Few studies follow participants for a year or more to see if they kept the weight off. Little of this research is ever definitive, and most of it leaves plenty of room for skepticism, argument and debate.Dieting for better health is not necessarily the same as dieting to lose weight.Any diet that restricts calories will result in weight loss, but some diets simply are not healthy even if you are shedding pounds. They also agree that people with diabetes or high blood sugar levels often benefit from a diet low in carbohydrates.Why do people have such varying responses to diets?Is it genes? Dr. Gardner looked at participants in his study to see if he could find genes that predicted their responses to their assigned diets. He could not. Other scientists also have failed to find particular genetic predictors. That does not mean there are no genes involved in diet and weight loss. But it is hard to disentangle those effects from other possibilities. Motivation, for instance: One person may be mentally ready to diet, while another might make only a halfhearted effort, surrendering to temptation after a short time on the assigned diet. Some researchers believe that the body\u2019s production of insulin in response to dietary carbohydrates may explain why some dieters lose weight and others do not. Dr. Ludwig found such a link in his study. But Dr. Gardner found no such effect, and the moderator of the symposium, Kevin Hall of the National Institutes of Health, argued that the disputed link does not hold up to close scrutiny. Is there a diet that prevents you from regaining lost weight?Dr. Ludwig was trying to ameliorate this effect with a low-carbohydrate diet. Whether it worked is still subject to scientific debate, and for now the question is still open. Have sugary foods been making people fat?We just don\u2019t know to what extent added sugar contributes to the obesity epidemic. Many scientists think it is a factor, but not necessarily more potent than some others, such as refined grains. No one is advocating a diet of sugary foods, but many leading researchers are hesitant to blame a single ingredient for widespread obesity. Why have people become fatter in recent decades?The big unanswered question. The problem here is that so many things changed in our society while the obesity epidemic gathered steam. Some changes ought to have lowered weights: the availability of cheaper, fresher fruits and vegetables; the popularity of walking and gyms; increased nutrition education in schools, and improvements to school lunches. Other societal trends could have encouraged weight gain: ever-larger portion sizes; a growing tendency to snack all day; more people eating more meals out; and a cultural acceptance of overweight to the point where it now seems almost normal.And then there is the decline in smoking. It has been an enormous health benefit, of course. But smokers weigh less than nonsmokers on average; when people stop smoking, their weight usually goes up. How are these forces working together to drive up weight over all? That, no one knows.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Power of Supreme Court Choices", "Date": "2018-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA combative approach from George H.W. Bush put Clarence Thomas on the court and and has been embraced by Mitch McConnell and other Republicans.Contributing Opinion Writer It\u2019s not hard for a new president, in concert with Congress, to erase a predecessor\u2019s legislative, regulatory and diplomatic accomplishments. It\u2019s a president\u2019s Supreme Court legacy that lasts. Many retrospectives on the life of President George H.W. Bush, who died last Friday, noted that one of the two men he named to the court, Clarence Thomas, is now in his 27th year as a justice and, at age 70, is on track to become one of the longest-serving Supreme Court justices in history.Justice David H. Souter, who in 1990 became President Bush\u2019s first Supreme Court appointee, has received much less attention in recent days, perhaps because he retired nine years ago and has avoided the spotlight ever since. The soft-spoken New Hampshire judge never became a lightning rod except to those on the right who, while thrilling to Justice Thomas\u2019s hard-edge originalism, were sorely vexed by Justice Souter\u2019s modestly progressive jurisprudence. While one became an icon, the other became the object of a negative mantra: \u201cNo more Souters.\u201dOf course, Supreme Court nominations are bound to reflect the priorities of the individual who serves in the White House, and the first President Bush, whose primary focus was on foreign policy, simply wasn\u2019t very interested in the Supreme Court. So in July 1990, when Justice William Brennan had a stroke and retired abruptly and unexpectedly on a Friday afternoon, the president acted with dispatch to get the pesky distraction of a sudden court vacancy off his desk.It took all of a single weekend. On Monday afternoon, having interviewed Mr. Souter and another potential nominee, Judge Edith Jones of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, President Bush announced his choice. The president told reporters that he had not taken \u201cthe litmus test approach\u201d and had not questioned the nominee about his views on abortion or anything else. \u201cI have too much respect for the Supreme Court for that,\u201d President Bush said. He added that he expected the nominee\u2019s credentials to carry the day in the Democratic-controlled Senate. \u201cWe\u2019re not bracing for some horrendous fight with the United States Senate,\u201d he said.And that was that. President Bush made his choice at the urging of a Republican senator from New Hampshire, Warren Rudman. Senator Rudman was David Souter\u2019s longtime mentor, having preceded him as the state\u2019s attorney general; later, he engineered his appointment first to the New Hampshire Supreme Court and then to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. President Bush\u2019s chief of staff, John Sununu, a former New Hampshire governor whose hard-right conservatism contrasted sharply with Senator Rudman\u2019s more traditional brand of New England Republicanism, praised the Souter appointment as \u201ca home run for conservatives.\u201d But he had ample reason to know that was not the case. In fact, according to rumor at the time, Mr. Sununu had privately urged the appointment of Judge Jones, a deeply conservative and polarizing figure on her court, where she still serves. A Jones nomination would most likely have engendered a \u201chorrendous fight\u201d reminiscent of the battle over President Ronald Reagan\u2019s nomination of Judge Robert Bork, whom the Senate had rejected less than three years earlier. President Bush saw no reason to go down that road. The vote to confirm Judge Souter was 90 to 9.The scenario was much different the following year. On June 27, 1991, the final day of the Supreme Court term, Justice Thurgood Marshall announced his retirement. Once again, President Bush wasted no time. Given the need to prevent the Supreme Court from reverting to an all-white body, as it had been before Justice Marshall\u2019s arrival in 1967, and given the extreme scarcity of conservative African-Americans then in a position to be nominated, there was one obvious choice, and he was sitting in his judicial chambers a mile from the White House.Barely two years earlier, President Bush had named Clarence Thomas to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. That appointment had been widely seen as an effort to place the young lawyer, only 41 at the time, in the launch position for the Supreme Court. It took only four days after Justice Marshall\u2019s retirement announcement for President Bush to select Judge Thomas, describing him \u201cthe best man for the job on the merits.\u201d The nomination was understood in ideological as well as racial terms; as head of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Clarence Thomas had given a series of speeches that underscored his conservative credentials, which he attempted to disavow during his confirmation hearing.Poles apart, the Souter and Thomas nominations offered templates for the presidencies that followed. Democrats have shied from confrontation, while Republicans have generally embraced and even sought it. President Trump declared on his final campaign swing before the midterm elections last month that \u201cthis will be the election of Kavanaugh.\u201d It\u2019s impossible to imagine President Bill Clinton declaring before the 1994 midterms that \u201cthis will be the election of Stephen Breyer,\u201d his middle-of-the-road Supreme Court nominee who was confirmed that year by a vote of 87 to 9.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bangladesh Elections: Choice of \u2018Lesser of Two Evils,\u2019 Voters Say", "Date": "2018-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 Bangladeshi voters will decide in parliamentary elections on Sunday whether to punish the governing party for worsening human rights conditions or reward it for overseeing a booming economy.During Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina\u2019s two terms, the economy and social development have improved, according to most measures. But as she has tightened her grip on power, fundamental rights have been eroded.Now the 71-year-old leader is seeking her third consecutive term on Sunday. In defending her record, Mrs. Hasina questioned the very definition of human rights.\u201cIf I can provide food, jobs and health care, that is human rights,\u201d she said this month in an interview with The New York Times. She vowed, if re-elected, to deliver 10 percent annual growth, up from the current 7.8 percent, and eliminate extreme poverty while continuing to strengthen welfare programs.\u201cWhat the opposition is saying, or civil society or your N.G.O.\u2019s \u2014 I don\u2019t bother with that,\u201d she said of nongovernmental organizations and her critics. \u201cI know my country, and I know how to develop my country. My biggest challenge is that no one is left behind.\u201dLocal activists, political rivals and international rights organizations accuse Mrs. Hasina of co-opting state institutions like the judiciary and the police.Some Bangladeshis have been punished after speaking against the government, and a new law on digital security gives the police sweeping powers to monitor people\u2019s activity online and arrest critics without warrants. There are fears she will become even more heavy-handed should she win a new term.Mrs. Hasina and her Awami League are pitted against the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party. The country has vacillated between the two parties since the advent of democracy in 1991, when military rule ended.Mrs. Hasina dismissed such criticism from local and international organizations.\u201cThey are trying to please their donors and exaggerating,\u201d she said, to get more funding.\u201cHe was doing propaganda against the government and instigating people to violence,\u201d Mrs. Hasina said of Mr. Alam, who has been freed on bail but could still face prison time.Voters complain this election gives them few real choices. The opposition coalition is dominated by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party but encompasses some two dozen parties bound by little other than their desire to check the prime minister\u2019s hold on power.It is unclear which candidate the opposition would vote in as prime minister should it clinch a majority of the 300 seats up for grabs in the election.The Bangladesh Nationalist Party\u2019s own track record is marred. Even its secretary general, Mirza Fakhul Islam Alamgir, acknowledged in an interview this month that human rights violations and corruption flourished under his party in the past, with extrajudicial killings and disappearances used as governance tools.But Mr. Alamgir and his allies say that violations under the B.N.P. government were limited and that, given another chance, they would govern well.Some voters who are satisfied with the economic development under Mrs. Hasina\u2019s leadership may still vote for the B.N.P., not because they think the party has a greater affinity for human rights, but because they hope to salvage democracy, they say, by providing a check on the governing party in Parliament.\u201cWe are choosing the lesser of two evils in our politics,\u201d said Iftekharuzzaman, who goes by one name and is the executive director of the Bangladesh arm of Transparency International, a corruption watchdog.\u201cAll government institutions have a stake in the elections now; they have been politicized strongly,\u201d he said, adding that if Mrs. Hasina \u201cwins a third term, she will increase her authoritarianism, her hold over the state.\u201d\u201cThe only silver lining one can see out of this mess is a Parliament with a significant opposition to provide some checks and balances,\u201d Mr. Iftekharuzzaman said.He and Human Rights Watch say that the governing party has undermined an open campaigning process, with the police intimidating opposition candidates and protesters, imprisoning politicians for several days under false charges and tearing down their posters.The B.N.P. said this month that 10 of its candidates are in prison and 6,000 party loyalists have been arrested.\u201cIf we have a multiparty system, a Parliament that works and a government without absolute power, then this election may be worth the intimidation,\u201d said Kamal Hossain, the head of the opposition coalition. He had previously been allied with Mrs. Hasina.Independent observers say that antipathy toward incumbents is strong and that it is hard to determine whether Mrs. Hasina will win on Sunday. But the opposition is plagued by bitter infighting, and the manifestoes of the B.N.P. and the Awami League are nearly identical, promising vague paths to continued economic growth and better welfare programs.Mrs. Hasina said in her interview that the right to criticize the government freely is only a concern of the urbanized elites. She says her government has delivered on what rural Bangladeshis are most concerned with: getting food on the table, medical care and jobs.Per capita income has increased by nearly 150 percent, while the share of the population living in extreme poverty has shrunk to about 9 percent from 19 percent, according to the World Bank.Electricity generation has also increased drastically under Mrs. Hasina\u2019s rule, helping to boost factory production and spreading out to homes in rural areas. The rates of maternal mortality and illiteracy have also declined.Sultana Kamal, a Bangladeshi activist who was once close to Mrs. Hasina but has become increasingly wary of her, said a win by the current government would be seen as an indifference by voters to rights concerns.\u201cIf Awami League returns, they will say, \u2018The critics are criticizing us, but we returned to power on the people\u2019s vote. The people don\u2019t care about extrajudicial killings, human rights or corruption,\u2019\u201d she said.Bangladesh\u2019s telecoms regulator has ordered mobile operators to shut down high-speed mobile internet services until midnight on Sunday, the day of a national election.Activists are worried that the shut down will prevent election monitors from sharing information about any irregularities at polling stations and alerting the public.For Rashed Khan, a student who moved to Dhaka from a farming village to attend college, resentment of the crackdown on freedom of expression and assembly is not limited to city-dwellers, as the prime minister says.\u201cI am from a village,\u201d Mr. Khan said. \u201cVillage politics are important; they want to be able to speak their minds.\u201dLike other activists, Mr. Khan says democratic ideals cannot be sacrificed for economic growth.\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t the government want our opinion, our input?\u201d asked Mr. Khan. \u201cIf we have no rights to criticize the government, this development doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It is important to them to share what is happening in the region, stories they believe will be among the most vital in the world as concern over climate change continues to grow.\u201cWhen we do books, we won\u2019t be able to get to everybody on the planet,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a little puzzle in a bigger picture. Some people might see it and start thinking about things. People in the Arctic have hardly anything to do with what\u2019s happening in the Arctic. It\u2019s more pollution from other countries.\u201dWith respect to the glaciers\u2019 current status, he reported that they are shrinking by 100 meters per year and that scientists predict they will disappear entirely within two centuries. Additionally, as the ice melts, it lessens pressure on Iceland\u2019s volcanoes, which makes them more likely to erupt.\u201cThere is a danger ahead because the pressure is less and the volcanoes are waking up,\u201d RAX said. \u201cWe are waiting for huge eruptions, actually, which is a bigger threat. One erupted in 1362 and killed everybody that was living underneath. Everything was destroyed, kind of like Pompeii.\u201dBeyond the science, though, these photographs are intended as art rather than just documentation, as seen in the emphasis on line, shape, texture and contrast. Many look like Renaissance etchings, or charcoal drawings; a function of the strong separation of whites and blacks in the pictures, and in the glacial landscape of snow, ice and ash.The famed Danish-Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson, in a foreword for the book, wrote of this proclivity: \u201cAxelsson is clearly comfortable with the abstract and with the patterns that physical landscapes create. He embraces the commingling of abstraction and beauty head-on, yet his pictures are always present, accessible, there for you.\u201dHe is motivated by a desire to know he did something meaningful in what may be the great battle of the 21st century \u2014 the fight to save the planet. But he also wants to make sure that there is a poetic record of his beloved glaciers, in case we do face a world without them. He called the book an ode or a love letter.For now, that appears to be the likely future for all of Iceland\u2019s glaciers.\u201cIt will be a sad world without them, because it\u2019s a very beautiful thing to see,\u201d RAX said. \u201cThe pearls of Iceland are its glaciers.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Germany\u2019s Far Right Rebrands: Friendlier Face, Same Doctrine", "Date": "2018-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHALLE, Germany \u2014 Christmas carols were playing and the scent of ginger hung in the crisp December air. Students sold organic plum compote and served mulled wine in biodegradable cups made from sugar cane. But then there were the postcards.\u201cIslamization? Not with us,\u201d read one. \u201cDefend yourself! This is your country,\u201d urged another. \u201cFortress Europe,\u201d said a third. \u201cShut the borders.\u201dThis was no ordinary Christmas market, but one hosted by Generation Identity, a far-right youth movement under observation by several European intelligence services. Part hippie, part hipster, the activists of Generation Identity are one result of a broad image makeover the far right has tried to give itself in recent years.Better dressed, better educated and less angry than the skinheads of old \u2014 at least in public \u2014 they see themselves on the front line of a counterrevolution fought by a loose but increasingly well-networked web of actors in politics, publishing, civil society and business who call themselves the \u201cnew right.\u201dTheir aim: to bring down liberalism and rid Europe of non-European immigrants.The \u201cnew right\u201d seeks to distance itself from the \u201cold right,\u201d which in Germany means neo-Nazis. Many analysts and officials consider this little more than clever rebranding. But they worry that it could allow groups like Generation Identity to act as a conduit between conservatism and extremism and draw young people into their orbit.The number of committed Generation Identity followers in Germany is relatively small, estimated by Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence service at 400 to 500, and there are thought to be a few thousand Europewide. But officials say the number of sympathizers is far larger.Despite a ban from Facebook, which deprived the group of an important campaigning and fund-raising platform, its members continue to be active on YouTube, Twitter and the Russian platform VK, where slick branding amplifies their message.\u201cThey have given extremism a friendly face,\u201d said Stephan Kramer, the domestic intelligence chief of the east-central state of Thuringia.Several Generation Identity activists have a past in avowed neo-Nazi circles. But their methods are straight out of a leftist playbook.\u201cWe are a kind of Greenpeace for Germany,\u201d said Philip Thaler, a 25-year-old political-science student and a co-founder of the Halle chapter of Generation Identity.He and his fellow activists sip cafe lattes or \u201cIdentity Pils,\u201d their own branded craft beer, and discuss the future of the welfare state, which they contend is doomed at current levels of immigration. They study and date across European borders (Mr. Thaler\u2019s girlfriend is French).And they pride themselves in their rebellion. \u201cWe are the punks of today,\u201d said Ingrid Weiss, a 24-year-old Austrian activist. \u201cIf you want to be a rebel today you have to be on the right.\u201dLiberals are furious when far-right extremists are normalized. But it is one of the wrinkles of the new right that their lifestyles are familiar and modern \u2014 and so are some of their ideas: They bemoan rising inequality and a consumerism bereft of moral meaning.When it comes to migration, they have purged their language of crude racism. Instead of \u201cGermany to the Germans\u201d or \u201cforeigners out,\u201d they call for \u201cre-migration\u201d \u2014 meaning sending immigrants who do not assimilate back to their ancestral homes.They call themselves \u201cethnopluralists,\u201d arguing that all cultures would thrive by remaining broadly homogeneous, and accuse liberal politicians of engineering a \u201cgreat replacement\u201d to supplant white Europeans with Muslims.In this worldview, it is liberals who are undermining Western democracy by overstretching the welfare state and allowing fundamentalist Islam into the country.The intellectual veneer on what is ultimately an argument against pluralism is typical of the new right, Mr. Kramer said. \u201cWhen you break it down, it\u2019s nothing but the racial theories that existed under the Nazis,\u201d he said.The different layers of the far right are neatly crystallized in the four-story apartment building opposite the university campus in Halle that hosted the recent Christmas market.From the outside, the building looks innocuous enough. There are patches of graffiti on the facade and a communal garden project in the back. Rap blares from an open window. Young people in hoodies flow in and out the front door.But inside, the ecosystem of the \u201cnew right\u201d comes into focus: Bought by the secretive Titurel foundation, which was set up by a wealthy Bavarian donor, the building houses a bar, a library and communal living space for the activists of Generation Identity.Officially, the AfD has no links to Generation Identity. But in Halle one recent afternoon, the links were openly touted.\u201cWe have street activists, we have a think tank, we have a publishing house and we have a political party in Parliament,\u201d said Simon Kaupert of One Percent.Mr. Kaupert used to work for the AfD. Over all, \u201cdozens\u201d of supporters of Generation Identity work for the party, he said.Franziska Schreiber, who left the AfD last year and has written a book about the party, estimates that \u201cat least half the members of the AfD\u2019s own youth wing are followers of Generation Identity.\u201dThomas Haldenwang, the new domestic intelligence chief, speaks of a \u201cnew dynamic on the right\u201d and announced recently that he would increase the number of agents dealing with the far right by 50 percent. In January, his office is expected to decide whether the AfD will come under general observation.\u201cWe\u2019ve known for a long time that numerous followers of Generation Identity work for the AfD in different parliaments,\u201d said Konstantin von Notz, a lawmaker of the Greens party and deputy leader of the parliamentary committee that oversees the intelligence services. \u201cA deliberate infiltration of democratic institutions is taking place.\u201dDespite having cleaned up their language, Mr. von Notz said, \u201cThey are deeply anti-Democratic, often very anti-Semitic and openly racist.\u201dAt the recent Christmas market, activists disputed this. But they openly expressed their admiration for Hungary\u2019s semi-authoritarian prime minister, Victor Orban, and Italy\u2019s nationalist vice premier Matteo Salvini.Mr. Thaler said his main motivation for joining the movement had been his frustration with not being allowed to say he was proud to be German.\u201cIf you are a patriot, if you support ethnocultural identity, you are immediately being put in the extremist corner,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have to justify myself for saying, yes, there is such a thing as Germany, and we want to preserve it.\u201dThis is where liberalism has failed, Mr. Kramer said.\u201cThese people operate in the moral vacuum that has been left by our politicians,\u201d he said. \u201cPatriotism, community, identity \u2014 these are instinctive needs people have and that were denied them for a long time.\u201dThat some of their views can now be heard in Parliaments and on the street gives them a new quality. \u201cThe question is: Can we still stop it?\u201d Mr. Kramer said. \u201cThat\u2019s a question that concerns our liberal democracy.\u201dChristopher F.

Between the ages of 6 and 13, she excelled in swimming and table tennis, represented her school in softball and badminton, and became a member of the Malaysian national rhythmic gymnastics team.At age 14, Ms. Chua switched to golf because her parents worried about the strict dietary restrictions imposed upon gymnasts.\u201cI was used to training hard for gymnastics so golf worked for me,\u201d said Ms. Chua, who was 15 when she won the Hong Kong MacGregor Junior Open in 2003.She dated a soccer player but found romance difficult. \u201cIt was hard to have a relationship because athletes travel constantly, and there were issues with trust, exclusivity and different schedules,\u201d she said.\u201cI watched Wes pick up my bed and carry it out to the truck,\u201d she said of that spring day in 2011. \u201cI liked his build and thought he was hot. We didn\u2019t talk long but he seemed confident, almost arrogant, yet carried himself well.\u201dThough Mr. Griswold was attracted to her, it was the wrong time. \u201cI was newly single after a long romance and not looking to dive into a relationship,\u201d he said.A few weeks later when Ms. Chua was in Florida for golf tournaments she initiated a conversation with Mr. Griswold on Facebook that turned to texting. Shortly after, Mr. Griswold, now 30, was driving from North Carolina to Florida and asked if she would meet for dinner at a Chili\u2019s in Orlando. She thought it was a date, but he merely wanted a dinner partner.\u201cNot only did he not offer to pick up the check, but he ordered a huge slice of chocolate cake and ate it all himself while I watched,\u201d she said. \u201cI was upset and didn\u2019t want to see him again.\u201dBut when he asked her to go bowling a few weeks later she drove down rural roads to meet him in Frostproof, a small Florida town where he was raised and his parents have a lakefront home. When he introduced them to Ms. Chua, his father Mike Griswold, who liked her \u201ccharisma and energy,\u201d and suspected his son did, too.Bowling that night was fun if not romantic. \u201cWe shared a love for competition early on,\u201d Mr. Griswold said. \u201cJean was different from other women I had dated because she seemed genuine, down to earth and not self-centered. She liked to help others.\u201dTwo weeks later, Ms. Chua played 36 holes in North Carolina and qualified for the L.P.G.A. United States Women\u2019s Open that July. After texting Mr. Griswold of her good fortune, he persuaded her to visit him in Panama City. Excited about qualifying and Mr. Griswold\u2019s invitation, she drove all night and arrived at 7 a.m.For the next few days, they hung out at the beach, interacted with his parents, and shared a kiss. She then asked him to caddie for her at the Open. He was \u201cshocked\u201d because that tournament is the most important in women\u2019s golf and professionals use experienced caddies. \u201cIt would be my first time at a professional event, and the stage couldn\u2019t be bigger,\u201d he said.After returning to the United States, she joined Mr. Griswold at the Broadmoor in Colorado Springs for the Open, where they shared a room and strategized her game. \u201cHe was an amazing caddie,\u201d she said. \u201cI made the cut and was paired with the No. 1 and No. 3 players in the world.\u201dDuring the Open, Mr. Griswold took notes, carried the bag, cleaned her clubs, did the laundry, planned their meals and kept their room spotless. \u201cI wanted her to rest and stay focused on golf,\u201d he said. \u201cMaking the cut was a big deal. The entire week was an experience we will always cherish, especially since it was the beginning of our relationship.\u201dThe next month, in August 2011, she was touring full time and they rented an apartment together in Winston-Salem, where Mr. Griswold had one more year of college. He caddied for her on weekends, and she helped him with math. He finished a degree in interdisciplinary studies.The couple then moved to St. Petersburg, Fla., in 2012 and the following year he received an M.B.A. at the University of Tampa. All the while, they toured in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, India and Malaysia, always working to improve her game.\u201cWes swallowed his ego,\u201d said Dianne Dailey, Ms. Chua\u2019s coach at Wake Forest. \u201cMost men don\u2019t want to play second fiddle but he was the opposite. He didn\u2019t talk about what he was doing only about what she was doing.\u201dStill, too much togetherness got tough. They argued constantly about anything from club selection to reading putts, and she fired him at least 10 times. \u201cI am surprised we didn\u2019t kill each other,\u201d Ms. Chua said. \u201cIt was hard working so closely with someone you\u2019re dating.\u201dThe business arguments would continue off the course because they were always in the same car driving to the next tour location and eating meals together. They both recalled taking six- to 10-hour car rides in silence.\u201cAlthough her anger would upset me, if I think an argument is petty, I ignore it, which drives Jean crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cIf its something more significant then we discuss and eventually resolve by communicating.\u201dMost of their conflicts were a result of Mr. Griswold pushing Ms. Chua to be a better golfer. (Her best years were 2012 with five top-10 finishes and 2013 with two on the Symetra Tour.) If she had a bad round and looked to him for consolation, he might give her one sentence then delve into everything she did wrong.\u201cIf I didn\u2019t do well, I would blame him,\u201d she said.In 2013, at the Symetra Classic in Charlotte, they fought about a particular shot. She scored 8 on a par-4 hole and followed it with a 6 on another par-4. She made the cut but was discouraged about her performance. \u201cWes was furious, so no consolation from him,\u201d Ms. Chua said. \u201cI sat in a field by myself and cried. I wanted someone to hold me and tell me it was going to be O.K. Wes wasn\u2019t lovey-dovey boyfriend material, but being an athlete himself, he put my career first and made me a greater golfer when he was caddying for me, and I love him for that.\u201d\u201cWes is a wood-element dragon child meaning brave, strong and frank, while Jean is a fire-element rabbit child, diplomatic, considerate, generous and smart,\u201d said her father Chua Beng Yap. \u201cIn the end, the male dragon is attracted to the tenderness and kindness of the female rabbit, and the female rabbit likes and appreciates the strong and brave male dragon.\u201dIn 2014, when Mr. Griswold started his career as a business unit manager at Jabil, an electronic manufacturing services company based in St. Petersburg, Ms. Chua had to tour solo. \u201cWe argued more when we were apart, but texted frequently because we missed being together,\u201d said Ms. Chua, who tried so hard to succeed that she began to deteriorate physically.After nearly 7 years, and traveling to 10 countries and 30 states together, Mr. Griswold finally felt settled, financially secure, and ready to propose. \u201cIt was time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe overcame every challenge, still laugh a lot, and remain compassionate about the same things, including golf, life goals, family and travel.\u201dOn Dec. 13, during a snowy ski vacation in Big Sky, Mont., they were hiking on a back trail with his young nephew when Mr. Griswold was overcome by the scenery. \u201cI hadn\u2019t planned an exact time but the location was remote and beautiful,\u201d he said.They were married Nov. 11 by Jay Steffel, a friend who was ordained by American Marriage Ministries, outside the Omni Grove Park Inn in Asheville, N.C., overlooking the Blue Ridge Mountains.In her vows, Ms. Chua got a loud laugh from their 72 guests when she told Mr. Griswold, \u201cI will listen to you.\u201dAfter Mr. Steffel pronounced them married, guests cheered the bride and groom, who were wrapped in a long kiss.\u201cWes is not emotional, but Jean appreciates the little things, and pulls the greatness out of him,\u201d said the best man, Glen Mabe, who believes that Mr. Griswold has become a better person since he met Ms. Chua. \u201cThrough good and bad times, they have grown and matured together creating a special bond that will last.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Watch This Wolf Go Fishing", "Date": "2018-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesYes, researchers in Minnesota have recorded wolves diving into a stream to grab a meal. Wolves are thought of as red-meat eaters, but a team of biologists in northern Minnesota, near Voyageurs National Park, has documented a pack that often enjoys a meal of fish.Wolves in Yellowstone have been known to chow down on trout, but it\u2019s unclear whether they actually caught the fish or if the catch was already dead. \u201cIt is exceedingly rare, but they do it,\u201d said Douglas Smith, the park\u2019s wolf biologist.Wolves were collared by the Voyageurs Wolf Project for research into pack territory and prey, primarily beaver but also deer fawns and moose calves. If wolves spent more than 20 minutes without moving, researchers went to the site to see if they were eating and if so, what it was.Tom Gable, a doctoral student working on the project, noticed from GPS data that wolves from a pack named Bowman\u2019s Bay were spending a lot of time near a stream. He made a trek into the forest to see why.When he arrived, he found a wolf on the bank of the stream. \u201cWhen I saw it, just eight meters away, it was running full-steam into the middle of the creek and then it ran back out,\u201d he said. Mr. Gable saw the wolf crunching fish parts, and later found wolf tracks intermingled with fish remnants along the creek.Researchers set up remote cameras on that section of creek, and discovered the techniques a wolf uses to capture aquatic prey. \u201cThe wolves are standing next to the creek in the dark, just listening or looking,\u201d Mr. Gable said. \u201cYou can see the wolves abruptly head to the water several times after hearing a splash \u2014 they learned what a fish splashing in the creek sounds like, and they know that it means food. Incredible.\u201dThe researchers have compiled GPS data from seven packs in the area, but this is the only one that appears to fish. The researchers have seen five wolves from the Bowman\u2019s Bay pack fishing, and data show that two of them spent from 43 to 63 percent of their time fishing for spawning suckers along the creek.\u201cGiven the impressive adaptability of wolves to find food, it is not entirely surprising,\u201d said Joseph Bump, an associate professor of wildlife research at the University of Minnesota.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Fight to Save the Traditional Tortilla", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn Mexico, this staple \u2014 made with heirloom corn \u2014 is under pressure from mass production and modernity, but small producers are pushing back.TLAXIACO, Mexico \u2014 Petra Cruz Gonz\u00e1lez wakes at 6 every morning to make some 400 tortillas by hand. Despite a few modern advancements, like an electric flour mill and a metal hand press, she still cooks them over a wood fire as she learned to do when she was 8 years old.The city\u2019s 25 tortiller\u00eda shops have severely cut into their sales, and Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez often has to work until 10 p.m. to sell all her tortillas. She charges 10 pesos (about 50 cents) for six, but this covers little more than her expenses. She often trades any remaining tortillas for food from other vendors.\u201cThe tortiller\u00edas just want to make more money \u2014 they\u2019re not interested in what they sell,\u201d Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez said. \u201cWe sell quality, not quantity.\u201dFrom the city to the countryside, the Mexican tortilla is in crisis. Consumption has dropped nearly 45 percent in the last 35 years, according to the nutritionist Julieta Ponce of the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma Metropolitana Xochimilco, to 125 pounds per person in 2016 from 225 pounds in 1982, as Mexicans eat more bread and fast food.Quality has suffered in the race for the cheapest tortilla; nearly half the supply is now made with industrially produced masa harina, or corn flour, like Maseca.Cristina Barros, an author who investigates Mexican cuisine, says the perilous state of the tortilla is a red alert for Mexico\u2019s wider social ills, including obesity, poverty and emigration. \u201cIf the tortilla is not functioning well, if it\u2019s not good quality, there are going to be a bunch of problems,\u201d particularly for tortilla makers and corn farmers, Ms. Barros said. \u201cWhen we decided to change our traditional food for industrial food, this epidemic of obesity shot up.\u201d Amado Ram\u00edrez Leyva, an agricultural engineer who has worked with corn producers for more than 25 years, promotes biodiversity as the key to persuading consumers that traditional tortillas are worth the expense and the effort to seek them out. \u201cFor the last 50 years, people don\u2019t know how corn tastes in the city,\u201d he said. \u201cThe native heirloom corns have a much wider flavor palette than industrial corns.\u201d\u201cPeople are interested in providing healthy food for their families,\u201d Mr. Mier said. \u201cWe simply need to provide the information.\u201dHe considers 4.5 pesos (24 cents) to be a fairer price, so laborers don\u2019t have to work in cities or emigrate to the United States. (Mr. Angoa plans to work in California for three years in construction while his family takes care of his fields.)\u201cThe tortilla is like a bread dough, a pizza dough \u2014 it needs to be understood that it has the same importance, to give it value,\u201d Mr. Mu\u00f1oz said.Well-made tortillas are already in the city\u2019s top restaurants, so Ms. Casarin sees the larger change happening in less expensive restaurants, fondas and taquerias. \u201cIt\u2019s finding a place for that middle-priced tortilla,\u201d she said.The fight to preserve the old ways is just beginning. In Mexico, there are still 40,000 tortiller\u00edas that nixtamalize their corn and millions of people who make traditional tortillas at home. \u201cThere\u2019s an enormous knowledge, but the market doesn\u2019t recognize it,\u201d Mr. Mier said. \u201cThe know-how exists.

{"Headline": "Russian New Year\u2019s Eve: Christmas, the Fourth of July and Thanksgiving, All Rolled Into One ", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor a holiday that eclipses every other on the Russian calendar, the chef Bonnie Frumkin Morales of Kachka in Portland, Ore., goes all out with her family. PORTLAND, Ore. \u2014 Many chefs say their passion for cooking was shaped in their mothers\u2019 kitchens. Often, because her food was so delicious; sometimes, because it was so terrible. For the chef Bonnie Frumkin Morales, it is more complicated than that. This entire project would have seemed preposterous to Ms. Morales\u2019s younger self. As she grew up in the Chicago suburbs in the 1990s with parents who had recently emigrated from the Soviet Union, it seemed to her that everyone else ate only American food: chicken nuggets, frozen pizza, steak. At her house, there was sauerkraut fermenting in the basement alongside endless rows of pickled fruit and vegetables. Dinners included smelly fish and whole grains and Old World specialties like jellied calf\u2019s foot and cured skeins of fish roe. Often, the kitchen was filled with wild food like berries and mushrooms that her parents insisted on gathering from the woods, and sometimes from neighbors\u2019 yards. In college, she finally worked up the courage to invite friends to dinner, luring them with the promise of unlimited vodka. \u201cI told them the food would be super-weird and they might want to eat before they came,\u201d she said. \u201cThey did not disagree.\u201d Although Ms. Morales, 37, was born and raised in the United States, her parents, Slava and Luba Frumkin, spent most of their lives in Belarus (then the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic). Like many \u00e9migr\u00e9s from the former Soviet Union, they use \u201cRussia\u201d as shorthand for the complicated place they come from. Before any Frumkin gathering, the women of the family cover the table with zakuski, appetizers that prevent hunger and preserve sobriety during the pre-dinner period of talking and toasting that can go on for hours.Mrs. Frumkin calmly laid out black sturgeon caviar and red salmon roe; three kinds of salted, pickled and smoked fish; home-pickled green tomatoes, apples, red peppers and quinces; salads of eggplant and beets and potatoes and mushrooms and cucumbers; stuffed eggs and cabbage leaves and eggplant rolls; sliced beef tongue, jellied calf\u2019s feet and cured pork loin. \u201cRussians never lost all those skills of preserving food for the winter,\u201d Ms. Morales said. And for them, it wasn\u2019t a pretty artisanal fantasy: with the chronic food shortages in the Soviet Union, she said, \u201cThey needed that food to live.\u201d\u201cThis is proof that there are miracles,\u201d said Mr. Frumkin, making the first of many toasts to his mother, who was still alive and living in Minsk when her descendants finally left in 1980. He, Luba and their son, Simon, then 6, were part of the great wave of Jewish families who left the Soviet Union after emigration rules were relaxed in the 1970s. When they moved to Chicago, they continued speaking Russian at home, so Ms. Morales is fluent in the language as well as in the food. But in some ways, the Frumkins remain Russian, and New Year\u2019s Eve remains the biggest holiday of the year: Christmas, the Fourth of July and Thanksgiving rolled into one. The reasons for this go back to the years after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, when the vast properties of the Russian Orthodox Church were nationalized, religious instruction was outlawed and believing in miracles was officially forbidden.About a decade later, the Soviet regime banned the celebration of Christmas. (Dec. 25 was made a national \u201cday of industrialization,\u201d to be observed by going to work.) New Year\u2019s Eve was declared an official holiday, celebrated at midnight with approved concerts and fireworks. Gradually, Christmas traditions like trees, presents and sweets crept into the New Year\u2019s celebration, including a nonreligious Santa figure called Grandfather Frost who hands out gifts with the help of his granddaughter, the Snow Maiden.The modern celebration is a family dinner that lasts well into the morning of Jan. 1, accompanied by a multihour televised gala featuring Russian pop stars, glitter, fireworks and an address to the nation from President Vladimir Putin.On New Year\u2019s Eve, the zakuski course may not end until midnight, when hot dishes are finally served: luxuries like braised short ribs, Georgian chicken tabaka (pan-roasted with lots of garlic and pressed flat, like chicken under a brick), mushrooms and potatoes cooked in lush smetana, the Russian cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche. When the soprano Anna Netrebko, 47, was growing up in the Russian city of Krasnodar, she said, New Year\u2019s Eve included all the secular elements of Christmas: a tree, presents and a family feast.\u201cWithout Olivier,\u201d Ms. Netrebko said, \u201cyou cannot have a Russian party.\u201dRich dishes like Olivier, salmon and salo (pork fatback), and traditional dense, dark breads, are seen as protecting the stomach from the alcohol and astringency of the usual accompaniment to zakuski \u2014 shots of vodka.At the same time, vodka is considered good medicine, Ms. Netrebko said, echoing a common belief. \u201cIt kills the germs during the Russian winter,\u201d she said, when bitter weather keeps everyone inside.Although vodka is traditional for toasting, Champagne and Cognac are also popular now in Russia, representing the new pleasures of conspicuous consumption.Ms. Morales said he was the first \u201coutsider\u201d ever to be impressed, instead of confused, by her family\u2019s food. \u201cThe first time he came to dinner, we left and he said, \u2018What the hell happened back there? That was one of the best meals I\u2019ve ever had.\u2019\u201d\u201cThis is great food from a sophisticated civilization, even if it\u2019s not what they teach in culinary school,\" she said.She is particularly proud of her restaurant\u2019s extraordinary handmade dumplings, including feathery folded vareniki stuffed with sour cherry compote or farmer\u2019s cheese, and plumper pelmeni, filled with meat and herbs.Mr. Morales said his first Russian New Year\u2019s Eve began after he and Ms. Morales finished the holiday shift at Tru.An earlier version of this article misstated the date of the gala premiere of \u201cAdriana Lecouvreur.\u201d It is Dec. 31, not Jan. 31.Advertisement"}

It was 8:03 p.m., Wednesday, Dec. 12, and my body had sent me a notification, via my throbbing skull: You\u2019re probably getting the flu. Facebook, too, had just notified me, via an alert on my phone, of its own plan for me: \u201cYou and Rosie Schaap are celebrating two years of friendship on Facebook.\u201dOver the next few days, my body followed up with a series of messages: you have a sore throat; you have a fever; you have the chills. In that same period, Facebook emailed me four times. \u201cSee Rosie Schaap\u2019s message and other notifications you\u2019ve missed,\u201d it demanded on Thursday, then on Friday, then again on Sunday and once more on Tuesday. By Wednesday, feeling better, I was catching up on emails. \u201cSee Rosie Schaap\u2019s message.\u201d Rosie Schaap\u2019s message? Had I missed something?I had not. \u201cRosie Schaap\u2019s message\u201d did not exist; it was the automatic notification generated by Facebook, about the anniversary of the moment we added each other to Facebook\u2019s database of human connections. I asked Rosie if she had gotten a similar notification about, or \u201cfrom,\u201d me, and she hadn\u2019t, but she said she had removed Facebook Messenger from her phone some time ago. It was a decision that she said \u201cI think has improved my quality of life generally,\u201d but it had also left her out of our Facebook \u201ccelebrating.\u201d And so we had reconnected, to the extent we had ever connected on Facebook in the first place. I had done as I was told.The emails, however, would not stop. Like many millions of others, I get emails from Facebook all the time. Some days I get three, some days none. In November, I got 42. Each one is deceptive in its own way. \u201c[Person whose profile I checked not so recently] has posted an update\u201d is a subject line that shows up frequently, but the email body contains nothing more than the same text, with a link and a big button that says: \u201cView.\u201d Underneath, it will say something like \u201c13 people reacted to this,\u201d and below that, there will be another button that simply says: \u201cOpen Facebook.\u201d Others include \u201c[Old acquaintance] commented on his photo\u201d and \u201c[Cousin] shared [stranger\u2019s] post,\u201d which open to emails that never contain a photo, or a post, just the same set of solicitations to visit Facebook. First: Who honestly cares? They\u2019re just emails! It\u2019s just Facebook! I don\u2019t have to open these emails, and my inbox automatically puts them in special tab. And also: I don\u2019t have to use Facebook in the first place, and I could turn off emails \u2014\u00a0while these messages contain almost nothing in the way of information, they do contain an \u201cunsubscribe\u201d link. And, besides, anyone with an internet connection should know that any company to which you give your email address should be expected to use it as much as possible. There was also a time not so long ago when Facebook\u2019s emails contained the entirety of the things they described: the post, or the photo, or, at least, the text of that \u201cmessage\u201d from a friend. And, sure, my inbox is otherwise full of solicitations from various companies to buy their products or use their services or read their content. They share a set of obvious tactics: overpromising and underdelivering; creating unnecessary mystery in subject lines; manufacturing urgency at commodity scale. In aggregate, over time, these thousands of solicitations and misdirections have gently but constantly made my inbox a worse place. I\u2019ve dealt with this by using a combination of filters, new email apps and rationalization. It\u2019s a situation much like the one Facebook has struggled with for years on its own service. Since the advent of the News Feed \u2014 it was about a dozen years ago that the company created a stream of content for its users to endure \u2014 Facebook has made clear its disdain for what it has called, variously, \u201clow-quality content,\u201d \u201clow-quality web page experiences\u201d or, occasionally, \u201cengagement bait.\u201d We hear from our community that they\u2019re disappointed when they click on a link in News Feed that leads to a web page that contains little substantive content, and is covered in disruptive, shocking or malicious ads.Our research shows that there is a tiny group of people on Facebook who routinely share vast amounts of public posts per day, effectively spamming people\u2019s feeds. Our research further shows that the links they share tend to include low quality content such as clickbait, sensationalism, and misinformation.There was this issue with clickbait, where there were a bunch of publications that would push content into Facebook, [and] people would click on them because they had sensational titles but then would not feel good about having read that content.People who \u201cwould not feel good\u201d about content they expect to be \u201csensational\u201d sounds like a tiny but probably less than optimal experience, and it would be a shame if it happened all the time!Among them: pages that \u201clack substantive or original content\u201d or \u201cprovide an unexpected content experience.\u201d As an attribute of \u201clow-quality content,\u201d it describes something familiar: Ads that purposefully withhold information are ones that entice someone to click a link in order to understand the full context of something.So: Spam for me, but not for thee! Of course, we don\u2019t need to place Facebook\u2019s email behavior in the context of the service itself to understand what it is the company is doing. We all know the word for nagging promotional emails sent with no regard for the general well-being of our inboxes: spam. But Facebook isn\u2019t just another e-commerce operation trying to get you to buy something else, or a publication trying to get you to resubscribe, or a scammer trying to fix your erectile dysfunction or let you in on the ground floor of the latest cryptocurrency or both. It\u2019s Facebook! Like email, it\u2019s a near-universal online service. It wants people to use it and its sister apps for basically everything, which makes it sort of a competitor to email. In 2010, it even provided users with @facebook.com email addresses, and linked them to their Facebook inboxes. \u201cIt seems wrong that an email message from your best friend gets sandwiched between a bill and a bank statement,\u201d the company wrote at the time. \u201cWith new Messages, your Inbox will only contain messages from your friends and their friends. All other messages will go into an Other folder where you can look at them separately.\u201d (The service has been discontinued.)As higher-stakes questions about the biggest social platforms are finally creeping to the fore \u2014\u00a0about what kind of world they want, and what kind of world they\u2019re creating \u2014\u00a0it\u2019s worth taking note of how these companies have behaved where they think they won\u2019t bear the burden of their actions. And as the tech giants ask you to trust them with ever more access to your work and personal lives, consider what they\u2019ve done with the first piece of information you entrusted to them, all these years later: your email address.Advertisement"}

They sing songs of freedom and overcoming. They testify to how far their faith has brought them and how much faith and courage they will need to face another year.The president kept his word \u2014 although two more years of slaughter and civil war lay ahead. African-Americans emerged from that long night of waiting and watching with the right to pick up arms and join the military struggle to save the Union as soldiers and aboard \u201cvessels of all sorts.\u201d The proclamation declared that those enslaved in the Confederacy were now \u201cforever free,\u201d and the might of the United States government, \u201cincluding the military and naval authority thereof, will recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons, and will do no act or acts to repress such persons, or any of them, in any efforts they may make for their actual freedom.\u201dThe proclamation was the most consequential executive order in the history of the United States. It should be celebrated and honored.For every American who cherishes freedom and democracy, New Year\u2019s Day should mean far more than college bowl games and parades. The nation must revive and reclaim the true meaning and significance of Jan. 1, Emancipation Day.This Jan. 1 is even more significant in that the year 2019 marks the 400th anniversary of the first documented African slaves\u2019 forced arrival on the shores of the New World that was to become the United States of America. This anniversary year should be a time of commemoration and celebration, reflection \u2014 and action \u2014 on how far we have come and how far we must still travel to reach the mountaintop.The journey from slavery to freedom was largely completed in 1865 with the adoption of the 13th Amendment. The march from freedom to equality is far from over.I spent Christmas morning \u2014 as I have for more than 40 years \u2014 visiting and praying with the inmates and staff at Cook County Jail, the sprawling warehouse of the poor and dispossessed on the West Side of Chicago. As I looked out over the faces crowded into the jail\u2019s gym, I saw that they were overwhelmingly black and brown.Although African-Americans make up just 24 percent of the population of Cook County, nearly 74 percent of the jail\u2019s population is black.Even as revolutionary Americans rebelled against the British monarchy, declaring all men created equal, the founding fathers at the Constitutional Convention bowed to the South with three slave compromises that still haunt our nation: permitting the international slave trade; counting slaves as three-fifths of a person for congressional representation; and establishing the Electoral College, giving the South congressional representation disproportionate to its voter eligibility.Yet in the darkness of chattel slavery, the enslaved were able to sustain enough of their humanity to maintain a light of hope for a better day, for freedom and for equality. African-Americans were able to see the dimly lit outlines of a more just social, economic and political order, even during slavery, apartheid and centuries of discrimination. But black people did not wait for freedom to fall from the sky. The Colonial era and beyond bristled with slave rebellions and resistance.The lies, myths and insanity of white supremacy contaminated the soil and the soul of America. The Academy said African-American minds were inferior. The medical establishment said our bodies were inferior; the church, our morality. The banks determined that we were unworthy for loans or investment. These barriers have yet to be completely broken down. We are free but unequal. Yet still we rise.History is an unbroken continuity that cannot be denied. Americans should not hide from the past nor engage in an extended exercise of rehashing 400 tragic years. Although there can be no plan for the future without comprehending the past, we cannot go forward while only looking backward.2019 must be about the vision of a fully equal society.In the coming year, we must set goals and a timetable for the most profound and in-depth corrective action program in history and show what true equality for all Americans means and looks like.We must examine how much such repair will cost, what failure to repair has already cost, and the continuing cost to the nation in terms of human and economic underdevelopment if we fail to even the playing field for African-Americans and other people of color.In 2020, there will be another presidential election. As the candidates campaign in the next two years, they must be challenged to share their vision of what an equal, nondiscriminatory, multiracial, multiethnic, multireligious and nonsexist society looks like, and how they propose to take us there.In the meantime, we the people \u2014 red, brown, yellow, black and white \u2014 must do what African-Americans have done for 400 years, from bondage to emancipation, from lynch mobs to great migrations, from the back of the bus to Rosa Parks, from the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis to President Barack Obama on the balcony of the White House.Keep hope alive.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fashion Revolution Has Begun, and Artificial Intelligence Is Having a Big Say", "Date": null, "News": "China DailyAdvertisementShareHumans are still the primary source of design, but machines are learning how to foresee trends.When Thailand\u2019s King Bhumibol Adulyadej died in October 2016, a low- to mid-end Hong Kong fashion brand sold out of black shirts and white ones \uff0d the colors of respect worn during the official mourning period \uff0d almost overnight. That prompted designers and merchandisers to begin wondering whether such color-focused shopping sprees could be predicted.Traditionally, industry experts predict fashion trends based on their own experiences and sense of style. These days, however, social media\u2019s impact on consumers\u2019 behavior comes into play, and a fashion industry revolution is underway, with help from artificial intelligence technologies.\u201cWe intend to provide a real-time estimation of fashion color trends by using big data from social media,\u201d said Gloria Yao, director of project development at the Hong Kong Research Institute of Textiles and Apparel, who is working with a team that is developing an AI-based color-prediction model.Yao said sales prediction is very important for fashion businesses, as it makes for effective inventory management, which increases profits by reducing markdowns due to overstocking.That prompted Yao and her team to focus on hundreds of influential fashion industry accounts on Facebook, including over 500 fashion brands, 100 fashion magazines, 150 designers and 500 social media celebrities. To qualify as influential, Yao said, a brand should have at least 100,000 followers, a magazine 10,000 followers, and a designer or celebrity 1,000 followers. In addition, the accounts should be updated frequently and be able to spark community conversations.\u201cThe aim is to capture the ongoing social and cultural events from social media posts and validate their impact on consumers\u2019 color preferences,\u201d Yao said.An AI technology known as natural language processing interprets the text and images in Facebook posts and helps to identify \u201cauthentic fashion posts\u201d related to color.\u201cIf a celebrity says, \u2018I\u2019m walking on a red carpet at a film festival,\u2019 the \u2018red\u2019 here has nothing to do with fashion,\u201d Yao explained. \u201cBut if she says, \u2018I like my red-colored dress today,\u2019 then this \u2018red\u2019 is the target of our data collection.\u201dThe institute works with a well-known Hong Kong fashion brand that provides its data on sales, inventories, prices, shop locations and marketing information.The project will finish in April, when a production license will be introduced and commercialized for application in the industry.At present, Yao said, the color-prediction model fits different brands, \u201cbut with some adjustments\u201d. The reason is that different brands may target consumers with varying color preferences.\u201cAI enhancements will go beyond the traditional areas of machine tasks into creative and customer-interaction processes, blurring the line between technology and creativity,\u201d U.S. management consulting firm McKinsey & Company said in a report on fashion trends this year.Fashion is about design and the customer\u2019s emotions and mood \uff0d combining physical materials with human senses. So how can it be read by a machine?The biggest challenge facing Taobao is the sheer chaos of products that have not been properly tagged, said Jia Menglei, a senior engineer at Alibaba, with customers complaining that it\u2019s hard to find what they\u2019re looking for.Li Yuan, 26, and a keen online shopper, said: \u201cThere are just tons of items on Taobao. I often have to spend hours on it selecting what I need. Sometimes it makes me feel dizzy.\u201dJia said using a data set of fashion attributes produced by Wong\u2019s team will make tagging more exact and predictable, allowing Alibaba to \u201crebuild the world map of consumer goods\u201d.Take a sweater. It can have a puritan collar, a shirt collar, a ribbed collar \uff0d the list goes on. To train a machine to understand a sweater, you need to install a data set of images of all kinds of sweaters, tagged with their design attributes. The AI network, or a single machine trained to have predictive ability, would then recognize a specific type of sweater the next time it sees one.The data set is most important. It serves as a guideline for the machine\u2019s learning process and sets the foundation for all follow-up research.\u201cIt needs to be professional enough to meet the requirements of machine training,\u201d Wong said, including complete and precise attributes for each style that may be applied to the basic image.\u201cFor a sweater with a turtleneck, you need to give it a tag both as a sweater and a turtleneck. If it\u2019s identified sometimes as a sweater and sometimes as a turtleneck, the machine will be confused.\u201dWong said the accuracy of searches for clothing images on the internet is only about 50 percent, something he attributes to the lack of sufficient professional data.The AI system adopted by Alibaba has been trained to recognize more than 500,000 outfits.The second level of AI application in fashion is to analyze current styles, evaluate their most popular elements, provide recommendations and even predict trends.Wong said that if a machine has a data set of the latest images of outfits in the fashion world, it could calculate which elements are emerging as popular and may become the trend of the foreseeable future. Then it could offer recommendations for consumers, based on predictive analysis and individual preferences.The team expects that in the near future AI will be able to collect more data from customers, providing important information about the popularity of certain styles. The data can note the amount of time a customer spends looking at a particular piece of clothing using a \u201csmart mirror\u201d and whether they decide to buy it, along with other aspects of the fashion experience.Alibaba will combine data from Taobao with that collected in offline shops, aiming to provide an all-around data service for the industry \uff0d from fashion design and material selection to storage and logistics.AI appears set to transform the fashion industry, but is there anything a machine is not likely to master in the near future?Yes, said Wong, because, in the end, designers are irreplaceable. The core of design is the inspiration, he said, and a machine can only serve as an assistant, at best.Sylvia ChangThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post\u2019s\u00a0creation."}

Chief Justice John Roberts, obviously, or the newest justice, Brett Kavanaugh, the successor to Justice Anthony Kennedy, whose votes in favor of maintaining the right to abortion were reluctant but fairly steady. Following the court\u2019s normal practice, Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Kavanaugh kept to themselves their reasons for not voting to hear the cases. It was Justice Thomas, in a dissent joined by Justices Alito and Gorsuch, who broke the norm by accusing his two colleagues of \u201cabdicating our judicial duty.\u201dAs a formal matter, the state\u2019s appeals presented simply a jurisdictional question. The Medicaid law contains what\u2019s known as the \u201cfree choice of provider\u201d provision, entitling Medicaid recipients to obtain care from any provider who is both qualified and willing. The issue in the cases was whether this provision gives Medicaid patients the right to sue to keep a provider on the list. Five United States Courts of Appeals have said yes, including those for the Fifth and Tenth Circuits in these cases, while the court for a sixth circuit, in a decision last year, said no. A conflict among the federal circuits is a typical indication that an issue is worthy of the Supreme Court\u2019s attention, although a lopsided 5-to-1 split is not the kind of entrenched conflict that makes a grant of review nearly automatic.Stressing the circuit conflict, Justice Thomas asked: \u201cSo what explains the Court\u2019s refusal to do its job here? I suspect it has something to do with the fact that some respondents in these cases are named \u2018Planned Parenthood.\u2019 That makes the Court\u2019s decision particularly troubling, as the question presented has nothing to do with abortion.\u201dOf course, the cases had everything to do with abortion in a real-world sense. The attack on Planned Parenthood by red states \u2014 16 had signed a friend-of-the-court brief \u2014 was fueled by a fraudulently obtained and dishonestly edited video purporting to show that Planned Parenthood clinics sell body parts of aborted fetuses. As lower courts have found, the accusation is false.\u201cIt is true,\u201d Justice Thomas continued, \u201cthat these particular cases arose after several states alleged that Planned Parenthood had, among other things, engaged in \u2018the illegal sale of fetal organs\u2019 and \u2018fraudulent billing practices,\u2019 and thus removed Planned Parenthood as a state Medicaid provider. But these cases are not about abortion rights.\u201dWithout bothering to mention that the allegation against Planned Parenthood has been thoroughly debunked, Justice Thomas went on: \u201cSome tenuous connection to a politically fraught issue does not justify abdicating our judicial duty. If anything, neutrally applying the law is all the more important when political issues are in the background.\u201dWhere were the chief justice and Justice Kavanaugh then? The answer is unknowable from the outside, but the question is crucial. Has it occurred to the Thomas three that something more significant may be at stake than dragging the court into ideological battle? Something like the court\u2019s own short-term welfare and long-term legitimacy?Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article said that the Supreme Court term begins in January.

It\u2019s going to come.\u201dIn the meantime, though, the dining room is packed, and so many people have tried to steal the restaurant\u2019s signature red plates that Mr. Bradley removed them to his office, where he packed them in a fish cooler. Last week he hired a jazz band to march through the bar, recalling a New Orleans second line.Restaurants close every day. But not many close after nearly two decades in a flurry of business, after serving hundreds of hundreds of thousands of meals. So The Times sent the photographer Daniel Krieger to the Red Cat to document some of the particulars of the restaurant\u2019s personality, its quirks and worn edges, its people and vibe.The New England chef and burger maven Dave Dubois once worked for Mr. Bradley, who took the name of Mr. Dubois\u2019s Boston hamburger mini-chain to as the name of the burger he serves at the Red Cat. \u201cIt\u2019s not even Dave\u2019s burger,\u201d Mr. Bradley said, laughing. \u201cBut I like the name and so I stole it.\u201d The chalkboard was a gift from Robert Redford, for whom Mr. Bradley once produced a food event in Sundance, Utah.Colleen Grapes was the restaurant\u2019s longtime pastry chef. When she returned to the restaurant for a final meal, Mr. Bradley started bouncing ideas off her, and at one point tried to persuade her to move to Providence, R.I., and open a milk bar with him. I asked him if he really wanted to do that. He shrugged. \u201cProvidence could use a good milk bar,\u201d he said.There is a small step up from the restaurant\u2019s bar area to the dining room in back. It is lighted from within, and there is a sign on the wall beside it warning customers of its existence. Waiters, runners, busboys and Mr. Bradley himself watch the hazard closely, and point out the rise to all those who approach it. They do so, reflexively, to one another.Table 45, in the far southwestern corner of the dining room, provides the restaurant\u2019s best seats, with views of the whole place. \u201cIt\u2019s the most voyeuristic table,\u201d Mr. Bradley said. \u201cYou can see everyone.\u201d He purchased the chairs for the restaurant in 1999, in eastern Pennsylvania, for $25 a seat. They came from a schoolhouse, and were scarred and initialed by students, \u201ca lot of Joanie loves Chachi stuff,\u201d Mr. Bradley said. He still has every one. Mr. Bradley\u2019s father built the half-hull model of a red catboat that hangs near the restaurant\u2019s pay phone. It was a gift for his son when the restaurant opened. The model is based on the father\u2019s own boat, an 18-foot Marshall cat that is neither red nor called the Red Cat. \u201cCellphones weren\u2019t really a big thing when we opened,\u201d Mr. Bradley said, \u201cso we put in that telephone so people wouldn\u2019t keep borrowing the one at the host station.\u201d For the past few years, he has been in a stalemate with the telephone company, which no longer services pay phones. \u201cThey want to charge me $75 a month,\u201d he said, \u201cfor a phone that doesn\u2019t work and that they won\u2019t fix.\u201d He shrugged. Now it\u2019s art.The Red Cat has never been simply a neighborhood restaurant. As Mr. Bruni wrote in his review, \u201cits fluid, flexible nature is such that it seems \u2014 and is \u2014 in equal measures a local joint and a destination. It's the exceedingly rare place that can often take a reservation only a few days in advance and yet is almost always packed.\u201d Until Dec. 23, that is.

In the proposal, which will be voted on at Amazon\u2019s annual shareholder meeting next spring, employees asked the company\u2019s board to say how it would respond to climate change and reduce its dependence on fossil fuels.\u201cWe realized we could use our position as employees and our power and our rights as shareholders to bring visibility of this issue to the board and the top leaders of this company,\u201d said Eliza Pan, a program manager who has worked at Amazon for five years and is one of the employees who signed on to the proposal.Ms. Pan, who earned Amazon shares as part of her compensation package, said workers must own at least $2,000 in stock for a year to file a shareholder proposal. \u201cWe had this power, and we wanted to leverage that power,\u201d she said.The move by Amazon\u2019s employees builds upon similar activism at Google this year. In March, its workers were part of a shareholder petition by Zevin Asset Management that sought to link executive compensation to diversity and inclusion goals. Google\u2019s employees did not directly file the proposal, but joined Zevin and presented it at the annual shareholder meeting of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company.The proposal was ultimately voted down, but Pat Miguel Tomaino, the director of socially responsible investing at Zevin, said the firm planned to work with Google employees to resubmit it for the 2019 shareholder meeting.\u201cWorkers are looking at who holds power and where changes can be made,\u201d said Yana Calou, an engagement manager at Coworker.org, an organization that allows colleagues to start campaigns together. \u201cWorkers are shareholders themselves, and risks to workers and users are often risks to shareholders, so there is a natural alliance of shared interests.\u201dAmazon declined to comment on its employees\u2019 advocacy, but it said it was taking steps to address climate change.\u201cWe have set a goal to power our global infrastructure with 100 percent renewable energy and are investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency innovations,\u201d said Kara Hurst, director of worldwide sustainability at Amazon. The company, based in Seattle, has installed solar energy systems at 25 of its fulfillment centers and has streamlined its packing process to reduce its use of packing materials, she added.Google declined to comment on its employees\u2019 participation in shareholder proposals.Shareholder proposals have in the past been used largely by activist investment firms and others to advocate for changes.\u201cIt\u2019s fairly unusual to see this, where employees are taking a stand in regard to the company they\u2019re working for,\u201d said Natasha Lamb, a managing partner at Arjuna Capital, a wealth-management fund that focuses on climate issues.Tech employees, more than in many other industries, have a ready-made way to become activist shareholders because of how they are paid. Google, Facebook, Apple and tech start-ups such as Airbnb have all made stock a component of compensation. At privately held companies, tech workers often get stock options, which give them the option to buy shares at a set price. Publicly traded companies tend to grant restricted stock options that automatically transfer shares to employees over a period of time.\u201cBecause so much value is being created, or we hope is going to be created, it\u2019s appealing to employees to receive some potential part of that pop or growth in value,\u201d said Mary Russell, a lawyer and founder of Stock Option Counsel, a legal firm in Palo Alto, Calif., that advises tech employees on their compensation. \u201cThe culture of the companies is that we need to do this to incentivize people to build the value of the company.\u201dBut by paying employees this way, tech companies open themselves up to this kind of shareholder advocacy, she said. \u201cThey are setting themselves up to have quite a large group of stockholders who would of course, like any other stockholder, have the right to bring forward a shareholder proposal,\u201d Ms. Russell said.Employee shareholder proposals may ultimately not be effective since shareholder-led proposals are often shot down. And because tech founders often possess a large chunk of the shares in their companies \u2014 Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder and its largest shareholder, owns 16 percent of the company; the Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin have about 51 percent of voting shares in Alphabet \u2014 the proposals have little chance of passing without founder support.Tech employees said it was worth taking that risk. Shareholder proposals often gain attention because they are distributed to stockholders and are included in annual proxy statements, the employees say, and they give workers a way to raise their grievances directly to the board, rather than just to managers.\u201cBanding together with other shareholders amplifies my voice and makes all of our voices more powerful,\u201d said Ms. Pan of Amazon.\u201cIt\u2019s important to make change and work for change wherever you happen to be, and I happen to be an employee at Amazon,\u201d said Emily Cunningham, a user experience designer who is backing the climate change proposal and who has received Amazon shares as part of her compensation.She said it was important for employees to publicly demand a plan. \u201cIt\u2019s affecting the public, it\u2019s affecting business,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

The Yellow Vests on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es are cousins of the British who voted for Brexit, the Americans who voted for Donald Trump, and the Poles, Hungarians and Italians who elected populist, anti-democratic governments.He should also have been aware that the \u201cleft behind\u201d of France had voted less for him than against the established parties that, they believed, had left them stranded on the economic periphery, and that leading off his reforms with the elimination of a tax on the rich was politically foolish.All of that seems clear in retrospect, and Mr. Macron insists he has absorbed the message of the Yellow Vests and will pay heed to the ordinary citizens whose tax-eaten income barely stretches to the end of the month. Less clear is whether the demonstrators, whose Saturday invasions of Paris and other major cities have had no single organizer or common agenda, will be satisfied. And if the Saturday protests continue, the demonstrations are likely to be increasingly hijacked by violence-prone thugs.And that depends on which way the Yellow Vests go. So far the movement has not fallen prey to ideologues of the far left or the far right, and despite violence on the fringes of the Saturday demonstrations, a large majority has remained reasonably moderate in its various demands, save the odd call for Mr. Macron to go away.Mr. Macron has done well to come down from the heavens to show contrition.

{"Headline": "After Yellow Vests Come Off, Activists in France Use Facebook to Protest and Plan", "Date": "2018-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Last Saturday, Thomas Mirall\u00e8s donned a yellow vest in his hometown in southern France and headed out to protest President Emmanuel Macron and high taxes. Afterward, he and other demonstrators around the country returned home, just as they had done every weekend for the past month.But though they were no longer gathered together in town squares and on the streets, Mr. Mirall\u00e8s and many fellow protesters were far from dispersed. Away from the television cameras and police lines, they kept coordinating their actions online \u2014 mostly on Facebook.\u201cBoth fuel each other,\u201d said Mr. Mirall\u00e8s, 27, a real-estate agent in Perpignan who moderates a Facebook group for protesters that has amassed more than 305,000 members. \u201cWithout Facebook there wouldn\u2019t be such a movement, but the online activity is fueled by the energy in the streets.\u201d\u201cWe are on the right track, let\u2019s not give up,\u201d wrote one user in the Facebook group La France en Col\u00e8re, or Angry France, on Tuesday while sharing a news article suggesting that \u201ctired\u201d police forces might join the Yellow Vests.France has a robust history of political protest, with or without Facebook. But looking inside the platform opens a window into the unruly nature of Yellow Vest conversations, with their disparate demands and competing agendas. Facebook has roughly 35 million monthly active users in France, or about 52 percent of the population, and many feeds are now crammed with images related to the protests.In recent weeks, Facebook has turned several average citizens \u2014 nurses, truck drivers and small-business owners \u2014 into Yellow Vest influencers. Several have received over three million views for videos of them speaking into their phone, according to data from Crowdtangle, which tracks activity on Facebook.\u201cShooting in Strasbourg, a government machination to intimidate Yellow Vests,\u201d one user posted on Tuesday. \u201cIt smells of smoke.\u201d The post was later deleted.Mr. Mirall\u00e8s, who became the administrator last month of La France en Col\u00e8re, said he tried to delete the most extreme material posted in the Facebook group. But that task is difficult, he said, given how fast-moving the activity is.\u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of conspiracy theories, which is a shame,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re facing an increasing need of moderators and administrators. It\u2019s a little complicated.\u201dMr. Mirall\u00e8s joined the Yellow Vest movement in October after growing frustrated with high taxes. He said he had reached out to La France en Col\u00e8re to volunteer to help screen the posts flooding in as interest in participating in protests swelled. Within weeks, he was one of the group\u2019s eight moderators, spending several hours a day responding to messages from fellow activists and reading through comments.Steven Lebee, 31, a stay-at-home father from Haute-Savoie in the Alps who volunteers with Mr. Mirall\u00e8s, said many protesters looked only to Facebook for information because of widespread mistrust of the mainstream media.\u201cThere\u2019s no other existing tool that could allow us to share so much information without being censored,\u201d Mr. Lebee said. \u201cThe information we share is shared as we share it. There is no media distortion.\u201dBut the proliferation of rumors and misleading posts on Facebook about the protests has led to concerns that the site is inflaming anger and making it harder for the authorities to find solutions.Apart from the false information about the Strasbourg shooting, Yellow Vests last week shared misleading Facebook posts about a nonbinding United Nations migration pact signed by Mr. Macron in Marrakesh, Morocco, arguing that he would \u201chand France\u2019s sovereignty over to the U.N.\u201d Pictures falsely showing members of the police and military supporting the demonstrators were also shared hundreds of thousands of times.On Twitter and the messaging platform Telegram, protesters also posted videos of French military vehicles with the false claim that they were being deployed to squash protests.\u201cFalse news has no place on Facebook and we have doubled down on our efforts to prevent the spread of false information on our platform and to educate people on how to identify and signal this type of content,\u201d the company said in a statement.Twitter declined to comment.

For many groups, she said, \u201cit has gotten out of their hands.\u201dFacebook has long been used as a political organizing tool, but it has rarely fueled such a large protest movement inside a Western democracy, said Olivier Costa, a political scientist in Bordeaux and head of research at the National Center for Scientific Research. While the size of Yellow Vest protests may shrink after this week\u2019s government concessions, the experience provides a template for future activism, he said.For the Yellow Vests, it can be dizzying to \u201cbuild such a movement and force a government to bend,\u201d Mr. Costa said.Those in the movement said the strength of social media was worth any drawback.\u201cCall Facebook a tool, a threat, a weapon, it\u2019s hard to know,\u201d Mr. Mirall\u00e8s said. \u201cBut there would be no Yellow Vests today without it.\u201dElian Peltier reported from Paris, and Adam Satariano from London.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Environmentalism Just for Rich People?", "Date": "2018-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGray matterSometimes it can seem as if only the privileged support the cause. But the truth is more complicated.Dr. Gross is a sociologist.The Yellow Vest protests that have convulsed France for the past few weeks, leaving chic Parisian neighborhoods smoldering, are making environmentalists nervous.As with working-class support for the faltering coal industry in the United States, the question arises: Is environmentalism a boutique issue, a cause only the well-off can afford to worry about?Some social science suggests the answer is yes. In a landmark 1995 paper, the sociologist Ronald Inglehart observed an intriguing pattern in public support for the environmental movement. According to a public opinion survey he conducted in 43 nations, the countries where large percentages of the population supported strong environmental policies shared two characteristics: They were dealing with major environmental challenges (air and water pollution and species conservation were among the top priorities at the time) and they were affluent.Mr. Inglehart argued that citizens were apt to prioritize environmental concerns only if they were rich enough not to have to fret about more basic things like food and shelter. Environmentalism was part of a larger \u201cpostmaterialist\u201d mind-set, focused on human self-realization and quality of life, that was naturally to be found in the world\u2019s economically advanced societies \u2014 and especially among better-educated, wealthier citizens. Mr. Inglehart anticipated that growing prosperity, rising education levels and increasingly dire environmental circumstances would translate into the further spread of environmental consciousness in the years to come.In some ways the situation in France fits this theory. France is wealthy and well educated. And environmentalism is big there. A 2017 study, for instance, found that 79 percent of the French population believes climate change to be a very serious problem. It is plausible to think that some of the anger the Yellow Vests are unleashing on Paris revolves around the cultural gap separating those French citizens privileged enough to be able to devote time, attention and money to matters like the environment from those not as fortunate.Thought-provoking as Mr. Inglehart\u2019s thesis is, however, it\u2019s not hard to identify weaknesses. Here\u2019s an obvious one: The United States, like France, is a prosperous country with a well-educated population. Yet according to a survey conducted this year by the Pew Research Center, only 44 percent of Americans say they care a great deal about climate change.More recent research bolsters this skeptical view. Work by the sociologists Riley Dunlap and Richard York, based on a wider range of data, turns Mr. Inglehart\u2019s finding on its head: They have discovered that the publics of poorer countries facing imminent resource loss from environmental destruction often hold the strongest pro-environment attitudes. For example, the island nation of Fiji \u2014 which stands to be decimated by global warming, rising sea levels and storms \u2014 ratified the Paris climate agreement on a unanimous parliamentary vote before any other nation did.Another study, by the political scientist Matto Mildenberger and the geographer Anthony Leiserowitz, has found \u201cno evidence\u201d that people became less attuned to climate change when their economic prospects dwindled after the 2008 financial crisis.Mr. Dunlap and Mr. York emphasize the contingency and variability of public support for environmental causes and practices. How much backing there will be \u2014 and in what quarters \u2014 depends on the specific environmental, economic and political conditions countries face. Environmental protection efforts can advance if the environmental movement acts strategically.The notion that there are few hard-and-fast rules when it comes to public support for environmentalism has influenced the response of environmentalists to the Yellow Vest protests. While raising taxes to reduce fossil fuel consumption or fund green energy transitions is essential, they say, depending on how and when such policies are proposed, they may spur a backlash. So smart rollouts and messaging matter. Mr. Macron\u2019s environmental policies, for example, were announced from on high, without meaningful input from all the communities that would be affected.Environmentalists insist that there is no reason in principle why a more effective communications strategy could not be found to pull together urban dwellers and the rural working- and lower-middle-class in a broad environmental coalition. The fact that the French public is sympathetic to the cause of the Yellow Vests but also concerned about the climate shows that the protests were never really about the environment in the first place.Such a perspective is comforting. But it arguably understates the magnitude of the problem the environmental movement now confronts. Yes, contrary to the theory of postmaterialism, the well-off aren\u2019t the only ones who care about climate change and the environment. Yet in many of today\u2019s capitalist democracies, class and status resentments, fostered by rampant inequality and whipped up by opportunistic politicians, have developed to such an extent that issues like the environment that affect everyone are increasingly seen through the lens of group conflict and partisan struggle.Differences between urban and rural, new economy and old, college educated versus working class and cosmopolitan versus local loom larger than ever. Although the research of the sociologist Dana R. Fisher shows that in the United States, climate change activists have been working to diversify their ranks, the trust needed for truly large-scale environmental coalition building is wearing thin.Thus a different interpretation of the Yellow Vest protest may be warranted. Without a concerted effort to address inequality \u2014 which some in the environmental movement consider someone else\u2019s department \u2014 the bold policy changes needed to slow global warming risk never getting off the ground.Neil Gross is a professor of sociology at Colby College.Advertisement"}

Since President Trump once owned casinos, you\u2019d think that he might have caught on by now. Then again, those casinos went bankrupt, an outcome that Mr. Trump blamed on anyone not named Donald Trump.Now that he\u2019s president, the table stakes are much higher. Except that Americans are the ones who are losing. With the stock market at the brink of a bear territory since September, and the S.&P. 500 off about 10 percent this year, the president continues to insist in tweets, and in conversations with his economic advisers and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, that everything would be great \u2014\u00a0if it was not for that meddlesome Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. \u201cThe only problem our economy has is the Fed,\u201d Mr. Trump ranted on Monday. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a feel for the Market.\u201dThe only problem our economy has is the Fed. They don\u2019t have a feel for the Market, they don\u2019t understand necessary Trade Wars or Strong Dollars or even Democrat Shutdowns over Borders. The Fed is like a powerful golfer who can\u2019t score because he has no touch - he can\u2019t putt!The Federal Reserve Board has had the temerity to do exactly what it had signaled for months it would do, steadily raise interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating. The Fed is legally mandated to maximize employment and contain inflation, not to prop up the stock market on presidential orders. Mr. Powell also signaled that the Fed would pause in this rate-raising mode if the economy began to slow. Wall Street was not surprised in the least by this pronouncement.Mr. Trump was in Iraq, and off Twitter, on Wednesday.While a paralyzed federal government is not yet damaging the economy, the damage from Mr. Trump\u2019s other personal policy perversions is piling up. On its own, the economy, while clearly slowing, is doing well enough and will probably continue to do well enough with minimal fine tuning. Mr. Trump complains bitterly that Mr. Powell is going to turn him into Herbert Hoover by doing what the Fed is mandated to do. But what turned Hoover into Hoover is a Federal Reserve that did nothing and a Republican Congress that conducted a disastrous trade policy rife with tariffs.The really scary part, if one continues this historical comparison, is that the Great Depression was ended not as much by smart economic policy as it was the end of a failed foreign policy marked by American isolationism in the years leading to World War II. Today, Mr. Trump\u2019s America First posture is behind his abrupt decision last week to withdraw antiterrorism troops from Syria. His own generals \u2014 \u201cmy generals\u201d \u2014 and national security staff have warned that such a retreat could allow the shattered Islamic State to regroup and spread global chaos again.But what do generals know about warfare? About as much as economists with Ph.D.s at the Fed know about the economy. That is, a lot.Maybe the kid can now call Chairman Powell and commiserate, while the rest of us brace for King Minus\u2019s next touch.Advertisement"}

Outside the building, a fellow member of Parliament was trying to burst through police lines to reach him.But on the main state television channel, the talk was all about pigeons.Under Hungary\u2019s far-right prime minister, Viktor Orban, the country has long been a place of parallel realities.But rarely have these two bubbles seemed so far apart than during the past week.Yet Hungarians who consume only state media, or the private outlets owned by Orban loyalists, will likely be either unaware of the scale of the protests, or consider them the work of foreign provocateurs.On Monday afternoon, for example, barring a few fleeting clips of the protests, programming at the state broadcaster continued as normal \u2014 even as the lawmaker outside threatened to crash through the building\u2019s locked glass doors to reach her guard-ringed colleague inside.\u201cThis is not normal,\u201d said the lawmaker, Agnes Vadai, \u201cthat there is an M.P. on the floor inside this building, surrounded by security guards.\u201dHaving no luck at one locked entrance, Ms. Vadai marched to another gate, this one blocked by armed guards. There was the sound of a small scuffle, and a muffled scream.Suddenly, Ms. Vadai emerged on the other side of the police line.While Ms. Vadai had made it closer to her colleague, she still wasn\u2019t inside the building, where they continued to broadcast that program about pigeons.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to give pigeons away to people who don\u2019t know what they are doing, people who have no background with pigeons,\u201d a government minister was saying. \u201cBecause that would be destined for failure.\u201dHungary\u2019s odd week began last Wednesday, when Mr. Orban\u2019s party bent parliamentary rules to pass a series of new laws without allotting enough parliamentary time for debate.But the legislation that spurred the most anger among opposition lawmakers was the so-called slave law that obligates employees to work up to 400 hours of overtime a year and gives employers up to three years to pay.Trying to delay its passage and disrupt parliamentary business, opposition legislators blocked access to the speaker\u2019s podium and blew whistles. The law was ultimately voted through, but the pandemonium energized several thousand Hungarians to protest in subzero conditions, three nights in a row, in the square outside.They took a break on Saturday, before an estimated 15,000 returned on Sunday \u2014 the highest numbers of the week.As night fell, around 2,000 then marched several miles through the snow to the state media building on the edge of town, to protest the broadcaster\u2019s failure to cover the demonstrations.While the crowds chanted outside, about 10 opposition lawmakers entered the building to ask for some airtime. They were shown to a green room, and passed the night by snacking on chocolate bars from a nearby vending machine.\u201cIt was a good bonding experience,\u201d said one of the legislators, Peter Ungar.But 10 hours later, they were still there \u2014 and no closer to discussing their demands on air.A fourth, Ms. Vadai, was treated by paramedics after being pushed and shoved while trying to reach Mr. Varju.Where all these surreal scenes end up, no one is quite sure \u2014 particularly as significant portions of the country may be only fleetingly aware of their occurrence. The protests are still relatively small, especially in comparison to Mr. Orban\u2019s base.His party won nearly 50 percent of the vote in an April election that election observers said was free but not fair.And for Mr. Kovacs, if there is an parallel universe in Hungary, it is one created by \u201cspin doctors in the international media,\u201d rather than at the state broadcaster.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen this before,\u201d Mr. Kovacs wrote, \u201cI mean the international mainstream media creating a sort of alternative reality.\u201dBenjamin Novak contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

After all, after the 2016 U.S. election and the Brexit vote in Britain, there was a lot of talk about a broad popular backlash against globalization. Over the past two years, however, it has become clear that this backlash was both smaller and shallower than advertised.But if there\u2019s no strong constituency for protectionism, why are we teetering on the brink of a trade war? Blame U.S. trade law.The creators of the U.S. trade policy system realized, however, that it couldn\u2019t be too rigid or it would shatter in times of stress; there had to be ways to relieve pressure when necessary. So trade law gives the executive the right to impose tariffs without new legislation under certain circumstances, mainly to protect national security, to retaliate against unfair foreign practices, or to give industries facing sudden surges in foreign competition time to adjust.In other words, U.S. trade law gives the president a lot of discretionary power over trade, as part of a system that curbs the destructive influence of corrupt, irresponsible members of Congress. And that setup worked very well for more than 80 years.Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t intended to handle the problem of a corrupt, irresponsible president. Trump is pretty much all alone in lusting for a trade war, but he has virtually dictatorial authority over trade.What\u2019s he doing with that power? He\u2019s trying to negotiate deals. Unfortunately, he really, really doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing. On trade, he\u2019s a rebel without a clue.Markets plunged earlier this week as investors realized that they\u2019d been had. As I said, business really doesn\u2019t want a trade war.Let\u2019s be clear: China is not a good actor in the world economy. It engages in real misbehavior, especially with regard to intellectual property: The Chinese essentially rip off technology. So there is a case for toughening our stance on trade.But that toughening should be undertaken in concert with other nations that also suffer from Chinese misbehavior, and it should have clear objectives. The last person you want to play hardball here is someone who doesn\u2019t grasp the basics of trade policy, who directs his aggressiveness at everyone \u2014 tariffs on Canadian aluminum to protect our national security? Really? \u2014 and who can\u2019t even give an honest account of what went down in a meeting.Unfortunately, that\u2019s the person who\u2019s now in charge, and it\u2019s hard to see how he can be restrained. So the future of world trade, with all it implies for the world economy, now hinges largely on Donald Trump\u2019s mental processes. That is not a comforting thought.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Pedestrian Strikes Back", "Date": "2018-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOfficials in several countries are getting the message: Cities are about people, not cars. Contributing Opinion WriterIn many of the major cities of the world, it has begun to dawn even on public officials that walking is a highly efficient means of transit, as well as one of the great underrated pleasures in life. A few major cities have even tentatively begun to take back their streets for pedestrians.Yes, car owners are furious. That\u2019s because they have mistaken their century-long domination over pedestrians for a right rather than a privilege. The truth is that cities are not doing nearly enough to restore streets for pedestrian use, and it\u2019s the pedestrians who should be furious.Urban walking has thus deteriorated from a civilized pleasure to an overheated, unshaded, traffic-harried race to a destination. It\u2019s like what the art historian Vincent Scully once said about the demolition of the old Penn Station and its replacement by the commuter hell squeezed beneath Madison Square Garden: \u201cOne entered the city like a god; now one scuttles in like a rat.\u201dMaybe we can\u2019t turn every street into a pedestrian paradise. Urban planners in London now follow a sort of zoning plan, with some streets developed primarily for moving vehicles, and others focused on the richer (and more retail-friendly) urban life of the pedestrian. In this country, Berkeley\u2019s Professor Macdonald and her co-authors have recently published a simple system for urban planners to identify \u2014 and presumably prioritize \u2014 factors that make streets pedestrian-friendly. For instance, on large arterial roadways, walkers feel comfortable only if the sidewalks are at least 15 feet wide.This is the fundamental common sense rule: Cities and their streets are about people, not cars, and all urban design should think first about the only transit equipment that comes factory-standard for the average human being \u2014 our feet.Advertisement"}

Responding to pressure from Congress and international outrage over the widely publicized Tiananmen Square killings, the Bush administration imposed limited sanctions on Beijing while maintaining dialogue with Chinese officials. Today, when another, more hostile strategic realignment between Beijing and Washington seems to be underway, there is again an urgent need to address at the highest levels of the American government what have been described as China\u2019s worst human rights abuses in decades. They are largely happening in secret to a group of people who are little known outside China.

The women had the store.Ms. Schulman\u2019s latest novel, \u201cCome With Me,\u201d has just been published.I was in a daze as I meandered up Columbus Avenue a few weeks ago \u2014 politics, the country, the world, you name it \u2014 when a pair of pants, a silly dazzling pair of silver-sequined flares that I couldn\u2019t afford and had no cause to wear, called to me from the window. I wondered, as I stared longingly: Why do I, a woman of a certain age, still have a penchant for glitter, decades after I should have outgrown a 7-year-old\u2019s yearnings for sparkly dress-up clothes?Elizabeth was a small port city then, and it had no village east or west as far as any of us knew. It was a bit of a geographic sleight of hand, a fantasy, but that was also the product. Saturday-night dreams of Hollywood glamour were nurtured and maybe sometimes came true in those aisles, just as they still do sometimes in my own closet \u2014 my passing on the silver-sequined flares notwithstanding.The men of this immigrant Jewish community had the synagogue \u2014 my grandfather and his friends went every day \u2014 and the women had the store. A lot of gossip took place there, among the salesladies and the customers: the affairs, the separations, the matches. I remember the hustle and bustle of working women scoping the racks for office attire, mothers and grandmothers hunting for bar mitzvah wear \u2014 the fancy stuff. I remember homemakers searching for outfits appropriate for shul, and single girls and teenagers shopping for date nights.\u201cShe looks like a fashion plate,\u201d they said, no matter what the woman looked like or how badly the dress fit. A seamstress would get on her knees and measure. With the pins still in her mouth, she\u2019d say, \u201cRight out of the pages of Vogue magazine.\u201d Not exactly: The dresses my grandmother sold were often showy, long, filmy, shiny concoctions, with sequined necklines and lace sleeves. They were priced for working-class people with fairy-tale aspirations, and they came in nylon and sateen and other cheaper fabrics; the skirts often swirled, and the waists had big stiff bows. It seemed as though the dresses themselves were enough to lift these women out of their daily grind, away from their painful memories, their threadbare lives, into what I imagined as clouds of fun \u2014 dances, parties; I had no idea.My grandparents were Russian refugees. They had met around 1915, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, where first they had a vegetable cart, and then a clothing pushcart. Several years later, they moved to Elizabeth, their small neighborhood an American version of a shtetl, where they eventually opened Schulman\u2019s. My grandmother was the genius behind the business. Malnourished as a child, she was just 4 feet 11 inches tall and weighed 90 pounds, and she was basically illiterate in all three languages she spoke (Russian, Yiddish and English). She was no clothes horse \u2014 she wore \u201chouse dresses,\u201d soft cotton button-downs that were easy to take off and on, wash-and-wear, with a simple slip underneath, unadorned but presentable \u2014 but she was an excellent businesswoman. Her strategy was to sell off-the-rack dresses to her clientele and have seamstresses on hand to alter the clothes to fit at no charge.When my father was a boy, one of the seamstresses took him under her wing \u2014 after he tore his pants and broke his eyeglasses playing ball she mended them so he wouldn\u2019t get in trouble with his father, who counted his pennies and had a temper. Her name was Sherrie. She was still working in the back room when I was a girl, and I always made sure to say hi to her at her sewing machine when we visited. I last visited Schulman\u2019s when my grandmother died in the early \u201970s, when I was in junior high school, and we sat shiva. My uncle and aunt owned and ran it after that, but the neighborhood was filling now with a new generation of immigrants from Latin America; many of Schulman\u2019s original clientele and their children had by this point moved on to the suburbs. By the time the store officially closed, I think in the early \u201980s \u2014 so much time has passed, I\u2019m not sure \u2014 I had not been there in years, and I\u2019d long stopped thinking about it.My father has been gone a long time now, along with his siblings and, of course, Sherrie, who was older than any of them. I have a chunky pale purple crystal necklace of hers that my father\u2019s sister gave me when I first got married and that I still wear. I pair it with a black velvet top I got in Paris during the soldes \u2014 the crazy, state-sanctioned rock-bottom sales that occur twice a year in France. The shirt was a find, and whenever I wear it I dress it up with that necklace. I discovered when I was young that the flashes of light that come from a little sparkle seem to brighten anything, even as the lift itself is weightless and ephemeral.Advertisement"}

The refrigerator door is wallpapered edge to edge with photos from old friends\u2019 Christmas cards; the doors of our kitchen cabinets are covered with notices for art shows long since closed.

They remind my husband and me of that brief time in our family\u2019s life when there was still someone at home small enough to jump up and down, clapping with glee, when the Christmas tree lights came on for the first time, even if it was only a test and the lights were spread out across the floor or still tangled together at the bottom of a cardboard box.Other boxes hold the stockings my mother needlepointed, one for each boy. The Coke-bottle Santas my mother-in-law bought at the gift shop in her tiny hometown, also one for each boy.

The nativity set my grandmother\u2019s best friend made for her in a backyard studio \u2014 each year a new camel or wise man or shepherd or donkey, till the set was complete. The angel my great-grandmother crocheted of white string and starched into a stand-alone shape that allows the angel to balance in place at the top of the tree.Last year when I packed up the Christmas decorations, I set aside our oldest son\u2019s homemade ornaments in a separate box. He is on his own now, and I know the day is coming when he will have his own tree to decorate, his own holiday traditions to establish. He didn\u2019t put up a tree this year, so his father and I are still keeping them safe, but we are also ready for whatever comes next.For now those ornaments are back in their old familiar places, hanging alongside all the other reminders that the people who are gone from us are never truly gone, that the little boys hopping up and down with excitement are still somewhere inside the grown men who can set that homely angel in her place at the top of the tree without even straining to reach.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Race to Dam the Himalayas", "Date": "2018-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHundreds of big projects are planned for the rivers that plunge from the roof of the world.Mr. Amrith is the author of the forthcoming book \u201cUnruly Waters,\u201d a history of how water has shaped South Asia.Along the banks of the Godavari River, near the city of Rajahmundry in the eastern India state of Andhra Pradesh, stands a museum built in the memory of Sir Arthur Thomas Cotton. As commissioner for irrigation there in the 1840s, Cotton brought water to Andhra\u2019s parched lands, turning them into India\u2019s rice bowl.An engineer in the East India Company\u2019s army, he did this by restoring and expanding an ancient network of dams and canals along India\u2019s great southern rivers: the Kaveri, the Krishna and the Godavari. Motivated by a belief that science would pave the way for rural capitalism, he envisaged a landscape transformed.And so it was.India is not alone in its ambitions. Hungry for energy and threatened by an acute shortage of fresh water, other Asian nations are competing to harness the power of the Himalayan rivers, on which more than half a billion people depend directly for sustenance.Dam building was a global obsession. In the 1950s, the World Bank began financing multipurpose water projects in the developing world that combined irrigation, power generation and flood control; by the end of the 20th century, the bank had lent billions of dollars to dam projects.American engineers roved the world selling their hydraulic expertise. So did their Soviet counterparts, who advised the enormous program of dam construction in Mao\u2019s China. In that era, India and China sought to learn from each other. In 1954, two of India\u2019s leading engineers embarked on a two-month tour of China\u2019s water projects and found that the Chinese were working at a pace, and on a scale, that dwarfed India\u2019s ambitions.Estimates for the number of people displaced by dams in India since 1947 vary from 16 million to 40 million. If these projects were inspired by dreams of equality, India\u2019s large dams have instead entrenched some of the most intractable forms of inequality. Those most likely to be uprooted, and least likely to be compensated for their loss of land and livelihood and the rupture of their bonds of community, are marginalized indigenous communities.The first is geopolitical. Taken together, the Himalayan rivers flow through at least 16 countries. In the absence of coordinated planning, dam building becomes a zero-sum game in which downstream users lose out. India fears the construction of a large dam on the Chinese side of the border would affect the flow of the Brahmaputra; Bangladesh, in turn, would bear the consequences of Indian dams on the same river. The potential for conflict looms.Major river systems originating in the Himalayas, where many countries are racing to build dams.MongoliaUzbekistanExtent of each river system\u2019s watershedKyrgyzstanAmu DaryaTarimTurkmenistanTajikistanYellow RiverChinaAfghan.Bhakra Nangal dam IranTIBETShanghaiYangtseIndusNepalPakistanBramhaputraGangesIrrawaddyDhakaMyanmarIndiaBangladeshMekongSalweenRajahmundry ThailandMongoliaExtent of each river system\u2019s watershedUzbek.Kyrgyz.Amu DaryaTarimTurkmen.Tajik.ChinaYellow RiverAfghan.Bhakra Nangal dam ShanghaiIranTIBETYangtsePakistanNepalBramhaputraIndusGangesDhakaIrrawaddyMyanmarIndiaBangladeshMekongRajahmundry SalweenThailandExtent of each river system\u2019s watershedChinaTarimAmu DaryaYellow RiverYangtseIndusBramhaputraGangesIndiaIrrawaddyMekongSalweenBy The New York Times | Source: The Third PoleThe risks are likely to intensify with climate change as areas of the Himalayas warm faster than many other parts of the world. As the glaciers melt more quickly, the Himalayan rivers are projected initially to swell and then, by midcentury, to experience diminished flow. Ecologists and environmental campaigners charge that the new dam projects have not taken climate change adequately into account in their calculations of river flow, silt loads and energy potential. Dams also threaten to intensify flooding downstream during intense downpours when reservoirs overflow.At stake is not just the siting or approval of this or that dam \u2014 it is a whole worldview. Ramaswamy Iyer, India\u2019s water resources secretary in the 1980s, was once a big supporter of dams, but toward the end of his life he turned skeptical. The fundamental problem he identified was the persistence of a \u201ccolonial\u201d approach to water engineering, going back to the legacy of Arthur Cotton. It had bequeathed to India a Western tradition, to which Iyer had no objection, \u201cbut also the underlying Promethean attitude to nature,\u201d which he viewed with suspicion.There doesn\u2019t need to be a binary choice between local solutions and coordination on a larger scale, especially if that coordination reaches beyond national borders. A spirit of caution, wedded to environmental impact assessments with more teeth, better coordinated between the federal and state levels, would help to avert the most flagrant environmental risks. A more open and democratic discussion of resettlement and compensation is needed to reckon honestly with who bears the costs of these schemes. Even minimal attention to the repair and restoration of existing dams, canals, pipes and power lines will lessen the number of dams needed, because large amounts of generated power, as well as irrigation water, are lost to leakage. Better regulation of groundwater use and a concerted policy of recharging depleted aquifers will do more for water security than large reservoirs.Faced with the prospect of catastrophic climate change, we need to better understand the benefits and dangers of 20th-century ideas about harnessing great rivers before damming even more of them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Hearing to Preview Democrats\u2019 Strategy on Big Tech", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Democrats and Google executives worked arm in arm for years, particularly during the Obama administration. But when Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, testifies before Congress on Tuesday, some of the toughest questioning is likely to come from Democrats.The hearing will provide an early glimpse of how Democrats plan to approach Silicon Valley giants in the coming year as they assume control of the House of Representatives. And the testimony from Mr. Pichai, who is appearing before lawmakers after initially resisting, may provide clues about how he and the company will approach them.Democratic lawmakers, angry about Russian misinformation online during the 2016 campaign and concerned about the expanding influence of tech\u2019s biggest companies, are expected to target the industry in the next Congress. Some have already raised concerns about potential antitrust and privacy violations, showing more willingness than Republicans to regulate an industry viewed as an engine of economic growth.Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a Democrat, and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, have warned that Amazon and other tech giants aren\u2019t paying fair wages. Two other Democrats, Senators Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, have called for privacy and online ad legislation, saying big tech companies can\u2019t be trusted to regulate themselves.Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island who sits on the House Judiciary Committee, said, \u201cWe need to restore competition and protect our rights online.\u201d He added: \u201cThe promise of an open internet is fundamentally threatened by the ability of a few powerful gatekeepers to bully competitors, cripple innovation and exploit consumers. This must be a top priority going forward.\u201dThe concerns are aimed broadly across the tech industry. On Tuesday, however, they will focus on Google, as Mr. Pichai will be alone in testifying before the House Judiciary Committee.Republicans have accused Google, Twitter and Facebook of secretly placing conservative voices lower in news feed and search rankings. President Trump and his campaign manager, Brad Parscale, have joined the chorus of critics, saying that the liberal views of Silicon Valley leaders and employees have led them to program their services to limit conservative voices.\u201cRecent reports suggest Google might not be wielding its vast power impartially,\u201d said the House Republican leader, Kevin McCarthy of California, who called on Mr. Pichai to meet with members during his September visit. \u201cIts business practices may have been affected by political bias.\u201dSome Democrats warned that Republicans could focus too much on the accusations of anti-conservative bias, arguing that it would distract from more pressing issues like misinformation and the handling of user data.\u201cThe public has voiced grave concerns about privacy, discrimination, lack of diversity and incivility online,\u201d said Representative Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. \u201cUnfortunately, House Republicans are instead choosing to use their final days in the majority to peddle conspiracy theories about conservative bias.\u201dThe prospect of legislation to rein in tech remains slim, because Republicans still control the Senate and have shown no signs of wanting to add regulations. But the harsh criticism from Democrats has put the companies in a defensive crouch.\u201cThe internet companies\u2019 blue wall of protection in Washington seems to be crumbling,\u201d said Paul Gallant, an analyst at the research firm Cowen & Company. \u201cDemocrats now see political gain in taking on tech.\u201dOn Thursday, Mr. Pichai participated in a White House business round table that included Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, Satya Nadella; Oracle\u2019s co-chief executive Safra Catz; Qualcomm\u2019s chief executive, Steve Mollenkopf; and others.While Mr. Trump made a brief appearance, his daughter and special adviser, Ivanka Trump, represented the White House. She was joined by some administration tech advisers. The topics of discussion included artificial intelligence, quantum computing and next-generation 5G wireless networks.Democratic and Republican lawmakers are also expected to press him on Google\u2019s possible plans for re-entering China, a market the company left in 2010 over concerns about censorship and government hacking.Mr. Pichai has kept a relatively low profile since becoming Google\u2019s chief in 2015. A soft-spoken engineer who grew up in Chennai, India, he worked his way up the ranks at the company and is seen as more at home dealing with products and technology than with policy and politics. But like other technology chief executives facing questions about the societal impact of their products and the policies of their companies, Mr. Pichai is being forced to take a more active role in Washington.Mr. Pichai\u2019s political donations also mirror Google\u2019s attempts to foster better relationships with Republicans. After donating mostly to Democratic candidates since 2008, Mr. Pichai, who is one of the highest-paid executives in Silicon Valley, adopted a more bipartisan approach to his donations.

One of the men got drunk and tried to force some of the women into having sex with him, including inside the women-only dormitory, and both of the men sexually harassed team members, Ms. Popal said.When the players threatened to complain, Ms. Popal told The Guardian, Mr. Keram, a politically influential former governor of Panjshir Province, beat one of them with a snooker cue, and threw her and eight other women off the team, alleging they were lesbians.Hummel also focused on Mr. Keram. \u201cAllegedly, the president was complicit in allowing the abuse to happen, and did not respond to the allegations put forward by the national team,\u201d the company said.Ms. Popal said that when she learned in Jordan about the abuse of players, the victims were concerned about keeping everything quiet for fear that their parents would stop them from playing on the team. She said she had called Mr. Keram to tell him about the abuse.\u201cHe promised that he would follow the issue and punish the abusive trainers,\u201d she said. Instead, they were promoted to other federation jobs, she added.The Afghanistan Football Federation issued a statement calling the allegations \u201cgroundless\u201d and saying it had \u201ca zero-tolerance policy toward any type of such behavior.\u201dIt said no one had ever brought such accusations to its attention.Mr. Keram did not respond to repeated requests for comment over four days. His chief of staff, Massoud Hassimi, said Mr. Keram was still the federation president and that only the main doors of the federation\u2019s offices required fingerprint scans to open.Mr. Ghani did not announce any actions against the soccer federation and did not say if he believed the accusations. \u201cEven if mere allegations cause our people to stop sending their sons and daughters to sports, we need to act immediately and comprehensively,\u201d Mr. Ghani said.FIFA said it had long been aware of the allegations and was investigating them. \u201cFIFA has a zero-tolerance policy on human rights violations and condemns all forms of gender-based violence,\u201d the organization said in a statement. \u201cThe serious subjects mentioned are being looked into by FIFA.\u201dNeither the FIFA statement nor Afghan officials addressed calls from players and Hummel for the Afghan federation or Mr. Keram to be suspended. \u201cOnce the facts are established, whatever remedial measures are needed will be taken,\u201d a FIFA spokesman said.The Afghan soccer federation claims to still have the backing of the women\u2019s team. \u201cIt is grateful for the vocal support of its current female players, who have all published statements on the A.F.F. Facebook page,\u201d it said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Misguided Priorities of Our Educational System", "Date": "2018-12-10", "News": "OpinionWe spend too much money on college students and not enough on everyone else. Supported byMr. Cass is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. Consider two high school seniors \u2014 one who exhibits strong academic talent and one who does not. For one, December marks the homestretch of a yearslong effort, intensively supported by his school, to prepare the perfect college application. For the other, December is just another month on the path to, well, whatever might come after graduation. The former will likely proceed steadily toward a bachelor\u2019s degree; the latter is unlikely to finish college if he enrolls at all. To whom does our education system owe what?That second student, to be clear, has done nothing wrong. He probably clawed his way through his town\u2019s standard college-oriented curriculum, though it neither targeted his interests and abilities nor prepared him for work force success. Looking ahead, he faces a labor market in which he may need to work harder than his college-bound counterpart for lower pay, with fewer options and slower advancement. Yet we celebrate the first student and lavish taxpayer funds on his education. To the second student, we offer little beyond a sympathetic \u201cSorry.\u201d Our education system has become one of our nation\u2019s most regressive institutions.One explanation for this bizarre state of affairs, in which society invests heavily in those headed for economic success while ignoring those falling behind, is the widespread belief that everyone can be a college graduate. If that were true, the shove toward the college pipeline might make sense.A second explanation is the widespread belief that a college diploma is a necessary and sufficient \u201cticket to the middle class.\u201d If that were true, even a small chance at escaping the supposedly sad fate of inadequate education is better than ever admitting defeat.Pushing people from the former category to attend college and land in the latter category does them few favors. And remember, that assumes they graduate; people in their position typically will not. Remember also, those are the outcomes before we attempt to create an attractive non-college pathway that they might prefer and that might equip them for success.What might such a pathway look like? For the roughly $100,000 that the public spends to carry many students through high school and college today, we could offer instead two years of traditional high school, a third year that splits time between a sophisticated vocational program and a subsidized internship, two more years split between subsidized work and employer-sponsored training, and a savings account with $25,000, perhaps for future training. Any American could have, at age 20, three years of work experience, an industry credential and earnings in the bank.For student borrowers unlikely to graduate, the current subsidies succeed mainly in luring them toward a substantial investment of time and money that is both high-risk and low-return. If a good alternative existed, they would be well served to take it. Certainly, the choice should remain theirs. But to decide wisely whether college is worth the cost, they need to actually face the cost.People often applaud vocational education in theory, provided it is \u201cfor someone else\u2019s kids.\u201d Those kids are most kids, and a false promise of college success does more harm than good. We owe them our focus and the best pathway that we can construct \u2014 one that carries them as close as possible to the destination their college-bound peers will reach, and sometimes beyond.Advertisement"}

The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.When it comes to Albany, every labored step out of the ethical muck is something to celebrate.The pay committee, born out of a wily measure tucked into the state budget by Gov. Andrew Cuomo and lawmakers earlier this year, was designed to grant the legislators a hefty raise with no questions asked.Instead, the committee, made up of four well-regarded current and former public servants \u2014 the New York City comptroller, Scott Stringer; the former city comptroller, William Thompson Jr.; the state comptroller, Thomas DiNapoli; and the former state comptroller, H. Carl McCall \u2014 acted responsibly.Per the panel\u2019s unanimous decision on Thursday, state lawmakers, by 2021, will see their pay increase to $130,000, from $79,500 now. But since this essentially acknowledges that legislators are doing a full-time job, their income from other sources will be limited to 15 percent of that salary \u2014 $19,500. Stipends will be eliminated for all but the highest-level positions, preventing legislative leaders from handing them out or pulling them back as rewards and punishments. The final details of the committee\u2019s decision are expected to be released in a report on Monday.Mr. Stringer, one of the committee\u2019s members, said the new rules are based on those of Congress, which sets similar limits on outside income. In an ideal world, which is to say, not New York State politics, these changes would go further. The New York City Council set a better example in 2016 when its members took an open vote to raise their own pay and eliminate nearly all forms of outside income and committee stipends. Albany lawmakers wanted a fat pay increase with no strings attached. Some have said the committee has no legal right to attach strings. The members of the pay committee chose to set a higher standard for public service. If the legislators don\u2019t like it, they can reject the reforms, and the raise.An earlier version of this editorial misstated the legal status of form State Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos and former Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver. Both have been sentenced to prison on corruption charges, but neither has been imprisoned yet.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "To Deal With Trump, Look to Voltaire ", "Date": "2018-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdvice from the Enlightenment: In the face of crude bullying and humorless lies, try wit and a passion for justice. Professor Darnton specializes in the French Enlightenment. How can we restore a healthy climate? There is no easy answer, but some historic figures offer edifying examples. The one I propose may seem unlikely, but he transformed the climate of opinion in his era: Voltaire, the French philosopher who mobilized the power of Enlightenment principles in 18th-century Europe.Actually, I think that last line, which is among the most famous in all literature, should be understood as a call to engagement. \u201cCultivation\u201d means commitment to culture, to civility, to civilization itself. That is the argument I want to make.To those encountering him for the first time, Voltaire can look like a historical curiosity. His archaic wig and libertine wit seem to belong to a forgotten corner of the past. Moreover, he can be considered a conservative. He curried favor with the high and mighty, especially Louis XV. He was so deeply committed to the cultural system developed under France\u2019s previous ruler, Louis XIV, that he would fail any test of political correctness today. And Voltaire opposed education for the masses because, he said, someone had to tend the fields.So, forget the wig. But reconsider the wit. Nothing works better than ridicule in cutting bigots down to size. \u201cI have never made but one prayer to God,\u201d Voltaire wrote, \u201ca very short one: \u2018O Lord, make my enemies ridiculous.\u2019 And God granted it.\u201d The first of the two most powerful weapons in his arsenal was laughter: \u201cWe must get the laughter on our side,\u201d he instructed his auxiliary troops in the salons of Paris.Ridicule works outside salons. We in America have Stephen Colbert on television. We had H.L. Mencken in the newspapers and Mark Twain in books. Yet wit can sound elitist, and Voltaire cultivated the elite, especially in his youth, when he celebrated wealth, pleasure and the good things of life. His poem \u201cLe Mondain,\u201d written in 1736, is an apology for worldly luxury \u2014 \u201cthe superfluous, a very necessary thing,\u201d he wrote, in opposition to Christian asceticism.That was Voltaire the young libertine. But now, in our contemporary crisis, I propose that we look also to Voltaire the angry old man. It was in his old age, during the 1760s and 1770s, that he wielded his second and most powerful weapon, moral passion.In 1762 Voltaire learned about a case of judicial murder. The Parlement (high court) of Toulouse had condemned a Protestant merchant, Jean Calas, to be tortured and executed for supposedly killing his son, who supposedly had intended to convert to Catholicism. Not only were the suppositions wrong, but strong evidence pointed to Calas\u2019s innocence. To Voltaire, the case represented far more than a miscarriage of justice. It epitomized atrocities that had been inflicted on Protestants for two centuries. They had been slaughtered, driven out of the country, forced to convert to Catholicism and deprived of civil rights, including the rights to marry and inherit property within the law. Beyond the persecution of Protestants, Voltaire saw intolerance in general, and beyond intolerance, barbarism.Voltaire seized his pen. He composed the \u201cTreatise on Tolerance,\u201d one of the greatest defenses of religious liberty and civil rights ever written. He also wrote letters, hundreds of them, to all his contacts in the power elite \u2014 ministers, courtiers, salon leaders and fellow philosophers, working from the top down and manipulating the media of his day so skillfully that he created a tidal wave of public opinion, which would ultimately lead to the recognition of rights for Protestants in 1787, nine years after he died.Voltaire ended many of those letters with a rallying cry, \u201c\u00c9crasez l\u2019inf\u00e2me\u201d \u2014 \u201cCrush the vile thing.\u201d For him, the meaning of \u201cl\u2019inf\u00e2me\u201d could be extended from intolerance to superstition and injustices of all kinds. The opposing notion of tolerance shaded off into broader values, including civility \u2014 the virtue that we need so much today and that Voltaire identified with civilization. Voltaire saw the triumph of civilization over barbarity as the ultimate good inscribed in the historical process. He made the message clear in his most ambitious work, \u201cEssai sur les moeurs et l\u2019esprit des nations\u201d\u2014 \u201cEssay on the Manners and Spirit of Nations\u201d \u2014 a survey of world history that he first published in 1756 and revised and expanded until his death in 1778.What more can we aspire to in the age of Trump? The opposition to bigotry and the defense of civil rights once again call for a commitment to the cause of civilization. They require moral passion seasoned with wit.Cultivate gardens. \u00c9crasez l\u2019inf\u00e2me.Robert Darnton is an emeritus professor at Harvard University.

Trump\u2019s jokes merely ridicule.Opinion Columnist\u201cHe never lost his sense of humor,\u201d the former senator from Wyoming said of his friend of more than 50 years. \u201cHumor is the universal solvent against the abrasive elements of life. That\u2019s what humor is. He never hated anyone. He knew what his mother and my mother always knew: hatred corrodes the container it\u2019s carried in.\u201dDid Donald Trump catch any of this as he sat there in the first pew? Lindsey Graham, the episodically spineful Republican from South Carolina, has claimed that, in private, the 45th president is \u201cfunny as hell\u201d and has \u201ca great sense of humor.\u201d If so, it\u2019s a better kept secret than his tax returns.But Trump, I suspect, isn\u2019t unfunny. He\u2019s anti-funny. Humor humanizes. It uncorks, unstuffs, informalizes. Used well, it puts people at ease. Trump\u2019s method is the opposite: He wants people ill at ease. Doing so preserves his capacity to wound, his sense of superiority, his distance. Good jokes highlight the ridiculous. Trump\u2019s jokes merely ridicule. They are caustics, not emollients.This brings me to Simpson\u2019s second, connected point: \u201cHatred corrodes the container it\u2019s carried in.\u201dIn June 1971, Richard Nixon sent a memo to Chief of Staff Bob Haldeman complaining that his good-natured appearance at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner had been followed by a press conference in which \u201cthe reporters were considerably more bad-mannered and vicious than usual.\u201dThe press, of course, mostly hated Nixon, and he repaid them in kind. His mistake was to suppose that his only choice lay between ingratiation and hatred, rather than indifference and humor. It left him incapable of rising above. Till the end of his presidency, Nixon was trapped by a thirst for approval he would never get and an appetite for destruction he could never achieve.In sum, that humor in democratic politics is also its most effective weapon: the strongest shield and the sharpest blade. It doesn\u2019t just amuse, leaven and comfort. It defangs, attracts, and mobilizes. Winston Churchill was a wit, as were Jack Kennedy and Ronald Reagan. Nixon and Jimmy Carter weren\u2019t.Does any of this make a dent on Trump? I doubt it. His character is what it is. And his style of politics isn\u2019t democratic so much as it is cult-of-personality. Trump appeared engaged throughout the service, but I suspect that Simpson\u2019s speech flew right past him.It shouldn\u2019t fly past the rest of us. This is an angry age, in which Trump\u2019s critics also simmer in rage, ridicule, self-importance, self-pity \u2014 and hatred, too. They think they\u2019re reproaching the president. Increasingly they reflect him. Simpson\u2019s message contains a warning to us all.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Case Against Meritocracy", "Date": "2018-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAn aristocracy that can\u2019t admit it.Opinion ColumnistThis week I briefly trended on Twitter \u2014 a bracing experience for any columnist, because it means that you\u2019ve done your job of provocation a little bit too well.This argument was read by certain readers (and a few social media non-readers) as a paean to white privilege, even a brief for white supremacy. In these misreadings, there was an assumption that to praise, in any way, the elite that predated the modern meritocracy is to reject racial diversity, minority and female advancement, in favor of permanent white rule.That\u2019s not my view. Rather I think ideals of diversity and meritocracy are two different ways of shaping an elite, which can advance together but which are just as often separable, or even in tension with each other.And I would separate them. I think it was a good and necessary thing that the American upper class diversified, and that more African-Americans and Jews and Catholics (like myself) and women now share privileges and powers once reserved for Protestant white men.But I think that same upper class was unwise to abandon an aristocratic self-conception in favor of a meritocratic one. On the evidence we have, the meritocratic ideal ends up being just as undemocratic as the old emphasis on inheritance and tradition, and it forges an elite that has an aristocracy\u2019s vices (privilege, insularity, arrogance) without the sense of duty, self-restraint and noblesse oblige that WASPs at their best displayed.Here it\u2019s important to stress that a WASP was not just any white Protestant or upper-crust American of the pre-1960s past. The term properly refers to a specific kind of American elite, mostly from the Northeast, mostly high-church Protestants, concentrated in a few cities (Boston, Philadelphia, New York, plus some Midwestern and Californian outposts), generally associated with the Republican Party (with occasional defectors like F.D.R.), who dominated a particular set of fields (academia, finance, foreign policy) and shared the code of service and piety and manners that defined the elder Bush\u2019s career.The WASPs were distinct from other white elites \u2014 including the planter class that ruled the South, the regional elites that emerged as the frontier moved westward, the immigrant tycoons who challenged WASP power in the East. Their importance rested, to borrow from a WASP acquaintance\u2019s email this week, on being \u201cprimus inter pares\u201d \u2014 first among equals, with a particular kind of power in a particular set of institutions, and an ability to set a tone for the American upper class that was adopted by other groups when they ascended.And ascend they often did, because the older American system was both hierarchical and permeable, with room for actual merit even without a meritocratic organizing theory.Those advancing groups included non-Anglo-Saxons, and eventually non-Protestants and non-whites. In the middle of the 20th century, you could find elite Catholics who imitated WASPishness \u2014 think of William F. Buckley Jr. or the Kennedys. You could even find WASPish African-Americans: The oldest summer colony for black Americans, and not coincidentally a place where the somewhat WASPy Barack Obama liked to hang out in the summer, sits on the shores of the WASP isle of Martha\u2019s Vineyard.These imitations existed in the shadow of racial apartheid and residual anti-Catholicism. But their example suggested that an aristocratic spirit was transferable to a more diverse elite, that there could be Catholic and African-American and Jewish aristocrats \u2014 like, say, the family that has long stewarded this newspaper \u2014 who could adopt the WASP establishment\u2019s upper-class virtues without the ethnic and religious chauvinism.But then the WASPs themselves decided to dissolve their own aristocracy, and transform their once-Protestant universities into a secular mass-opportunity system \u2014 a more democratic way of education, in which anyone with enough talent could climb the ladder, and personal achievement and technical expertise would be prized above all else.This was meritocracy, the system that we now take for granted. And for several reasons it didn\u2019t work as planned.First, meritocracy segregates talent rather than dispersing it. By plucking the highest achievers from all over the country and encouraging them to cluster together in the same few cities, it robs localities of their potential leaders \u2014 so that instead of an Eastern establishment negotiating with overlapping groups of regional elites (or with working-class or ethnic leaders), you have a mass upper class segregated from demoralized peripheries.Second, the meritocratic elite inevitably tends back toward aristocracy, because any definition of \u201cmerit\u201d you choose will be easier for the children of these self-segregated meritocrats to achieve.But even as it restratifies society, the meritocratic order also insists that everything its high-achievers have is justly earned. \u201cHe was born on third base and thought he hit a triple,\u201d Ann Richards famously quipped of George H.W. Bush; well, the typical meritocrat is born on third base, hustles home, and gets praised as if he just hit a grand slam.This spirit discourages inherited responsibility and cultural stewardship; it brushes away the disciplines of duty; it makes the past seem irrelevant, because everyone is supposed to come from the same nowhere and rule based on technique alone.As a consequence, meritocrats are often educated to be bad leaders, and bad people, in a very specific way \u2014 a way of arrogant intelligence unmoored from historical experience, ambition untempered by self-sacrifice. The way of the \u201cbest and the brightest\u201d at the dawn of the technocratic era and the \u201csmartest guys in the room\u201d decades later, the way of the arsonists of late-2000s Wall Street and the \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d culture of Silicon Valley.Diversity, despite what many liberals want to think, does not provide a solution to this problem. A diverse elite may be good in its own right, as a matter of justice and representation. But nothing about being a woman or a minority makes you immune to meritocracy\u2019s ruthless solipsism. Just ask Elizabeth Holmes or the slipping-from-grace Sheryl Sandberg, exceptions to the Silicon Valley boys\u2019 club whose trajectories prove the meritocratic rule.Which is why it\u2019s worth looking backward and forward at the same time as we contemplate what\u2019s wrong with our elite. I don\u2019t want to bring back the WASPs; if I had the magic wand to conjure a different elite, it would be a multiracial, multilingual Catholic aristocracy ruling from Quebec to Chile. (Hey, you asked.)But I do want to raise the possibility that an aristocracy that knows itself to be one might be more clearsighted and effective than an aristocracy that doesn\u2019t, and that the WASPs had at least one clear advantage over their presently-floundering successors: They knew who and what they were.Advertisement"}

And then I saw her photography.Ms. Stapinski is a journalist.Few things are more painful than loving a 15-year-old girl, particularly when she is your child. Ask any mother who has been through a daughter\u2019s adolescence and she will nod in sympathy, maybe even give you the hug you have been missing.I yearn for those nights when my daughter, Paulina, couldn\u2019t sleep and I spooned her tiny body in the recesses of mine, her warmth commingling with mine, putting us both into a coma.These days, I barely see or talk to her. She\u2019s busy with school, and when she has free time she would rather be out with friends. I get it. I hear snippets of her life ringing from her upstairs room, conversations and laughter, favorite songs occasionally played in the car from her iPhone.I know. I know. I remember how I treated my mother at that age. Not wanting to talk to her, much less walk near her on the sidewalk. I became enraged when she secretly looked in my diary, obviously snooping for information about my pot smoking or sex life.But now that I had my own teenage girl, I realized for the first time that my mother wasn\u2019t even looking for anything incriminating. She was simply looking for me. Trying to catch a glimpse of the girl she had given birth to, the full-grown person she had nurtured who was now walking swiftly away from her.From this vantage point, a new, sadder realization struck me: I no longer saw Paulina in her natural habitat, telling jokes or even crying with those she was close to. I was losing her to the world. Which is the point of your children growing up. If you do a good job, they go out into that world and make a life.Then a few days ago, I bumped into Maddie, a friend of my older son, Dean, who\u2019s away at college. We chatted about how school was, if she\u2019d spoken to Dean, if she missed home. And then she asked, \u201cHow\u2019s Paulina?\u201d\u201cGood, I think,\u201d I said, mentioning that she was taking a class at the International Center for Photography. \u201cShe loves photography. Hates her math teacher.\u201dThen Maddie, eyes wide, asked, \u201cHave you seen her Instagram feed?\u201dI started to panic. All I could think of were other parents I had spoken to whose daughters\u2019 feeds were filled with revealing photos. Parents who had to take their children\u2019s phones and computers away because of inappropriate posts or texts. Oh God, I thought. Here it comes.\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d Maddie said. \u201cShe\u2019s a great photographer. She has over a thousand followers.\u201dI had never asked to see Paulina\u2019s feed. I didn\u2019t even know the name she used. But a thousand followers?That night, I got up the nerve to ask Paulina if I could follow her on Instagram. Miraculously, she said yes, shrugging as she walked up the stairs to her room. I grabbed my phone, and suddenly, there it was: Paulina\u2019s life. In black-and-white and full color.There were photos of her girlfriends hanging out in the bathroom at school, friends goofing around at a spot they call Venice in Gowanus, where Brooklyn teenagers go after classes, and a great shot of all the boys\u2019 skateboards piled straight up in someone\u2019s hallway. An artistic shot of an empty, rumpled bed in a friend\u2019s room in Rockaway. A lonely place setting in a Japanese restaurant. Not just photos, but beautifully framed photos. Taken by my daughter.Social media has been blamed for ruining our democracy, shortening our children\u2019s attention spans and undermining the fabric of society. But through it, I was able to be with Paulina out in the world again, to see what she sees, to virtually stand beside her and witness the people and places she moves through, in nearly real time. Not in a parent-policing role, but in a wonderful-world sort of way.Then there was the photo she posted of herself as a little girl among autumn leaves, wearing a checkered skirt, pink leotard and green high-tops.\u201cWish I was still a little kid,\u201d the caption read.So I wasn\u2019t the only one.Helene Stapinski is a journalist and the author of \u201cMurder in Matera: A True Story of Passion, Family and Forgiveness in Southern Italy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jim Mattis Kept His Country From the \u2018Dark Side\u2019", "Date": "2018-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith the retirement of the secretary of defense, the U.S. risks a return to the \u201cenhanced interrogation\u201d techniques used after Sept. 11.Mr. Weston was a State Department official in Iraq and Afghanistan.The room of about 200 Marine officers, who were grade-schoolers on Sept. 11, 2001, also debated torture. Clicking yes-or-no buttons, 40 percent responded \u201cyes\u201d when asked, \u201cIs it acceptable to torture?\u201d The number increased to 55 percent when the captains were asked if torture was O.K. if an enemy prisoner of war knew the location of a missing fellow service member. The general stood out to me when he ordered Marines to make a ramshackle wooden operations center \u201clook better than Yosemite\u2019s visitor center,\u201d as one Marine put it. He wanted visiting Iraqi delegations to feel more at ease despite the hard talk that took place in the center on the eve of the biggest battle of the Iraq war. The great risk today, almost two years after the Senate voted 99 to 1 to confirm Mr. Mattis, is that an overtly political person will take his place. The likelihood of a new Pentagon chief who prioritizes loyalty to a president over loyalty to the ideals and values of the country could signal a renewed willingness to blur lines in the moral conduct of American foreign policy. When Mr. Mattis decamps from Washington in February, the United States risks a return to the \u201cdark side\u201d of its conduct after Sept. 11. Only the United States can really hold itself to account in how it engages with the rest of the world. And many other governments, good and bad, will continue to see the bar for conduct either being raised or lowered depending on America\u2019s lead. The Saudis are arguably the most relevant example in this regard right now, given the recent murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.Maintaining a moral compass in a time of peace is important. But in a time of seeming endless conflict, it is critical that a clear ethical code flows down from the top of the military. Should terrorists succeed in bringing fear once again to American skies and cities, the temptation to bring back torture as our policy will likely be great in an administration that denigrates alliances and devalues international institutions, treaties and law.The military rightly gives medals for all sorts of battlefield bravery. But it is the stories of moral courage that I remember most from my seven years in Iraq and Afghanistan.In one instance, a Marine sergeant who had just returned from patrol to Camp Leatherneck in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, told a commanding general, \u201cSir, with all due respect I disagree,\u201d then proceeded to offer important insights into a coming battle in Taliban-filled poppy fields. In another case, a corporal openly criticized the military\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy toward gays as several Marine generals listened in. The Pentagon does not give medals for the moral courage to stand up and speak the hard truths \u2014 but it should. In the next months, one can imagine many moments when the well-being of our government and our democratic values will depend on the willingness of our best public servants to challenge, respectfully but forcefully, America\u2019s commander in chief. Perhaps one of those voices will be a recently retired secretary of defense.And if Mr. Mattis adds another title to his long r\u00e9sum\u00e9 \u2014 \u201cauthor\u201d \u2014 future Marine Corps University students studying the moral dimensions of war will be a ready audience.

{"Headline": "Breast Cancer Risk May Rise After Childbirth, but Is Still Low", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCompared with women who have never given birth, those who recently had babies may have a slight increased risk of breast cancer that peaks after about five years and then gradually declines, according to a study published this week.The degree of risk increases with the mother\u2019s age at the time she gave birth.The results sound disturbing, especially for women who already have more than enough stress taking care of young children. But even with the increase, the risk of breast cancer in young women before menopause remains very low, researchers say.\u201cWe don\u2019t want women to feel alarmed or frightened,\u201d Hazel B. Nichols, an epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, and the lead author of the study, said in an interview.To show that the risk is small, Dr. Nichols explained that in women between the ages of 41 and 50 who had given birth in the previous three to seven years, the study found that 2.2 percent developed breast cancer, while in those who had not had babies, the figure was 1.9 percent. The increase in risk lasted for about 20 years. No rise in risk was detected in women who had babies before age 25.The median age at diagnosis is 62. Other studies have shown that women who had children appear to gain a protective benefit against breast cancer later in life, which Dr. Armstrong said is likely to far outweigh the earlier rise in risk.\u201cIn almost every study, the overarching result is that having children reduces your risk of breast cancer over your life time,\u201d Dr. Armstrong said in an interview.She added that although the transient increase in risk is small, it is important for women who have given birth recently to see a doctor if they notice anything abnormal in their breasts, and not to chalk it up to some quirk of pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding.Both researchers said that the findings should not influence women\u2019s decisions about if or when to have children. But they said the information, combined with other factors like family history, reproductive history and genetic tests, could help women and their doctors assess their individual risks and decide if and when to begin screening tests like mammography.For instance, Dr. Armstrong said, a woman who had no children before 25 and gave birth in her late 30s might decide to start screening earlier.The studies were observational, meaning they were not controlled experiments, but were based on following patients\u2019 histories and looking for patterns and associations. Such studies cannot prove cause and effect, but in this case they are the only source of information because women cannot be picked at random and assigned to groups that either do or don\u2019t have babies.Paradoxical as it may seem that childbirth could both raise and lower the risk of breast cancer, researchers say that appears to be the case. The pattern has turned up in study after study.The reason is not known, but there are possible explanations. The risk might increase after birth, Dr. Nichols said, because \u201cthere is rapid cellular proliferation in the breast, and any time where tissue or cells are rapidly growing, there is a small potential for errors to be made when a cell is copying or dividing, or if there is an error in the cell, there\u2019s an opportunity for it to be copied and reproduced many times.\u201dAs for the protective effect of childbirth, she said that when breast tissue goes through the complete development process involved in producing milk, it becomes less susceptible to developing cancer later in life.Dr. Armstrong said other factors might also be involved, like changes in the immune system related to pregnancy or to the stress and fatigue of caring for young children, or to changes in the microbiome in the breast.The average age of women entering the studies was 41.8 years, ranging from 16 to 54.9. On average, they were followed for 10.8 years, but not past 55. Those who had children when they were young were followed for decades, long enough for researchers to see that the risk gradually diminished, and at about 24 years after the last birth, the protective effect actually emerged.Because so many women were studied, the researchers were able to get meaningful information about various factors that could influence the odds of developing breast cancer. They found that the transient risk increased in women who had more than one child or were older at their first birth, and in those who had a family history of breast cancer. Contrary to popular beliefs, breastfeeding did not lower the risk that followed childbirth, though it does appear to have a protective effect later in life.Most breast cancers, 70 percent or 80 percent, are \u201cER positive,\u201d meaning that the hormone estrogen helps them grow. The study found that in women who had another type of breast tumor \u2014 ER negative, or not sensitive to estrogen \u2014 the late-in-life benefit of childbirth never kicked in.Dr. Nichols said that the point of the study was to help determine how the risk factors for breast cancer change over the course of a woman\u2019s life.\u201cWe have to move to really understanding the biological mechanisms,\u201d Dr. Armstrong said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to take these studies and the transformation in our ability to study human biology, using new tools like genomics, proteomics and immunology. Otherwise, you just create a kind of pregnancy scare.\u201cAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Unfazed Alaska, a Major Quake Is Just a Bump in the Road", "Date": "2018-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byANCHORAGE \u2014 Tomasz Sulczynski had been driving for nearly four hours through rural Alaska on Friday when the biggest earthquake to hit the state in half a century began twisting the road beneath him.He had begun the day in Homer, a remote fishing village down the coast, and was headed for the Anchorage airport with his girlfriend, Rebecca Taylor, in a red 2014 GMC Terrain. Now they found themselves stranded in a sinkhole about 10 feet deep.Images of the wrecked road circulated nationally all weekend, an emblem of the destructive force that Alaskans endured when the magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck on Friday. The frightful scene elicited astonishment that anyone could have survived.Mr. Sulczynski, 46, felt that sense of awe, too. But he also had a flight to catch.Among the broken concrete slabs, he and Ms. Taylor got out of the S.U.V. and climbed out of the hole. Then they hitched a ride to Ted Stevens International, a few miles away \u2014 and made the flight.\u201cThat part wasn\u2019t that big of a deal,\u201d Mr. Sulczynski said later. \u201cIt was all so surreal and happened so fast that there was no time to get scared.\u201dThe state is called the Last Frontier for a reason, and residents pride themselves on their rugged endurance. That entrenched attitude may seem hokey in the Lower 48, but it is etched into the very skin of Alaska residents, winter after winter. Daily life in the state can be harsh, but there is also much dignity to be found in resilience.Mr. Sulczynski and Ms. Taylor have become the latest embodiment of that ethos: When nature sends its worst, an Alaskan moves along without complaining. \u201cDrive to Anchorage didn\u2019t quite go as planned!\u201d Mr. Sulczynski posted later on Facebook, his pictures drawing shock and laughter.Julie Davis, another Homer resident, summarized the terror and the joy in her response to his post: \u201cAn eyewitness, interviewed on TV, just said you left your car and headed to the airport to catch your flight! You are a true Alaskan!\u201dThe earthquake drew instant comparisons to the one that heavily damaged downtown Anchorage in 1964. That earthquake, the most powerful on record in the United States and the second-strongest anywhere, was magnitude 9.2; it killed more than 100 people and caused a tsunami that destroyed many small towns along the Alaska coast.Friday\u2019s earthquake struck just seven miles from Anchorage, but the fact that it was relatively deep \u2014 nearly 30 miles below ground \u2014 combined with the rigorous building code enforcement in the region helped mitigate a potential catastrophe. There have been no casualties reported in connection with the earthquake, and only two reports of structure collapse.And so, even though significant aftershocks continue to awaken people in the night, by Sunday most Alaskans had already started putting the quake behind them.Teodore Odena, 27, said that the response has been true to Alaska, through and through.\u201cWe have tough skin,\u201d Mr. Odena said during breakfast at Snow City Caf\u00e9 in downtown Anchorage. \u201cNo offense, but you look at the Lower 48, and you hear every time they have a snowstorm. Dealing with the elements, Alaskans have that resilience, we just push forward.\u201dMr. Odena was on his way to work at the Alaska Department of Fish and Game on Friday morning, and at first he thought he had a flat tire. He realized it was an earthquake when the road started bouncing up and down and the swaying streetlights began to flicker. When he got to his office, furniture had toppled over and had partially blocked a hallway as people were evacuating.Cleanup may take a while, he conceded.Alaska became a state in 1959, but it remains deeply misunderstood by many Americans who have never lived there. There are plenty of stereotypes that make Alaskans bristle; questions about igloos draw particular ire. And there are disagreements about what an Alaskan really is. Few people can truly live up to the myth of the self-reliant frontiersman, and sometimes that can cause dissonance. The state itself falls short of the ideal, relying heavily on the federal government, especially in rural areas.But if there\u2019s one shared quality most Alaskans will agree on, it is that the state\u2019s people are tough, because they have to be.Amber Lindstrom, 31, a lifelong Alaskan, was at work in Palmer, about 35 miles northeast of Anchorage, when the earthquake started. She said some ceiling tiles fell, but that overall, things returned to normal very quickly. She said on Sunday that Alaskan toughness has been a key theme in the response to the earthquake, but she stressed that tough does not mean callous or selfish.\u201cAlaskans can take care of ourselves, but we also try to take care of others,\u201d she said. \u201cThe big thing afterward was checking in on everyone to make sure everyone was O.K.\u201dThe earthquake, she added, was \u201cone of those sort of things that\u2019s like, O.K., now this has actually happened. It was weird, but once we checked in on everyone and cleaned up, it was fine.\u201dThe Anchorage fire chief, Jodie Hettrick, urged residents who had experienced any anxiety or trouble sleeping after the quake to pursue mental health services. Aftershocks on Friday night in particular kept many people awake.\u201cNow that the aftershocks have slowed down a little bit,\u201d Chief Hettrick said, \u201cis the time to really focus on some self-care.\u201dEven the most enthusiastic Alaska evangelists will acknowledge that living in the state has some drawbacks, not least the cost of living. Mr. Sulczynski said food is \u201csuper expensive,\u201d gasoline can be very pricey, and housing can be difficult to afford on regional salaries.The state is also prone to all kinds of natural disasters, not just quakes.\u201cThe earthquakes don\u2019t faze me at all,\u201d Mr. Sulczynski said. \u201cI\u2019ve lived through a couple of volcano explosions where our town was covered in ash. Yeah, it\u2019s always kind of interesting, I suppose.\u201dIn fact, he said, his main complaint is much more prosaic. \u201cThe only thing that kind of gets me once in a while, especially when I\u2019m working a lot, is the winters, when it\u2019s dark,\u201d he said. \u201cYou go to work, sit in an office all day, and then you get out and it\u2019s still dark. I get pretty grumpy.\u201dBut he also deeply enjoys life in his coastal town, he said; he can kite-ski, kayak, surf, hike. He particularly enjoys long rides along scenic Alaska highways on his motorcycle.Like many Alaskans, he was born elsewhere, moved to Alaska on a lark, and has fallen in love with the state. He grew up in San Jose, Calif., and moved to Homer 18 years ago to be closer to his wife\u2019s family (they have since divorced).His hometown was \u201csuburbia at its finest, or worst, depending on your take,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great place for me to visit and to vacation for a week. But the millions of people and freeways and traffic and strip malls and all that \u2014 I\u2019m just so over it.\u201dHe said he would never move back: \u201cAlaska is home. Once you\u2019ve been an Alaskan long enough, you really don\u2019t belong anywhere else.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Days Later, Mayor Apologizes to Woman Whose Child Was Torn From Her Arms", "Date": "2018-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMayor Bill de Blasio has, since it became well publicized last weekend, mostly kept silent about an episode last week in which law enforcement personnel at a Brooklyn government office ripped a 1-year-old boy from his mother\u2019s arms and arrested her.Other elected officials have vehemently condemned the way the woman, Jazmine Headley, was treated, but Mr. de Blasio made only two brief comments about it on Twitter.On Wednesday, the mayor broke his silence to apologize to Ms. Headley, to criticize the way she was treated and to defend his response to it.\u201cI want to apologize to her on behalf of all 8.6 million New Yorkers,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said during his weekly news conference on Wednesday, at a public housing complex in Bushwick, Brooklyn.He added, \u201cWhat happened to Jazmine Headley and her son Damone should never have happened, should never happen to anybody.\u201dHe said that he first learned of the episode on Sunday evening and then inquired about it to officials at the Police Department and the Human Resources Administration.\u201cI reached out to the commissioners involved for an update on what had happened and why,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cThey both told me they were getting facts immediately. Until I got their side of what happened, I could not speak to the public. Once I had it I did.\u201dHe added, \u201cWhat I say has to be definitive.\u201dMs. Headley appeared in court in New Jersey on Wednesday. Brian Neary, her lawyer, said she was accepted into a pretrial intervention program that would require her to do 20 hours of community service and report periodically to the authorities in order to have the charges dismissed.Ms. Headley, 23, had gone to the benefits center to inquire about receiving child care vouchers. She had waited for hours and was sitting on the floor when she apparently got into a dispute with a security guard.Mr. de Blasio first addressed the matter Monday afternoon, when he posted a message on Twitter, calling it disturbing and saying that the Police Department and the Human Resources Administration would \u201cget to the bottom of what happened.\u201dOn Tuesday he posted another Twitter message praising the Brooklyn district attorney\u2019s office for its decision to drop the charges.But while the mayor stuck to Twitter, other elected officials spoke out publicly. On Tuesday, the City Council Speaker, Corey Johnson, appeared to refer indirectly to the mayor when he said during a rally in support of Ms. Headley on the City Hall steps that \u201cevery leader in this city\u201d had an obligation to speak out about the episode and to call for her release from Rikers Island.Mr. de Blasio, who has showed himself loath in the past to criticize the police, was quick to blame the peace officers, although he said that a review of the episode had not yet been completed and it was not clear what each of the officers had done.\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable to me that people who have the title \u2018peace officer\u2019 would do this to a woman and her baby,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe that by the time the N.Y.P.D. arrived the situation was already out of hand and should not have been.\u201dTwo peace officers have been placed on modified duty.Mr. de Blasio has often refused to apologize for mistakes made by city agencies. But on Wednesday, he tried to empathize with Ms. Headley. He used words such as \u201coutraged\u201d and phrases like \u201cdisgusted as a parent\u201d to describe his feelings.\u201cI\u2019ve been in those benefit centers. I\u2019ve talked to a lot of people in need in this city,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cWhatever was happening, there was no reason to get physical. She was not presenting a danger.\u201dThe news conference centered on the mayor\u2019s plan to shore up the city\u2019s crumbling public housing system, which is home to 400,000 low-income New Yorkers and faces a daunting $32 billion in unmet capital needs.The de Blasio administration also struck a deal with the New York City Housing Authority\u2019s biggest union, which would allow caretakers and supervisors to work longer hours and weekends in order to make apartment repairs when residents are typically home.The agency also expects to replace 297 of its lowest-performing boilers by 2026 and replace 405 elevators at 30 developments, where 58,000 residents live. Nycha will also take measures to cut the rat population at its developments by half by the end of 2020.Luis Ferr\u00e9-Sadurn\u00ed contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "All Text and No Subtext", "Date": "2018-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat will the historians of the future learn from the past week in Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter feed?Contributing Opinion Writer At least that is how it felt at the end of a week in which President Trump used the social communications medium and was used by it in ways that the founders never would have envisioned. While Twitter as a direct line to, well, everyone, has been a hallmark of the Trump presidency, his persistent and increasing use of it over the last several days has reached new and truly bizarre levels.The bully pulpit has become the bully tweet \u2014 with an emphasis on bully.Mr. Trump wrote two dozen twitchy posts in just 24 hours from Thursday to Friday, employing more capitalization and exclamation marks than a Macy\u2019s after-holidays sales ad. He tweeted threats to shut down the government over the funding of the border wall; he tweeted farewell to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who resigned in protest over the pullout of troops in Syria and Afghanistan; he tweeted criticism of the Fed on interest rates; and in honor of the Farm Bill, he tweeted a truly bizarre video of him singing the \u201cGreen Acres\u201d theme song at an Emmy Awards show with the Throwback Thursday hashtag.The uses and abuses of Twitter will doubtless be studied by historians in decades to come. It shows us the entire ruling class strafing one another in the digital ether, but with disturbing real-life implications. \u201cThe Democrats now own the shutdown!\u201d Mr. Trump declared to his 56.3 million followers, as if he were commenting on a baseball game, even though it meant tens of thousands of government employees could soon be without a paycheck.There is one positive way of looking at this whole situation: The smoky back rooms are all gone now, making way for a 24-hour feed that chronicles every bit of the action under klieg lights. There are no secrets, no side deals in the shadows, no quiet signaling. Instead, it is all text and no subtext, moving from action, reaction, reaction to the reaction and so on.We used to say no one should see the sausage being made. But the digital age of Twitter and Trump turns that on its head. You see not only the making of the sausage, but also the goring of the pig and the butchering, too, followed by the eating of the sausage and then what happens after that. Nothing is left unsaid, even if nothing that\u2019s being said means much at all.It also makes one wonder exactly what Mr. Trump would do without Twitter, which has become his best and only true way to communicate. He can certainly go on television and he does; he can make a live speech and he does; he can stand out on the White House lawn and he does. But it\u2019s not the same. The lightning-fast, easy-hit addiction of Twitter has Mr. Trump hooked like none other.And there are zero alternatives online. Facebook is too bloated and slow; Snapchat is too small and hard to use for the olds; Reddit is a hot mess. There is no other digital harbor for Mr. Trump\u2019s carnival barker show, no place where both the left and right can react and where all the media gathers.So what would happen to the president who governs by tweet if he finally did or said something that forced Twitter to throw him off the platform? Could he do his job at all? Advertisement"}

{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "When Merrill moved to Nashville to study violin performance at college, she and her father were no longer able to just pick up instruments and play together whenever they wanted. Nor were little things like walking the dogs or discovering new coffee shops possible. \u201cI had spent so much time with her as she grew up,\u201d Jonathan Merrill says. \u201cIt was a big change.\u201dWhat they missed from those moments are the building blocks that satisfy a hard-wired need within us all: connecting with those we care about. It\u2019s part of what makes us human, and it is essential for our well-being, says Darby Saxbe, a psychologist at the University of Southern California.\u201cWithout human connection we would not survive,\u201d Saxbe says. \u201cThe desire to feel connected is really built into our brains and bodies.\u201dConnection does much more than just improve our social lives. It has tangible effects on a person\u2019s overall well-being too, says Moira Burke, a research scientist at Facebook who studies how people communicate.\u201cInteracting with people can be as good for your health as quitting smoking,\u201d Burke says, referencing research popularized by political scientist Robert Putnam.But what happens when pursuits separate us physically from our relationships? How can Rowen Merrill stay connected with her family from 2,000 miles away while also pursuing her dream? The answer may lie with a new technology and its ability to expand the boundaries of human connection.When battling distance and hectic schedules, many of us look to quality time \u2014 devoting a block of time to a shared activity \u2014 as the gold standard for connection. But experts view things differently. Connections form via \u201cquality moments\u201d or the everyday things we do together, according to Tamar Kremer-Sadlik, an anthropologist at the University of California, Los Angeles.For some, it might mean debating the latest episode of a TV show or sharing a meal. For Merrill and her father, it\u2019s often talking about and listening to music.\u201cShe helps me stay current,\u201d Jonathan Merrill says. \u201cWe listen to lots of different kinds of music together: pop, rock, country, jazz, world music.\u201dThe thread running through these interactions, and the force that helps us form bonds, is feeling present with someone, a phenomenon that may happen less often than we realize. In fact, Americans spend just 37 minutes a day, on average, with loved ones, a recent study by the research company 72Point found.Demanding schedules are partly to blame, Kremer-Sadlik says. When we feel strapped for time, we\u2019re less likely to devote it to others. \u201cPeople basically feel hurried all the time,\u201d she says. While there\u2019s no substitute for face-to-face interaction, research shows that video calling can be a powerful tool for fostering presence. The feeling of presence is the sense of being physically there with someone \u2014 seeing facial expressions and gestures, hearing a tone of voice. Morgan Ames, a postdoctoral scholar at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Information, points out that mediums like video calling are actually changing the way psychologists think about connection. Previously, experts held that frequent in-person interactions were essential to building relationships, but now it\u2019s possible to connect with people even when they\u2019re far away, she says.\u201cDigital technologies can help us fulfill our desires for connecting with loved ones in many of the same ways face-to-face meetings can,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is still not the same as being there in person, but it is a close second.\u201dIn Nashville, Merrill was loving her violin program and her new friends. But she still felt the need to call her parents almost daily. \u201cI definitely missed my parents,\u201d she says. They also texted and video chatted, but still \u201cthere were times that I really wanted to come home,\u201d she adds.Noticing trends in communication, but recognizing the limitations of existing technologies, Facebook convened a team to create new ways for people to spend quality time together, even when they're physically apart. Years later, the result is Portal.Building Portal meant moving beyond existing platforms and creating something totally new.\u201cThere\u2019s only so much you can do behind a screen if that screen is a laptop or a tablet or a cell phone,\u201d says Jason Harrison, the engineering manager for the team.With Harrison and his colleagues working hard on their mission, elsewhere at Facebook AI researchers were making breakthroughs in camera motion detection. The Portal team leveraged these advances to make a big leap forward in how we communicate. \nAI powers some of the key features, like its Smart Camera and microphone, which help Portal make it feel like you\u2019re right there with friends. But that solved only part of the problem. AI alone couldn\u2019t recreate the smooth movements between an overall scene and focused attention that a camera operator masters only with years of practice. So the Portal team worked with cinematographers to refine the way Portal captures movement, by incorporating traditional camera techniques, such as panning left to right or zooming in and out.\u201cWe really took the approach of marrying the art and the science,\u201d Harrison says.The Merrills have started using Portal, and it has redefined how they keep in touch. Its microphone and camera naturally pick up the voice and movement of the person speaking, which makes it feel more like you're having a conversation in person, Jonathan Merrill says. Just like those days of living in a house together filled with music, Portal allows the Merrills to feel like they\u2019re in the same place. That means getting more of the everyday moments through which the family bonded in the first place.\u201cYou can see everyone is moving around and doing their thing,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s more relaxed and it\u2019s more real. Right away, I felt more connected.\u201d \nIllustration by Michele MarconiThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}

Sound familiar?Dr. Crossley has found that we\u2019re not the only creatures in the animal kingdom that make unusual dietary choices when hungry: Hungry pond snails will also swallow potentially harmful foods they\u2019d normally spit out. They do this under the control of brains that work in the same basic way as our own.With a single part of their brain, and if hungry enough, pond snails can overcome their senses and see otherwise unpalatable items as potential food. The finding builds on previous research showing that pond snails and other animals travel farther, explore more and invest copious energy in finding food to survive when hungry. It also might give you an excuse when you start feeling bad about weird shopping trips: To survive, sometimes you have to take risks.Pond snails, smaller than a thimble and found in freshwater habitats across the northern hemisphere, ingest food by opening their mouths, like this:And they egest, or spit out unpalatable objects, like this:But their brains are rather simple. While humans have billions of tiny neurons that guide us on a misbegotten grocery trip, the pond snail\u2019s brain is made up of only about 20,000 relatively giant cells.With so few neurons, changing just one can significantly alter a pond snail\u2019s behavior. And researchers can find the exact same neurons from snail to snail. By probing these neurons, Dr. Crossley was able to dissect a basic neuroscience of extreme hunger.In the study, researchers gave pond snails things they\u2019d typically reject, like a piece of plastic or a substance that tastes kind of like banana. Some of the snails were well-fed. Others had been food-deprived for days. The satiated snails rejected the nasty stimuli, but hungry snails swallowed it. That risky behavior increased the hungrier they got.In the snail\u2019s brain, the researchers also found activity patterns that differed depending on the animal\u2019s hunger state. The activity was located in a sort of control center that guided whether the snail was hungry enough to enter survival mode and start taking food risks. When the researchers blocked certain chemical signals in this part of the brain, they transformed well-fed pond snails into hungry risk takers.But hunger didn\u2019t affect the parts of the brain relaying sensory information about the stimuli. It didn\u2019t make gross things tasty. It only altered the perception of the stimuli, allowing the animals to risk eating potentially harmful things because, well, don\u2019t eat and surely die.\u201cOnce you\u2019re in that situation you will eat anything just to get the slightest bit of nourishment,\u201d Dr. Crossley said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about maximizing the animal\u2019s food intake.\u201dAnd so we return to shameful grocery trips. Though the human brain is more complex than a pond snail\u2019s, the organ between your ears may allow you to generalize perceptions of food in your environment, ignoring whether it\u2019s particularly tasty, healthy or well-paired just to get a bite. Even if it\u2019s smoked salmon and doughnuts together in your shopping cart.For Dr. Crossley, it\u2019s combinations like cauliflower and fish, which he finds unappealing.\u201cIf you need food, you will put yourself in harm\u2019s way to find it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Pentagon Doesn\u2019t Know Where Its Money Goes", "Date": "2018-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe military finally submits to an audit, and the results are poor.The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.That laxity \u2014 and the prospect of tax dollars flowing to boondoggles \u2014 would be concerning at any time. But it is especially worrisome when the federal budget deficit has skyrocketed to $779 billion \u2014 and the military is insisting it needs more money.Yet the Pentagon had nearly three decades to prepare for this accounting Judgment Day. While federal agencies were mandated by Congress in 1990 to begin performing annual financial audits, the Pentagon resisted for so long that it became the last one to comply with the law. Private companies, accountable to shareholders, couldn\u2019t get away with that.But audits are hard work; most defense officials aren\u2019t business experts; and to some, bookkeeping and other management operations just aren\u2019t a priority in wartime, which since Sept. 11, 2001, has been a permanent state.So what did the audit \u2014 which cost some $413 million and covered every military asset, from buildings, fences, storage tanks, planes, computers, spare parts, invoices, purchase orders and contracts \u2014 find?But the Pentagon was found to lack the systems and controls needed to \u201cprovide assurance over the existence, completeness and the valuation of inventory and related property recorded in the financial statements.\u201d In all, the audit identified 20 \u201cmaterial weaknesses\u201d that \u201ccould adversely affect DoD\u2019s financial operations.\u201dThey discovered ineffective payment systems, outdated financial management information technology systems, and an inability to substantiate that Pentagon real estate assets were properly cataloged and valued, among other complaints.Its purpose was to determine whether accounts could be reconciled, making the results less sexy, perhaps, but still important. The inability to accurately track how money is spent makes it impossible to know whether precious resources are going to the right places, undermining the Pentagon\u2019s ability to be successful in its far-flung missions around the globe.But it would be misleading to imply that such an immense bureaucracy is not also experiencing actual fraud, abuse or waste. Cost overruns and performance issues with such major weapons as the F-35 fighter jet and missile defense systems have been well documented in the past, raising doubts about the Pentagon\u2019s ability to responsibly manage taxpayer dollars. The nation needs to be more honest about the choices it is making (investing trillions more dollars in the nuclear arsenal is especially foolhardy) and realize that other investments \u2014 in diplomacy and development overseas, in job training and infrastructure projects at home \u2014 are also crucial to national security.Before rushing to push Pentagon spending even higher, however, Congress, which has shirked its vital oversight role, would be well advised to make sure that critical reforms are undertaken by a stubbornly change-resistant bureaucracy, so Americans can be certain their tax dollars are being spent effectively.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Denmark Plans to Isolate Unwanted Migrants on a Small Island", "Date": "2018-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCOPENHAGEN \u2014 Denmark plans to house the country\u2019s most unwelcome foreigners in a most unwelcoming place: a tiny, hard-to-reach island that now holds the laboratories, stables and crematory of a center for researching contagious animal diseases.As if to make the message clearer, one of the two ferries that serve the island is called the Virus.\u201cThey are unwanted in Denmark, and they will feel that,\u201d the immigration minister, Inger Stojberg, wrote on Facebook.On Friday, the center-right government and the right-wing Danish People\u2019s Party announced an agreement to house as many as 100 people on Lindholm Island \u2014 foreigners who have been convicted of crimes but who cannot be returned to their home countries. Many would be rejected asylum seekers.The 17-acre island, in an inlet of the Baltic Sea, lies about two miles from the nearest shore, and ferry service is infrequent. Foreigners will be required to report at the island center daily, and face imprisonment if they do not.The deal allocates about $115 million over four years for immigrant facilities on the island, which are scheduled to open in 2021.The finance minister, Kristian Jensen, who led the negotiations, said the island was not a prison, but added that anyone placed there would have to sleep there.Louise Holck, deputy executive director of The Danish Institute for Human Rights, said her organization would watch the situation \u201cvery closely\u201d for possible violations of Denmark\u2019s international obligations.The agreement was reached as part of the annual budget negotiations. Each year, the Danish People\u2019s Party demands restrictions on immigrants or refugees in return for its votes on a budget.In Denmark, as in much of Europe, the surge in migration from the Middle East and Africa in 2015 and 2016 prompted a populist, nativist backlash.The government has vowed to push immigration law to the limits of international conventions on human rights.Legal experts said it was too early to tell whether the Lindholm Island project would cross those boundaries, constituting illegal confinement. They said it resembled an Italian government project that was struck down in 1980 by the European Court of Human Rights.The Lindholm Island plan furthers the government\u2019s policy of motivating failed asylum seekers to leave the country by making their lives intolerable.Asylum seekers with criminal records are not allowed to work in Denmark. Rejected asylum seekers who cannot be deported are given accommodations \u2014 where they cannot prepare their own meals \u2014 food and an allowance of about $1.20 per day, which is withheld if they fail to cooperate with the authorities.A former immigration minister, Birthe Ronn Hornbech, called the island project \u201ca joke\u201d and a blunder comparable to a soccer player scoring a goal for the opposing team.Many foreigners who have been denied asylum cannot be deported to their home countries for fear of abuse or persecution, or simply because those countries refuse to take them back.Hundreds lingering in two deportation centers refuse to leave \u2014 a challenge for a government that has promised to get rid of those who have no legal right to remain in Denmark.Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said last month that the government\u2019s aim in receiving refugees would no longer be to integrate them, but to host them until they can return to their countries of origin.This summer, a ban on face coverings was introduced and quickly nicknamed \u201cthe burqa ban\u201d as it followed a debate on the Islamic garment seen by some as \u201cun-Danish.\u201d This month, Parliament is expected to pass legislation requiring immigrants who want to obtain citizenship to shake hands with officials as part of the naturalization ceremony \u2014 though some Muslims insist that they cannot shake hands with someone of the opposite sex.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump Is Doing Something \u2026 Good?", "Date": "2018-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byConservatives get serious about criminal justice reform.Opinion ColumnistThis year is ending with one truly surprising development, a real man-bites-dog story: Donald Trump is poised to sign bipartisan legislation that will make America a slightly more decent place. I\u2019m talking about the First Step Act, the criminal justice reform bill championed by Jared Kushner. The measure passed the Senate, 87 to 12, on Tuesday and the House on Thursday, and Trump is expected to sign it soon. According to Inimai Chettiar, of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University\u2019s law school, it will be the largest federal effort to reduce prison populations ever enacted.In some ways that\u2019s not saying much; experts expect the initial impact to be quite modest. Most incarcerated Americans are in state prisons, and the First Step Act affects only those in federal custody. \u201cIts direct overall impact is going to be pretty slight \u2014 I think even its proponents admit that,\u201d said John Pfaff, a law professor at Fordham and the author of \u201cLocked In: The True Causes of Mass Incarceration and How to Achieve Real Reform.\u201d But it is also a product of something more personal and less ideological. One way to turn a right-leaning person into a prison reformer is to expose him or her to the realities of the system. I\u2019m not quite cynical enough to believe that Trump wants to ease federal prison conditions because he and his children might be indicted \u2014 I assume he agreed to get behind the First Step Act because he was desperate for a win. But many of the people who\u2019ve tried to move the Republican Party toward criminal justice reform have seen prison, or at least criminal prosecution, firsthand.Then there\u2019s Colson, former special counsel to Richard Nixon, who founded Prison Fellowship, his Christian nonprofit, after serving seven months for obstruction of justice in connection with the Watergate scandal.And now, at last, we are close to getting it, at least for some. Perhaps there\u2019s a genuine silver lining to the deep corruption of the Republican Party. Modern conservatism can no longer ignore the interests of people accused of committing crimes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Postal Worker\u2019s Christmas ", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMy grandfather was part of a long tradition of postal workers who sacrificed Christmas Eve with their families to deliver holiday packages.Ms. Anderson is the director of the Global Economy Project at the Institute for Policy Studies.Every year on Christmas Eve, my extended family gathers for a meal that can be served at the last minute, whenever we\u2019re ready to eat. This tradition of cold salads, ham balls and cookies goes back to my mom\u2019s childhood.My mother\u2019s father was a North Dakota postal employee, so on Christmas Eve, she never knew when he would get home. He was determined to keep working, my mom would tell us, \u201cuntil every Christmas package that could be delivered would be delivered.\u201d He started working for the Postal Service in 1911, and family lore has it that he sometimes had to trudge through the snow on horseback to deliver the mail.As in my grandfather\u2019s day, today\u2019s postal workers have a mandate to provide universal service, delivering mail and packages to every American household at uniform rates, no matter where they live. That mandate has helped bind our vast nation.Specifically, the task force urges the Postal Service to change its pricing system to maximize profits on commercial package deliveries. This would be a major blow to families who buy products online and live along high-cost delivery routes.If the Trump task force has its way, customers in these areas would no longer be able to turn to the Postal Service for surcharge-free, lower-cost rates on most of these routes. Small businesses hoping to send mail or packages to these places would also suffer.Rural communities would also be more likely to lose their local post offices. The task force wants to get rid of a law prohibiting the closing of rural post offices solely because they\u2019re running a deficit. The Postal Service would also have the green light to reduce delivery days from six to five or even fewer days per week and expand the use of cluster mailboxes to replace door-to-door delivery.These and other proposed service cuts would shrink the number of good postal jobs \u2014 jobs that have long supported this country\u2019s middle class. My grandfather\u2019s 47 years of steady Postal Service employment protected the family from the Great Depression and paid for my mom\u2019s teacher training.A generation earlier, my great-grandfather supported his family delivering the mail from Westerly to Newport, R.I., lugging his loads first onto a train and then a ferry. He got the position after the Civil War, when the government created jobs for Union Army vets like him by expanding free delivery service.So what\u2019s behind this cutthroat cost-cutting?The Trump task force report claims that the Postal Service is a financial disaster. In fact, its operations are funded through postage, not tax dollars. Every day, the Postal Service delivers more than 400 million letters and packages at rates that are just a fraction of those in other rich countries \u2014 including the European nations that have privatized their postal operations.While refusing to end this onerous mandate, the task force opposes the post office\u2019s efforts to raise new revenue. The Postal Service has proposed expanding into check-cashing, bill payment and other financial services that could raise new revenue. These would be low-cost, reliable options for consumers without access to traditional banks, and they are services that post offices in other countries have provided for many years. But the task force opposes this move, arguing that the Postal Service can\u2019t compete effectively with banks for this business.This year, as my family gathers for our traditional Christmas Eve meal, we will remember our ancestors\u2019 hard work \u2014 and hope that our country\u2019s Postal Service will continue to thrive for many more generations.Advertisement"}

The Trump administration marked it by working with Russia and Gulf oil nations to sideline science and undermine the accord at climate talks underway in Katowice, Poland. Scientists tell us we must act now to avoid the ravages of climate change. The collision of facts and alternative facts has hurt America\u2019s efforts to confront this existential crisis. Ever since Mr. Trump announced that he would pull America out of the Paris accord, those of us in the fight have worked to demonstrate that the American people are still in. But the test is not whether the nation\u2019s cities and states can make up for Mr. Trump\u2019s rejection of reality. They can. The test is whether the nations of the world will pull out of the mutual suicide pact that we\u2019ve all passively joined through an inadequate response to this crisis.Talk to leaders who are gathered in Poland. They acknowledge that we aren\u2019t close to getting the job done in reducing the greenhouse gas emissions that warm the planet. People are dying today because of climate change, and many more will die and trillions of dollars of damage to property will occur unless America gets back in the fight.Future generations will measure us by whether we acted on facts, not just debated or denied them. The verdict will hang on whether we put in place policies that will drive the development and deployment of clean technologies, re-energize our economies, and tackle global climate change. Every day that goes by that we\u2019re paralyzed by the Luddite in the White House is a day in the future that our grandchildren will suffer. That\u2019s not hyperbole \u2014 that\u2019s science.Instead of tacitly accepting that inaction is preordained for the remaining two years of the Trump presidency, Congress should send Mr. Trump legislation addressing this crisis. It will force him to make choices the American people will long remember: Will he say no to deploying solar technology that would turn the American West into the Saudi Arabia of solar? No to turning the Midwest into the Middle East of wind power? No to a manufacturing revolution that could put West Virginia back to work in ways that his beloved coal never will?Make him choose \u2014 and let\u2019s find out.Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democrat from New York and Senate minority leader, is right to demand that infrastructure legislation actually hasten the transition to a clean energy economy and increase climate resilience. In soon-to-be Speaker Nancy Pelosi, he has a partner who wrangled the votes in the House in 2009 to pass a landmark cap-and-trade program to limit emissions of heat-trapping gases (though it never made it out of the Senate), and can join him in seeking investments in low carbon infrastructure. And if Mr. Trump says no, make climate change the galvanizing issue for 2020 for millennials who will vote as if their lives depend on it \u2014 because they do.If we fail, future generations will judge us all as failures, not just this president. They will have no time for excuses. Facts matter. Act on them.John Kerry was a Democratic senator from Massachusetts before becoming secretary of state in the Obama administration.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Day, a Life: When a Medic Was Killed in Gaza, Was It an Accident?", "Date": "2018-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKHUZAA, Gaza Strip \u2014 A young medic in a head scarf runs into danger, her only protection a white lab coat. Through a haze of tear gas and black smoke, she tries to reach a man sprawled on the ground along the Gaza border. Israeli soldiers, their weapons leveled, watch warily from the other side.Minutes later, a rifle shot rips through the din, and the Israeli-Palestinian drama has its newest tragic figure.To the Palestinians, she was an innocent martyr killed in cold blood, an example of Israel\u2019s disregard for Palestinian life. To the Israelis, she was part of a violent protest aimed at destroying their country, to which lethal force is a legitimate response as a last resort.In each version, Ms. Najjar was little more than a cardboard cutout.An investigation by The New York Times found that Ms. Najjar, and what happened on the evening of June 1, were far more complicated than either narrative allowed. Charismatic and committed, she defied the expectations of both sides. Her death was a poignant illustration of the cost of Israel\u2019s use of battlefield weapons to control the protests, a policy that has taken the lives of nearly 200 Palestinians.It also shows how each side is locked into a seemingly unending and insolvable cycle of violence. The Palestinians trying to tear down the fence are risking their lives to make a point, knowing that the protests amount to little more than a public relations stunt for Hamas, the militant movement that rules Gaza. And Israel, the far stronger party, continues to focus on containment rather than finding a solution.In life, Ms. Najjar was a natural leader whose uncommon bravery struck some peers as foolhardy. She was a capable young medic, but one who was largely self-taught and lied about her lack of education. She was a feminist, by Gaza standards, shattering traditional gender rules, but also a daughter who doted on her father, was particular about her appearance and was slowly assembling a trousseau. She inspired others with her outward jauntiness, while privately she was consumed with dread in her final days. The last day of her life begins well before sunrise. Ms. Najjar fries sambousek, small meat pies, to share with her father for the predawn meal before the Ramadan fast. She shows him a new suit she bought for her 5-year-old brother, Amir. They pray together before going back to sleep.When he awakens that afternoon, she is gone.Today, the medics are hoping for a low-key Friday. But around 5 p.m., the protest gains energy. A crowd surges toward the fence and the Israelis unleash a suffocating barrage of tear gas. There has been no gunfire yet. It is still possible to kid around. \u201cLet\u2019s go get martyred together,\u201d Ms. Najjar teases Mahmoud Abdelaty, a fellow medic. \u201cGo on and get hit so I can take care of you.\u201d\u201cAre you scared of death?\u201d she asks Mahmoud Qedayeh, another member of their team of volunteers. \u201cYou only die once.\u201dFor the Israel Defense Forces, she was a nightmare of a victim: a photogenic symbol of nationhood, youth and compassion.On March 30, the protests\u2019 first day, Ms. Najjar became the youngest of three volunteers tending to the wounded, and the only woman.To the young men in skinny jeans and T-shirts hurling rocks at Israeli soldiers, she seemed to appear beside them almost as fast as they fell, bandaging burns, splinting fractures, stanching gunshot wounds, offering encouragement, sometimes hearing last words.Journalists noticed. Practically overnight, she became a fixture of news reports, with a growing social-media following. \u201cEverybody knew her,\u201d said another medic, Lamiaa Abu Moustafa.Over the next nine weeks, shrapnel pelted Ms. Najjar\u2019s legs, a flaming tire burned her, a tear-gas grenade fractured her arm. She cut off her cast the same day and went back to the protest.Others cowered when Israeli soldiers fired at them. Not Ms. Najjar. \u201cThe gunshots we hear will not harm us,\u201d she told a colleague. The implication: You won\u2019t hear the one that kills you.She inspired other women to become medics, despite social conventions in this deeply conservative Muslim territory that reserve dangerous work for men. \u201cI wanted to become like Rouzan, brave and strong and helping everybody,\u201d said Najwa Abu Abdo, a 17-year-old neighbor, explaining her decision to volunteer.Unmarried and uninterested in marriage for the time being, Ms. Najjar remained very much the star of her own drama. She sent affectionate texts to peers who each believed they were her closest friend. She lied about her credentials, pretending to be a college student. She obsessed over backbiting and jealousy within her social circle.Yet she had more on her mind.For Ms. Najjar, the protests were not just an opportunity to vent at the barbed wire that made Gaza feel like an open-air cage. They were an opportunity to gain medical experience, to make a name for herself and perhaps, by making an impression, to further her goal of making nursing school affordable.By late May, she seemed well on her way.Tear gas is everywhere. The Israelis have not yet fired live ammunition, but the acrid fumes are overwhelming. \u201cLike a dense fog,\u201d says Fares al-Qedra, another medic.It\u2019s a giant dance: Protesters run toward the fence, soldiers launch gas grenades, the protesters back off. Repeat.Ms. Najjar, noticeable in her white coat and red lipstick, scurries around spraying saline solution in people\u2019s eyes to wash away the gas. So many need her help that she cannot keep up.A 54-year-old man is hit in the forehead by a gas grenade. Ms. Najjar rushes to him, bandages the gash, then runs alongside as he is carried to an ambulance.Gaza had not always been locked up behind barbed wire, sensors and bunkers.Before 2005, Gaza residents could work in Israel. But rocket attacks and bombings after the Second Intifada erupted in 2000 prompted Israel to cordon off the strip and eventually abandon its settlements there. When Hamas seized power from the Palestinian Authority after a weeklong civil war in 2007, Israel imposed a punishing blockade, severely restricting travel and trade.By 2017, after three wars with Israel, Gaza\u2019s economy was a shambles and the authority\u2019s president, Mahmoud Abbas, was determined to finish off Hamas. He laid off thousands of Gaza workers and cut electricity to a few hours at a time.With imams urging people to attend and Hamas chartering buses, crowds grew quickly. The protests became a kind of nationalist circus. Mothers brought children, vendors hawked falafel and families slept in tents. Nearer the fence, young men burned tires, crept up with wire cutters or improvised firebombs \u2014 and presented Israeli snipers with easy targets.Bloodshed served Hamas\u2019s public-relations purposes, winning international attention and sympathy. The Israelis obliged.Later, Israeli officials explained that military policy permitted deadly force only as a last resort, against an imminent threat of violence, and after exhausting lesser options like verbal warnings, tear gas and warning shots. Spokesmen insisted that commanders had to approve each shot and, in one subsequently deleted Twitter post, that \u201cWe know where every bullet landed.\u201dBut the first day of protests alone left more than 20 dead and hundreds wounded. Since then, one Israeli soldier has been killed by sniper fire. The Palestinian death toll has reached 185.The victims include two women and 32 children. Journalists. A double-amputee in a wheelchair. A young man who had a tire in his arms and was running away from the fence when he was shot in the back.And medics. A new friction point has opened up: A few dozen protesters have drifted about 200 yards north along the fence, past the point where a bunker on the Israeli side had loosely marked the protest\u2019s northern boundary.Some of the protesters begin tearing at the barbed-wire coils about 40 yards in front of the fence. Israeli soldiers quickly drive up and take defensive positions on the other side. They\u2019ve shot people for less. For now, they fire only a warning shot and more tear gas.Except for a visit to Egypt in 1997, at three days old, Ms. Najjar spent her life confined to the cramped Gaza Strip, mainly in Khuzaa, a tiny border village where nearly everyone is a Najjar \u2014 descended from refugees who fled in 1948 from Salamah, near Jaffa.Rouzan was precocious, entering kindergarten at 2, picking up English words and reciting poetry. And happy: Her mother, Sabreen, given to melancholy, recorded her laughing. \u201cShe would move worlds when she saw me sad,\u201d she said.But Rouzan was a daddy\u2019s girl. Her father, a lanky entrepreneur named Ashraf al-Najjar, spoiled her, when that was still possible. He worked in Israel for months at a stretch, buying appliances or furniture to sell in Gaza at four times what he paid. There was meat for dinner.\u201cTo be honest, I long for those days,\u201d he said.As a little girl, Rouzan reached for toy stethoscopes. Her father expected to send her overseas to study medicine someday.But then came the rockets, the blockade, the wars. No longer able to work in Israel, Mr. Najjar opened a motorcycle-repair shop. It was bulldozed by the Israeli army during the 2014 invasion. He went bankrupt and took handouts from siblings. Rouzan skipped school field trips to scrimp.Khuzaa was largely reduced to rubble in the war. Two of Rouzan\u2019s best friends were killed, one of them along with more than 20 of her relatives. She saw a cousin\u2019s body torn apart. The Najjars\u2019 home was damaged, the recordings of her laughter lost. When they returned from shelter, the dead and dying lay in the streets.Rouzan said she wanted to learn how to help.Opposite the Israeli bunker, Ms. Najjar rushes toward the fence to help a teenager, as Israeli soldiers look on. Someone behind her throws a rock at them, using her as cover. Two protesters are trapped near the barbed wire, lying on the ground.She and several other medics \u2014 among them her friends Rasha Qudeih and Rami Abo Jazar \u2014 make their way forward again to try to help. They raise their hands to show the Israelis they mean no harm.Two shots ring out overhead. Ms. Najjar waves at the soldiers, who are only about 50 yards away, not to shoot. But as she edges closer, another shot, much closer, kicks up the sand.A soldier emerges from behind a jeep, leveling his rifle. \u201cThe sniper is aiming at us!\u201d Ms. Qudeih yells.The medics turn and run, as a fresh barrage of tear gas descends on them. Ms. Najjar is the slowest to retreat.Nearly everyone who saw Ms. Najjar at the protests was struck by her readiness to place herself in harm\u2019s way. Again and again, there she was in video clips: the first to those in trouble, the last to safety.\u201cShe was reckless,\u201d said Eslam Okal, a trauma nurse from Rafah who volunteered at the Khuzaa protests after hearing about Ms. Najjar. \u201cI told her, \u2018Your first priority is safety.\u2019 We had many arguments over this. But her bravery won out.\u201dIn high school, she was the alpha of a clique of mildly rebellious teenagers who bridled at the dress code of their all-girls school: white scarf and hijab, dark trousers. Ms. Najjar wore bright colors and accepted the scoldings that followed.Other girls were quiet in class. But Ms. Najjar interrupted the teachers with questions, stood her ground when chastised and talked back constantly, though usually through a smile.How she became so fearless and outspoken is impossible to pin down, but several people who were close to her cited a traumatic experience when she was 15.During 10th-grade finals, Rouzan returned home to a tense situation in her family\u2019s four-story building. Her aunt, Nawal Qedayeh, whom Rouzan adored and who was seven months pregnant, was being treated like a pariah by Rouzan\u2019s paternal aunts and grandmother, who refused to let her use the communal kitchen. When Ms. Qedayeh was caught scrubbing pots there, a fight broke out, and Rouzan watched as her grandmother pushed Ms. Qedayeh down the stairs. Both she and the fetus she was carrying were killed.Rouzan, the only eyewitness, had a choice: She could stay silent, forgoing justice for her aunt\u2019s killing and following the social expectation for a young woman to leave weighty legal matters to the men. Or she could tell the truth and potentially send her grandmother to prison.Rouzan testified. Her grandmother was convicted of accidental manslaughter and spent more than a year in prison.Nisreen Abu Ishaq, Rouzan\u2019s high school religion teacher, said the ordeal made her \u201cstronger and more daring.\u201d After that, said Suzan Mahdi al-Reqeb, a school administrator, \u201cnothing stood in her way.\u201dGaza CityMediterraneanSeaGAZAWESTBANKKhuzaaJerusalemAreaof detailISRAELISRAELEGYPTBy The New York TimesMoney did. Knowing she couldn\u2019t afford college dejected her. She had also failed part of the entrance exams. Yet she scarcely gave up.\u201cOn the contrary,\u201d her mother said. \u201cShe stomped her feet and said, \u2018I\u2019m not going to waste years waiting for things to get better \u2014 I\u2019ll find another way.\u2019\u201dShe began taking basic first aid courses and discovered that she could simply \u201cforget\u201d to pay the fees: \u201cDon\u2019t be an idiot,\u201d she told a friend who almost paid $5 in tuition.She hung around emergency rooms, running errands, observing surgery, pretending to belong until the staff realized she didn\u2019t. When Seif Abdel Ghafour rushed his dying uncle to Nasser Hospital, he was bewildered by the place until Ms. Najjar led them where they needed to go. \u201cShe didn\u2019t know us,\u201d he said. \u201cBut she treated us like we were her brothers.\u201dThe protests would let her test her skills. When the Health Ministry made about 200 volunteer medics take a written exam, Ms. Najjar scored 91, the highest in her group. She was given an identification card, lab coat and white-and-pink paramedic\u2019s vest.She wore them like armor.To the north, past the bunker, at least two protesters throw homemade firebombs at the Israelis. No damage is done, but it\u2019s a significant escalation from slinging rocks. Ms. Najjar is recovering from the tear gas she inhaled. Nearby, protesters start cutting away a new section of barbed wire.Suddenly, there\u2019s a rifle shot. A young man in the group to the north is hit in the leg.That is where Israeli forces are instructed to aim, a tactic, Israeli officials say, intended to minimize fatalities. But they fire a heavy battlefield round, one meant for targets hundreds of yards away. At 100 yards, ballistics experts say, a missed shot could bounce like a skimming stone. \u201cIf I missed, and it will hit a rock, I don\u2019t know where the bullet will go,\u201d a senior Israeli commander says.Nearly every protester in Khuzaa has at least one story of Ms. Najjar coming to his rescue. Some have many.When Mahmoud Abu Shab, 26, a kafiyeh-wearing rock thrower, was shot through the hand in March, she stanched the bleeding. One day in April, when he failed to get out of the way of a stretch of barbed wire being dragged from the fence, she bandaged his wounds.He didn\u2019t know that she had bought the medical supplies herself. She was collecting a shekel a day from a group of supportive young women. She even sold off a gold ring to buy supplies.\u201cShe wanted to always be at the fence, to be a daughter of men,\u201d said Nada al-Laham, another volunteer, using an expression for a woman driven by a strong sense of national identity.Her father said he urged her to take a day off: \u201cShe\u2019d say, \u2018No, Baba, there are people who need me.\u2019\u201dHer mother visited the protests, but said their chats ended abruptly: \u201cSuddenly there would be a wounded protester, and she\u2019d just stop talking and say, \u2018I have to go, there\u2019s someone I need to save.\u2019\u201dMs. Najjar saw her role as part of the Palestinian struggle as much as those burning tires or wielding wire cutters. She became a practiced spokeswoman, never refusing an interview request, not always waiting to be asked.Her Facebook posts could be florid. She once wrote that her bloodstained uniform carried the \u201csweetest perfume.\u201dThe protests became Gaza\u2019s biggest social event. Matches were made, engagements announced almost every day. Young men and their parents paraded through the Najjars\u2019 home seeking betrothal to the now-famous Rouzan. \u201cTen or 12 just during Ramadan,\u201d her father said.She turned them all down, he said: \u201cShe had her own goals in mind.\u201dAfter the protests ended, she planned to retake and ace the college-admission tests. Somehow, she would find her way to nursing school.Ms. Abu Moustafa is concerned. The Israelis often shoot at the rope pullers, she says. She urges Ms. Najjar to leave.The rope pullers finally make off with a small coil of barbed wire. Much of the crowd follows. The clamor around the two women subsides.As the protests took on a sense of permanence, Ms. Najjar\u2019s bravado became alloyed with increasingly frequent allusions to her possible demise.\u201cWhen my life finishes, make me a sweet memory for those who know me,\u201d she wrote on Facebook on May 5.\u201cThey said to me, \u2018Bend a little, as the bullet is on its way to you,\u2019\u201d she wrote later. \u201cI said to them, \u2018The bullet chose me because I do not know how to bend, so why should I change my way?\u2019\u201dShe texted one friend an apology in case one of them was martyred.\u201cSay a nice prayer for my memory,\u201d she told another on May 24.Her parents said such morbid talk was uncharacteristic. While many in Gaza speak of death as preferable to the here-and-now, Ms. Najjar \u201cclung to life,\u201d her mother said. \u201cShe never wanted to be a martyr. She loved life.\u201dOne of her happiest days ever, friends said, was Tuesday, May 29. She cashed a $100 check \u2014 a one-time gift to each member of her team of medics, the Palestine Medical Rescue Service, from its overseers in the West Bank \u2014 and joined colleagues on a small boat that left the Gaza City marina, hoping to catch up to a flotilla that was challenging the blockade.They were on the water nearly three hours under the brilliant Mediterranean sun before being turned back by an Israeli gunboat.\u201cI said I hoped we wouldn\u2019t get hit,\u201d said Mr. Abdel Ghafour, the man she had helped at the hospital and who had since befriended her. \u201cShe said, \u2018So be it! We die as friends.\u2019\u201dSunset is coming and with it, the end of the fast. Things seem to be quieting down at the fence.An Israeli soldier looking across at where Ms. Najjar stands now might see a man waving a Palestinian flag aloft, a few straggling protesters ambling around, and a cluster of medics helping a protester on the ground recover from tear gas. No one in the area is doing anything menacing. The tear gas is doing what it is meant to: making the use of lethal force unnecessary.Suddenly, there is another gunshot.Mohammed Shafee, a medic, sees things \u201cfly into my body.\u201d He\u2019s sprayed in the chest by small bullet fragments.Mr. Abo Jazar perceives an explosion on the ground, then screams in pain. He\u2019s grazed in the thigh. Behind them, Ms. Najjar reaches for her back, then crumples.  As Ms. Abu Moustafa looks on in shock, Ms. Najjar is picked up by protesters she had treated just a few minutes ago. As they carry her off, blood pours from her chest.Three medics down, all from one bullet. It seemed improbable.It was fired from a sand berm used by Israeli snipers at least 120 yards from where the medics fell.The Israeli military\u2019s rules of engagement are classified. But a spokesman, Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, said that snipers may shoot only at people posing a violent threat, like \u201ccutting the fence, throwing grenades.\u201dTo deliberately shoot a medic, or any civilian, is a war crime. Israel quickly conceded that Ms. Najjar\u2019s killing was unintended.\u201cShe was not the target,\u201d Colonel Conricus said. \u201cNone of the medical personnel are ever a target.\u201dBut no Israeli soldiers reported accidental shootings. After-action reports said snipers aimed at four men that day and hit them all, the army said.The Times found the first, third and fourth of those protesters, each shot in the leg exactly when and how the army said they were. But The Times could not corroborate the army\u2019s description of the second person it said was shot, which matched the time Ms. Najjar was killed.The army said it was a man in a yellow shirt who was throwing stones and pulling at the fence. But the only man in a yellow shirt anywhere near the line of fire was not doing that or much of anything else, The Times found. He stood about 120 yards from the fence and posed no threat.Even if the man was a legitimate target, there remains the question of the medics standing behind him.Prof. Ryan Goodman, a New York University expert on the laws of war, who was a special counsel to the Pentagon on war crimes and targeting rules, said the key to whether a war crime was committed was whether the sniper was aware of a high risk that civilians would be harmed.\u201cThe laws of war would not want any military personnel to deliberately fire in the direction of the medics,\u201d Mr. Goodman said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s close to the line. I\u2019m saying it crosses the line.\u201dA senior Israeli commander told The Times in August that 60 to 70 other Gaza protesters had been killed unintentionally, around half the total killed at that point.Yet the Israeli army\u2019s rules of engagement remain unchanged, the military says.That alone may constitute a separate violation of international humanitarian law, experts say: After enough civilians have died, commanders have a duty to make changes to ensure that they aren\u2019t needlessly targeted.\u201cYou lose the right to say, \u2018Oops,\u2019\u201d said Noam Lubell, a professor of the law of armed conflict at the University of Essex.Colonel Conricus said that not all those killed unintentionally had been shot unintentionally. Sometimes soldiers had aimed at the legs of people they considered to be legitimate targets, he said, but killed them instead of wounding them.Israel considers members of Hamas fair game whether they are armed or not, an interpretation of international law that is not universally accepted.Colonel Conricus also said the rules of engagement were merely an upper limit on the use of force, and that the army was doing other things, such as training troops when they are first assigned to the fence, to curb civilian casualties.Israeli military lawyers conceded there had been some misconduct but said that no soldiers were suspected of intentionally killing anyone they knew they shouldn\u2019t have.On Oct. 29, nearly five months after she was killed, Israel\u2019s military advocate general began a criminal investigation of Ms. Najjar\u2019s death.But the senior commander told The Times in August that no recordings of the shooting from the Israeli side existed. He had no idea exactly when Ms. Najjar had been shot. He learned that from The Times.Israel seems content to say that protecting its border is a messy business. \u201cUnfortunately, yes,\u201d said Colonel Conricus, \u201cin a situation like that, accidents happen, and unintended results happen.\u201dAn ambulance races Ms. Najjar to a triage tent, where she is deposited in the \u201cred zone\u201d for trauma cases.She had wanted so badly to belong here that she used to visit the tent often, even when she was not escorting patients. Now, the professionals crowd around frantically trying to save her. The doctor who intubates her is the same one who administered the Health Ministry exam she aced back in April.\u201cWhy kill her?\u201d cries her shattered father. \u201cShe was an angel of mercy.\u201dReporting was contributed by Yousur Al-Hlou, Malachy Browne, Iyad Abuheweila and Neil Collier from Khuzaa; Ibrahim El-Mughrabi from Gaza City, and John Woo from New York.Advertisement"}

Now, they have found themselves in the center of a perilous geopolitical battle, Canadian pawns in a larger contest between two of the world\u2019s biggest superpowers, China and the United States.On Friday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada said their detainment was unacceptable, and warned that Canada was getting ensnared in a dust-up between the United States and China.She is awaiting an extradition hearing.Senior Canadian officials said Canada\u2019s ambassador to China, John McCallum, had been granted access to Mr. Kovrig on Friday.They said the aim of the \u201cconsular visit\u201d was to assess the well-being of a Canadian citizen, clarify the nature of the detention and provide a communication link with his family. They declined to comment on Mr. Kovrig\u2019s condition or whereabouts.Canada\u2019s foreign ministry said it was pressing Chinese authorities for access to Mr. Spavor.On Friday, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland and Defense Minister Harjit Sajjan held talks in Washington with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary James Mattis, including a discussion on securing the release of the two Canadians.Michael Kovrig, a native of Toronto who was living in Hong Kong at the time of his detainment, was working as a senior adviser for the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based research organization.A former Canadian diplomat, he had taken a leave from the ministry two years ago, and no longer enjoyed diplomatic immunity.Friends called him an affable \u201cnerd,\u201d and said he loved swing and ballroom dancing. A former journalist, he spoke Mandarin and Hungarian, noting on his LinkedIn page that he had \u201cworked in 20 countries and traveled through more than 50.\u201dBut his line of work also made him vulnerable, experts on China said.Guy Saint-Jacques, a former Canadian ambassador to China who was Mr. Kovrig\u2019s boss when he was first secretary at the embassy in Beijing, said Mr. Kovrig\u2019s job had involved gathering information on sensitive subjects, like Taiwan and minority groups, subjects that would have attracted the scrutiny of the Chinese authorities.\u201cThe Chinese would\u2019ve been waiting for the right moment to spring,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Meng case provided them the perfect opportunity.\u201dHe said Mr. Kovrig was likely being subjected to psychological pressure, detained in a room with the lights left on 24 hours a day. He said China\u2019s accusation that the crisis group was operating illegally in China could be a precursor to filing espionage charges.Joanna Chiu, deputy bureau chief in Vancouver for The Toronto Star and a friend of Mr. Kovrig, said that, as a foreigner and former high-level diplomat, he would have been aware that he was being monitored, but that he was not the paranoid type.\u201cWorking in China you just assume everything can be accessed by the Chinese government,\u201d she said, noting that Mr. Kovrig was about six feet tall, and stood out in China.He stressed that Mr. Kovrig had nothing whatsoever to do with the Huawei case. He said Mr. Kovrig frequently traveled to Beijing and was a regular guest on Chinese media.\u201cWe are very worried for his well-being and his security,\u201d he said.Michael Spavor, the other detained Canadian, is a daring adventurer known for his high-level contacts in North Korea.He had also lived in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, teaching at a school run by a Canadian nongovernmental organization.Yet in his Reuters interview he characterized his involvement in the country as outside the parameters of politics.\u201cFor me, encouraging these sports engagement events, these nonpolitical friendship interactions, promoting these kind of events can show people that Americans and Koreans can get along very well,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "An Introvert\u2019s Guide to Friendship", "Date": "2018-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat my student taught me about one of life\u2019s most important relationships.Ms. Ruhl is a playwright.It can be a hurdle for introverts that to make friends you have to talk to people, sometimes even in a dreaded group. And yet introverts can make the best kind of friends \u2014 often the most loyal, often the best listeners. Some of my most profound friendships have been made in enclosed spaces, like rehearsal rooms or classrooms, where one must stay for a prescribed amount of time before bolting. I lost one such dear friend, a brilliant poet named Max Ritvo, two years ago, when he was 25. We wrote about 500 letters back and forth before he died, and at some point we decided to make a book of them. Max had a rare genius for friendship, and for the writing of poetry. Our friendship, which I think would have been lifelong, had to be compressed into the four years we knew each other.I first met him when he walked into my undergraduate playwriting class at Yale. In his application to get into the class he wrote, \u201cAll I want to do is write.\u201d He seemed to have an ancient light bulb hovering over his head. He\u2019d read everything, and he was also very funny. He loved to make a joke; looking like a young Mike Nichols, he would gaze up from under his thick spectacles to see whether his joke had found its target.At the end of the semester, Max told the class that he\u2019d had a recurrence of Ewing\u2019s sarcoma, a rare pediatric cancer he\u2019d battled in high school. My father died of cancer when I was 20, and I knew from experience that most of Max\u2019s peers did not have mortality on the brain. I told Max that he could talk to me about his fears if he wanted to. He wanted to. Our friendship was accelerated by the urgency of his questions.Unlike me, Max was an extroverted writer, which is something of an anomaly. When he read his poems aloud, he shouted them to a crowded room, circling and often wearing a pink kimono. He collected friends readily, intensely and demonstratively. Max knew he didn\u2019t have time for the slow reveal. He once recited a poem to me in his booming voice standing up in a Brooklyn cafe. When I indicated a measure of embarrassment, Max was horrified and apologetic, waving his arms. No, no, I assured him. I was embarrassed in the way that Elizabeth Bishop was when she read a poem that moved her \u2014 she didn\u2019t want to look at it directly.Max and I were often not in the same city. He was in Los Angeles to see his family and for treatment or in Washington undergoing a clinical trial. To distract him from chemotherapy, we swapped poems, plays, rants, jokes, spiritual questions and dreams of the afterlife. We wrote on subjects as far afield as metaphysics, the essence of soup, literary revenge, meditation, the Amtrak quiet car, childhood battle chants and our mutual love of Mel Brooks.Like the nature of conversation itself, friendship is not categorizable; friendship is partly defined by what you can talk about. With some friends you can talk about work; others, family, fishing, books, politics; some, nothing much at all, but you enjoy being together in silence, making a pie, or walking. Max\u2019s genius for friendship was partly a genius for conversation \u2014 he could discourse as easily on the soul as he could on Cyndi Lauper. We tried to arrange our book of letters by subject matter, but the book kept resisting our efforts. We realized that the disparate subjects defied categorization. And after he was gone, I realized that to organize the book chronologically was to imply an ending.The ending came in August 2016, when Max was 25. A lot of people pointed out that it was the same age at which Keats died. I don\u2019t even know whether Max liked Keats, though now I would love to ask him. For a long time after he died, I could not stand the sight of poetry. Reading poetry just made me want to talk to Max again, and that made me sad.How to mourn for a student, a friend, a teacher? Because Max was first my student, then my friend and finally my teacher. In our culture it sometimes feels as though social ties can be summed up by the bonds of nuclear family and romantic love. Perhaps we\u2019re obsessed as a species with romantic love because it helps propagate our species. But isn\u2019t friendship just as necessary to emotional survival? When we find the right friend at the right time in our life, or the right teacher, or the right student, our lives are changed forever. Max was the voice that answered back. And he still is.Sarah Ruhl is a playwright who teaches at the Yale School of Drama and a co-author, with Max Ritvo, of \u201cLetters From Max: A Book of Friendship.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Director Quits \u2018All My Sons\u2019 Amid Dispute Over Cast\u2019s Racial Makeup", "Date": "2018-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe director Gregory Mosher found an actor he thought was perfect to play George Deever, one of the main characters in \u201cAll My Sons,\u201d the Arthur Miller classic that is coming back to Broadway in the spring.Though the principal cast members in the original late-1940s production were white, this actor was black. Mr. Mosher went about trying to find a black actress to play his sister, Ann Deever.\u201cAll My Sons\u201d tells the story of the Kellers and the Deevers, two families in 1947 Ohio whose relationships are upended by a scandal involving military parts for World War II, and a soldier gone missing.In other instances, Ms. Miller has supported casting people of color in roles traditionally filled by white actors. A 2019 production of \u201cDeath of a Salesman\u201d in London, for example, will feature a black Loman family. But here, she said, she was not convinced.There is a romantic connection between the two families, and if the Deevers were black, it could introduce the concept of an interracial relationship in a time and place where that was highly unusual.\u201cMy concern was that to cast the Deevers as black puts a burden on the play to justify the relationship in the historical context,\u201d Ms. Miller said. Since the script does not address race, she said, \u201cI was worried that it would whitewash the racism that really was in existence in that period by creating this pretend-Valhalla-special family where no one would mention this.\u201dMr. Mosher, a decorated director and producer and the chairman of the theater department at Hunter College, said that he believed Ms. Miller was making a sincere effort to protect the script, and that she offered to allow Mr. Mosher\u2019s choice for George Deever if Ann were played by an actress of a different race than her brother. It was unclear why that option was more acceptable, but in any case, Mr. Mosher said, the disagreement put him in an impossible bind, so he left.\u201cI was auditioning black actresses, which means the black acting community in New York knew I was doing it,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to say to these actors. I\u2019ve decided to hire a white girl? I couldn\u2019t find somebody? What am I supposed to say?\u201d\u201cIt was a kind of breaking faith with a community that I didn\u2019t want to break faith with,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019m afraid it comes rather quickly to \u2018you just have the wrong skin color for this part.\u2019 \u201dPlaywrights have tremendous power in the theater, even in death. An estate can threaten to pull the rights to a show if it disagrees with certain choices, like casting, but Harvey Young, dean of the Boston University College of Fine Arts, said such disputes are rare and tend to be restricted to certain estates. But they happen.There are different approaches to diverse casting. In so-called colorblind casting, the production hires the best actor for the part, regardless of their race and the original race of the character. Color-conscious casting means the roles are open to different races, but the production considers how the audience will react to the choices.Dr. Young said that an example of the latter he likes to offer his students is \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption.\u201d In the original novella, written by Stephen King, the character named Red is Irish. But in the movie, that character is played by Morgan Freeman \u2014 who even says, when asked how he got his name, \u201cmaybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m Irish.\u201dDr. Young said that color-conscious casting allows the work to tackle contemporary issues and creates the opportunity to breathe in new life.\u201cThe very best theater allows you to engage with your present social and political moment,\u201d Dr. Young said.Ms. Miller said she was not advocating colorblind casting, but rather \u201cbeing more conscious, not less.\u201d She said that she was in favor of casting more actors of color in the production and that she did not necessarily discount that the play could be performed with a black Deever family in the future.\u201cI would love to see a reading of that to see what it would entail,\u201d she said. \u201cBut not in the kind of extreme pressure of \u2018we\u2019re about to start rehearsal.\u2019 It needs some time and thought.\u201dMr. Mosher was dismayed by how it all turned out, though he did not appear embittered.\u201cMan, I wanted to direct this play,\u201d he wrote on Facebook Tuesday night. \u201cIt\u2019s so good, and I\u2019ve thought about it so intensely in the past half year.\u201d\u201cBut \u2018All My Sons\u2019 is not a documentary about life in rural Ohio in 1947, the year it opened. It\u2019s a play,\u201d he continued. \u201cI think I made the right choice. We\u2019ll see what happens next. Maybe it will all be fine. I sincerely hope so.\u201dMichael Paulson contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Birth Tourism\u2019 Is Legal in Canada. A Lawmaker Calls It Unscrupulous.", "Date": "2018-12-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRICHMOND, British Columbia \u2014 Melody Bai arrived in Vancouver from China in the late stages of pregnancy with one goal: to give birth to a Canadian baby.Awaiting her was an elaborate ecosystem catering to pregnant women from China, including a spacious \u201cbaby house\u201d where she spent four months, attended to by a Mandarin-speaking housekeeper.Caregivers offered free breast massages to promote lactation, outings to the mall, lectures on childbirth with other Chinese mothers-to-be and excursions for high tea.\u201cIt\u2019s an investment in my child\u2019s education,\u201d Ms. Bai, a 28-year-old flight attendant, said by phone from Shanghai, months after returning to China with her newborn and passport in hand. \u201cWe chose Canada because of its better natural and social environment.\u201dMs. Bai is part of a growing phenomenon in Canada known as birth tourism, which is not only generating political opposition, but mobilizing self-appointed vigilantes determined to stop it.It is perfectly legal.The practice underlines how Canada, and British Columbia in particular, has become a favored haven for well-heeled Chinese seeking a refuge for wealth and kin away from authoritarian China.Mr. Griffith argues that Canada intended birthright citizenship for those who wanted to live in and contribute to the country. \u201cSince those engaging in birth tourism have no or barely any real link to Canada,\u201d he said, \u201cthe practice is challenging a very Canadian value of fair play.\u201dWith its sprawling Chinese food markets, Chinese-language newspapers and large number of caregivers speaking Mandarin, Richmond has become ground zero for birth tourists from China.About two dozen baby houses are in operation. Visits to about 15 addresses showed that some operate openly while others work under licenses as tour agencies or present themselves as holiday rentals. Some are in homes. Others are in apartments. Many are booked through agents and brokers in China.In a visit to one, the Baoma Inn, a modern house across from a park, a woman in the late stages of pregnancy could be seen in a second-floor window. A young man who answered the door confirmed that the inn was a baby house before another angrily slammed the door.But during a telephone call in Mandarin inquiring about the Inn\u2019s services, a man said it offered a one-stop package including \u201cguaranteed appointments\u201d with \u201cthe No. 1 obstetrician in British Columbia,\u201d who spoke Mandarin and had \u201ca zero accident rate.\u201dCustomers usually stay for three months, he said, including one month after the birth, to allow time to apply for a passport for the newborn and to recuperate, as is the Chinese custom.He added that his agency had seven sales offices in China. The bill for a three-month stay at a two-bedroom apartment, not including meals and prenatal care, is about 25,000 Canadian dollars ($18,331).\u201cThe women all go back to China,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t enjoy any social benefits from the Canadian government and don\u2019t need it.\u201dBob Huang, who with his wife runs Anxin Labour Service, a birthing center in the nearby city of Burnaby, said he was frequently contacted by agents in China who wanted a 50 percent commission on every successful referral. He said he preferred to post his own ads on local Chinese classifieds websites.Some Richmond residents say birth tourism is undermining the community\u2019s social fabric.On a recent morning, she received an anonymous tip on Facebook that as many as 20 pregnant \u201cbirth tourists\u201d from China were being housed in a nearby modernist high rise.Ms. Starchuk complains that birth tourists bump local mothers from maternity wards, a concern echoed by some local nurses, and get access to public services without paying taxes.The issue has become conflated with resentment in the Vancouver area against soaring housing prices, which some residents blame on an influx of wealthy Chinese.But Ms. Bai, who had her baby in Vancouver in February, said that given the hefty price she had paid to give birth here \u2014 60,000 Canadian dollars, including housing and hospitalization \u2014 she was subsidizing the Canadian health care system and contributing to the local economy.\u201cMy child won\u2019t be enjoying any Canadian health benefits, as we are living in China,\u201d she said.Since her son is Canadian, however, she and her husband, a pilot, could save about 150,000 Canadian dollars on tuition fees at an international school in Shanghai.After gaining fluency in English and Western culture, her son could also later attend a Canadian university at the discounted local rate. Eventually, the entire family could emigrate to Canada.Some first- and second-generation immigrants oppose birth tourists for jumping the queue.\u201cI don\u2019t think it is fair to come here, give birth and leave,\u201d said Wendy Liu, a Richmond resident of 11 years, adding that she had been repeatedly harassed after Ms. Starchuk mistakenly put her house on a list of birth tourism centers.A nonresident, Yan Xia, gave birth there, racked up a bill of 312,595 Canadian dollars in maternity and neonatal care for her newborn because of complications, and then absconded without paying the bill, according to a civil claim the hospital filed at British Columbia\u2019s Supreme Court in April, six years after Ms. Xia gave birth.Including six years\u2019 worth of interest, Ms. Xia\u2019s bill would amount to about 1.2 million Canadian dollars.Daisy Xiong contributed reporting from Vancouver.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Self-Described Jets Owner-in-Waiting Will Tailgate for Now", "Date": "2018-12-28", "News": "The entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk, a fan of the Jets, would love to own the team someday. There are just two problems: The team isn\u2019t for sale, and he isn\u2019t rich enough. So here\u2019s the plan. \u2026Supported byOr maybe it was a prayer circle.\u201cO.K., bring it in,\u201d he said in a hushed voice. The 12 men wrapped arms and locked eyes. One by one, they predicted the final score and a key play of the game. And because they were all Jets fans, the overwhelming expectation on this damp December afternoon was that the Jets would lose.In fact, Vaynerchuk was hoping for it.\u201cI want them to get a high draft pick,\u201d he said. \u201cAny real fan should want the same thing.\u201dKnow this: Vaynerchuk, 43, is a real fan, and he has been since the New York Sack Exchange team in 1982. He might prove this by casually referencing the former wide receiver Wallace Wright (career receptions: eight). He also owns a Thomas Hennessy jersey. That\u2019s the current team\u2019s long snapper.So when he one day owns the Jets, Vaynerchuk said, he will still be rooting for high draft picks and tailgating in the parking lot and tweeting furiously about his team\u2019s preseason games, because that\u2019s what Vaynerchuk does. Fulfilling a lifelong dream to buy this particularly unfortunate and derisible N.F.L. franchise wouldn\u2019t change that.Many die-hard N.F.L. fans might dream of owning their favorite team. Vaynerchuk, though, is the rare fan with an outside chance of one day making that dream a reality.Here\u2019s the plan: Over the next 25 years, if his $150 million communications holdings company, VaynerX, sees the growth he expects, and the team\u2019s current owner, Woody Johnson, or his family, or whoever is the principal owner at that point, is ready to sell, then the Jets will become Vaynerchuk\u2019s.Scratch that. When these things happen, not if. Because no one is willing to bet bigger on himself than Gary Vee.On a recent afternoon in his office on Manhattan\u2019s West Side, in front of a window gazing across the belly of the city, Vaynerchuk took stock of the bustling digital media empire he built, in part, on his ability to scout the future.\u201cAll of this is to buy the New York Jets,\u201d he said, sweeping an arm toward the glass wall facing rows of cubicles and conference rooms.\u201cYes,\u201d he continued, \u201cthat\u2019s what I want to do with my life. I\u2019d like to buy the Jets at 68 years old and win six Super Bowls before I die.\u201dIt is reasonable to wonder, as the Jets wrap up another losing season, why them? Why the Jets? It is a franchise that, after all, just celebrated the 50th anniversary of its last Super Bowl. A franchise most likely on the verge of making a sixth coaching change since 2000. A franchise that has again missed the playoffs, for the 22nd time in the past 30 years.According to Forbes, the Jets ($2.85 billion) are the eighth most valuable team in the N.F.L., but the fourth most valuable sports team in the New York metropolitan area, slightly ahead of the Mets ($2.1 billion). And there is no indication that Johnson, currently the United States ambassador to the United Kingdom, or his brother Christopher, the team\u2019s chairman, is planning to sell any time soon.Still, when RSE Ventures, led by Stephen M. Ross, the majority owner of the Miami Dolphins, bought a stake in VaynerMedia in 2014, it came with a half-serious option for equity in the football team, as well. Vaynerchuk declined.\u201cIt would have been cool to walk around life as a 38-year-old and say I own the Dolphins,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I hate the Dolphins.\u201dRoss said: \u201cI\u2019d be partners with him in anything. But I knew he wasn\u2019t going to do that.\u201dIt has been all about the J-E-T-S since Vaynerchuk, who was born in Belarus, started selling lemonade and shoveling snow for extra cash in Edison, N.J. His family moved first to Queens and then to New Jersey, where his father opened a wine store called Shoppers Discount Liquors. In 1996, working for his father, Vaynerchuk considered opening a second store. Instead, he started a website. A multimillion-dollar e-commerce wine-selling enterprise was born.Along the way, he discovered the Jets. As an immigrant bouncing to various places in his childhood, without a firm grasp of English, he found in the early 1980s that football helped him bond with children in school and connect with the community.\u201cIt represented so much,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were starting to make it in America. That was the way I broke through. It is the American thing for me.\u201dThough cheer-worthy seasons have been few and far between since 1982, his passion for the Jets has hardly diminished. In the Vayner offices, there are autographed helmets, framed jerseys on the walls and even a small Jets ornament hanging from a Christmas tree in the reception area. At a recent consulting workshop called the Daily Digital Deep Dive, for which a seat at the conference table costs $10,000, Vaynerchuk wore an \u201cugly\u201d Jets sweater equipped with battery-powered lights.On game days, from his seats in Section 113, Row 18, Vaynerchuk has become one of the team\u2019s most famous fans since Edwin Anzalone, better known as Fireman Ed, stopped regularly attending games in 2012.\u201cHe used to get so upset after losses,\u201d said Phil Toronto, VaynerX\u2019s senior vice president for special projects, investing and advising, \u201cI used to have to cancel meetings the next day.\u201dVaynerchuk said he has no relationship with the Johnsons and has never engaged in any discussions about a sale.There is no discussion to be had, he said. He understands that N.F.L. teams are purchased by people with substantially more money than he has, like David A. Tepper, a hedge fund manager who paid more than $2.2 billion for the Carolina Panthers in May.So Vaynerchuk\u2019s pledge to one day have the resources to buy the team might be partly self-motivational, a goal to chase. But that has not stopped him from candidly telling anyone who asks that he is actively laying the foundation for a future Jets takeover.\u201cHe\u2019s speaking it into existence,\u201d his brother and business partner, A.J., said.\u201cGary doesn\u2019t have a dream to own tons of houses or a private jet,\u201d he added. \u201cI truly believe he\u2019s working toward ownership of the Jets.\u201dBeing discreet was never Vaynerchuk\u2019s style. With a podcast, newsletters, essays, books and tweets, he is widely credited with originating the full-time videographer trend by putting his life on camera, everywhere, for a series called DailyVee starting in 2015.\u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about a passionate product, you can\u2019t just put out press releases,\u201d Vaynerchuk said.The league\u2019s struggle to stem the exodus of fans choosing to watch games on television, rather than attend in person, is another sticking point for Vaynerchuk, who criticized the Jets and the Giants for betraying many longtime season-ticket holders with the introduction of costly personal seat licenses when the teams moved into MetLife in 2010.\u201cHe has the pulse of the people out there,\u201d Ross said. \u201cSometimes you lose sight of them. How do you get to them? How do you influence them? How do you market to them?\u201dRoss said that although Vaynerchuk might not have been interested in owning the Dolphins, he has contributed marketing ideas geared toward Dolphins fans.\u201cSocial media is the greatest marketing tool there is today,\u201d Ross said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s like the gold standard in that.\u201dThat was evident before the Jets hosted the Houston Texans, as Vaynerchuk bounced around the small gathering in the parking lot in typically restless fashion. He exchanged text messages with a professional boxer, recorded a video for Facebook Live and checked his YouTube page, where he had just posted a seven-and-a-half-hour vlog of his recent tour of Dubai.As far as tailgates go, it was a mild one. There was one foldout chair. Somebody handed out a bag of pretzels. (Vaynerchuk, who recently started a direct-to-consumer winery called Empathy Wines, rarely drinks beer.)Rolling his eyes, A.J. Vaynerchuk joked, \u201cIt\u2019s like he\u2019s a slot receiver.\u201dExcept that his route is aimed at the owner\u2019s suite.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Problem With Banning Pornography on Tumblr", "Date": "2018-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe decision has taken away an essential platform for some women and members of the L.G.B.T.Q. community. Ms. Powell is the former head of communications for Google.While we can get hung up on debating what kind of content should or shouldn\u2019t be allowed on a particular platform, none of that alters an equally important but less-visible problem: When tech companies tackle large-scale problems with large-scale solutions, underrepresented groups are often further marginalized as a result. This is not the first time a social media or blog platform has banned adult content. Twitter, Facebook, and many other platforms all prohibit pornography. But in the United States, we seem to ignore public debate about the censorship of sex and the human body, reflecting the American tendency to get more offended by the sight of a female-presenting nipple than by guns, hate speech or violence.While all efforts must be made to eradicate illegal content on Tumblr, it\u2019s important to acknowledge that underrepresented groups have carved out safe spaces on the platform. Tumblr has thrived in part thanks to its unique identity as a place for adult content. Young women dominate the platform, and many turn to it as a place to find more empowering, female-centric takes on pornography and the female body. On Tumblr, one could find pages dedicated to celebrating bodies of all types, could browse sophisticated fetish images curated from a female perspective, and could find GIFs and videos that \u2014 unlike most mainstream pornography sites \u2014 depict female pleasure.Similarly, many in the L.G.B.T.Q. community have said the adult content on Tumblr provided a space to connect with those with similar interests and to explore sexuality without judgment.The problem isn\u2019t just about agreeing on what kind of content to allow on a platform, or whether adult content is a positive or negative force in society. It\u2019s also that tech companies like Tumblr make statements about wanting to be a positive place for diverse communities, all the while not truly understanding these communities and allowing their algorithms to target their adult content.To be fair, it is a hard nut to crack. Platforms with millions of users need algorithmic solutions to solve issues like content regulation at scale. The problem is, machines are not yet very good at nuance. Can Tumblr\u2019s artificial intelligence tell the difference between a curated page of visual erotica and violent sexual imagery the same way a trained human could? Probably not. There are many examples of Tumblr\u2019s A.I. making mistakes, in which non-explicit fan art, pictures of a person\u2019s hands, a cartoon image of two men kissing and a vigorous, sweaty game of Ping-Pong set off the platform\u2019s A.I. filters. Tumblr has said there will be an appeals process staffed by real live humans, but the human part seems like an afterthought, as it so often does with tech companies.While there is no perfect solution, there are many steps Tumblr could take if it truly wanted to support these communities. A more nuanced policy could be developed and then implemented through greater short-term investment in more human moderation and long-term investment in A.I. Without the ability to judge nuance at scale and to distinguish between empowering versus damaging content, Tumblr has adopted a policy that destroys communities who are among its greatest fans. It is a lesson all tech companies should keep in mind when they are debating policy changes: When you cast a wide net, you may sacrifice a group you never intended to hurt. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yes, You Can Be an Ethical Tech Consumer. Here\u2019s How.", "Date": "2018-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixProducts that we enjoy continue to create privacy, misinformation and workplace issues. We can do better at getting the industry to do better.It has never felt worse to be a technology consumer. So what can you do about it?That\u2019s the question of the year after many of the biggest tech companies were mired in scandal after scandal or exposed as having committed necessary evils to offer the products and services that we have so blissfully enjoyed.All of this bad behavior circles back to you. We are the buyers, users and supporters of the products and services that help Big Tech thrive.So what do we do at this point to become more ethical consumers?\u201cI think this is an incredibly powerful question to ask,\u201d said Jim Steyer, chief executive of Common Sense Media, a nonprofit that focuses on technology\u2019s impact on families. \u201cIt\u2019s a very important moment where consumer behavior can have a transformational impact.\u201dI talked to a broad range of people \u2014 ethicists, activists, environmentalists and others \u2014 about how to become a more empowered, socially responsible tech consumer. Here\u2019s what they agreed on.First and foremost, when tech does you wrong, one of the most powerful ways to protest is to take your business elsewhere and ask your friends and family to go along.Even so, damage to a brand may have plenty of repercussions because it motivates the company to change its behavior, Mr. Steyer said. Both Uber and Facebook, facing enormous pressure, have modified some of their practices and committed to improvements.\u201cSometimes shame is one of the most important arrows in your quiver,\u201d Mr. Steyer said. We can also take the path less traveled \u2014 that is, take our data and money to products made by more ethical vendors.Pulling the plug on Facebook is a hassle, but not impossible. Taking on the challenge of finding alternatives is an example of how people can give up some convenience in exchange for individual empowerment, said Shahid Buttar, a director of grass-roots advocacy for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights nonprofit.The same approach can be applied to Google if you take issue with its behavior. While Google offers a comprehensive suite of web services, including news, email and maps, you could switch to an alternative for each of those products.A rush shipment could involve multiple vehicles and various facilities before it gets to your door. So pause and ask yourself if you actually need that smartphone or scented candle tomorrow. If you can wait, choose no-rush delivery, which could take about a week.\u201cOne of the things you can do to be more responsible is to take greater ownership of your stuff,\u201d Mr. Lai said.The Cambridge Analytica scandal this year illustrates our responsibility to think about others, not just ourselves, when using technology.In other words, if people had disabled Apps Others Use, Cambridge Analytica most likely couldn\u2019t have collected the data of their friends. More important, if those who took the quiz were aware of the potential of sharing information about their friends, they might have opted not to participate.But how can you be more conscious of your actions when technology is so confusing in the first place?The bottom line is that you are not alone. And if a company makes it too difficult for you and your friends to stay safe while staying connected, you can leave.\u201cIf you\u2019re really uncomfortable with the values of a company, don\u2019t use their product,\u201d Mr. Steyer said.

{"Headline": "Jon Meacham: George H.W. Bush and the Price of Politics", "Date": "2018-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor every compromise he made to political expedience on the campaign trail, in office he ultimately did the right thing.Mr. Meacham is the author of \u201cDestiny and Power: The American Odyssey of George Herbert Walker Bush.\u201dHis guests were just about everything George H.W. Bush had never been, and never could be: ideological, hard edged and spoiling for a partisan revolution. It was the spring of 1989, and Newt Gingrich, a young congressman from Georgia, had been elected the House Republican whip, a key leadership post in the Washington of the 41st president. Mr. Bush, who was more comfortable in the fading moderate precincts of the Republican Party, didn\u2019t know Mr. Gingrich well, but the perennially hospitable president invited him and Vin Weber, the Minnesota Republican congressman who had managed Mr. Gingrich\u2019s whip campaign, down to the White House for a beer. The conversation was pleasant, but the visitors felt there was something Bush was not quite saying. Mr. Weber decided to put the question to the president directly.\u201cMr. President, you\u2019ve been very nice to us,\u201d Mr. Weber said as they were preparing to leave. \u201cTell us what your biggest fear is about us.\u201d\u201cWell,\u201d Mr. Bush answered, \u201cI\u2019m worried that sometimes your idealism will get in the way of what I think is sound governance.\u201d In the most polite way possible, in a single sentence, Mr. Bush had summarized his anxiety that when politics and principle clashed, politics was going to win. Mr. Weber recalled that he appreciated the president\u2019s use of the word \u201cidealism\u201d \u2014 he hadn\u2019t said \u201cextremism\u201d or \u201cpartisanship,\u201d though that was what he meant. The two congressmen represented a harsh new kind of politics that would, in five years\u2019 time, lead to the first Republican takeover of the House in four decades. By then George Bush would be back in Texas, a one-term president done in by the right wing of his own party \u2014 a conservative cabal that rebelled against Mr. Bush\u2019s statesmanlike deal with Democrats to raise some taxes in exchange for spending controls to rein in the deficit.George Herbert Walker Bush, who died Friday night, at 94, was the last president of the Greatest Generation, a gentleman who came of age in an ever-uglier arena, the embodiment of a postwar era of consensus that, in our time, seems as remote as Agincourt. He deserves our praise, but he also repays closer historical consideration, for his life offers an object lesson in the best that politics, which is inherently imperfect, can be.He\u2019d grown up in a world where politics was a means to serve the public good, not a vehicle for self-aggrandizement or self-enrichment. His father, Senator Prescott Bush of Connecticut, spoke out against Joseph McCarthy earlier than most. And George Bush \u2014 known then as \u201cPoppy,\u201d a childhood nickname \u2014 signed up to serve as soon as he could, and never stopped. As an 18 year old, he volunteered for hazardous duty as a carrier-based naval aviator in World War II. As commander in chief, nearly half a century later, he, with the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and building on the work of presidents of both parties down the decades, ended the deadliest standoff in human history, the Cold War. Before he got to the White House, a nuclear Armageddon between America and the Soviet Union was always a possibility; after him, it was unthinkable.On the home front, his 1990 budget agreement codified controls on spending and created the conditions for the elimination of the federal budget deficit under his successor, Bill Clinton. He negotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement, signed the Americans with Disabilities Act and passed historic clean-air legislation. It\u2019s virtually impossible to imagine a Republican president doing so much today.It\u2019s an inescapable fact of history, though, that as Bush struggled to govern like Ike, the world around him was beginning to resemble a Joe McCarthy rally. In the Bush years conservative Republicans girded for total war, talk radio was on the rise, cable news shows were busy turning politics into a kind of professional wrestling for wonks, and populists such as Ross Perot and Pat Buchanan \u2014 forerunners, in their way, of Donald J. Trump \u2014 were waiting for their chance to pounce. (Mr. Bush did think an overture from Lee Atwater, his campaign manager, to consider Mr. Trump for the 1988 vice-presidential nomination the most puzzling of notions. \u201cStrange,\u201d Mr. Bush told his diary. \u201cUnbelievable.\u201d)Mr. Bush was a gentleman, but he was a politician, too, and therein lay the great tension of his life. \u201cPolitics isn\u2019t a pure undertaking \u2014 not if you\u2019re going to win, it\u2019s not,\u201d he once told me. \u201cThat\u2019s the way politics is, unfortunately.\u201dTruth be told \u2014 and he always wanted history to tell the truth \u2014 it is also the case that Mr. Bush was an occasionally hard-knuckled politician. He presided over a presidential campaign that relentlessly attacked Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis\u2019 liberal social views, ranging from furloughs for first-degree murderers to Mr. Dukakis\u2019 veto of a bill requiring public-school teachers to lead the Pledge of Allegiance.To win office Mr. Bush had to choose between two sets of deeply ingrained impulses; the Competitor had to be given provisional dominion over the Conciliator. As he privately observed when his mind turned to his own 1988 White House run: \u201cIf you want to be President \u2014 and I do \u2014 there are certain things that I have to do.\u201dTo serve he had to succeed; to preside he had to prevail. For Mr. Bush the impulses to do in his opponents and to do good were inextricably bound. At the end of the 1988 campaign he mused to himself, \u201cThe country gets over these things fast. I have no apologies, no regrets, and if I had let the press keep defining me as a wimp, a loser, I wouldn\u2019t be where I am today: threatening, close, and who knows, maybe winning.\u201d He was at once ferocious and gracious \u2014 a formidable combination.Bush never doubted that he was the best man on the ballot. Armed with this self-confidence \u2014 a personal assurance masked by his kindness and his thoughtfulness \u2014 he could justify adapting his principles and attacking his opponents as the inevitable price of politics. To Mr. Bush, such calculations were not cynical. They were instrumental to the desired end: the accumulation of power to be deployed in the service of America and of the world. What mattered to him was not what one said or did to rise to ultimate authority. What mattered was whether one was principled and selfless once in command. And as president of the United States, Mr. Bush was surely that.For every compromise or concession to party orthodoxy or political expedience on the campaign trail, in office Mr. Bush ultimately did the right thing. In 1964, when he sought a Senate seat from Texas, he opposed the Civil Rights Act, only to vote for open housing once in Congress four years later, much to the fury of his conservative constituents. In 1988, he made an absolute pledge on supply-side economics \u2014 \u201cRead my lips: No new taxes\u201d \u2014 only to break that promise two years later, when he believed an agreement that included higher taxes was best for the country. And, after winning the hard-hitting 1988 race, he sought to bring about what he\u2019d called a \u201ckinder, gentler\u201d America, reaching out to Democrats and Republicans alike, seeking common ground on common problems.The nation mourns him not least because we no longer have a president who knows that the story of the nation is not all about him. In the last years of his life, President Bush was asked how he\u2019d like to be remembered. He didn\u2019t pause \u2014 and he avoided, as ever, the first-person pronoun, what his mother used to call the \u201cGreat I Am\u201d \u2014 and replied: \u201cThat we put the country first.\u201d That such words seem so quaint is one of the many reasons we already miss him as much as we do.Jon Meacham is the author of \u201cDestiny and Power: The American Odyssey of George Herbert Walker Bush.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Feathers and Fur Fly Over Pterosaur Fossil Finding", "Date": "2018-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesAn analysis of two fossils would push back the origins of feathers by about 70 million years, but more specimens may be needed for confirmation.Birds are famous for their colorful feathers, which they use to fly, flirt and keep warm. But long before avians ever flapped their wings, flying reptiles called pterosaurs seized the skies.Among paleontologists, it was a long-running assumption that the winged creatures lacked feathers. But a team of researchers has found what they believe to be tiny structures hiding in the fossils of two pterosaurs from China that they say are feathers \u2014 not as elegant, but comparable to the plumage on birds and dinosaurs.More specimens may be needed to confirm the finding, which other paleontologists questioned. But if true, it would push back the origins of feathers by about 70 million years, and also be the first time that feathers have been identified on an animal that was neither a bird nor a dinosaur.Both specimens were mostly covered in hollow, unbranched pycnofibers that resemble fur. But the team then found one type of branched structure, which looked like a curved painter\u2019s brush, on the neck, part of the forelimb and foot area and tail of one of the specimens. A second structure, found on the head of the same specimen, had a central shaft that branched off near the midpoint almost like a fraying rope. And the last, which was found on both pterosaurs\u2019 wing membranes, looked straggly like down feathers on a chicken.In contrast with the sleek, aerodynamically designed feathers seen on modern birds, these feathers were most likely for insulation, the researchers said.Some paleontologists had previously pegged the origin of feathers to dinosaurs somewhere around 180 million years ago in the Early and Mid-Jurassic. While these pterosaur specimens were about 160 to 165 million years old, their lineage dated back to about 230 million years ago, and the new finding adds further evidence to the idea that there was a common ancestor of birds, dinosaurs and pterosaurs that was either feathered or at least had the genes to grow them.\u201cWhen I first saw these specimens and the branching I didn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Dr. McNamara said.Her views were changed, she said, when she saw the systematic arrangement of the feather-like branches. But other scientists have retained their skepticism.Others were less equivocal.\u201cI don\u2019t know if the described morphologies of the pycnofibers in this specimen are valid,\u201d Dr. O\u2019Connor said. \u201cIn dinosaurs, similar claims of unusual feather morphotypes have been made that are slowly being refuted one by one. Only time and better specimens will tell.\u201d\u201cThese additional three types are branching,\u201d he said, \u201cand if you simply take the dictionary definition of a feather, that is a feather.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech Stocks Often Rise and Fall Together. They Shouldn\u2019t.", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThe stock market often acts as though tech stocks were members of a close-knit family that must always travel together.Talking about tech as if it were a monolith isn\u2019t entirely wrong. Tech stocks often do move in a pack \u2014 mainly because investors frequently treat them as a cohesive entity.\u201cWhat we call \u2018tech companies\u2019 really includes a broad range of companies that are at different stages of maturity,\u201d Professor Damodaran said in an interview. \u201cThe aging process for tech companies \u2014 which usually start out as high-growth companies \u2014 is very rapid.\u201cAlso, some companies are more tech at their core. Some are less tech,\u201d he added. \u201cWe should be looking at companies along a kind of a spectrum, along at least two dimensions.\u201dThe problem, then, is twofold.\u25a0 First, Professor Damodaran said, \u201ctech companies live in dog years.\u201d They have accelerated life cycles and behave differently as children and mature adults. A young money-burning company like Tesla and an old cash-generating company like IBM need to be evaluated with different metrics.\u25a0 Second, tech has become ubiquitous. \u201cNearly all big companies today are tech companies, at least to some degree,\u201d he said. In late 2018, simply using advanced technology isn\u2019t a distinguishing characteristic.Even the newspaper industry \u2014 which used linotype machines and pneumatic tubes when I started as a copy boy in the 20th century \u2014 has a lot in common with tech companies. Like Netflix and Spotify, for example, The New York Times and The Washington Post use streaming technology and data analysis to feed information and entertainment to growing armies of digital subscribers.\u201cOn the day that, say, 60 percent of profits and revenues come from digital sources, do we reclassify these companies as tech companies?\u201d Professor Damodaran asked.Similarly, he compared Tesla, which makes electric cars and is widely viewed as a tech company, with Ford and General Motors. Should Ford and G.M. be categorized as tech companies, too, when the bulk of their revenue eventually derives from electric vehicles?Tesla and IBM are at two ends of what Professor Damodaran calls the tech company life cycle.As an infant company, Tesla poses a valuation challenge. Assessing the value of a stock typically starts with an assessment of earnings and cash flow, but that requires imagination with Tesla because it churns out annual losses, not earnings. Yet investors in the stock market collectively say Tesla is worth about $60 billion, more than G.M. or Ford, which make profits.Will Tesla become profitable enough to justify its current price? Professor Damodaran believes its shares are grossly overvalued. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to know with a young company,\u201d he conceded, adding that Tesla is \u201ca risky proposition but not an impossible one.\u201dOld profitable companies like IBM are easier to value. The stock market says it is worth about $110 billion, based on a price-to-earnings ratio of 8.4. That ratio is less than half the level at which the average stock trades, presumably because IBM hasn\u2019t been growing rapidly and, by some metrics, has been shrinking.\u201cAn old company can\u2019t run as fast as a young company can, and usually it shouldn\u2019t try,\u201d he said.Sober analysis is critical to market health. Consider the damage done by bouts of magical thinking about the value of tech stocks.While valuations are generally more subdued today, imprecise thinking about tech stocks abides, with troubling implications.Amazon, for example, trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 109 \u2014 more than five times the valuation of the average stock. That has given its shareholders, including its founder, Jeff Bezos, astonishing wealth. It has allowed the company, which is old in tech years, to behave like an upstart, Professor Damodaran said, plowing profits into new businesses and disrupting entire industries.The answers should be different in each case, because tech stocks really aren\u2019t the same. One day, grouping them together is likely to seem quaint and, possibly, dangerous.Follow Jeff Sommer on Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

We mostly see each other on the weekends, but he really bugs my other friends. I want to invite him on our holiday ski trip; they don\u2019t because he often makes up stories about celebrities. Not only will he have an Ariana Grande sighting (totally believable), but he takes it to another level: He and Ariana have an amazing conversation that he relays in painful detail. (Less believable.) I forgive him these lies because he\u2019s kind and loyal. But my friends don\u2019t. Should I say something to him? And what about the ski trip?M.P.You put your finger on a category of lie that (while still wrong, of course) I find sympathetic. This guy probably doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s good enough as he is, so he makes up glittery stories to be more appealing to you. (He\u2019s not getting anything else out of these fabricated encounters with Ariana Grande, right?) But the lies don\u2019t enhance his prestige; they just get him vetoed from ski trips.In my experience, the people who do this tend to be sensitive and defensive. Avoid a brusque confrontation with him: Instead of saying, \u201cStop this nonsense with celebrities,\u201d try to be gentle. The next time he claims to have schmoozed with a pop star, say, \u201cI value your kindness much more than your ability to get past Cardi B\u2019s security guards. Do you know that?\u201dThat may be all it takes for him to realize his miscalculation about your friendship (and that you know he\u2019s lying). If it doesn\u2019t, turn it up a notch. Ask him gently: \u201cDid you really chat with Cardi B today?\u201d If he persists with his lying, spare your friends their justifiable annoyance and see him on your own.

My younger brother and I live with our mom, but we stay with our dad some weekends. On big holidays, like Thanksgiving and Christmas, my parents spend the day together like they\u2019re still married. That would be fine, but they always end up fighting with each other and make the day stressful for my brother and me. Can I say something?SARAAbsolutely! Talk to your mom about this one night when you\u2019re both relaxed. Give your parents credit for trying to pull off these happy family holidays. Believe it or not, they\u2019re doing it for you and your brother. But the fact that they fail consistently (and stress you out in the bargain) suggests a need for change, or a greater effort on their part. My hope is that by raising the issue softly, your mom won\u2019t feel criticized but will see that she and your dad should start working on a new holiday plan.After 22 years of not having a boyfriend, I finally do! I moved to a midsize city after college and met a great guy on a hookup app. We\u2019ve been dating for six months, and things are going great.

Don\u2019t let anxiety about a simple question (or nosy aunts) spoil the good news here.What\u2019s more, there\u2019s nothing wrong with hookup apps. As long as two people agree on what they\u2019re looking for, they can be wonderful (or at least wonderfully efficient). If your grandmother were 40 years younger and lived in a midsize city, she\u2019d probably be swiping right too. So, take it easy on yourself.My teenage grandchildren have never sent us a thank-you note for any present we\u2019ve given them. My husband and I are thinking of teaching them a lesson by skipping Christmas gifts this year. Thoughts?LOISUnless you believe your grandchildren can read minds, wouldn\u2019t it be a more useful lesson to ask them for thank-you notes? I\u2019m sorry that you and your husband feel underappreciated. But if the kids\u2019 parents never insisted they write notes, and you never asked for them, how were your grandchildren to know?If you expect thank-you notes, or if they are the price of admission for future gifts, tell your grandchildren.

{"Headline": "The Otherworldly Beauty of a Dying Sea", "Date": "2018-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Dead Sea is falling by more than a meter a year, and paradoxically, its destruction is revealing an eerie, enchanting world below the waters. Jake Ben Zaken steered his boat along the western shore of the Dead Sea, cut the motor, and bobbed amid the white towers of salt rising out of the turquoise water. Just last year, many of these circular towers, their bumpy surfaces now glistening in the afternoon sun, were beneath the water in this shrinking salty lake.The tours \u2014 the only current commercial option for boating on the Dead Sea \u2014 are part of a tourism industry that, paradoxically, is growing, even as the sea, famous for its highly salinated water, mud and minerals and for being the lowest place on earth, dries up.LEBANONSYRIASea of GalileeJordanRiverMediterraneanSeaWestBankJORDANJerusalemMitspe ShalemDead SeaGAZASTRIPEin GediEin BokekISRAELEGYPT50 MilesBy The New York TimesHotels and spas that once lined the waterfront are now hundreds of meters from the shoreline, and some resorts and beaches have been forced to close in recent years because of the thousands of sinkholes that have resulted from the drying up of the water and the ground around it.Fences with signs warning of sinkholes line much of the western coast, whose dry brown expanse is also dotted with abandoned date palm groves, closed roads, and shuttered buildings, including a defunct gas station. In many places the shoreline is covered with crusts of salt. Pillars and blobs of salt rise from the shallow edges of the water.The eerie, yet enchanting, landscape is increasingly drawing visitors. In 2017, the number of overnight stays in Israeli hotels on the Dead Sea rose 35 percent compared to 2016, according to Israel\u2019s Central Bureau of Statistics. Betting on continued growth, Israel\u2019s tourism ministry recently spent 500 million shekels, or about $135 million to renovate beaches, and build a waterfront walkway at the resort area of Ein Bokek on the Dead Sea\u2019s southern basin, where a new shopping mall opened in November. Two new hotels are also in the planning stages, the first significant development in more than 30 years.The southern basin \u2014 always shallower than the deep northern basin where Mr. Ben Zaken runs his boat trips \u2014 would be completely dry now if the companies harvesting salts and minerals from the Dead Sea didn\u2019t pump water into it, according to scientists.In Jordan, where the number of tourists rose about 8 percent in 2017 compared to 2016 and is on track to increase at a similar rate in 2018, a new Hilton Hotel opened last year on the Dead Sea, and $1.5 billion joint Kuwaiti-Jordanian government project is underway to build more hotels, an amusement park and other tourism infrastructure along the seashore.The falling water level also means that the salinity of the water has increased, and since the 1980s, the water has become so concentrated that crystals of salt now accumulate on the bottom in a process called halite precipitation.\u201cThe Dead Sea is the only place in the world where we see this phenomenon in modern time,\u201d Mr. Lensky said, explaining that millions of years ago, halite precipitation in many of the deep saline lakes that once covered the earth led to the creation of massive, thick salt deposits in places like Poland\u2019s Wieliczka salt mines and the oil-rich Delaware Basin under Texas and New Mexico.It is also halite precipitation that has created the salt sculptures that first began peeking out above the surface of the Dead Sea about 10 years ago, Mr. Lensky said. Because the shape, size and number of salt crystals piling up on the sea bottom vary with the water\u2019s salinity, evaporation rate and temperature, the resulting structures also vary in shape, he said.With much of the sea\u2019s western shore off limits because of sinkholes, Mr. Ben Zaken\u2019s blue and red Dutch-made boat \u2014 named Nefeli after a cloud nymph in Greek mythology \u2014 is the only way to see this otherworldly salty landscape up close.\u201cIt was like being on the moon,\u201d said Natali Tamir, a smartphone photography instructor from Tel Aviv who was inspired to take the boat ride in October after seeing photographs that one of her students had taken on a previous tour. \u201cI have been to the Dead Sea many times and was aware of what was happening there, but on this boat I suddenly understood how dramatic it is, and how sad it is seeing things that won\u2019t be there in five years.\u201dThe tours, which require advance reservation, leave from the Dead Sea shore near the Mitzpe Shalem settlement on the Israeli-occupied West Bank, about 45 miles from Jerusalem. A one-and-a half-hour tour is 180 shekels ($48) and a three-hour tour is 250 shekels ($67) per person. The boat holds up to 12 people.Bobbing among the salt towers, Mr. Ben Zaken pointed out similar structures on the shore, where the water has receded, now brown and gray, and some toppled over.\u201cThose are dead,\u201d he said, before starting up the boat\u2019s engine and motoring past islands of salt that resembled heaps of melting snow or piles of shiny pearls.Mr. Ben Zaken, 54, -who lives in Mitzpe Shalem, served in Israel\u2019s Navy and worked on a commercial crab boat in Alaska. He cranked up the motor and headed to deeper water. The salt formations faded into the distance, as did the desolate brown beaches beyond them. Across the water to the east rose Jordan\u2019s pink Abarim mountains.\u201cI am all alone out here,\u201d Mr. Ben Zaken said as he reached a speed of about 25 knots, fast enough to leave a wake on the water, which reaches depths of about 1,000 feet. Aside from a scientific research boat located several miles south near Ein Gedi, and not visible from here, Mr. Ben Zaken\u2019s Nefeli \u2014 and the fleet of kayaks he began operating last year \u2014 were the only vessels on the Dead Sea.Military restrictions, a constantly-receding shoreline and expensive maintenance to prevent salt buildup on the bottom of vessels all make boating here difficult, and contributed to the closing about 15 years ago of a large wooden ship named Lot\u2019s Wife (she famously turned into a pillar of salt in the Bible) that took groups of tourists out on the water, Mr. Ben Zaken said. But historical texts and archaeological finds of ancient anchors and harbors indicate that the Dead Sea had a thriving maritime culture for thousands of years.\u201cLike any other sea, it should have boats,\u201d said Mr. Ben Zaken, who bought his first boat in 2011, when he was working as an auto mechanic, then waited two years for military permission to start using it and build up a tour business. Last year, he added kayak tours, bought a second boat, and is looking to hire an additional skipper to meet growing demand.Out on the water, Mr. Ben Zaken slowed his boat near what looks like a wall of brown stairs on a nearby shore. \u201cEach one of those steps is a year of losing water,\u201d he said.Continuing south, the last stop on tour was his kibbutz\u2019s Mineral Beach resort, which was forced to close in 2015 after a large sinkhole opened up, swallowing up palm trees, the parking lot and some buildings. The air smelled like sulfur, and the water was the color of pea soup. The lifeguard stand had collapsed onto the gray sand, and empty lounge chairs sat under thatch palm huts.Mr. Ben Zaken pointed to a wooden shed that used to serve as his boat house. After the beach closed, he lost access to the boat shed, and now has to launch his tours from a point further south, reachable only with an off-road vehicle. At the end of each day, he pulls his boat out of the water, loads into on a trailer, then hauls it with a tractor more than half a mile through the desert, over dry land that was once underwater, and rinses the salt water off the boat each night.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this story misstated the amount of money in dollars the Israeli tourism ministry recently spent on improvements at the Ein Bokek resort area. It was $135 million, not $13 million.Advertisement"}

At what point is control lost and the creations take over? How about now? Contributing Opinion Writer Try to imagine the last 11 minutes of Lion Air Flight 610 in October. The plane is a new machine, Boeing\u2019s sleek and intelligent 737 Max 8, fitted with an advanced electronic brain. After takeoff, this cyberpilot senses that something is wrong with the angle of ascent and starts to force the jetliner down.A tug of war follows between men and computer, at 450 miles an hour \u2014 the human pilots trying to right the downward plunge, the automatic pilot taking it back from them. The bot wins. The jetliner crashes into the Java Sea. All 189 onboard are killed.And here\u2019s the most agonizing part: The killer was supposed to save lives. It was a smart computer designed to protect a gravity-defiance machine from error. It lacks judgment and intuition, precisely because those human traits can sometimes be fatal in guiding an aerodynamic tube through the sky.But it\u2019s not too much of a reach to see Flight 610 as representative of the hinge in history we\u2019ve arrived at \u2014 with the bots, the artificial intelligence and the social media algorithms now shaping the fate of humanity at a startling pace.Like the correction system in the 737, these inventions are designed to make life easier and safer \u2014 or at least more profitable for the owners. And they do, for the most part. The overall idea is to outsource certain human functions, the drudgery and things prone to faulty judgment, while retaining master control. The question is: At what point is control lost and the creations take over? How about now?It was exactly 200 years ago that Mary Shelley published a story of a monster who is still very much with us. Her book \u201cFrankenstein\u201d is about the consequences of man playing God. You can see permutations of the monster, a not-unsympathetic patchwork of human parts, in characters like Dolores, the host who rebels in the television series \u201cWestworld.\u201dShelley\u2019s concerns were raised at the peak of the Industrial Revolution, when the Western world was transformed from sleepy agricultural societies into a frenetic age of factories, machines and overcrowded cities. All the helpful inventions also produced mass dislocation, life-killing pollution, child labor and \u2014 as per the invention of the cotton gin in the American South \u2014 an expansion of human enslavement.Today we are close to creating a human brain inside a computer \u2014 an entirely new species. In his book \u201cSapiens,\u201d Yuval Noah Harari takes us through a mostly upbeat tour of humanity since the cognitive revolution of 70,000 years ago. At the end of the book \u2014 our time \u2014 he warns about the new being, the cyborg now taking shape in a lab near you.The C.E.O. of Microsoft, Satya Nadella, hit a similar cautionary note at the company\u2019s recent annual shareholder meeting. Big Tech, he said, should be asking \u201cnot what computers can do, but what they should do.\u201dIt\u2019s the \u201ccan do\u201d part that should scare you. Facebook, once all puppies, baby pictures and high school reunion updates, is a monster of misinformation. And Facebook\u2019s creator is more clueless than Dr. Frankenstein about the dangers of what he has unleashed on the world.Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s C.E.O., has glibly assured us that building advanced artificial intelligence systems will root out the hate speech, lies and propaganda passed among the two billion active users of Facebook. But fake news \u2014 whether gossip shared by family members or the toxic kind spread by Russians in basements \u2014 is the mother\u2019s milk of Facebook. The A.I. may only make it easier for mass manipulation. In that sense, Facebook is headed for its own crash into the sea.It\u2019s not Luddite to see the be-careful-what-you-wish-for lesson from Mary Shelley\u2019s era to our own, at the cusp of an age of technological totalitarianism. Nor is it Luddite to ask for more screening, more ethical considerations, more projections of what can go wrong, as we surrender judgment, reason and oversight to our soulless creations.As haunting as those final moments inside the cockpit of Flight 610 were, it\u2019s equally haunting to grasp the full meaning of what happened: The system overrode the humans and killed everyone.

{"Headline": "Reconciliation and Why \u2018When in Doubt, Go\u2019 Makes for Better Journalism", "Date": "2018-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter 84______For months, I\u2019d been wanting to write about a community confronting its colonial past, really working through the issues, and I\u2019d seen a few references to Elliston\u2019s new monument commemorating the Waterloo Bay massacre, but I wasn\u2019t sure there was much more to say.Was there any deeper meaning to a slab of stone acknowledging just one violent incident from 1849? Would anyone want to talk about it?I decided to just go, with a single person lined up for an interview: Jack Johncock, a local Wirangu elder. I flew to Port Lincoln, where he lives, and hopped into his ute for the long ride up the coast to Elliston.Immediately, I could tell it was the right call.Jack \u2014 a tree trunk of a man who coaches footy and uses more Aussie slang than most of Parliament \u2014 provided me with more history and context than I could have ever imagined.He explained in detail the extensive process Elliston went through to investigate what happened near Waterloo Bay, and the angry pushback that a few older white residents had mounted against the idea of using the word \u201cmassacre\u201d to describe the act of shooting and pushing several Aboriginal Australians off a rocky cliff into the sea.\u201cThey just don\u2019t want to accept what happened,\u201d he said.Jack could kind of understand; there was a dispute about the numbers. Written accounts by English settlers identified three dead, while the Wirangu\u2019s oral histories put the number much higher, at around 200.What he and others argued for, ultimately, was the right to define the narrative \u2014 for Australia\u2019s original inhabitants to have their account prioritized. And they succeeded. The monument now commemorates \u201can incident referred to by the traditional owners of this land as \u2018The Massacre of Waterloo Bay.\u2019\u201dBut as we drove northwest on dirt roads and smooth highways past farms and bush, the theme of whose story of the land gets told kept coming up. Every few miles, Jack would point out a mountain, field or coastal outcrop with a name and spiritual tale that was thousands of years old.There was damage, too.About halfway through, Jack pointed to his left, to a patch of scrub without much vegetation.\u201cThey overgrazed that area,\u201d he said. \u201cThey overused the land.\u201dA little later, he pointed to his right, toward a distant lake that he said had also been ruined long ago.\u201cWhen they first brought their sheep here, they took over the water holes,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was our people\u2019s source of life, for thousands of years.\u201dSuch small acts, which might not have looked like much to English settlers, are what led to many frontier conflicts in Australia.Historical accounts show that hunger and the loss of land drove many of Australia\u2019s first inhabitants to steal food; those thefts often led to reprisal killings, like those memorialized by the monument in Elliston.Whether what happened in Elliston should be called a \u201cmassacre\u201d strikes Jack as a moot point and an effort to \u201chush things up.\u201d The dictionary definition of massacre does not require a specific number of dead, he noted, and he insisted that the benefits of bold reconciliation should not be discounted.When we reached Elliston, it wasn\u2019t hard to see what he meant. We sat together at a picnic table in the town\u2019s main park with a pair of local officials. Jack and the two men had an undeniable rapport; it was clear they had been through a lot together to get the monument built.A few minutes later, Jack yelled over to a young Aboriginal man, Robbie Pickett, who joined us as we finished our coffees. Robbie told me the process of overcoming resistance to the monument had changed how he and his people viewed Elliston.\u201cWe feel a lot more at peace,\u201d he said.Jack agreed, declaring \u201ca dark cloud has been lifted.\u201dNeither of them were bitter about the ugliness of the debate, which involved racist taunts and angry Facebook posts that intensified divisions.They both said Elliston deserved praise for opening up the conversation in a public, transparent way that is rare in Australia, revealing both how far the country has to go, and how small towns can show the way.\u201cIt is what it is,\u201d Robbie said. He smiled. \u201cWe all just have to put our best foot forward.\u201dRight, I thought. When in doubt, go.______Australia is one of the many countries pushing the limits of the Paris Agreement, putting us all on track for a more rapid confrontation with some of the most severe consequences of global warming.Not good.

{"Headline": "The Feminist Power of Embroidery", "Date": "2018-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen I pick up needle and thread, I join a long line of women who have turned the domestic arts into political expression. Ms. Kim is a journalist.Many years ago, inspired by a book on Korean folk art and craft, I began a crude, autodidactic experiment in stitching. I worked without a pattern, using cheap floss, a needle with a too-small eye and a plastic embroidery hoop to sew geometric designs on a few worn-out T-shirts.Thread lends itself almost too easily to metaphor. With each clumsy stitch, I thought of my maternal grandmother, whom I never got a chance to meet. An artwork of hers hangs on my parents\u2019 wall, in Tacoma, Wash. From a distance, the framed image appears to be a painting, but it is in fact hair-fine embroidery. A light-green parrot sits at rest in a magnolia tree, the bird\u2019s curved, red-orange beak contrasting sharply with its layered feathers. The flowers are in full bloom, shaded dark pink to white.Each tiny stitch of plumage and branch is the work of a young woman\u2019s fingers, cramped by the needle\u2019s demands, her bowed head curving her torso into a C. My grandmother created the panel around 1941, when she was a high-school student in Seoul living under Japanese colonial rule. Given the oppressions of that era \u2014 she and her classmates were forced to use Japanese names; she walked past soldiers on her way home from school \u2014 embroidery must have lent her a quiet, fleeting freedom.My own practice has been intermittent, but last year, in a moment of anger and news overload, I picked up my old hoop and thread. I began to sew objects, words and portraits of loved ones into handkerchiefs and remnants of felt. I embroidered during afternoon work breaks and in the evening, while watching bad TV. I learned how to keep my fabric just taut enough and marveled at the difference a millimeter of thread can make in evoking a nose or the tuning peg of a tiny violin.Even when the design at hand has no straightforward message, the act of embroidery can feel transgressive in its silence and domesticity. It is a haven from news whorls and internet noise, a return to a female tradition when our bodies and minds feel so keenly under assault.The history of embroidery affords a glimpse of \u201cthe private inner world\u201d of women, as a chronicler of the Korean tradition puts it. Because it has tended to flourish in female and feminine spaces \u2014 namely, the home \u2014 it is a kind of secret. To embroider is to embellish: to create a fantasia and thus be momentarily free.None of this is to argue for retreat, let alone to the sewing room. Resistance is necessarily public, manifested in rallies and pickets, door-knocking and debate. Yet for all the time I have spent outside in the Trump era, there is a corresponding need for time indoors, where I can be still and let the mind wander. Textile work resembles meditation, though it can also take place in knitting circles and quilting groups, where silence is shared.I recently reread \u201cEmbroideries,\u201d by Marjane Satrapi, a graphic memoir about the lives of women in her extended Iranian family. The young Marjane sits with her grandmother at home over tea and listens to the stories told by female relatives and neighbors. The title of the book refers not only to needle and thread but also to the elaboration in \u201cold wives\u2019 tales,\u201d domestic labor, fashion and nose jobs. Feigned virginity becomes \u201cthe full embroidery.\u201dI know just a few things about my grandmother. She was a passionate student who, despite the limited opportunities available to Korean women during Japanese rule, became a high-school math teacher. Her husband forced her to quit when they were married, but she applied her intellect and skills to work in the home. I used a photo of my grandmother\u2019s embroidered parrot to guide a recent project: a bust of my mom sewn into a periwinkle handkerchief. The weave of her face isn\u2019t as delicate as in my grandmother\u2019s work. But there is a hint of her, there in the eyes and red-thread smile.Advertisement"}

Ms. Henebry said that students were not told about the threat, but were simply told to follow fire drill procedures.\u201cWe of course practice our evacuation drills, we also have active assailant drills that we do with just our faculty, so our faculty are very well prepared,\u201d she said.At the Hayward Area Memorial Hospital & Water\u2019s Edge in Hayward, Wis., an employee received the threat by email at 12:29 p.m. local time, according to Cherie Morgan, the marketing and communications director. The hospital notified the Sawyer County Sheriff\u2019s Department, which responded.The hospital, which has 25 beds, along with a 50-bed skilled nursing facility and 40 senior apartments, did not evacuate patients, but closed down its urgent care and orthopedic clinics, canceled scheduled appointments, and sent nonessential staff home. After staff searched the building twice, and the sheriff\u2019s department deployed bomb-sniffing dogs, the sheriff\u2019s department pronounced the building safe.In Connecticut, a staff member at the Wallingford Public Library received the email around 1 p.m. \u201cIt looked very much like a hoax to us but we want to be very careful always so we called the police and decided to evacuate the building,\u201d Jane Fisher, the director of the library, said.

But they are capable of other impressive feats.On the Arctic island of Svalbard, Norway, the shaggy white creatures eat almost nonstop to store up fat during the summer months of the midnight sun. Then, during the long winter of total darkness and little food, they live mostly off energy reserves.\u201cThey are normal mammals only about three months a year,\u201d said Walter Arnold, a professor at the University of Veterinary Medicine in Vienna who studies animals\u2019 adaptations to cold.The rest of the time, extreme conditions demand extreme behaviors. For instance, some research suggested that Svalbard reindeer lacked standard circadian rhythms, leading to speculation that their body clocks had been lost over evolutionary time. Dr. Arnold and his collaborators used pill-shaped metal capsules containing the sensors. Once swallowed, the capsules stay harmlessly in the animal\u2019s stomach as long as it lives, transmitting information about temperature, movement and heart rate. When the researchers looked at roughly two years of data from four reindeer, they saw interesting patterns.\u201cFrom our physiological data, it was clear from the first glance, the first analysis, that in body temperature there was clearly a diurnal rhythm,\u201d said Dr. Arnold. Further analysis showed rhythms in other measurements, too.When summer arrives, the reindeer\u2019s circadian cycles are weak, and perhaps easier to ignore. During that season, reindeer must stay awake at all hours to eat as much as possible.\u201cThey just don\u2019t listen to the clock anymore. They are shift workers during that time,\u201d said Dr. Arnold.Staying up late may be key to survival: If they slept more during the precious period when they are actually able to graze, they might not be able to make it through winter.The intense activity of summer, abetted by their peculiar clocks, is eventually replaced by a winter of striking somnolence. They do not hibernate, but they get very close.\u201cI would call them walking hibernators,\u201d said Dr. Arnold.The study\u2019s measurements show that in winter, the reindeers\u2019 metabolic rate is suppressed to just a third of its summer high \u2014 not a state that would lend itself to taking off from rooftops.Humans who ignore their clocks, far from thriving, have higher rates of some cancers, heart disease and other health problems. How do reindeer manage?\u201cWe have no idea how this works,\u201d said Dr. Arnold, noting that there are still many mysteries in the lifestyles of animals in the planet\u2019s most extreme habitats.Advertisement"}

And Who Gets to Decide?", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAustralia dispatchA small coastal town had a bitter fight over a monument, and in the end Aboriginal Australians saw their version of history told.ELLISTON, Australia \u2014 Jack Johncock, a local leader of the Wirangu people, pointed toward the spot near Waterloo Bay where a group of Aboriginal Australians were pushed to their deaths from rocky cliffs above a ferocious sea. \u201cMy body crawls just looking at it,\u201d Mr. Johncock said.He didn\u2019t want to get too close. The town of Elliston had been arguing for months about whether a few people or a few hundred had been killed. He wouldn\u2019t even be in Elliston at all if not for the presence of a new monument declaring that \u201ca number of Aboriginal Australians were killed near this site in May, 1849 by a party of settlers.\u201d What happened at the cliffs was a massacre, in Mr. Johncock\u2019s mind. And that\u2019s what the monument commemorated: \u201can incident referred to by the traditional owners of this land as \u2018The Massacre of Waterloo Bay.\u2019\u201d\u201cA lot of people didn\u2019t want to accept the truth,\u201d Mr. Johncock said.In a remote town of a few hundred people \u2014 mostly farmers, small business owners and itinerant surfers \u2014 the debate over the monument\u2019s message turned neighbors into enemies, shifted power in the local government and poisoned even the most routine interactions. At the local pub, signs announcing Elliston Council meetings about the memorial were torn down. Petitions created by a small group of residents opposing the use of the word \u201cmassacre\u201d on the monument led to shouting matches, combative Facebook posts, racist insults and tension that persists two months after the monument\u2019s opening ceremony. \u201cIt\u2019s war,\u201d said Kym Callaghan, who was the chairman of the Council when the monument vote was held. \u201cSome of these people just can\u2019t move forward.\u201d The vitriol and raw feelings reflect the grip Australia's past still holds on this country, which has yet to fully grapple with its often ugly colonial history, even as long-buried atrocities continue to resurface and Aboriginal Australians press for their version of events to be recognized.But the dispute caught many people in Elliston by surprise because the process to erect the monument had initially looked straightforward. 500 milesCoral SeaNORTHERNTERRITORYQUEENSLANDAUSTRALIASOUTHaustraliaNEW SOUTHWALESEllistonGreatAustralian BightSydneyVICTORIAB100south australiaEllistonB91Site ofmonumentWaterlooBay2 milesBy The New York TimesBy early last year, all the town needed to agree on were the words to be inscribed on the monument to describe what happened at Waterloo Bay.\u201cFor me, it wasn\u2019t a hard decision,\u201d said Mr. Callaghan, a retired sheep farmer whose roots in the area run deep. \u201cAs a little bloke, my nana and my mum told me the blacks were driven off the cliff for the murder of Hamp.\u201dJohn Hamp was a settler killed on a cattle station in June of 1848. The story Mr. Callaghan heard was that after Mr. Hamp\u2019s murder, there were a string of violent events around Elliston that culminated with the deaths off the cliff. But official histories and oral histories offered different details of precisely what happened. Finally, a settler\u2019s hut was robbed, causing cattle hands to chase a group of Aboriginal suspects to the cliffs of Waterloo Bay.At least two of the suspects were shot and killed there; a third died later, the official records say. But according to the research of Dr. Tim Haines, an anthropologist hired by Elliston to advise on the monument, there may well have been over 20 Aboriginal people killed. And Wirangu oral history puts the number of dead much higher, in the hundreds. The oral accounts also include harrowing details, absent from the written record.\u201cOur story is right,\u201d Mr. Johncock said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same one we\u2019ve been passing down for years.\u201dThese sorts of frontier conflicts played a major role in Australia\u2019s settlement.Most of the map\u2019s locations lack any monument or form of public recognition, which is why Elliston\u2019s monument resonates so powerfully among Australia\u2019s indigenous minority; it is one of the few places where their story has become the official narrative.The people in town who opposed relying on oral history argued that they were adhering to established facts. \u201cTo recognize this falsehood is erroneous and terribly wrong,\u201d she said, according to the reports. At the meeting, she circulated a petition opposing the monument\u2019s language. It ended up with around 60 names. A follow-up petition gathered no more than 85, officials said, in a district of 1,300 people. \u201cThis small group was just so scared of saying the word \u2018massacre,\u2019\u201d Mr. Callaghan said. The final vote in September of 2017 was 7 to 1 in favor of the monument as it now stands. On Nov. 6, Mr. Callaghan was re-elected to another term on the Council but was stripped of his position as chairman.At his farm, a sprawling patch of bush, Mr. Callaghan said he felt more hurt by the way some of his neighbors responded during the feud than by losing the chairmanship. And over the course of the monthslong debate, the issue became personal for him. He discovered that despite his searing blue eyes and light skin, his family has a measure of Aboriginal ancestry. He said his grandchildren, who look darker, have endured racist taunts at school.There have been benefits, too, from the whole, painful process. He and Mr. Johncock have become close friends. \u201cThere are a lot of people who learned something,\u201d said Ian Dudley, 38, a teacher at the local primary school. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a complicated history. It hasn\u2019t unfolded as some people want it to have unfolded.\u201d The monument sits on the edge of town, with a view of the cliffs. The sound of the loud, grinding surf, which defines this stretch of the South Australia coast, is constant. It is a solemn place, inviting silence. For the Wirangu and the other local Aboriginal clans, the mere existence of the monument brings peace. \u201cThe spirits will be at rest knowing this is taken care of,\u201d said Veda Betts\u2019 daughter, Sharon Betts, 47, an educator who works with local schools on Aboriginal issues. Her mother, sitting across the kitchen table, nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s progress,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we need for more of this to happen. Everywhere.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The thicker crust around a farmhouse pork terrine, served with a chill that brought out its Spammy qualities, is on its way to being cooked. The very, very thick football of crust encasing beef Wellington is cooked only on the surface; deep inside, where it meets the tenderloin, is a mass of wet, gluey dough.

And it\u2019s the one holiday that most assimilated Jews celebrate.Mr. Lukas is a novelist.It\u2019s the question that Jewish parents instinctively dread.A few months ago, I was sitting on the couch with my 3-year-old daughter, watching YouTube videos about animals in space, when out of nowhere she looked up at me and asked:\u201cDada, can we celebrate Christmas?\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t celebrate Christmas,\u201d I told her, putting on my serious voice. \u201cWe celebrate Hanukkah.\u201dLike generations of Jewish parents before me, I did my best to sell her on the relative merits of Hanukkah. True, Christmas might have those sparkly trees, ornaments and fruitcake. But we have latkes, jelly doughnuts and eight nights of presents.\u201cDo we have Santa?\u201d she asked, hopefully.\u201cNo,\u201d I said, and her face dropped. \u201cThey do.\u201dI tried to reiterate the part about the jelly doughnuts and the eight nights of presents. But she wasn\u2019t having any of it. I can\u2019t say I blame her. During the rest of the year, the Jewish holidays we celebrate are like special, bonus celebrations we get to have on top of everything else going on in the calendar.With Hanukkah and Christmas, however, it\u2019s a zero-sum game.[Discover the most compelling features, reporting and humor writing from The New York Times Opinion section, selected by our editors. Sign up for the Sunday Best newsletter.]Most of the year, it isn\u2019t hard for our family to feel both American and Jewish. But in December \u2014 when there are wreaths and Peppa Pig Christmas specials and inflatable Santas everywhere you look \u2014 that dual identity becomes more of a question. Which is why Hanukkah is a big deal for mostly assimilated Jews like myself.The only trouble is the actual holiday. Not the latkes and the dreidels, but the story of Hanukkah, which at its heart is an eight-night-long celebration of religious fundamentalism and violence.For most of the past 2000 years, Hanukkah was an afterthought on the Jewish calendar, a wintertime festival of lights during which people spun tops and ate greasy food to commemorate what has to be one of God\u2019s least impressive miracles \u2014 a small container of oil lasted for eight nights! More recently, as Jews have become assimilated into American society, the holiday has evolved into a kind of Semitic sidekick for Christmas, a minor festival pumped up into something it was never meant to be so that Jewish kids won\u2019t feel bad about not having a tree.This is the version of Hanukkah that I grew up with: presents and chocolate gelt; latkes with sour cream and applesauce; a few somber, off-key songs that no one fully remembered, about Judah Maccabee. This is the version of Hanukkah I had in mind when my daughter and I walked down to our local branch of the Oakland Public Library to check out a stack of books about the holiday. Most of the books we found presented a familiar narrative \u2014 dreidels and menorahs and pious Maccabees doing battle against their enemies \u2014 but between the lines, there were some hints at a darker story, enough to send me to Wikipedia and the Books of Maccabees on the (definitely not Jewish but very helpful) Bible Gateway website, which led me back to the library for another stack of books, this one for myself.According to most modern scholars \u2014 and a few rabbis I called on to help me out \u2014 the story of Hanukkah is based on a historical conflict between the Maccabees and the Hellenized Jews, the former being religious zealots who lived in the hills of Judea and practiced an ancient form of guerrilla warfare, the latter being mostly city-dwelling assimilationists who ate pork, didn\u2019t circumcise their male children and made the occasional sacrificial offering to pagan gods. Some of the details are up for debate, depending on which texts you consult. But everyone agrees that the Maccabees won out in the end and imposed their version of Judaism on the formerly Hellenized Jews. So Hanukkah, in essence, commemorates the triumph of fundamentalism over cosmopolitanism. Our assimilationist answer to Christmas is really a holiday about subjugating assimilated Jews.The more I thought about all this, the more it disturbed me. For what am I if not a Hellenized Jew? (O.K., an Americanized Jew, but what\u2019s the difference, really?) I eat pork every so often. Before having children, my wife and I agonized over the question of circumcision. And while I\u2019ve never offered burned sacrifices to Zeus, I do go to yoga occasionally. When it comes down to it, it\u2019s pretty clear that the Maccabees would have hated me. They would have hated me because I\u2019m assimilated and because I\u2019m the product of intermarriage. And while I can\u2019t say for certain what the Maccabees would have thought about my fondness for Bernie Sanders or my practice of Reconstructionist Judaism, I\u2019m pretty sure they wouldn\u2019t have liked those things either.Given all this, there\u2019s a part of me that wants to skip out on Hanukkah altogether. Why should I light candles and sing songs to celebrate a group of violent fundamentalists?The answer, frankly, is that it\u2019s not my choice. With my daughter ready to sign up for Team Santa, we have to celebrate something, and I\u2019m not quite Hellenized enough to get a Christmas tree.Michael David Lukas is the author of the novel \u201cThe Last Watchman of Old Cairo.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the historic enemy of the Maccabees, as commemorated in the Hanukkah story. The Maccabees fought the Seleucid Empire, not the Romans.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook, Twitter and YouTube Withheld Russia Data, Reports Say", "Date": "2018-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When lawmakers asked YouTube, a unit of Google, to provide information about Russian manipulation efforts, it did not disclose how many people watched the videos on its site that were created by Russian trolls.Facebook did not release the comments that its users made when they viewed Russian-generated content. And Twitter gave only scattered details about the Russian-controlled accounts that spread propaganda there.In the reports, Google, Twitter and Facebook (which also owns Instagram) were described by researchers as having \u201cevaded\u201d and \u201cmisrepresented\u201d themselves and the extent of Russian activity on their sites. The companies were also criticized for not turning over complete sets of data about Russian manipulation to the Senate.The data they did provide \u201clacked core components that would have provided a fuller and more actionable picture,\u201d said one of the reports, which was written by New Knowledge, a cybersecurity company, along with researchers at Columbia University and Canfield Research. The report added: \u201cRegrettably, it appears that the platforms may have misrepresented or evaded in some of their statements to Congress.\u201d\u201cEveryone wants to qualify the impact of the 2016 presidential election. They want to understand, did it swing the election?\u201d she said. \u201cNone of the data sets we were given gives us that answer.\u201dThe reports were especially critical of Google, whose YouTube site hosted 1,100 videos made by the Kremlin-backed Internet Research Agency. The reports said Google had not only provided incomplete information about these videos, but one report accused Kent Walker, the company\u2019s chief legal officer, of giving misleading testimony to Congress this year about whether those videos were targeted at a particular audience.When compared with Facebook and Twitter, \u201cGoogle\u2019s data contribution was by far the most limited in context and least comprehensive of the three,\u201d said one of the reports, by researchers at Oxford University and Graphika.Of the information that the companies did hand over, some came in formats that were difficult to analyze. Researchers said that in many cases, information was provided in duplicate and triplicate, or was incomplete or corrupted. That meant it took months just to catalog and clean up before it could be studied.In a statement, Nu Wexler, a Google spokesman, said, \u201cWe conducted an in-depth investigation across multiple product areas, and provided a detailed and thorough report to investigators.\u201d He added that neither YouTube nor Google allowed people to target an audience by race.Twitter said it was committed to transparency and had improved its work with researchers. \u201cOur singular focus is to improve the health of the public conversation on our platform,\u201d said Katie Rosborough, a spokeswoman.A spokesman for Facebook, Matt Steinfeld, said it \u201cprovided thousands of ads and pieces of content to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence for review and shared information with the public about what we found.\u201dOn Monday in Washington, lawmakers lashed out at the tech companies for hiding the ball.\u201cFor many months we urged the social media companies to undertake such a crosscutting analysis without success, even as we made as much of their data as public as possible,\u201d said Representative Adam Schiff, a Democrat from California. He said the companies\u2019 reluctance to look deeply at Russian interference \u201cmade our task far more difficult than it should have been.\u201dSenator Richard Burr, a Republican from North Carolina who is chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said, \u201cThese reports are proof positive that one of the most important things we can do is increase information-sharing between the social media companies who can identify disinformation campaigns and the third-party experts who can analyze them.\u201dSocial media companies have been under fire for helping spread Russian disinformation. Facebook, Google and Twitter all initially played down or denied the Russian activity on their platforms. But over time, it became clear that Russia had used them to try to influence American voters.All three companies have since acknowledged that the scope of Russian interference was broader than what they originally disclosed.The Senate Intelligence Committee first asked the companies to provide data on Russian manipulation in October 2017. In the year that followed, the committee repeated the request several times. Six months ago, after accumulating dribs and drabs of data from the tech companies, the committee gave the material to the independent researchers.The reports noted how the incomplete information had caused problems. Because Google did not provide any data on how many times Russian-created videos were watched or shared on YouTube, researchers were forced to search for the videos through alternative websites to re-create how widely the propaganda had been shared.Google\u2019s data from 2014 to 2018 was \u201cremarkably scarce,\u201d the report from researchers at Oxford and Graphika said.The top Facebook and Instagram accounts made by the Internet Research Agency ultimately gained hundreds of thousands of followers and generated millions of interactions. One Instagram account, @blackstagram_, published posts that were regularly liked by more than 10,000 people by 2017.Twitter provided the most extensive data, the researchers said, covering 2009 through 2018. That included account names and information that is not visible to other users, such as the internet protocol addresses, login dates and locations for 3,841 accounts, which produced more than eight million tweets. Four of the five most popular Russian-made Twitter accounts posted messages targeting African-Americans.\u201cTwitter provided a vast corpus of detailed account information on the Twitter accounts the company knew were managed by I.R.A. staff,\u201d the researchers wrote.Yet the Twitter data was also disorganized. The researchers said the company made it difficult for them to collect their own data through its site, and repeatedly failed to work with them to track Russian influence operations over the last two years.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "GoFundMe Campaign to Build Border Wall Raises Millions, Riles Migrant Advocates", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCrowdfunding donations have paid for medical and legal bills, wildfire losses and college tuition. Now, a GoFundMe campaign aims to finance one the most hotly debated issues in American politics: President Trump\u2019s long-promised border wall.\u201cAmericans are putting their money where their mouth is,\u201d the campaign\u2019s founder, Brian Kolfage, said in an interview Friday. \u201cThey\u2019re willing to put money down to show politicians this is what they want.\u201dMr. Kolfage \u2014 a triple amputee who served in Iraq and who ran a right-wing website that was eventually removed by Facebook \u2014 is hoping to raise even greater sums to cover construction of a barrier between the United States and Mexico. He suggested on the GoFundMe page that if the 63 million people who voted for Mr. Trump were to each donate $80, they would raise more than $5 billion, the amount Mr. Trump is seeking for the wall.\u201cAs a veteran who has given so much, 3 limbs, I feel deeply invested to this nation to ensure future generations have everything we have today,\u201d Mr. Kolfage, 37, wrote in the fund-raiser description. \u201cToo many Americans have been murdered by illegal aliens and too many illegals are taking advantage of the United States taxpayers with no means of ever contributing to our society.\u201dMr. Kolfage, a Purple Heart recipient who lives in Miramar Beach, Fla., wrote on the GoFundMe page that he began the drive out of frustration that Mr. Trump\u2019s signature campaign promise remained unfulfilled. \u201cIt\u2019s time we uphold our laws, and get this wall BUILT!,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s up to Americans to help out and pitch in to get this project rolling.\u201dIn a phone interview, Mr. Kolfage said the public outpouring of donations only underscored the exasperation felt by those who supported the wall project. \u201cAmericans are frustrated with the way things are going and politicians holding us all hostage,\u201d he said.Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Kolfage has focused his wrath on congressional Democrats, whom he blames for refusing to fund the project. \u201cThey\u2019d rather see President Trump fail, than see America succeed,\u201d he wrote on the fund-raiser page.Immigration advocacy groups condemned the GoFundMe campaign, calling it a misguided venture fueled by xenophobia.Mr. Kolfage dismissed the criticism, saying he simply opposes illegal immigration. \u201cJust go through the front door,\u201d he said. \u201cBring all these migrants in, verify them, vet them. I\u2019m all for it.\u201dMr. Kolfage assured donors that \u201c100% of your donations will go to the Trump Wall,\u201d and that his team had contacted the Trump administration about securing the funds. He also wrote that he was working with a law firm to draft a contract that would \u201cbind the government to using the funds for the border wall itself, nothing else.\u201dTo allay any doubts, Mr. Kolfage\u2019s campaign page cited the 2012 Washington Monument restoration project, which repaired earthquake damage to the 555-foot obelisk with $7.5 million allocated by the government and a matching donation made by a billionaire to the Trust for the National Mall, a nonprofit public-private partnership with the National Park Service. If the crowdfunding project fails to reach its goal, Mr. Kolfage promised to refund every donation. \u201cThis won\u2019t be easy, but it\u2019s our duty as citizens,\u201d he wrote.But it is not that simple. The Department of Homeland Security would not be able to accept the donations without congressional approval.\u201cCongress would still have to enact a statute permitting this,\u201d said David Bier, a policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. \u201cBut current law prohibits the administration from taking this money and spending it, and it also violates the law to accept donations that bind the hands of the administration.\u201dMr. Kolfage said in the interview that he had spoken to someone in the White House, but declined to identify the person. \u201cI think it\u2019s gone all the way up to President Trump,\u201d he said. He added that Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, had called him to say that the GoFundMe campaign had impacted Thursday\u2019s vote.The campaign\u2019s viral success may stem in part from Mr. Kolfage\u2019s national profile as a conservative political activist who ran a political website that was removed by Facebook in October, an action that drew the attention of Fox News.Advertisement"}

on delicacies from the old country like herring, caviar and jellied calf\u2019s foot, and toast in the New Year with vodka and bubbly.\u201cThis has no connection to religion,\u201d declared Mr. Kaminker, 39, who emigrated from Moldova in the mid-1990s, and was eager to avoid any misunderstandings that his shop was somehow linked to Christmas. \u201cYou won\u2019t find any Marias or crosses here,\u201d he added. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t allowed in the Soviet Union.\u201dNearly 30 years after the start of the great wave of immigration from the former Soviet Union, which began in 1989 and brought nearly a million Russian speakers to Israel by the end of the 1990s, the Novy God holiday has become something of a barometer to gauge the place of these immigrants in Israeli society.Back in Soviet days, Novy God was a particularly joyous night for many, being a purely secular holiday with no connection to the Communist Party.Yet some of those who brought Novy God traditions with them to Israel, like the evergreen yulka tree or Ded Moroz \u2014 Grandfather Frost, an often blue-coated Santa Claus \u2014 found themselves celebrating with curtains drawn, concerned that disapproving neighbors might think they were marking Christmas.The holiday and its symbols can still tap into underlying prejudices in the broader Israeli population about \u201cthe Russians,\u201d as immigrants from all former Soviet nations are referred to here.The immigration at the end of the last century included hundreds of thousands of newcomers who qualified for Israeli citizenship through family connections but are not considered legally Jewish under the strictly Orthodox interpretation of Jewish law.The pronounced secularity of many of the newcomers has led many immigrants to say they feel they are viewed suspiciously by other Israelis and constantly have to prove their Jewishness.So while the main point of Mr. Kaminker\u2019s pop-up store is to sell Novy God goods, he also wants to use it to help persuade his non-Russian and Orthodox Jewish neighbors to accept the holiday\u2019s traditions.\u201cWe need more awareness in Israel,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of people say a million Christians came here and that we tricked the state.\u201dAn annual obstacle to a wider embrace of the holiday are the Santas for hire who bring gifts to children.And this year has posed an extra hurdle for acceptance: There is a tradition of including the relevant animal from the Chinese zodiac in Novy God decorations, and 2019 happens to be the year of the pig \u2014 a reviled animal in Judaism whose meat is forbidden \u2014 meaning that this year\u2019s wares have included an abundance of ceramic pigs, cuddly pig toys and piggy banks.According to the Hebrew calendar, the Jewish New Year arrives in the fall, and the Jan. 1 date carries with it painful historical memories for some in Israel.The New Year\u2019s Eve that many secular Israelis celebrate at clubs and restaurants on Dec. 31 has long been referred to as \u201cSylvester,\u201d because it coincides with a traditional European feast day for a saint with that name who served as a pope in the 4th century and was considered anti-Semitic.For some Jews of Eastern European origin, the date connotes a time when local non-Jews would get drunk and carry out pogroms.\u201cThere were years when our people were slaughtered on such dates,\u201d said Nachman Zilber, 40, an ultra-Orthodox Jew, as he rushed past Mr. Kaminker\u2019s store.LEBANONSYRIAGOLANHEIGHTSMediterraneanSeaHaifaWESTBANKTel AvivJerusalemAshdodGAZASTRIPISRAELEGYPTJORDANBy The New York TimesAshdod, whose population of more than 200,000 is almost a quarter Russian-speaking, became the focus of disgruntlement with Novy God this year after the ultra-Orthodox deputy mayor, Avi Amsalem, objected to a spruce tree displayed beside a Hanukkah lamp at a city mall.Mr. Kaminker is not alone in his efforts to ease these tensions over the holiday and some of the fallacies associated with it.\u201cWe wanted to create a new Israeli tradition of Novy God where Russians open their homes,\u201d said Pola Barkan, 28, the director of the Cultural Brigade, who came as an infant with her family from Kiev.The Cultural Brigade, whose mission is to familiarize Israelis with the richness of Russian culture, was set up by young adults who had a common experience: They arrived with their families as children in a foreign country and found themselves living a cultural double life, speaking Russian at home while struggling to be accepted as Israelis.\u201cFirst,\u201d Ms. Barkan said, \u201cit was all about our integration into the country and forgetting where we came from.\u201dBut now Ms. Barkin says she wants Russian immigrants and their descendants to feel free to embrace their heritage and invite other Israelis to appreciate it.\u201cLet everyone decide what they want and have a choice, without feeling embarrassed,\u201d she said.Year by year, Novy God does appear to have become more widely accepted.A recent survey by the Jewish People Policy Institute, a Jerusalem-based research group, found that 38 percent of the general Jewish population in Israel did not know what Novy God was \u2014 meaning that more than 60 percent did.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu broadcast New Year\u2019s greetings in Russian last year. And the Jewish National Fund, known for planting forests, said it was distributing trees this year for Novy God.Newspapers have devoted food columns to traditional Novy God recipes, and a supermarket advertisement on Israeli public radio opens with a woman exclaiming, \u201cNovy God!\u201d over the steep discounts.At the Big Fashion Mall in Ashdod, the Novy God tree has turned into an attraction, with Russian speakers and Israelis whose families have been here for generations both snapping selfies by it.Many passers-by said there was more tolerance than there used to be, although not everyone was wholly comfortable with the festivities.\u201cIt\u2019s a free, democratic country,\u201d said Yehuda Crispin, 33, an observant Jew who was out shopping. \u201cIn history, there were pogroms against the Jews on that date, but in our days that\u2019s less relevant.\u201dAt another pop-up stall nearby, Alice Duke, 39, was buying a tiny tree for her daughter, Klil, 7, who was smitten by \u201cThe Christmas Chronicles\u201d movie and hoped that Santa would bring her presents.Ms. Duke noted that Klil was more likely to get presents from the prophet Elijah who, according to tradition, visits Jewish homes at Passover.Etty Ben-Dayan, 50, who was walking by, said that she was married to a Russian and that her husband and her older daughter went to his parents for the Novy God feast. \u201cMy daughter is not always so happy about it,\u201d she said. \u201cShe says it\u2019s not a Jewish holiday.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Sources at the Hudson Institute said that Kleptocracy Initiative would continue, but did not comment on the Blavatnik gift. (Disclosure: I am a visiting fellow at Hudson, but it is an honorary position, and I have neither received money from the institute nor performed work for it.)(Asked for comment, a Harvard spokeswoman said in a statement: \u201cHarvard Medical School is deeply grateful for the generous and transformational commitment from the Blavatnik Family Foundation that will support discovery at HMS propelling the school\u2019s mission to transform human health.\u201d She also referred me to someone who handles media relations for the foundation.)One of Mr. Blavatnik\u2019s early investments, United Trading Company, which he owned with Viktor Vekselberg, another oligarch also under American sanctions, brought him censure from the Russian government.Mr. Blavatnik\u2019s biggest deal involved selling his stake in the Russian oil company TNK-BP to Rosneft in March 2013; he and his partners, including Mr. Vekselberg, together made $27.7 billion. The deal was arranged at the top levels of the Russian government; since 2004, Rosneft has been run by a close ally of Mr. Putin, Igor Sechin, a former deputy prime minister. To be clear, Mr. Blavatnik is not accused of any crimes, in the United States or in Russia. But he is undoubtedly a Kremlin insider, someone who has made an enormous fortune trading on his political connections to a deeply corrupt circle of oligarchs and a criminal Russian state. Mr. Blavatnik is entitled to spend his money how he pleases. But institutions like the Hudson Institute and Harvard, which at least in principle stand for the ethical pursuit of knowledge, sully themselves by accepting it.Accepting gifts \u2014 especially naming gifts \u2014 from people with dubious sources of funds or close ties to despotic regimes encourages the view that dirty money can be cleansed by charity. What lessons does that teach Harvard students? And what message does it send to citizens of countries troubled by kleptocracy and corruption? I still remember that. I wonder if Harvard does.Ann Marlowe is a writer and consultant who specializes in investigating corruption.Advertisement"}

Two mouths slightly opened. And, sometimes, two hearts racing from a mixture of yearning and excitement.\u201cWhen you look at a found photograph, you\u2019re activating a story,\u201d Ms. Levine said, \u201cso when I started to notice how many pictures we had of people kissing in our archive, it seemed like a real jumping-off point for discussion, for examination.\u201dKissing is a common gesture. We see it in movies and on social media posts. But the act became something worthy of memorializing among everyday people just a little over a century ago, Ms. Levine and Ms. Ramey wrote with Peter L. Stein in the book\u2019s introductory essay. Photographs and postcards from the late 19th and early 20th centuries show an awkward and unnatural formality \u2014 despite the moment\u2019s intimacy \u2014 thanks to subjects \u201ckeeping stock-still for the duration of an exposure,\u201d they wrote. The accompanying text for many of the images reflects conservative sensibilities of the time: \u201cKeeping healthy,\u201d reads one postcard from 1911 of a man in a suit and white gloves planting one on a woman with her eyes slightly opened; another co-opts a lusty smooch to warn viewers of the perils of infidelity.The seemingly endless supply of photos in the archive enabled Ms. Levine and Ms. Ramey to pick out themes and to show changing mores surrounding kissing and romance over the years.\u201cYou watch our photographic literacy develop as the years go by, and there are different things in different eras that are interesting,\u201d Ms. Levine said, \u201cso it\u2019s an important part of story to try to tell that story through shifting ideas and trends.\u201dPhotographs of tender moments between same-sex couples became more common in their collection as the years passed by, including one of two women embracing the kitsch of the Kiss-O-Meter. Meanwhile, snapshots from the 1950s capture the rise of youthful rebellion: passionate yet candid make-out sessions, on picnic blankets with hair tossed and bodies intertwined, and near snowy banks during a nightly outing, with a young couple paying no attention to their friends\u2019 reactions.Kissing, as these photos show, doesn\u2019t always require baring one\u2019s soul. Interspersed between amorous moments are more dramatic and humorous demonstrations. Adults coax toddlers to imitate them, while giggling childhood friends peck one another\u2019s cheeks. And it\u2019s not unreasonable to ask whether it was a sense of devotion or a desire to perform for the camera that inspired a man to stretch his torso across the floor to reach his partner\u2019s lips.Since the majority of couples in the collection are anonymous, many of these images can also serve as ways for us to reflect on our own experiences of kissing. For some, a pair\u2019s steamy embrace on a loveseat may bring back memories of the exhilarating nervousness that gives way to ecstasy. Others, meanwhile, might feel uncomfortable about how they may have once looked as ridiculous as the man in swim trunks thrusting out his tongue as he goes in for a French kiss.\u201cYou start to put yourself in the photograph and wonder all these questions for which there\u2019s no answers,\u201d Ms. Levine said. \u201cYou\u2019re supplying all the answers.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.Pope Francis had grim tidings for predatory priests, in this life and the next. The words of the pope and the authorities \u2014 about justice, divine and human \u2014 should be of deep concern at two major gatherings that the Catholic Church hopes will initiate genuine change in an institution almost brought to ruin by cascading revelations of clerics\u2019 sexual abuse of minors, and systematic cover-ups by their bishops. That the law is finally catching up with this long trail of horror and impunity can only be welcomed, though it is shameful that it has taken this long.Alas, there\u2019s only so much the law can do. Many of the predatory priests have died, and the statutes of limitation on many others have expired. But at least the victims can receive long-denied recognition of their suffering, and perhaps seek compensation for the damage done to them.That alone will not resolve the crisis. The Church must confront the clerical culture that spawned the crisis before it destroys the Catholic Church. At risk is the faith of millions around the world and a great many schools, hospitals and charitable institutions founded and supported by the Church.In his address, Pope Francis harshly denounced abusive priests. \u201cThey perform abominable acts yet continue to exercise their ministry as if nothing had happened,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have no fear of God or his judgment, but only of being found out and unmasked.\u201dWith \u201ctheir boundless amiability, impeccable activity and angelic faces,\u201d he said, \u201cthey shamelessly conceal a vicious wolf ready to devour innocent souls.\u201d But he has also met regularly with victims. It was he who called on the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops to gather for the retreat, which will be held Jan. 2 to Jan. 8 at Mundelein Seminary, near Chicago. But can Pope Francis and his bishops investigate themselves and effect the change that is needed? That, after all, is at the heart of the problem the Pennsylvania grand jurors and Ms. Madigan discovered \u2014 that \u201cthe priority has always been in protecting priests and protecting church assets,\u201d as Ms. Madigan said.Now there is no place left for the bishops to hide. When they meet, they need to go beyond contrition and promises, and radically transform the secretive, privileged, all-male clerical culture that controls the Church and that allowed the abuse to proliferate and persist.

{"Headline": "Curbing Speech in the Name of Helping Israel", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Senate bill aims to punish those who boycott Israel over its settlement policy. There are better solutions. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.One of the more contentious issues involving Israel in recent years is now before Congress, testing America\u2019s bedrock principles of freedom of speech and political dissent.The aim is to cripple the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement known as B.D.S., which has gathered steam in recent years despite bitter opposition from the Israeli government and its supporters around the world.The proposal\u2019s chief sponsors, Senator Ben Cardin, a Maryland Democrat, and Senator Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican, want to attach it to the package of spending bills that Congress needs to pass before midnight Friday to keep the government fully funded. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a leading pro-Israel lobby group, strongly favors the measure. Critics of the legislation, including the American Civil Liberties Union and several Palestinian rights organizations, say the bill would violate the First Amendment and penalize political speech. The hard-line policies of Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, including expanding settlements and an obvious unwillingness to seriously pursue a peace solution that would allow Palestinians their own state, have provoked a backlash and are fueling the boycott movement. It\u2019s not just Israel\u2019s adversaries who find the movement appealing. Many devoted supporters of Israel, including many American Jews, oppose the occupation of the West Bank and refuse to buy products of the settlements in occupied territories. Their right to protest in this way must be vigorously defended.The same is true of Palestinians. They are criticized when they resort to violence, and rightly so. Should they be deprived of nonviolent economic protest as well? The United States frequently employs sanctions as a political tool, including against North Korea, Iran and Russia.But there are problems with their arguments, critics say. The existing law aimed to protect American companies from the Arab League boycott because it was coercive, requiring companies to boycott Israel as a condition of doing business with Arab League member states. A company\u2019s motivation for engaging in that boycott was economic \u2014 continued trade relations \u2014 not exercising free speech rights.By contrast, the Cardin-Portman legislation would extend the existing prohibition to cover boycotts against Israel and other countries friendly to the United States when the boycotts are called for by an international government organization, like the United Nations or the European Union.Neither of those organizations has called for a boycott, but supporters of Israel apparently fear that the Human Rights Council database is a step in that direction.Civil rights advocates, on the other hand, say that anyone who joins a boycott would be acting voluntarily \u2014 neither the United Nations nor the European Union has the authority to compel such action \u2014 and the decision would be an exercise of political expression in opposition to Israeli policies.But the American Civil Liberties Union says the First Amendment wording is nonbinding and \u201cleaves intact key provisions which would impose civil and criminal penalties on companies, small business owners, nonprofits and even people acting on their behalf who engage in or otherwise support certain political boycotts.\u201dIn a properly functioning Congress, a matter of such moment would be openly debated. Instead, Mr. Cardin and Mr. Portman are trying to tack the B.D.S. provision onto the lame-duck spending bill, meaning it could be enacted into law in the 11th-hour crush to keep the government fully open.Any anti-boycott legislation enacted by Congress is also likely to face a court challenge. It would be more constructive if political leaders would focus on the injustice and finding viable solutions to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict rather than reinforcing divisions between the two parties and promoting legislation that raises free speech concerns.Advertisement"}

I was an Army major, serving in a tank battalion that the Army had provided to the Marines to give them extra firepower. On the way to the rehearsal for a sweep-and-clear operation, General Mattis\u2019s ground convoy was ambushed, with at least one of the Marines on his personal protection detail seriously hurt. Generals usually took helicopters, but General Mattis wanted to see the terrain for himself, from a grunt\u2019s perspective, and the talk among the junior officers was of his personal courage in the battle with insurgents that followed the ambush.

The reputation Mr. Mattis earned for being the \u201cadult in the room\u201d angered the president, and his admirers knew that his days were numbered. I last saw Jim Mattis two weeks ago at the Army-Navy football game. He wasn\u2019t very interested in what was happening on the field, but spent a great deal of time talking to a group of wheelchair-bound veterans \u2014 inquiring about their injuries and their treatment, offering his card to those who needed assistance or who just wanted to visit him in the Pentagon. After he had spent significant time with each wounded veteran, he spent a few minutes reminiscing with me about our time together in Anbar Province. It was pretty clear that he would have preferred to be back there, fighting against insurgents and terrorists, rather than engaging in the Washington combat to which he had to return after the game. I thanked him for his continued service, as should we all. America will be less safe, and our enemies greatly heartened, by his departure.John A.

He should have joined the House at the start of the Reagan era, when his brand of genial, wonky conservatism had an ally in the president. Instead, he made it to the summit of the Republican Party when the rank-and-file turned on everything he claimed to stand for.Is there anybody out there you see replacing the imaginary principled-Paul Ryan shoes?I\u2019ll admit I\u2019ve got a soft spot for Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, because he\u2019s smart and sane and clearly detests Trump.

I see myself as loving husband and as a public servant \u2014 a scientist and educator who serves at the will of the public.\u201dDr. Tyson, 60, remains in his positions with the show and the planetarium. But the women\u2019s accounts show how more than a year after the #MeToo movement swept into the public consciousness, accusations continue to emerge about the behavior of powerful and high-profile men.In his nearly 1,600-word Facebook post, Dr. Tyson addressed each accusation, describing two as benign gestures and suggesting that the third had not occurred.The most recent came from Ashley Watson, who began as Dr. Tyson\u2019s assistant on \u201cCosmos\u201d in the spring. She said in an interview on Saturday that one day, he asked if she would like to come to his home to share a bottle of wine and \u201cunwind for a couple of hours.\u201d Thinking they were going to discuss extending her work on the show, she said, she agreed to come in for one glass.In his apartment, she said, he told her that \u201cas human beings, we all need release,\u201d and asked if there were any \u201creleases\u201d she needed. Shortly after, she said, she went to leave and he asked to show her what he called a Native American handshake, which involved clasping their hands together and finding the pulse on the other person\u2019s wrist, while looking into each other\u2019s eyes. She broke it off after about 10 seconds, and stood up to leave.As she was leaving, she said, he told her, \u201cI want you to know that I want to hug you so bad right now, but I know that if I do I\u2019ll just want more.\u201dThe next day, she said, as she was driving Dr. Tyson home from work, which was part of her job, he told her, \u201cYou say you want to be a producer, but it\u2019s always going to be an uphill battle for you because you\u2019re too distracting.\u201dThe next day, she told a supervisor what had happened, and that she had to quit. The supervisor, a line producer, asked Ms. Watson if she wanted to file a complaint, and she said no, she said. After that, the supervisor suggested she tell her co-workers that she was leaving because of a family emergency. She left the show.In his Facebook post, Dr. Tyson described the handshake as one he uses \u201cin appreciation of people with whom I\u2019ve developed new friendships.\u201d He said that at work, Ms. Watson freely offered hugs, which he typically rejected, but that on a few occasions, he \u201cclumsily declared, \u2018If I hug you I might just want more.\u2019\u201d\u201cMy intent was to express restrained but genuine affection,\u201d he wrote.He wrote that Ms. Watson had come into his office after the night in his apartment and told him she had been \u201ccreeped out.\u201d He said he had \u201capologized profusely\u201d and that she had accepted the apology.Another woman, Katelyn N. Allers, an associate professor of physics and astronomy at Bucknell University in Pennsylvania, told Patheos about meeting Dr. Tyson in 2009 at a party after a gathering of the American Astronomical Society. Dr. Allers has a tattoo of the solar system stretching from an arm to her collarbone. She said Dr. Tyson was \u201cobsessed\u201d with whether the tattoo included Pluto. \u201cHe looked for Pluto, and followed the tattoo into my dress,\u201d she told the website, describing it as \u201cuncomfortable and creepy.\u201dIn his post, Dr. Tyson noted that Pluto had been declared no longer a planet just three years earlier, \u201cso whether people include it or not in their tattoos is of great interest to me.\u201d He said he did not know until now that Dr. Allers had been uncomfortable. \u201cThat was never my intent and I\u2019m deeply sorry to have made her feel that way,\u201d he wrote.She filed a report with the Austin police in 2014, but according to the police report, her complaint was not investigated because Texas has a 10-year statute of limitation on sexual assault charges.In his post, Dr. Tyson said they had a brief relationship and had been \u201cintimate only a few times, all at her apartment, but the chemistry wasn\u2019t there.\u201d He questioned the timing of the accusation \u2014 many years later, \u201cas my visibility-level took another jump\u201d \u2014 and he brought up her statements that she could not recall much of the night.\u201cIt is as though a false memory had been implanted, which, because it never actually happened, had to be remembered as an evening she doesn\u2019t remember,\u201d he wrote.In an email, Dr. Tyson said he would not comment beyond what he wrote on Facebook. Following his post, Ms. Amet said they had never dated and that she was \u201cin shock.\u201d\u201cIf he is talking about me he is lying!\u201d she wrote in a text message. (Dr. Tyson did not name any of the women in his post.) Ms. Watson declined to comment on Dr. Tyson\u2019s post. Dr. Allers did not respond to a message seeking a response; she said earlier that she did not want to speak beyond what she told Patheos.Anne Canty, a spokeswoman for the Museum of Natural History, said on Saturday that the museum was \u201creviewing\u201d the recent allegations. \u201cThe museum is not aware of any other allegations and has received no complaints,\u201d she said.Fox and National Geographic said in a statement that they had \u201conly just become aware of the recent allegations regarding Neil deGrasse Tyson.\u201d\u201cWe take these matters very seriously and we are reviewing the recent reports,\u201d they said.

{"Headline": "Finding Harmony in Ribera del Duero", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWines of The TimesAfter gaining a reputation for oaky, exaggerated, powerful red wines, producers in this Spanish region are beginning to take a more balanced approach. In Ribera del Duero, the people traditionally drank clarete, a pink wine made by blending white and red grapes. A high percentage of those red grapes were tempranillo, or tinto fino, as it is known there. Other grapes were used as well, including garnacha and bobal among the reds and albillo among the whites.These wines are the modern face of Ribera del Duero. The wines received high praise from critics and found favor in the United States, where they often received top scores for their inky potency.If Rioja to the northeast, which also makes tempranillo-based reds, drew its inspiration from Bordeaux, Ribera del Duero, it was said, was more a Spanish version of the Napa Valley.It was a convenient formulation. But much has changed in wine in the last decade. Regions that were known for extracting as much ripeness, power and fruitiness as possible in making their red wines were pulling back in the direction of harmony. It has happened all over California, even in Napa Valley.What about Ribera del Duero? As one who prizes the qualities of restraint, balance and refreshing acidity, which were in short supply in Ribera del Duero, I have not often gravitated toward the region\u2019s wines. Yet I could not help but wonder whether this region, which had achieved such success with this particular style, had also evolved away from power toward more graceful, tense wines.Before the tasting, we debated briefly how to judge the wines. Was there such a thing as a typical wine from Ribera del Duero? Were we looking for wines that fit those characteristics, whatever they were?These wines did not represent the slow evolution of a region\u2019s character over generations, but rather were the products of conscious choices by their producers that coalesced into a dominant style. Ribera del Duero excels at producing wines in this mode, though the wines are more a product of international tastes than of regional traits.For me, harmony and balance are universal qualities that I want to see in fine wines, regardless of their styles. Ribera del Duero is typically hot and dry in summers, and so I would expect wines of ripe, muscular fruit flavors \u2014 sunnier versions of Rioja, so to speak.But, at high altitude, 2,500 feet above sea level, Ribera del Duero experiences big temperature swings between day and night. And many of the vineyards are on limestone. Theoretically, at least, this combination of altitude and soil can help to preserve acidity in the grapes, allowing the region to make wines that match ripeness with freshness, which gives them tension.\u201cSome are big and powerful \u2014 that is Ribera,\u201d Gabriela said. \u201cBut they can be balanced.\u201dThe best had spicy fruit flavors rather than the sweetness that might come from overripe grapes, and a sort of earthiness that one might infer was typical of warm-climate tempranillo.At $17, the Finca Torremilanos was our best value, though many wines could have filled that role, including our No. 3 bottle, the firm yet fresh 2016 Vi\u00f1a Solorca Barrica at $15, and our No. 7 bottle, the spicy 2016 Torremor\u00f3n at just $13.At No. 4 was an outlier, the 2017 Joven de Vi\u00f1as Viejas from Goyo Garc\u00eda, a wine made naturally, with minimal intervention, from old vines. If I were to choose one of these bottles to drink tonight, I would pick this juicy, pure, spicy and refreshing wine.In the fifth spot was the 2016 Mibal Joven from Hornillos Ballesteros, concentrated and rich, yet balanced and earthy, while No. 6 was the firm, resonant 2015 from Dominio del Soto.Also worth noting were the clear, pleasantly rustic 2015 Finca Villacreces, the heady and tannic 2016 Antidoto and the energetic yet oaky 2016 Roble from Valdrinal.Perhaps one reason we were impressed by our top 10 was that they were from the cheaper end of the spectrum, where long aging in barrels of new oak is often considered too costly. The three most expensive bottles in the tasting, all over $50, were rejected as either too oaky, too sweet tasting or simply too too.Nonetheless, we all took it as a good sign that we could find so many wines to like. It was an indication that the wines of Ribera del Duero are heading in a more exciting direction.Juicy, polished and medium-bodied, with fresh, expressive flavors of earthy minerals and sunny fruit. (Skurnik Wines, New York)Best ValuePure and harmonious, with firm tannins and fresh aromas and flavors of flowers and dark fruits. (Skurnik Wines)Firmly tannic, with fresh aromas and flavors of red and dark fruits. (Spanish Acquisition, Wilmington, Del.)Juicy, pure and refreshing on the palate, with rich, earthy aromas of spicy fruit. (Jos\u00e9 Pastor Selections/Llaurador Wines, Fairfax, Calif.)Concentrated, balanced, deep and rich, with earthy flavors of dark fruits and flowers. (Bonhomie Wine Imports, South Orange, N.J.)Young and firm, with resonant, lingering flavors of spicy dark fruits and menthol. (Sera Wine Imports, New York)Tannic yet balanced, with flavors of red and dark fruits and a not unpleasant earthy, metallic tang. (Ol\u00e9 Imports, New Rochelle, N.Y.)Pleasantly rustic tannins, with clear, pure flavors of red and dark fruits. (Eric Solomon/European Wine Cellars, Charlotte, N.C.)Quite tannic, with bold heady flavors of spicy dark fruit and notes of oak. (The Rare Wine Company, Brisbane, Calif.)Powerful, energetic flavors of ripe fruits, with plenty of oak. (Vintage Wines, Staten Island, N.Y.)Wintry weather and holiday parties call for celebratory food to share. In Ribera del Duero, the Spanish countryside north of Madrid, the weather can easily take on an Alpine chill. Game is popular there, so instead of the more typical beef, lamb, pork or poultry roasts, I opted for venison for this pairing recipe. The wines offered spice and fruit. I picked up on the spice with cumin and pepper for the venison and its sauce. But I avoided the usual tart-fruit component so the spices would have less competition, and I seared some shallots to go alongside. For venison, the rack is the easiest cut to prepare, and in a hot oven, it is quickly done. The meat is hearty and succulent, with just the faintest hint of gaminess. Be sure to cook it only to medium-rare or it will toughen. Unless you know a hunter, you\u2019ll need to buy ranch-raised American or New Zealand venison. It can carry a hefty price tag, and you do not want to be disappointed. FLORENCE FABRICANTAdvertisement"}

First Michael Avenatti drops out and now the former governor of Massachusetts. Who do the Democrats have left?Hehehe.Ballotpedia, the online political encyclopedia, is currently counting 55 \u201cpotential Democratic presidential candidates,\u201d most of them politicians or billionaires. (Or both \u2014 Good morning, Michael Bloomberg.)There are also 418 people who have already declared their intent to run to the Federal Election Commission. Unless you happen to live on the same block as one of them, you probably have never heard any of their names. This is a thing low-profile people do when they want to get attention in a virtuous, nonviolent way. And easier than decorating your Christmas lawn with 47 dancing reindeer.Avenatti became famous as Stormy Daniels\u2019s lawyer, a kind of high-end version of the reindeer-lawn strategy. He made campaign visits to Iowa and New Hampshire, which created quite a bit of buzz. Perhaps he lost interest when it became clear that while many people wanted to get a look at him, nobody actually wanted to vote for him.Patrick\u2019s farewell means that when it comes to presidential prospects, the state that gave us John Kennedy is pretty much down to two senators plus John (\u201cnot taking anything off the table\u201d) Kerry. Plus nine House members including Joe (\u201cI have no plans\u201d) Kennedy III.Look around the country \u2014 the possibilities are endless. There are 47 Democratic Senators, most of whom, I guarantee you, are at least daydreaming. And next year there will be at least 234 Democrats in the House of Representatives, all walking around looking available. If you run into one, try to avoid mentioning that we haven\u2019t elected a House member president since James Garfield.Governors are a much better bet. The Democrats have 16 right now beginning, alphabetically, with Jerry Brown of California. Brown is 80, but that\u2019s not necessarily a problem this year. The only limit on the age side seems to be a preference for politicians who would not pass 90 before the end of their first presidential term.Governors are attractive candidates, since they have that chief-executive look, and almost no one outside their state has had a chance to get sick of them. When you\u2019re dropping names over the holidays, just try saying \u201cI\u2019m looking hard at Steve Bullock of Montana.\u201d Everybody will nod and seem blankly impressed.I could imagine that working really well on Donald Trump.There\u2019s former Maryland governor Martin (\u201ckeeping an open heart and an open mind\u201d) O\u2019Malley. Perhaps you remember him as the guy who was supposed to be the inspiration for the sneaky mayor in \u201cThe Wire.\u201d Perhaps you remember him as the guy nobody can remember from the presidential debates in 2016. Anyhow, he\u2019s back.Senator Kamala Harris, a much-mentioned prospect, says \u201cover the holiday I will make that decision with my family.\u201d There\u2019s a lot of talk about figuring out whether to run for president over Christmas. It\u2019ll be lucky if anybody remembers to trim the tree. And come January 2, the race to the microphones will sound like an elk herd stampede.Meanwhile, Democratic officials are trying to figure out how you stage a debate with three or four dozen people.I think the least I can do is to let it be known right now that I am not a candidate for president. If nominated I will not run, if elected I will not serve. Well, maybe if elected. But no running.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Meet the Cookiers, Home Bakers With a Bond Stronger Than Royal Icing", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor a special breed of Americans, making and decorating cookies is a form of therapy and a tasty way to commune with others.HOLLADAY, Utah \u2014 Ten years ago, Georganne Bell was a lonely Army wife stationed in South Korea with two small children and an oven so small she couldn\u2019t fit a 9-by-11-inch cake pan into it.Baking cakes had always been her creative outlet, but without a decent oven all she could make were cookies. They quickly became her obsession. She found solace in cutting patterns from stiff dough, stirring color and water into powdered sugar, and rhythmically applying royal icing to the blank face of a sugar cookie.\u201cThere\u2019s something about the way the royal icing settles that is intensely calming,\u201d she said, in her home kitchen in this Salt Lake City suburb. \u201cYou can forget everything else for just a minute.\u201dCookies saved Katy Metoyer, too. The mother of two who started making them when her younger son went off to school six years ago. Then her father, her biggest champion and inspiration, died unexpectedly. For the next 10 months, Ms. Metoyer, 47, barely left her house in Hermosa Beach, Calif. Instead, she decorated what she guesses might have been 10,000 cookies. \u201cI would make 50 of them at a time and look at them, and then throw them away,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was my addiction, my therapy.\u201dWhat began as a way to feel better ended up making both women stars \u2014 at least among the tight, congenial subset of home bakers who refer to themselves as cookiers.There are tens of thousands of people across the United States who may identify themselves as cookiers, and even more if you include ambitious parents who attempt to customize sugar cookies as an inexpensive way to mark a child\u2019s birthday, and those who ponder cookie decorating only now, as Christmas nears.Most of the cookies have a crisp, slightly powdery texture, underscored by the crunch of dried royal icing. Certain cookiers \u2014 maybe 20 percent, by some estimates \u2014 advocate glaze or buttercream. But you can never get the surface as smooth with buttercream as you can by flooding a cookie with royal icing, and artistic expression is limited with glaze.For the real pros, it\u2019s all about pushing the limits of design with an arsenal of tools that can include food-coloring pens, edible silver, airbrush guns, fondant or wafer paper.Unlike those who design cookies to be preserved like art, Ms. Adams wants people to eat hers. She tinkers with citrus zest and flavor combinations in the dough and the icing. This time of year, she likes to mix orange and clove.\u201cIf it didn\u2019t taste good, I might as well be painting on a canvas,\u201d she said.American cookie decorating stretches back to colonial days, but there has never been a golden age like this one. Corporations looking to promote their brands are turning to logo-bearing cookies instead of pens and stress balls. One family ordered cookies bearing an image of their father\u2019s vintage Mustang for his funeral. \u201cWe call her the queen,\u201d Ms. Metoyer said. \u201cSeriously, I worshiped her when I started all of this.\u201dThe two have since become close friends and teaching companions. Ms. Metoyer runs a cookie shop in a former Chinese restaurant in Hermosa Beach she named Sugar Dayne after her oldest son. The people who kicked off the trend were, for the most part, D.I.Y. mothers who didn\u2019t work outside the home but had little interest in scrapbooking or other crafts.\u201cWe are weirdly extroverted introverts,\u201d Ms. Alvarado said. \u201cWe spend 95 percent of the time at home alone but chattering on social media.

He had sold 1,200 trees by the start of the week, and had just 250 left (though more were on the way, he promised).Finding trees to sell is a bit of a scramble, though, and has been for years.Because so many people lost their jobs, Mr. Gatanas said, he figured he\u2019d have fewer customers. He bought fewer trees, and tree sellers nationwide did likewise. Growers responded by planting fewer trees.Rinse and repeat a few times, and here we are.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t an environmental disaster,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was man-made.\u201dAs he has for years, he sells a three-foot \u201cCharlie Brown\u201d tree for $39.99.

{"Headline": "These 5 Numbers Explain Why the French Are in the Streets", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut it\u2019s not apparent that this single concession can clear the streets.The Yellow Vest movement \u2014 whose followers wear or display high-visibility vests used in emergencies \u2014 has morphed into a collective outcry over deeper problems that have plagued France for years: declining living standards and eroding purchasing power. Both of which have worsened in the aftermath of Europe\u2019s long-running financial crisis.Here are some numbers that explain why France has erupted.Many of the Yellow Vest demonstrators are protesting how difficult it is to pay rent, feed their families and simply scrape by as living costs \u2014 most notably fuel prices \u2014 keep rising while their household incomes barely budge.It wasn\u2019t always this way.Living standards and wages rose in France after World War II during a 30-year growth stretch known as \u201cLes Trente Glorieuses.\u201d Pay gains for low- and middle-income earners continued through the early 1980s, thanks to labor union collective bargaining agreements.The rich got richer, as top earners saw income gains of around 3 percent a year. Increasingly generous executive pay for very high earners has helped tip the scale.France is the third biggest economy in Europe after Britain and Germany, and the world\u2019s sixth largest before adjusting for inflation. Visitors to Paris can come away with the impression that the glitz of the French capital means the rest of the nation is just as well off.The quality of the recovery has been uneven. Large numbers of permanent jobs were wiped out, especially in rural and former industrial areas. And many of the new jobs being created are precarious temporary contracts.The growth slowdown makes it harder to resolve another French problem: the large numbers of people out of work.Unemployment in France has been stuck between 9 percent and 11 percent since 2009, when the debt crisis hit Europe. Joblessness has drifted back down to 9.1 percent today from 10.1 percent when Mr. Macron was elected. But it is still more than double the level in Germany.Mr. Macron promised to lower unemployment to 7 percent by the next presidential election in 2022, and has acknowledged that a failure to do so could fan the flames of populism.But to achieve that, the economy would have to grow by at least 1.7 percent in each of the next four years, which is by no means certain, according to the French Economic Observatory, an independent research group.Mr. Macron has tried to re-energize the French economy.As part of his plan to stimulate the economy, Mr. Macron cut taxes for France\u2019s wealthiest taxpayers during his first year in office, including by creating a flat tax for capital income.But the centerpiece of the tax package, and the one that has drawn the most ire from protesters, did away with a wealth tax that applied to many assets of France\u2019s richest households, replacing it with one that applied only to their real estate holdings.That lowered by \u20ac3.2 billion, or $3.6 billion, the amount of revenue the state received this year.Even before the Yellow Vests took to the streets, Mr. Macron realized that support was withering, and his government tried to pivot toward those left behind in the previous round of tax cuts.While polls show that the Yellow Vests have the backing of three-quarters of the population, questions have swirled about how much pain the protesters are really experiencing \u2014 or how much of the outpouring can be chalked up to a centuries-old culture of demonstrating against change.France protects citizens with one of the most generous social safety nets in the world, with over one-third of its economic output spent on welfare protection, more than any other country in Europe.In 2016, France spent around \u20ac715 billion on health care, family benefits and unemployment, among other support.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Cost of Telling a #MeToo Story in Australia", "Date": "2018-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Weiss is a writer and editor for the Opinion section.Yael Stone is scared.Most women who go public with #MeToo stories are fearful for obvious reasons. There is the pain of reliving traumatic experiences. There is the rage of not being believed. And there is sometimes the discomfort of admitting, as Ms. Stone readily does, that she didn\u2019t say \u201cno\u201d and at times even encouraged some of his behavior. She did so, she says, out of fear of offending a mentor and friend. She is worried that Australia\u2019s defamation laws will drag her into a legal and financial quagmire.Mr. Rush said in a statement that Ms. Stone\u2019s allegations \u201care incorrect and in some instances have been taken completely out of context.\u201d But, he added, \u201cclearly Yael has been upset on occasion by the spirited enthusiasm I generally bring to my work. I sincerely and deeply regret if I have caused her any distress. This, most certainly, has never been my intention.\u201dGeoffrey Rush responds to Yael Stone\u2019s allegations.The same power dynamics present in #MeToo stories, she said, \u201care reflected in a legal system that favors the person with a good deal more money and a good deal more influence and power.\u201dAustralia\u2019s defamation laws help explain why the #MeToo movement, while managing to take down some of the most powerful men in the entertainment and media industry in the United States, has not taken off there.But that financial support goes only so far. Crucially, if the actress is sued and loses, she will be personally responsible for the damages. That Ms. Stone is willing to take such a risk indicates how strongly she feels about the matter.\u201cI think the fact that she\u2019s speaking about this now is incredibly courageous,\u201d said Brenna Hobson, who was the general manager of the company that produced \u201cDiary of a Madman\u201d and has known Mr. Rush for more than two decades.An Australian filmmaker named Sophie Mathisen put it more bluntly: \u201cThe question in our current context is not, Do you want to come forward and speak on behalf of other women? The question is, Do you want to come forward and set yourself on fire publicly?\u201d\u201cWhat mattered to The Daily Telegraph here was their front page. She didn\u2019t matter,\u201d David Marr, a journalist for The Guardian, told me.\u201cI had the least power,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat was I supposed to do?\u201dYael Stone worshiped him. She said, \u201cHe has managed to draw a long bow between his training at Lecoq as a clown all the way through to understanding the internal workings of someone like David Helfgott, for which he won the Academy Award for \u2018Shine.\u2019\u201d Even now, she calls him a \u201cnational treasure.\u201d\u201cIt was the biggest break I had ever had,\u201d she said. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t a steppingstone. It was a leap across the river.\u201d It wasn\u2019t just the texts. There were, she says, \u201cstrange intimacies in the dressing room.\u201d Sometimes he would ask her to remove his contact lenses, say, or take off his sweaty costume at intermission. When she would sleep between matinee and evening performances in the cramped space underneath their makeup desks he would join her uninvited. Then there was the day he held a mirror above her shower. \u201cI certainly talked about it with Yael afterward. It was one instance of her feeling psychologically and physically intimidated by him,\u201d the person said.Ms. Stone herself does not remember screaming. Indeed, she laughed at the idea that she would have risked upsetting Mr. Rush in any way. \u201cI said some words to the effect of, \u2018Bugger off, Geoffrey.\u2019 I was walking a very delicate line where I needed to manage these uncomfortable moments but never, never offend him.\u201dMr. Armfield says he knew nothing of that particular incident, but wrote in a response to me, \u201cI was aware that Yael had felt some discomfort in sharing the dressing room with Geoffrey. I offered that Yael should move to another dressing room but my memory is that she declined.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t want him to think I was no fun, that I was one of those people who couldn\u2019t take a joke,\u201d Ms. Stone said. A person who witnessed the incident recalled, as Ms. Stone did, that it straddled a familiar line. \u201cIt was, I suppose, again that line between comical and obscene,\u201d the person said.When, later, at an awards show connected to the play Mr. Rush touched Ms. Stone\u2019s back \u201cin a very sensual manner\u201d that was \u201cunwanted and sustained\u201d \u2014 a significant enough violation that he wrote to her and apologized the next day, calling it \u201cuncalled-for but had to\u201d \u2014 she made nothing of it.In a year of Hollywood horror stories, Ms. Stone\u2019s experience does not rank among the worst. But it took its toll. \u201cMy level of anxiety was very high,\u201d she said. She told the man she was dating at the time that she was scared to go out with Mr. Rush after the show \u201cbecause I was nervous about what was expected of me.\u201dMs. Stone has been keeping a diary since she was 12, and her entries from the time confirm her memories. On Jan. 21, 2011, she wrote of a \u201cnew friend who fascinates and delights me (with equal parts revulsion and horror).\u201d By February, she had written, \u201cI\u2019ve never hated acting so much.\u201dBack when the case began, Ms. Stone said she \u201cswore I would never come forward. My intention was to keep it private.\u201dInstead of going public, Ms. Stone wrote the actor an email on December 11, 2017. Subject line: \u201cChallenging times.\u201d The email is self-aware and generous. \u201cI\u2019m sure that this moment is extremely challenging and my thoughts these last few weeks have come to you many times. I hope you are ok. I worry about you, about Jane and the kids,\u201d it begins, and then goes on to tell him that she was made uncomfortable by him during the play.\u201cIn the name of years of friendship I wanted to share with you what I have always been afraid to say,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI hope it\u2019s possible for you to receive this in the spirit that it is meant. With a view toward healing.\u201dShe never heard back.\u201cIf Geoffrey had written back and said I\u2019m sorry and offered to work with me to inspire positive change in our industry, it may have transformed both of our lives for the better,\u201d she said. \u201cI despair that I am now in this situation.\u201d And yet, Ms. Stone adds, \u201cI do believe it\u2019s a matter of significance to the public.\u201d\u201cI also understand it might be confusing and look strange that I maintained a friendship with someone for so long who treated me in a way that made me feel uncomfortable. But there is the reality of professional influence and the reality of a complicated friendship, which ultimately was corroded by a sexual dynamic. But it was still a friendship.\u201dAgain and again, she returned in our conversations to the themes of compassion and change.\u201cThe possibility of redemption must always be on the table,\u201d she said. \u201cNot all #MeToo stories are the same. Each dynamic is different. For some, a criminal process is essential. In my case, I\u2019m not interested in punishment. I am looking to change my industry and to work toward healing and growth.\u201dSome things are straightforward. \u201cI\u2019ve been in that particular dressing room in Sydney on many occasions with many wonderfully talented actors and many wonderfully talented clowns,\u201d Ms. Stone told me. \u201cAnd people have made me belly laugh till I couldn\u2019t breathe.

{"Headline": "Survival of the Sneakiest", "Date": "2018-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStealth can win out over speed and strength in the arms race of evolution.Dr. Barash studies the evolutionary factors influencing human behavior.\u201cThe race is not to the swift,\u201d we learn from Ecclesiastes, \u201cnor the battle to the strong.\u201d But as Damon Runyan once wrote, that\u2019s the way to bet. One of my students at the University of Washington, where I taught animal behavior and evolutionary biology, once asked me if the Bible was inconsistent with evolution by natural selection, since \u2014 as she understood it \u2014 the biological race is indeed won by the swift and battles by the strong. She was surprised by my response.But as I explained to my student, even in the supposed world of \u201cnature red in tooth and claw,\u201d the fiercest don\u2019t always win. This is especially true because \u201cwinning\u201d in evolutionary terms has very little to do with being victorious mano a mano, and everything to do with being successful in getting one\u2019s genes projected into the future. (More precisely, winning genes are those that manage to promote identical copies of themselves in succeeding generations.)Examples are legion. Among those highly aggressive bull elk, some individuals spend so much time and energy displaying and fighting that unassuming and unaggressive bulls sometimes sneak into the harem and mate with females while the ostensible lord and master is preoccupied with maintaining his dominion by clashing antlers with his more obvious competitors.Ornithologists have even coined the phrase \u201caggressive neglect,\u201d referring to the observation that some male birds are so busy defending their territories against interlopers that they neglect their paternal duties to provision their young, who end up undernourished and sometimes dead. Not a good evolutionary outcome for the pushy, ostensible \u201cwinners.\u201dThe biological world also offers a panoply of cases in which a seemingly winning tactic \u2014 often involving high levels of aggression \u2014 is paradoxically undone by its own success, resulting in a balance between the assertive and the downright meek. Among pumpkinseed sunfish, for example, some males are relatively large and heavily pigmented; they vigorously and conspicuously defend territories in which they mate with females. One might think that selection would strongly reward effective territorial defense, so that males would be as large and imposing as their ecological niche permits. But when the sunfish population consists of mostly strong, aggressive, highly pigmented and assertive males, the opportunity arises for males of a very different sort to enter the picture. These individuals \u2014 though fully male, in that they produce sperm \u2014 are female mimics. The territorial males welcome them into their aquatic boudoirs, whereupon immediately after a real female deposits her eggs, the female mimics release their sperm, and then skedaddle.The traditional large males are readily fooled so long as the mimics are rare, but as more mimics succeed, the big fish become less abundant and the mimics more plentiful. Then the dynamic turns. Those traditional males become increasingly aware of the presence of mimics and keep them away, whereupon the number of those assertive males rises once again. At equilibrium, the evolutionary race is not only to the big and aggressive, but also to a certain number of the small and sneaky. But even though it isn\u2019t clear that the meek (whether animals or people) will inherit the earth, it is worth noting that our modern understanding of animal behavior and evolution is at least compatible with the other side of Scripture: urging the legitimacy of a kinder, gentler perspective on how best to live.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "CBS Paid the Actress Eliza Dushku $9.5 Million to Settle Harassment Claims", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn March 2017, Eliza Dushku, an actress known for her work on \u201cBuffy the Vampire Slayer,\u201d signed on to play a major role in three episodes of the CBS prime-time drama \u201cBull,\u201d and there were plans to make her a full-time cast member.Her time on the set began promisingly. The show\u2019s star, Michael Weatherly \u2014 a mainstay of CBS\u2019s prime-time lineup for 15 years \u2014 seemed friendly. And a producer and writer on \u201cBull,\u201d Glenn Gordon Caron, told Ms. Dushku she would be more than a love interest.Then came a series of comments that made Ms. Dushku uncomfortable. In front of the cast and crew, Mr. Weatherly remarked on her appearance, and made a rape joke and a comment about a threesome. Shortly after Ms. Dushku confronted the star about his behavior, she was written off the show. She believed her time on \u201cBull\u201d came to a sudden end as a result of retaliation.After she went through mediation with CBS, the company agreed to a confidential settlement that would pay her $9.5 million, roughly the equivalent of what Ms. Dushku would have earned if she had stayed on as a cast member for four seasons.Details of Ms. Dushku\u2019s experiences on \u201cBull\u201d and the confidential settlement she reached with the company emerged during the course of an investigation that began in August, when the CBS Corporation board hired the law firms Covington & Burling and Debevoise & Plimpton to examine accusations of sexual misconduct made by multiple women against Leslie Moonves, the company\u2019s former chief executive. The board also instructed the outside lawyers to investigate \u201ccultural issues at all levels of CBS.\u201dIn a draft of the investigation report, which was reviewed by The New York Times, the lawyers said the company\u2019s handling of Ms. Dushku\u2019s complaints was not only misguided, but emblematic of larger problems at CBS. When faced with instances of wrongdoing, the company had a tendency to protect itself, at the expense of victims, the investigators wrote.Ms. Dushku declined to comment for this article. In a statement on Wednesday, CBS confirmed the settlement and pledged to improve working conditions.\u201cThe allegations in Ms. Dushku\u2019s claims are an example that, while we remain committed to a culture defined by a safe, inclusive and respectful workplace, our work is far from done,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe settlement of these claims reflects the projected amount that Ms. Dushku would have received for the balance of her contract as a series regular, and was determined in a mutually agreed upon mediation process at the time.\u201dIn an emailed statement to The Times, Mr. Weatherly apologized for his behavior with Ms. Dushku.\u201cDuring the course of taping our show, I made some jokes mocking some lines in the script,\u201d Mr. Weatherly said in the statement. \u201cWhen Eliza told me that she wasn\u2019t comfortable with my language and attempt at humor, I was mortified to have offended her and immediately apologized. After reflecting on this further, I better understand that what I said was both not funny and not appropriate and I am sorry and regret the pain this caused Eliza.\u201d\u201cBull,\u201d an hourlong procedural series that premiered in September 2016, is the 10th most-watched entertainment program on network television. The main character is loosely based on Dr. Phil McGraw, who worked as a trial consultant before he became a popular talk-show host.Dr. McGraw is one of the producers of \u201cBull,\u201d as is Mr. Caron, who created the prime-time hit \u201cMoonlighting.\u201d Shot mainly in New York, \u201cBull\u201d is produced in association with Steven Spielberg\u2019s Amblin Television.Mr. Weatherly, 50, was a star of the network\u2019s most popular drama, \u201cNCIS,\u201d for 13 seasons before CBS gave him \u201cBull.\u201d The character he plays, Dr. Jason Bull, is a self-assured trial consultant. He is also a flirt.CBS emphasized the character\u2019s roguish side when it marketed the show in the summer of 2016. Billboards showed a close-up of Mr. Weatherly\u2019s face behind a double entendre in huge red letters: \u201cHe\u2019ll Get You Off.\u201dWhen Ms. Dushku signed on with \u201cBull\u201d at $35,000 per episode \u2014 a figure that would have increased significantly, if she had continued on the show \u2014 there were \u201cwell developed plans\u201d to have her become a regular cast member, according to the draft of the investigators\u2019 report.The investigation\u2019s findings show how Ms. Dushku sought to address conduct she found demeaning, why she believed she faced retaliation and how a top CBS lawyer tried to undermine her claims with what investigators described as an \u201cantiquated\u201d view of how a woman should comport herself in the workplace.On \u201cBull,\u201d Ms. Dushku played J.P. Nunnelly, a criminal defense lawyer. Although she would have a running flirtation with Mr. Weatherly\u2019s character, Mr. Caron, the producer, said that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t want intimacy\u201d until the show\u2019s fifth season, according to notes taken by a participant in an interview Ms. Dushku gave investigators in September.But it wasn\u2019t long before Mr. Weatherly started making comments that left her feeling uncomfortable. \u201cHere comes legs,\u201d he said on a day when Ms. Dushku was wearing a suit, according to the interview notes. On another occasion, Ms. Dushku told investigators, he said in front of the cast and crew that he would bend her over his leg and spank her.In an interview, Mr. Weatherly said the remark about spanking was meant as a joke. \u201cI ad-libbed a joke, a classic Cary Grant line from \u2018Charade\u2019 or \u2018Philadelphia Story,\u2019 and that meant not at all that that was an action I wanted to take,\u201d he said.Ms. Dushku also described to investigators a time on the set when, in character, she made a gesture with three fingers. In response, she said, Mr. Weatherly suggested \u2014 to laughs from the crew \u2014 that she wanted to have a threesome with him and another male cast member.Because of his status on the show, his behavior was contagious, in Ms. Dushku\u2019s view. She told investigators that a crew member approached her at one point and said with a chuckle, \u201cI\u2019m with Bull,\u201d before suggesting that he, too, wanted to take part in a threesome with her.The exchange left Ms. Dushku feeling \u201cdisgusting and violated,\u201d according to the interview notes.Mr. Weatherly said that when he mentioned a threesome, it was not to suggest Ms. Dushku take part in a threesome with him and another cast member. \u201cWhile we\u2019re shooting, in the context of the scene, she held up three fingers, suggesting something,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I ad-libbed, \u2018Threesome?\u2019\u201dThen came the shooting of a scene involving a windowless van. With the cameras rolling, in front of the cast and crew, Mr. Weatherly said he would take Ms. Dushku to his \u201crape van,\u201d which, he added, was filled with phallic objects and lubricant, according to the interview notes.Mr. Weatherly said the \u201crape van\u201d line was an attempted joke that misfired. \u201cThe scripted line in that scene was, \u2018Hey, young lady, step into my windowless van,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t particularly like that line, so I joked, in order to highlight how distasteful the emphasis of the line was, about an \u2018r. van,\u2019 a rape van. Which, in retrospect, was not a good idea.\u201dMs. Dushku shared her concerns with Mr. Caron, who seemed receptive, according to the interview notes, and they agreed that she would approach Mr. Weatherly.She began by telling Mr. Weatherly that \u201ceveryone loves\u201d him on the set and followed his lead. She pointed out that after he made the threesome comment, a crew member said something similar to her, according to the interview notes. Mr. Weatherly asked Ms. Dushku who had made the remark and why she did not report it. As Ms. Dushku later told the lawyers, she did not have the sense that there was a \u201csafe person you could go to\u201d with that kind of complaint.After the talk, Mr. Weatherly sent a text to David Stapf, the president of CBS Television Studios, saying that he wanted to talk about Ms. Dushku\u2019s sense of humor. Mr. Stapf replied that Ms. Dushku made the show better, according to the interview notes.Around the same time, Ms. Dushku expressed the worry to her representatives that Mr. Weatherly might go to CBS and get her fired.That is effectively what happened. Within days of confronting Mr. Weatherly, Ms. Dushku was written off the show. The plan to make her part of the cast was over. By way of explanation, Mr. Caron told her that he \u201cdidn\u2019t know how to write\u201d her into the show anymore, according to the interview notes.Mr. Weatherly denied pushing for Ms. Dushku\u2019s removal. \u201cIt\u2019s my recollection that I didn\u2019t tell anyone how they should do their job regarding the hiring or firing of anybody,\u201d he said.Mr. Caron, who joined \u201cBull\u201d in 2017 and later became its showrunner, said the decision to end Ms. Dushku\u2019s run had nothing to do with her experiences on the set. \u201cThe idea that our not exercising her option to join the series was in any way punitive just couldn\u2019t be further from the truth,\u201d he said in a statement.On one of her final days on \u201cBull,\u201d Mr. Weatherly insisted that she stay for a champagne toast celebrating the wrap of another season. Ms. Dushku thought that was odd, because she would not be returning and had been open about the fact that she did not drink.During the toast, Mr. Weatherly said he needed a \u201creally beautiful woman\u201d to grab a ticket for a raffle. \u201cEliza,\u201d he said in front of everyone, according to the interview notes, \u201cwe need you, the most beautiful woman, to come grab the raffle ticket.\u201dMs. Dushku, in her final moments as part of the \u201cBull\u201d sphere, played along, although she felt \u201cembarrassed and humiliated.\u201dMs. Dushku told investigators that she relayed her experiences on \u201cBull\u201d to Leslee Feldman, an executive at Amblin. \u201cIf Steven ever knew about this, he would be so horrified,\u201d Ms. Feldman said, referring to Mr. Spielberg, the chief executive of Amblin Partners, according to what Ms. Dushku said during the interview. Amblin declined to comment.After considering a lawsuit, Ms. Dushku entered into mediation with CBS. Mark Engstrom, the chief compliance officer at CBS, participated, along with Bettina B. Plevan, a partner at the law firm Proskauer Rose, who was serving as outside counsel for the company.Mr. Engstrom handed over outtakes from \u201cBull\u201d in the belief that they would help the company\u2019s cause, because they showed Ms. Dushku cursing on the set, investigators wrote in the draft of their report.The strategy backfired. The outtakes were a \u201cgold mine\u201d for Ms. Dushku, the lawyers wrote, because they \u201cactually captured some of the harassment on film.\u201dAlthough the investigators praised Mr. Engstrom for his \u201ctremendous institutional knowledge\u201d and described him as a \u201csmart and very capable lawyer,\u201d they said the company\u2019s failure to recognize the instances of harassment caught on tape was a symptom of larger problems at CBS, according to the draft of their report. Mr. Engstrom declined to comment.Mr. Weatherly, Mr. Caron and Amblin Television were parties to the settlement agreement, which prohibited Ms. Dushku from discussing her experiences on the show in exchange for the $9.5 million payment.A history of misbehavior and sexual harassment on the part of prominent men at CBS has come to light in the last 13 months. In addition to forcing the departure of Mr. Moonves, CBS has fired two other well-known figures: Charlie Rose, a co-anchor of \u201cCBS This Morning,\u201d who was accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women; and Jeff Fager, the longtime executive producer of \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d after he sent a threatening text message to a CBS reporter looking into allegations that he had engaged in sexually inappropriate workplace behavior.Eight months after the settlement, when Ms. Dushku sat for the interview with the lawyers investigating CBS, she said she welcomed the chance to speak her piece. \u201cYou\u2019re all I have at this point,\u201d she told them. \u201cMy story is true and it\u2019s really affected me, and I can\u2019t talk about it.\u201dSusan C.

{"Headline": "Did This Health Care Policy Do Harm?", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA well-intentioned program created by the Affordable Care Act may have led to patient deaths.The authors are cardiologists and health policy researchers.But a deeper look at the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program reveals a few troubling trends. First, since the policy has been in place, patients returning to a hospital are more likely to be cared for in emergency rooms and observation units. This has raised concern that some hospitals may be avoiding readmissions, even for patients who would benefit most from inpatient care. Finally, and most concerning, there is growing evidence that while readmission rates are falling, death rates may be rising.The study, published in The Journal of the American Medical Association, found that although post-discharge deaths for patients with heart failure were increasing in the years before the program, the trend accelerated after the program was established. Death rates following a pneumonia hospitalization were stable before the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program, but increased after the program began. In the long term, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services should conduct an investigation into the patterns we and others report. All possibilities should be considered, from coding changes to inappropriately turning patients away from the emergency room to changes in risk factors among Medicare patients. The agency must also engage physicians and patients to understand how this program has influenced \u201con the ground\u201d care.Eight years after the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program was created, we remain uncertain about whether it has had unintentionally deadly consequences. That should be a bracing reminder that before we are seduced by promising but untried ideas, we need to first demand robust evidence that they will not harm patients. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Caste Underpins the Blasphemy Crisis in Pakistan", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCaste discrimination against Christians, whose ancestors were lower-caste Hindus, persists in the country. Mr. Devji teaches history at Oxford University.On June 14, 2009, Asia Bibi, a poor Christian woman, was picking fruit in the field of Itan Wali village in Pakistan, about 30 miles from the city of Lahore. On the landowner\u2019s order, Bibi fetched drinking water for her co-workers, but three Muslim women among them accused her of contaminating the water by touching the bowl. An argument followed.Later, the Muslim women accused Bibi of making blasphemous statements against the Prophet Muhammad \u2014 a charge punishable by death under Pakistani law. Despite little evidence, Bibi spent nine years in prison \u2014 eight in solitary confinement on death row \u2014 till she was finally acquitted by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in late October.Pakistan\u2019s religious right has violently protested her acquittal and Bibi is being held in an undisclosed location to keep her safe. The initial accusation against her was not about religion but caste. Her handling of a drinking vessel was seen to pollute the water inside because she belonged to an \u201cuntouchable\u201d Hindu caste that had converted to Christianity.When Pakistan was created after the partition of colonial India, upper-caste Hindus and Sikhs fled or were forced to leave for India, leaving their poorer and less mobile lower-caste coreligionists behind.In the southern province of Sindh, some upper-caste landowners stayed, while low-caste Hindus took the religion, its temples and practices into their hands in a startling departure from Hindu tradition that has no Indian counterpart. In Punjab Province, former \u201cuntouchables\u201d accelerated their conversion to Christianity, taking given names common among their Muslim neighbors while replacing the caste surnames with appellations like \u201cMasih,\u201d the Urdu word for Jesus in his role as Messiah.Discrimination and ethnic cleansing reduced the population of non-Muslims in Pakistan from about 30 percent at its creation in 1947 to less than 5 percent now. Yet the nearly absolute majority of Muslims in the country has not reduced religious conflict, but rather displaced, increased and internalized it among Muslims.The debate about blasphemy is also tied to cultural issues assuming unprecedented importance with the emergence of a technologically mediated global arena after the Cold War. But such protests and violence over depictions of Islam\u2019s prophet began during the middle of the 19th century in colonial India, where they had to do with urban politics and competition in newly capitalist societies.When controversies over insults to the Prophet Muhammad first arose in colonial India, the cases arising from them were dealt with under the Indian Penal Code written by the British politician Thomas Babington Macaulay, who criminalized the injury of religious and other sentiments in secular rather than theological terms by treating it the same way as defamation, libel and other such offenses.In post-colonial India and Pakistan, religious offense among Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs and Christians continues to deploy the secular language of hurt sentiments rather than the theological category of blasphemy. In Pakistan, Lord Macaulay\u2019s equal-opportunity conception of injury was done away with, and insulting the Prophet Muhammad was made into a specific crime above all others.But the accusations of blasphemy are also related to anxieties about the Muslim prophet\u2019s vulnerability to insult, which have emerged from profound shifts in the life of Muslim societies. These include efforts by Muslims to create a \u201cmodern\u201d Islam by ridding it of \u201csuperstitions\u201d like attributing superhuman powers to the prophet. But by becoming more human, Muhammad has also become more vulnerable to insult, and as a result requires the protection of his followers in an ironically secular way.Familiar across the subcontinent, such playacting involves practices such as caste restrictions, forcible conversion and other, more grotesque forms of bodily violence in which a community takes on the role it attributes to its enemies.Implying a relationship of perverse intimacy with one\u2019s foes, this impersonation also distances perpetrators from their own brutality by turning it into a piece of theater. In all cases it involves the impossible and infinite desire for vengeance against an enemy who has vanished in time, like India\u2019s Muslim invaders of a thousand years ago, or in space, like the Hindus and Sikhs who left Pakistan.In Pakistan, both the discrimination of caste and the history of religious difference are officially proscribed and forgotten. But for this very reason they continue to haunt the present in disavowed ways that include the charge of blasphemy against Ms. Bibi. In this sense, the passionate defense of their prophet represents a kind of traumatic memory, one that only allows Muslims to obscure a reality that remains unrecognized and therefore unresolved.Faisal Devji is a professor of Indian history at the University of Oxford.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "America\u2019s Most Hazardous Volcano Erupted This Year. Then It Erupted and Erupted.", "Date": "2018-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA landmark study unspools a timeline of the most destructive eruption in recorded history of Hawaii\u2019s Kilauea volcano.The collapse in April of the Pu\u2018u \u2018O\u2018o crater, located in the east rift zone, may have coincided with the breakdown of a subterranean barrier. That could have allowed magma at the site to flow through an established pathway toward the lower east rift zone.By May 10, the lava lake within Halema\u2019uma\u2019u had dropped to around 1,070 feet below the crater floor as the magma below continuously migrated to the rift zone. As the underlying magmatic foundations of the summit disappeared, the entire crater floor began to subside in what would amount to 62 separate collapse events.Major summit explosions were recorded on May 15 and 17. The largest since 1924, they produced plumes 12,000 and 30,000 feet high. This activity was once thought to be driven by groundwater angrily reacting with draining magma. But Ms. Neal said that new data suggests that escaping magmatic gas drove the explosions.By the beginning of June, twenty-four fissures had appeared in the rift zone, with rivers of lava flowing \u2014 some all the way to the ocean \u2014 as fast as 3,530 cubic feet per second. More than 55,000 tons of sulfur dioxide emissions were emerging each day.By the time the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park reopened on Sept. 22, Kilauea\u2019s lava covered 13.7 square miles of the island, and there had been 1,640 feet of vertical collapse at the summit.Dr. Anderson said at a news conference this past Tuesday that this meant the summit and lower east rift zone were clearly interlinked in a devilish dance.Magma still exists beneath the summit and rift zone. This means that a future eruption of some kind somewhere on Kilauea is a certainty. Whenever that occurs, scientists and disaster managers will rely on the insights gained from their close study of how the 2018 eruption unfolded to guide their response.Advertisement"}

The boomerang effect, in which people become even more entrenched in false beliefs when presented with facts, can also occur when medical misconceptions are challenged. To convince my patient that a statin was in her best interests, not only did I provide her the clinical rationale, but I also shared a personal story: After my dad had a heart attack, I urged his doctors to immediately start a statin at the highest dose. I told her that while a statin couldn\u2019t guarantee that he wouldn\u2019t have another heart attack, I wanted my dad to get his best shot at a healthy life.

{"Headline": "Fashion\u2019s Year in Cultural Don\u2019ts", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnbuttonedWhy do companies keep making such offensive, and dumb, mistakes with their products? And can we stop it from happening next year?Instead of getting better, it seems as if the offenses are getting worse. Just consider the fact that the year began with a monkey problem and ended with a blackface brouhaha. (Not the Megyn Kelly one.)I kid you not.Then, last week, Prada was pilloried for its decision to include in its Pradamalia collection, a menagerie of quirky bag charms that look like cartoony sci-fi animals, one that resembled nothing so much as a Little Black Sambo figure, complete with giant puffy red lips \u2014 and to fill the windows of its SoHo store with said imagery. A lawyer, Chinyere Ezie, who works at the Center for Constitutional Rights, was \u201cstopped in her tracks\u201d while walking by the store, snapped some pictures and called the company out on Twitter and Facebook.Her posts went viral, and in a day the store windows were shuttered, the products were gone, and Prada had apologized. It later promised to donate proceeds from the charms to \u201ca New York-based organization committed to fighting for racial justice\u201d and announced it would set up an \u201cAdvisory Council to guide our efforts on diversity, inclusion and culture.\u201dStill, it was impossible not to scratch your head and think: When will these brands ever learn? Apparently, not soon enough.But even by those standards, 2018 has been particularly bad. After all, between H&M and Prada, there were many other examples of seeming blindness to the implications, and origin, of a brand\u2019s design choices. Some were worse than others, but regarded from the vantage point of the year end, the critical mass is striking.There was, for example, the Zara checked skirt, a gathered number that look awfully like an Indian lungi, or sarong, that had people speaking out about the bad manners of filching an old look for a \u201cnew\u201d product.There were the turbans on the runway at the Gucci fall 2018 show, which, in their resemblance to Sikh turbans, upset many viewers, who felt the importance of the head wrap as a sign of a belief system had been thoughtlessly pilloried for pictures. As had the prejudice that has often ensued.This is getting tiresome. But wait. There\u2019s more.There\u2019s a tendency to view this as a case-by-case brand problem and roll one\u2019s eyes: Bad Prada! Ignorant Dolce! Silly Zara! But add it all together and it\u2019s clear that the mistakes are symptoms of a bigger problem, which has to do with a new reality (or understanding of reality), the way the fashion industry has been built and its inability, thus far, to adapt the one to the other.Some say it is a casualty of the global world, where brands based in one country and run by people with one understanding of history expand into other countries and view those consumers through their own foreign lens. Some say it has to do with the policing power of the internet, which allows individual voices to be heard in a way they never were in earlier times (and, occasionally, go too far). Both conclusions are probably true, but so is the fact that there are systemic contributors unique to fashion.Such as, for example, that the current pace of fashion and the pressure to get New Stuff Out Now mean that there are fewer safety checks and less time to consider the potential ramifications of choices around the world.\u201cWhile designers liked to play with clich\u00e9s in the past, cultural stereotypes are caricatures,\u201d said Serge Carreira, a lecturer on fashion and luxury at the Sciences Po institute in Paris. \u201cThey may be considered, nowadays, as marks of disdain. For decades, brands and designer messages were isolated and never challenged.\u201dYet such borrowing often happens with a kind of blithe thoughtlessness, a creative entitlement. If it feeds the imagination, that\u2019s all the justification the designer needs! You hear it again and again: They didn\u2019t mean anything bad by it. That\u2019s probably true. It also doesn\u2019t obviate the pain the products cause, or the problem. As Burak Cakmak, the dean of the School of Fashion at Parsons School of Design, said, \u201cWhile more and more companies are repositioning themselves as a value-driven business, most are not looking deep enough to understand historical and cultural contexts of their design and marketing choices to assess what might be offensive, inappropriate or simply without permission.\u201dMaybe 2019 is the year everyone finally figures out that retroactive head hanging is not enough anymore. That, as Mr. Carreira said, \u201cThe challenge is not only to promote a diversity of faces, but to implement a post-colonial and non-Westernized culture view in the industry.\u201d That proactive change is what is needed \u2014 a preventive checkup, if you will, as opposed to a Band-Aid after the fact. Though exactly what that would look like is unclear.The answer is not simply hiring a chief diversity officer, as H&M did. For real change to occur, it can\u2019t be housed in a small office off to the side of the C-suite, or limited to the visibility of the runway or the trickle-down of an advisory council, or the genuinely laudable advances in diversity on magazine covers. It has to infuse every level of a business, corporate and creative; it can\u2019t be one person\u2019s sole job, but part of everyone\u2019s job.\u201cI was standing in the store shaking my head and essentially saying out loud to myself, \u2018Do you have any black employees here?\u2019\u201d Ms. Ezie said of Prada. (The company has asked to meet with her; she said it would probably happen in January.) \u201cDid no one tell you this was blackface?\u201d Another question may be: If someone did tell, was there any mechanism to ensure decision makers would hear? What is needed is \u201ca change of mind-set impacting all behaviors in the industry and the traditional references. They should question the whole making processes of these images,\u201d Mr. Carreira said.You need an internal culture that encourages the raising of red flags from every quarter and every background \u2014 and then listens. After all, you can change your hiring practices to allow in new voices, but you also need to create an environment in which those voices matter. Fashion brands tend to have a centralized structure where messages, even about store design, flows only outward, from a home office; they need to go the other way, too. As does the realization that it\u2019s not just about representing diversity, Mr. Carreira said. But rather, \u201chow you represent it.\u201dA resolution, for the new year.Advertisement"}

They are based largely on data about the Russian operations provided to the Senate by Facebook, Twitter and the other companies whose platforms were used.Both reports stress that the Internet Research Agency created social media accounts under fake names on virtually every available platform. A major goal was to support Donald J. Trump, first against his Republican rivals in the presidential race, then in the general election, and as president since his inauguration.Among the services the Russians have provided Mr. Trump is to join in and amplify his regular attacks on Mr. Mueller.

Its attack on the United States used almost exclusively high-tech tools created by American companies.The New Knowledge researchers discovered many examples of the Russian operators building an audience with one theme and then shifting to another, often more provocative, set of messages. For instance, an Instagram account called @army_of_jesus_ first posted in January 2015 images from \u201cThe Muppet Show,\u201d then shifted to \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d and by early 2016 became Jesus-focused. Multiple memes associated Jesus with Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and Satan with that of his rival, Hillary Clinton.The Russian campaign was the subject of Senate hearings last year and has been widely scrutinized by academic experts. The new reports largely confirm earlier findings: that the campaign was designed to attack Mrs. Clinton, boost Mr. Trump and exacerbate existing divisions in American society.\u201cThe most prolific I.R.A. efforts on Facebook and Instagram specifically targeted black American communities and appear to have been focused on developing black audiences and recruiting black Americans as assets,\u201d the report says. Using Gmail accounts with American-sounding names, the Russians recruited and sometimes paid unwitting American activists of all races to stage rallies and spread content, but there was a disproportionate pursuit of African-Americans, it concludes.The report says that while \u201cother distinct ethnic and religious groups were the focus of one or two Facebook Pages or Instagram accounts, the black community was targeted extensively with dozens.\u201d In some cases, Facebook ads were targeted at users who had shown interest in particular topics, including black history, the Black Panther Party and Malcolm X. The most popular of the Russian Instagram accounts was @blackstagram, with 303,663 followers.The Internet Research Agency also created a dozen websites disguised as African-American in origin, with names like blackmattersus.com, blacktivist.info, blacktolive.org and blacksoul.us. On YouTube, the largest share of Russian material covered the Black Lives Matter movement and police brutality, with channels called \u201cDon\u2019t Shoot\u201d and \u201cBlackToLive.\u201dThe report does not seek to explain the heavy focus on African-Americans. But the Internet Research Agency\u2019s tactics echo Soviet propaganda efforts from decades ago that often highlighted racism and racial conflict in the United States, as well as recent Russian influence operations in other countries that sought to stir ethnic strife.Renee DiResta, one of the report\u2019s authors and director of research at New Knowledge, said the Internet Research Agency \u201cleveraged pre-existing, legitimate grievances wherever they could.\u201d As the election effort geared up, the Black Lives Matter movement was at the center of national attention in the United States, so the Russian operation took advantage of it, she said \u2014 and added \u201cBlue Lives Matter\u201d material when a pro-police pushback emerged.\u201cVery real racial tensions and feelings of alienation exist in America, and have for decades,\u201d Ms. DiResta said. \u201cThe I.R.A. didn\u2019t create them. It exploits them.\u201dRoger Stone is the sixth Trump adviser or official charged in the special counsel investigation.Of 81 Facebook pages created by the Internet Research Agency in the Senate\u2019s data, 30 targeted African-American audiences, amassing 1.2 million followers, the report finds. By comparison, 25 pages targeted the political right and drew 1.4 million followers. Just seven pages focused on the political left, drawing 689,045 followers.In response, the N.A.A.C.P. said it would not use Facebook or Instagram for a week and urged its social media followers and partners to do the same.While the right-wing pages promoted Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy, the left-wing pages scorned Mrs. Clinton while promoting Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate. The voter suppression effort was focused particularly on Sanders supporters and African-Americans, urging them to shun Mrs. Clinton in the general election and either vote for Ms. Stein or stay home.The New Knowledge report argues that the Internet Research Agency\u2019s presence on Instagram has been underestimated and may have been as effective or more effective than its Facebook effort. The report says there were 187 million engagements on Instagram \u2014 users \u201cliking\u201d or sharing the content created in Russia \u2014 compared with 76.5 million engagements on Facebook.In 2017, as the American news media focused on the Russian operations on Facebook and Twitter, the Russian effort shifted strongly to Instagram, the report says.The New Knowledge report criticizes social media companies for misleading the public.\u201cRegrettably, it appears that the platforms may have misrepresented or evaded in some of their statements to Congress,\u201d the report says, noting what it calls one false claim that specific population groups were not targeted by the influence operation and another that the campaign did not seek to discourage voting.\u201cIt is unclear whether these answers were the result of faulty or lacking analysis, or a more deliberate evasion,\u201d the report says.The report suggests a grudging respect for the scale and creativity of Russian influence operations. But the Russians were not eager to take credit for their own efforts.After the election, the report says, the Internet Research Agency put up some 70 posts on Facebook and Instagram that mocked the claims that Russia had interfered in the election.\u201cYou\u2019ve lost and don\u2019t know what to do?\u201d said one such post. \u201cJust blame it on Russian hackers.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Surprisingly Normal Reason Trump Wants a New Chief of Staff", "Date": "2018-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt probably has nothing to do with John Kelly\u2019s personality. More likely, the White House wants someone who\u2019s got political skills for the 2020 campaign. Mr. Dickinson is a professor of political science at Middlebury.True or not, everything under President Trump feels like it has been more bumpy than for any of his predecessors in the modern era. His governing approach combines an unusual faith in his own intuition, a relative lack of interest in policy details and a penchant for demonizing his opponents, real and imagined. The president appears to judge his White House aides less on their governing expertise than on their compatibility with and loyalty to his deeply personal approach to the presidency.But actually, the modern presidency moves to recognizable rhythms. And this one, in some ways, has been no different. There is a season to govern, and one to campaign. The announcement about Mr. Kelly is the clearest sign yet that for Mr. Trump and his White House staff, the time to govern is winding down, and the presidential campaign is about to begin.It is one thing to promise to Make America Great Again. It is another to recognize how to do so. To date, Mr. Trump appears less inclined than his predecessors to recognize the significance of that distinction; he governs as he campaigned.Mr. Kelly\u2019s rocky White House tenure as chief of staff illustrates this dynamic. President Trump hired him in July 2017 to bring order to a White House staff divided by factions. Reports detailed clashes among Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign aides, led by the former Breitbart executive Steve Bannon, Stephen Miller and Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter and son-in-law, Ivanka and Jared Kushner. Reince Priebus, the president\u2019s first chief of staff, seemed unable to mediate these disputes, prompting the decision to replace him with Mr. Kelly. Soon after, Mr. Bannon left the White House, and over the course of the next several months Mr. Kelly eased additional campaign aides out \u2014 including the former \u201cCelebrity Apprentice\u201d star Omarosa Manigault Newman \u2014 while bringing some semblance of coherence to White House operations.But the president never seemed fully comfortable with Mr. Kelly\u2019s effort to take charge of the White House staff. Mr. Trump reportedly bristled at the perception that Mr. Kelly was too willing to take credit for the administration\u2019s successes while criticizing Mr. Trump\u2019s failings, as when the chief of staff indicated the president\u2019s campaign statements on immigration and building a border wall were \u201cuninformed.\u201d For his part, Mr. Kelly\u2019s often-intemperate remarks, as when he suggested that the Civil War occurred because of a failure to compromise, revealed a lack of political acumen.Given those demands, it was not surprising that one rumored replacement, Vice President\u2019s Mike Pence\u2019s chief of staff, Nick Ayers, was the focus of the president\u2019s search to replace Mr. Kelly. Mr. Ayers has experience in political consulting and is considered a potential candidate for office himself in Georgia. But given the enormity of the tasks in the Trump White House, he has already reportedly turned down the job. Whoever it is, the new chief of staff will be dealing with a Democratically controlled House intent on using its oversight capability and the findings from the Mueller investigation as a possible basis for impeaching the president. Under Mr. Trump, however, a president who brags about making \u201cgut\u201d decisions and who resists any attempt at management, the chief of staff\u2019s task takes on greater urgency. How well the new chief performs may well determine the future of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, his potential re-election and the nation he leads.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Tear Up This Treaty", "Date": "2018-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byArms control isn\u2019t perfect. But abandoning treaties without a plan for the future is dangerous.The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.Update, Feb. 1, 2019: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced on Friday that the administration was suspending American participation in the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty and would likely withdraw from the treaty in six months.Every American president from John F. Kennedy to Barack Obama has successfully negotiated an agreement with the Soviet Union, or the Russian federation, to reduce the threat from both countries\u2019 vast nuclear arsenals. More than a dozen treaties limiting nuclear testing, nuclear weapons, activities in outer space and missile defense have been part of this mix. The need for such restraint is irrefutable: No weapons are more lethal and potentially more destabilizing to the world than those that have earned the moniker \u201ccity killers.\u201dBut that progress \u2014 and the network of agreements that undergird it \u2014 is now in jeopardy as President Donald Trump, and hard-line aides like John Bolton, the national security adviser for whom arms control has long been anathema, bristle at any restraints on what they call American sovereignty.It would be even more harmful to let New Start, with its mandated caps on nuclear warhead deployments and valuable requirements for verification and data exchanges, unravel. Unlike the I.N.F. Treaty, New Start restrains core Russian strategic forces that could directly target the United States, not just its allies. The Russian violation of the I.N.F. Treaty centers on an SSC-8 land-based cruise missile. American officials say it can carry nuclear and conventional warheads, is fired from a mobile launcher and has been tested at a distance of between 300 and 3,000 miles, the range prohibited by the treaty. The missiles, located in western and central Russia, are intended to intimidate Europe, especially former Soviet states aligned with the West.Which encourages speculation that the administration may be more interested in abandoning the I.N.F. Treaty so that it can deploy medium-range missiles to Asia. China is a growing threat that relies on similar missiles for 95 percent of its ground-based fleet. It also is not part of the treaty and is not restricted in its missile development. That same goes for Iran, India, Saudi Arabia, North Korea and the other six countries with fast-growing missile arsenals.Given current American-Russian tensions, saving the treaty through negotiations may be a long shot. But the Trump administration has an obligation to try. Otherwise, Russia is expected to expand its medium-range missile production, menacing Europe and Asia even more.\u201cThe answer to the problems that have come up is not to abandon the I.N.F. Treaty but to preserve and fix it,\u201d they said.A diplomatic initiative would require a concerted NATO effort. One solution being discussed by American experts would involve Russia acceding to American inspections of the Russian cruise missiles and the Americans allowing Russian inspections of American Aegis missile defense systems based in Romania and planned for Poland. Moscow, fearing the system could be used to launch offensive intermediate-range missiles, sometimes brands it a treaty violation, but most independent experts do not.The goal would be an agreement under which Russian inspectors periodically get to examine the Aegis system to verify that it is incapable of launching offensive cruise missiles; Russia would modify its SSC-8 cruise missile so it can\u2019t fly beyond 500 miles.But until some better formula is found for ensuring strategic balance and limiting the spread of the world\u2019s most lethal weapons \u2014 until Mr. Trump at least has some plan for what comes next \u2014 it\u2019s a dangerous mistake for him to jettison existing agreements like I.N.F. and New Start.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Beloved Sicilian Street Food Comes Inside", "Date": "2018-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCity KitchenHearty and full of flavor, sfincione is easily made at home \u2014 no finesse or screaming hot oven necessary.Sicily, the ancient Mediterranean island kingdom that\u2019s now part of Italy, is a fascinating place to visit. Hints of Sicily\u2019s past are everywhere, in the architecture, in the church interiors and in the archaeological remains. But even an earnest history-seeking traveler gets hungry. My suggestion is to head to the streets.Palermo, the capital, is a street-food paradise, with vendors selling traditional items, like panelle (chickpea fritters) and arancini, stuffed risotto balls as big as oranges. For the adventurous, there\u2019s pani c\u00e2 meusa, a warm sandwich of beef spleen on a bun, which is much better than it sounds.But a street food with universal appeal is sfincione, a hearty, tomatoey pizza. It is baked in a rimmed sheet pan, which allows the dough to rise to a chewy thickness.Sfincione may have regional variations across Sicily, but the basic concept is the same: dough topped with cheap, tasty ingredients, for a filling treat that can emerge from even the most humble home kitchen. (Now, though, most people buy a slice from a street cart or bakery.)Sfincione is not a cheesy pizza. It\u2019s usually made with only a small amount of sharp-flavored sheep\u2019s milk cheese, just enough to complement the other savory toppings. In this way, sfincione differs from what Americans know as a \u201cSicilian slice,\u201d which, though also cut thick and square, can come loaded with cheese or other items.I adhere closely to the original delicious recipe, with a couple of minor changes. Instead of blanching the onions, as she does, I saut\u00e9 them in the skillet while preparing the sauce, and I also increased the amount of tomato and anchovies slightly, a cook\u2019s prerogative.In her recipe, the bread crumbs are stirred into the topping, but some cooks prefer to sprinkle them on after saucing the dough. The choice is yours. As for cheeses, consider caciocavallo or provolone, coarsely grated. But you\u2019ll also get good result with more widely available pecorino Romano. As the sfincione bakes, your kitchen will fill with tantalizing aromas. Inhale deeply and dream of Sicily. I\u2019m told sfincione is popular there for Christmas Eve and New Year\u2019s celebrations. In my view, it\u2019s an any-time-of-year delight.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Hope and Betrayal of Blockchain", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTurning PointsThis is the most revolutionary and innovative aspect of blockchain. But its promise could be undermined.Trust \u2014 the basis of social and commercial interactions \u2014 has been guaranteed for centuries by institutionalized trust providers, such as hierarchically organized companies and other third-party authorities. These trust mechanisms have worked for offline business models, but they are becoming obsolete in our hyper-connected digital world.In the past few years, however, some open platforms, such as Twitter, have become increasingly restrictive. Things have turned sour, as developers and early users feel betrayed. They had been promised open platforms but that dream was snatched away.Moreover, incidents involving several tech giants, such as Facebook, eBay, Uber and Experian, have shattered their credibility as reliable keepers of our data. Our fear of surveillance and data misuse has grown.Thanks to blockchain, people are now able and eager to take on the platform owners by engaging directly with one another via peer-to-peer, or P2P, distributed networks that run on a commonly agreed-upon set of rules. The resulting machine-driven trust allows users to avoid the fallout from centralized trust mechanisms, such as third-party control or unauthorized surveillance.In fact, the large centralized trust enforcers may soon give way to decentralized trust systems and P2P network-enforced reputation systems that blockchain makes possible.Under such systems, algorithms confirm the authenticity of each transaction and can record each party\u2019s identity, along with their trust and reputation rating, in the blockchain, which acts as a kind of ledger. Misbehavior is prevented because it is impossible to tamper with or falsify the ledger, and accountability is improved because all actions can be independently audited by any participant.It is Uber without Uber, Airbnb without Airbnb.This evolution is already happening. Payment and financial services providers like PayPal are being challenged by Ripple or Circle. Social media and networking services like Twitter and Facebook face competition from decentralized platforms such as Steemit or Akasha. Decentralized apps \u2014 software making decisions and acting autonomously \u2014 can be created and deployed on different blockchains like Ethereum or EOS. These are just a few examples.This beguiling transformation seems too good to be true, and distributed systems based on blockchain face a conundrum.In modern large-scale P2P markets, trust and growth are at odds: The more a network grows, the less trust users often place in it. But user growth is essential to the success of the P2P platform economy.This problem can be solved by making it harder to join the network (reducing user growth) or by centralizing control to a handful of trusted coders or nodes (reducing decentralization). Unfortunately, the blockchain community seems to favor increased centralization.Apart from business-to-business platforms, which generally run on top of private blockchains where governance is centralized by design, the fastest, most secure and most rapidly growing P2P platforms are based on public blockchain networks \u2014 which are all centralized. A handful of people make and enforce the rules.For Ethereum, the largest public blockchain stack, adopted by thousands of P2P platforms, the situation is even worse. The top five mining pools secure as much as 80 percent of the transactions in the ledger. The developers are concentrated as well: 20 percent of Ethereum\u2019s core code was written by the same coder.Machine-driven trust is about to jump from systems controlled by tech giants to systems controlled by a small group of anonymous tech gurus.If only a few members have the ability to edit the system\u2019s ledger and control the protocol, where are the open, transparent, free-to-use and universally accessible blockchains that so many hoped would bypass third-party control and surveillance?Ultimately, this new frontier of managing trust in the digital world presents a rather stark choice: Either we bargain away our privacy to centralized but accountable trust providers or we keep direct \u201ccontrol\u201d of our data via a trust machine run by a limited group of anonymous people who could go rogue.These governance problems undermine the credibility of blockchain as a trust machine for the new P2P economy. It seems that synthetic trust among peers is not supported by a solid set of principles. This lack of trust inevitably atomizes the community and fragments group solidarity, as evidenced by the many chains that have forked off from the original protocols of Bitcoin and Ethereum.For the time being, there is warfare to control those blockchain systems, and not a new common good that the technology still has the potential to deliver.Paolo Tasca is executive director of the UCL Centre for Blockchain Technologies.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "This Dracula Ant\u2019s Jaws Could Make It the Fastest Animal on Earth", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesYou could call it an ant speed record. The Dracula ant is not much of a traveler. Located mostly in the tropics of Africa, Australia and Asia, the tiny creatures spend most of their lives burrowed into tree trunks or underground, to the endless frustration of scientists who would like to study them.So, imagine the surprise of the researchers who recently discovered that Dracula ants may be the fastest animals on earth.The findings provide new insight into ant evolution and could help engineers design more powerful and efficient machines.Fredrick Larabee, an entomologist at the Smithsonian Natural History Museum, had been studying ants with powerful jaws at the University of Illinois in 2014 when his colleague, Andrew Suarez, was lucky enough to collect two colonies of Dracula ants in Borneo.\u201cWe had spent four or five years trying to get a single colony,\u201d containing thousands of insects, said Dr. Larabee. \u201cBut we were never able to get more than a few workers.\u201dOnce Dr. Suarez brought the colonies back to his Illinois lab, the researchers quickly realized that their equipment wasn\u2019t powerful enough to study them.\u201cThe ants were so fast that we couldn\u2019t slow their motion down with the cameras we had,\u201d said Dr. Larabee. \u201cThat\u2019s when we knew we were onto something special.\u201dThey transported the ants to Duke University, where they could film them with a camera that captured up to 1 million frames per second. (The camera at the University of Illinois could capture only 100,000 frames per second.) They also used X-ray imaging to study the mandibles in three dimensions.They found that unlike trap-jaw ants, whose jaws snap close from an open position, this Dracula ant uses its mandibles much like a pair of snapping fingers. The ant presses two small appendages together, spring loading them with potential energy, until one slides past the other. The immense force generated by the pent-up energy can be used to stun or kill prey, which are then brought back to the nest and eaten. It takes just 0.000015 seconds for the appendages to accelerate from 0 to 200 miles per hour.By comparing the jaws of Dracula ants and trap-jaw ants, a genus of tropical ant whose mandibles reach speeds of 140 miles per hour, researchers can see how similar functions evolved in different ways. Dr. Larabee and his team also plan to further study how the Dracula ant uses its mandibles in the wild.Of course, records are made to be broken, and with the increasing availability of high-speed cameras making it easier to clock rapid animal movements, Dr. Larabee anticipates the Dracula ant won\u2019t hold the speed record for long. \u201cI suspect there are several other animals that are faster,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

But, after two years as commander in chief and a steady stream of complaints for not having done so, Mr. Trump did visit American troops stationed in a war zone.It\u2019s true that the president brought a lot of this criticism upon himself. But there\u2019s also something perverse about the fierce blowback he received. I\u2019ve found myself wondering if he\u2019s facing this tempest for another reason \u2014 because he dared suggest scaling back the reach of the American military-industrial complex.Mr. Trump has a strange relationship with the military. He loves the parades, the star-spangled pomp and surrounding himself with generals\u2019 stars. Until the generals speak, at least. For instance, see the letter of resignation from Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis \u2014 and the way it sped up his departure.The Iraq trip was a prime example of the superficiality of how this president sees the military. The seemingly staged images of Mr. Trump with kitted-up special operators in the Asad chow hall are both exploitative and goofy. And it seemed a bit convenient that so many \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d red hats happened to be at an air base in the middle of desolate Anbar Province. This president embodies our republic\u2019s earnest yet shallow understanding of military service, all the while acting as a reminder of the limited mass appeal of service itself. Less than one percent of Americans wear the uniform these days. Bone spurs? In 2018, who actually cares, beyond those who had to go to Vietnam in the stead of kids like Donald Trump? In so many ways, Mr. Trump is not a cause of diminishing respect for the military, but a symptom of it. So it is with 21st-century America and war. \u201cThank you for your service,\u201d but spare the details, please.Last month, I attended a retirement ceremony at Fort Knox, Ky., for the platoon sergeant I served with in Iraq.

We celebrated that evening with my friend\u2019s family over dinner and drinks, and talk gradually turned to the world. I asked my friend what changes he\u2019d noticed over his 20-plus years of military service \u2014 how different presidents have shaped his career, his multiple combat deployments.\u201cIt\u2019s been the same for us for a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cRepublicans in charge, Democrats in charge \u2014 hasn\u2019t really mattered much, to be honest.\u201dBut when questions like \u201cHow long?\u201d and \u201cHow many?\u201d and \u201cWhat\u2019s the objective?\u201d get swallowed up by a defense industry that essentially answers with, \u201cWe\u2019ll handle it,\u201d it\u2019s no wonder that the American citizenry doesn\u2019t engage with its military much beyond surprise homecomings at football games. Should we remain in Afghanistan? Should we stay in Syria and Iraq? Both as a combat veteran and a citizen who tries to stay informed of his nation\u2019s foreign policy, I can honestly answer only: I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not privy to top-secret briefings, nor do I earn a living by making grand predictions on matters of war and peace.I do know this, though: The way forward should involve more transparency, not less. Then citizens will be better able to hold our elected officials accountable for the decisions they have our military leaders execute. As it stands now, Americans seem to care so little or are so convinced of the necessity of permanent war that our military is still fighting overseas based on congressional authorization from 2001. That\u2019s not good enough, not even close.The American public has been conditioned to believe that foreign war is necessary, even vital, to maintaining our way of life. Forcing those in power to explain why \u2014 beyond easy, histrionic references to Sept. 11 \u2014 would go a long way toward moving beyond this forever war. In the meantime, our commander in chief continues to be both baffled by and obsessed with our men and women in uniform. It\u2019s crass. It\u2019s clownish. It\u2019s unbecoming. In 2018, it\u2019s also unquestionably American.Matt Gallagher is an Army veteran of the Iraq war and author of the novel \u201cYoungblood.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.His message was quite clear: Stop trying to get us to blow up Obamacare. If you don\u2019t like it, go see Congress.Now there\u2019s a real possibility that the Supreme Court may yet again be faced with a demand to settle the fate of the law.One way the Supreme Court can avoid getting dragged into another drama over health care is if the appeals court set to review the Texas ruling, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, finds grounds to reverse it. That would give the justices cover to duck the issue altogether by declining to review whatever the Fifth Circuit decides.So there\u2019s a chance that the entire Fifth Circuit will end up affirming the Texas ruling. This is a repeat of what happened in 2010 and 2013, as long-shot challenges to Obamacare that were once largely academic gained traction in the lower courts. And, with that, something else happened: Politicians began rallying behind the lawsuits. The media covered the cases. Legal academics debated and wrote about the disputes. The public started paying attention. Before long, the cases slithered their way to the nation\u2019s highest court. Rinse, repeat.In Mr. Balkin\u2019s view, the reason that seemingly bizarre legal arguments reach the mainstream is that politicians and others in power get behind them. Yes, support from the academy or from social movements moves the needle as well. But it is only when political actors \u2014 parties, elected officials, institutions \u2014 speak in favor of a position that it stands a chance of being taken seriously by the courts.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Social Media\u2019s Forever War", "Date": "2018-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftOne takeaway from these reports might be that the Russian influence campaign of 2016 was a freak occurrence enabled by a perfect storm of vulnerabilities: growth-obsessed social media companies, unsuspecting intelligence agencies and an election featuring two hyper-polarizing candidates, one of which had a Russian blind spot and an army of supporters willing to believe convenient lies and half-truths.The other way to look at these reports, and probably a more accurate one, is that the 2016 election was the Pearl Harbor of the social media age: a singular act of aggression that ushered in an era of extended conflict.The theatre opportunistically shifts as geopolitical events and cultural moments present themselves, but there is no sign of abatement \u2014 only tactical evolution as the digital platforms that serve as the battlespaces introduce small amounts of friction via new security checks and feature tweaks.There is also something uncomfortably America-centric about all of this investigation. Social media companies have, reluctantly and belatedly, disclosed details about the extent of their platforms\u2019 misuse during the 2016 election in the United States. But they have not made similar disclosures in Italy, France, Brazil or any number of other countries where social media disinformation has played a major role in tectonic political shifts.The researchers who analyzed data from the 2016 election have framed the continuing battle over disinformation and social media manipulation as a \u201chigh-stakes information war.\u201d But if this is indeed a war, it isn\u2019t a simple, bilateral one \u2014 with tech firms and American intelligence agencies on one side, and state-sponsored hackers and trolls on the other.Social networks, after all, are not extensions of the United States government. They are owned by corporations seeking to maximize their growth and profitability, and many of them operate mostly outside the United States. (It\u2019s useful to periodically recall that fewer than 10 percent of Facebook\u2019s users are American.) The social media apparatus that Russia exploited in 2016 \u2014 feeds engineered to show users emotionally engaging content, paired with viral sharing mechanisms and self-service advertising platforms \u2014 has been enormously profitable for these companies, and remains largely intact.We shouldn\u2019t hold our breath for these companies to voluntarily self-regulate. Instead, to contain this amorphous threat, we\u2019ll almost certainly have to look elsewhere for help.First, while pressuring social media companies to take information warfare seriously, the public and the media will need to take steps to make ourselves less vulnerable to influence campaigns, by increasing our fluency with disinformation and media manipulation tactics. As long as tools for targeted digital mass persuasion exist, Russian-style influence operations will be with us. And any new social network competing with Facebook, Instagram and Twitter will need to consider, from Day 1, how propaganda can be kept at bay. It is no longer enough to build a platform, attract millions or billions of users, and then deal with the consequences.If anything has changed since 2016, it\u2019s that social media is no longer seen as just a useful tool for influencing elections. It\u2019s the terrain on which our entire political culture rests, whose peaks and valleys shape our everyday discourse, and whose possibilities for exploitation are nearly endless. And until we either secure that ground or replace it entirely, we should expect many more attacks, each one in a slightly different form, and each leaving us with even more doubt that what we see online reflects reality, or something close to it.Advertisement"}

Despite what President Trump said, our mission is not complete. Mr. Geltzer and Mr. Costa served as senior directors for counterterrorism under President Trump and President Obama.So, as we look to 2019, it\u2019s important to stay focused on landing a body blow against the Islamic State\u2019s remnants in Iraq and Syria. That includes eradicating the last vestiges of the group\u2019s network of fighters, supporting resurgent governance in the areas the group once held, developing sustainable intelligence sources and law enforcement options for the group\u2019s terrorist network, and increasing the pressure against the group in what remains a virtual safe haven: the internet.Stripping the Islamic State of territory and even fighters is not the same as achieving the group\u2019s defeat. Forced from one redoubt, it will reappear in other territories, potentially even in less detectable \u2014 but more lethal \u2014 forms.

He has presided over near constant turmoil as he has increasingly relied on his own instincts.

Mr. Klein is the executive editor of The Washington Examiner.It also suggests that, however tumultuous the previous two years were, this week is a taste of what\u2019s to come and a sign that partisan warfare is going to get more fierce.President Trump, in other words, faced a classic political quandary of having to choose between his party\u2019s base and the general electorate. His decision shows that he\u2019s concluded his best path to re-election runs through appealing to his base. And he\u2019s probably right.Compared with that of other presidents, Mr. Trump\u2019s approval rating is relatively inelastic, so there isn\u2019t really an option of his winning over moderates by co-opting the message of his opponents, as Bill Clinton successfully did after Democratic losses in the 1994 midterms. Mr. Trump\u2019s own unorthodox political rise has taught him that the road to victory lies in energizing a devoted group of supporters.Any window for Mr. Trump to govern from the center has long since closed. Attempting to pivot now will win him no new fans, and it will only alienate his most passionate supporters, depriving him of his biggest political asset just as the 2020 presidential election enters its preliminary stages.There is no vow that defined Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign more than his promise to build a border wall. If he is going to enter the campaign in the embarrassing position of not having fulfilled that pledge, at the very minimum he\u2019s going to have to show that he exhausted every option at his disposal and fought for the wall tooth and nail. A high-profile government shutdown battle is a way to accomplish that.Most likely, perhaps at some point after House Democrats take control, Mr. Trump will be forced to sign a bill without wall funding, as he will no longer have the votes for it in the House. Coming off a huge electoral victory, Democrats aren\u2019t about to surrender and give Mr. Trump what would be the biggest victory of his presidency.It\u2019s quite possible that his strategy of feeding the base will doom his chances of re-election, but at this point it\u2019s the best play he has.Philip Klein is the executive editor of The Washington Examiner.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Florida SWAT Officer Is Demoted After Wearing QAnon Patch Next to Mike Pence", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt the end of a trip to South Florida on Friday, Vice President Mike Pence posed for photos with a group of local SWAT team members who had protected him during the visit. They were shared on Twitter, where among the officers\u2019 green uniforms, a red and black patch on Sgt. Matt Patten\u2019s tactical vest stood out: a bold letter Q and the phrase \u201cQuestion the Narrative.\u201dThe online followers of QAnon, a pro-Trump fringe movement that promotes baseless conspiracy theories about government secrets and clandestine plots, took notice and shared the photo. So did their anonymous leader, Q.\u201cIt\u2019s spreading,\u201d Q wrote.While the movement\u2019s loosely connected group of supporters embraced the moment, Sergeant Patten\u2019s employer, the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office, viewed it as an embarrassment. On Monday, the sheriff\u2019s office said it had reprimanded him, removed him from the SWAT team and reassigned him to a new department.\u201cSergeant Patten\u2019s actions of displaying unity with a controversial group not in alignment with the core values of the law enforcement and the Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office discredited the agency, the county and himself,\u201d a sheriff\u2019s office supervisor wrote in a disciplinary report.Sergeant Patten, a 31-year veteran of the department, did not respond on Monday to a call seeking comment. He will be reassigned to the Department of Law Enforcement, a sheriff\u2019s office spokeswoman said.When Mr. Pence landed on Friday at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, Sergeant Patten was part of a local SWAT group that, with the Secret Service, escorted him to a hotel in Hollywood, Fla., for a speech at the Israeli-American Council National Conference. After the speech, the sergeant traveled with Mr. Pence back to the airport, where the vice president asked if he could personally thank the local officers and take photos with them, according to the report.It was at this time, the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office said, that Sergeant Patten attached the circular QAnon patch, roughly four inches across, on the front of his vest. Mr. Pence later tweeted the photos, including the one with the sergeant.Supporters of QAnon and people who track far-right groups quickly noticed the patch, and the tweet by Mr. Pence was soon deleted.QAnon believers follow a person or group of people named Q who claims to be a government insider trying to expose nefarious efforts by the so-called deep state to undermine President Trump and his allies. They closely follow Q\u2019s posts and rush to interpret the messages. The exact number of Q followers is difficult to determine, but some QAnon forums, including a private Facebook group, have tens of thousands of members.The fringe theory gained a wider audience over the summer when some attendees at a rally for President Trump in Tampa, Fla., wore shirts with the letter Q.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Wants to Weaken Clean-Water Rules ", "Date": "2018-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA new proposal would threaten waterways and drinking-water supplies.Mr. Uhlmann was chief of the environmental crimes section at the Justice Department from 2000 to 2007.Once again, the E.P.A. is disregarding basic science. This latest proposal obscures its harmful effects with legalese that draws dubious distinctions between certain streams even though pollution flows downstream regardless of the legal terminology the agency deploys. This is a thinly veiled effort to slash water pollution protections that have long been embraced by both Republican and Democratic administrations.President Trump is once more playing to his base, this time to rural communities fearing greater regulation of the agricultural runoff that each year creates worsening dead zones in the Great Lakes and the Gulf of Mexico. Farmers do face significant challenges complying with environmental requirements. But in purporting to address their concerns, the E.P.A. would place at risk one of the greatest American environmental success stories: the transformation of our rivers and streams from open sewers in the 1960s and 1970s to far healthier waters today.But what constituted an adjacent wetland was not subject to any distance limits, which made the Clean Water Act vulnerable to claims of overreach by the federal government. Compounding matters, wetlands are also breeding ground for mosquitoes and other insects, and broad protection can hamper real estate development.The controversy over wetlands protection resulted in three decades of court fights, culminating in a fractured Supreme Court decision in 2006 that left the law a muddled mess. After a lengthy review during the Obama administration, which relied upon extensive input from the E.P.A.\u2019s scientific advisory board, the agency and the Corps of Engineers determined in 2015 that protecting navigable rivers and streams required that the Clean Water Act extend to the entire tributary system, including adjacent wetlands, just as the 1977 rule required. For the first time, the agencies imposed distance limitations on what wetlands would receive protection.The resulting rule made ecological and practical sense, reflecting sound science: Wetlands protect water quality in tributaries, which in turn protect water quality in downstream rivers and streams. Nonetheless, industry and property rights groups, joined by several states, immediately challenged the rule, arguing that it expanded Clean Water Act jurisdiction improperly to include ephemeral streams and isolated wetlands. Environmental groups also challenged the rule, claiming that there was no scientific basis for the distance limitations. The E.P.A. also ignores the reality that, as climate change brings more storms and catastrophic flooding, we will see far more pollution from ephemeral tributaries, threatening communities that depend on rivers and streams for drinking water and recreation. In addition, the E.P.A. proposes to slash federal protection for wetlands adjacent to the tributary system, reasoning without any scientific basis that only wetlands that directly abut or have a surface connection to tributaries deserve protection. The agency is thus disregarding a basic tenet of ecology \u2014 that hydrological connections below ground matter as much as the rivers and streams we can see.With fresh water supplies vulnerable to a changing climate, and our infrastructure outdated, as seen in Flint, Mich., we need to do more to protect America\u2019s waterways and ensure continued progress in the effort to provide clean drinking water, and fishable and swimmable streams \u2014 the goals Congress set when it passed the Clean Water Act in 1972. The last thing we should do is turn back the clock, weaken the Clean Water Act and further fray our national commitment to clean water and a healthy environment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "They Grabbed Her Baby and Arrested Her. Now Jazmine Headley Is Speaking Out.", "Date": "2018-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJazmine Headley took her baby boy to a public benefits office in Brooklyn on a recent Friday to find out why the city had abruptly stopped paying for him to go to day care while she worked cleaning offices.The incident, caught on cellphone videos and shared widely online, has propelled her into the center of a public reckoning over how the city treats people seeking public assistance.\u201cIt\u2019s the story of many other people, it\u2019s not just my story,\u201d Ms. Headley said in an interview. \u201cMy story is the only one that made it to the surface.\u201dHer arrest highlighted the tension that plays out in public benefit offices throughout the city every day. People seeking benefits are usually under tremendous financial strain and are dealing with an unyielding bureaucracy, and city workers at these offices are under pressure to follow rules, ferret out abuse and keep order.Those strains occasionally boil over into physical confrontations and arrests, officials said, an outcome that can have lifelong consequences for people already struggling at the bottom of the economic ladder. Since January 2017, law enforcement agencies have been called to food-stamp offices across the city 2,212 times and have arrested 97 people, mainly for assault and offenses against public administration, the police said.Ms. Headley had had a difficult two years \u2014 a disappointing move to North Carolina, a failed relationship with her son\u2019s father and an arrest on charges of credit-card fraud in New Jersey.On Thursday, she notified the city that she plans to file a potentially lucrative lawsuit to prevent what happened to her from happening to others.\u201cThey never asked me my name,\u201d Ms. Headley said. \u201cThey never said, \u2018Hello, who are you?\u2019 They never asked me.\u201dIn the interview, Ms. Headley said she tried to leave the office with her son shortly after the police showed up. The officers had been called because Ms. Headley had a heated argument with a female security guard, who told her she could not sit on the floor.She picked up her baby and started to leave, but the police said the guard grabbed her arm, and they all tumbled to the floor. Ms. Headley said she tried again to go, but a male police officer told her it was too late. She went into \u201cdefense mode,\u201d she said.\u201cIn my head, I told myself they\u2019re not going to let me leave,\u201d she said. \u201cI was so afraid. I was combative with my thoughts.\u201dMs. Headley grew up in Brooklyn, where she is raising her son, Damone Buckman III, in her mother\u2019s apartment in the Brevoort Houses, where she has lived since she was 3 years old. She went to public schools and worked briefly at a nonprofit that helps developmentally disabled adults.Suzanne Jones, the program\u2019s case manager, said that Ms. Headley was driven and knew how to stand her ground. \u201cYou don\u2019t roll over Jazmine,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s always going to push her way through.\u201dMs. Headley stayed on with the nonprofit, Jewel Human Services, for nine months until she said she fell in love and moved to Charlotte, N.C., to join her boyfriend.That summer, she was arrested outside Trenton, N.J., and charged with taking part in an identity theft and credit-card fraud scheme, prosecutors said. The police seized five phony cards with her name on them.Her relationship broke up around the time she gave birth to Damone in June 2017, her mother said. Her savings from her job at a Belk department store ran out a couple of months later, and she returned to New York, where she went on public assistance \u2014 a monthly allowance of $280 in food stamps and $140 in cash.In September, she went back to work cleaning offices part time for $13 an hour. Her benefits were cut after she started working, but the city still paid $1,200 each month for Damone\u2019s day care. Then that payment stopped, too.Ms. Headley had taken that Friday off work after the owner of her son\u2019s day care told her Damone could not return if the payment issue was not fixed.\u201cMy main objective was to get there, handle business and get home,\u201d Ms. Headley said.With Damone in a stroller, she arrived a few minutes before 10 a.m. at the Human Resources Administration office on Bergen Street and took a number for her turn to talk to a case worker who handles child-care assistance.At 12:20 p.m., she said, her turn came and a case worker told her that she would have to reapply for child care benefits, a process that could take up to a week.Determined to accomplish something, she decided to check the status of her cash allowance, for which she had reapplied in November. That meant taking another number, and more waiting.By then, Damone was getting restless. She said she took him to a play area, but workers turned her away because he is not toilet trained.All the seats in the main waiting area were taken, she said, so she sat on the floor with her back against the blue wall and talked to Damone, who was in a stroller to her right.A security guard came over and told Ms. Headley that she was blocking a fire zone and needed to move.Ms. Headley said she refused, noting that there were trash and recycling bins against the wall on the other side of Damone\u2019s stroller.\u201cI just remember being talked to very viciously,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was more or less: \u2018You\u2019re going to do what I say, and that\u2019s it.\u2019\u201dThe exchange grew heated, Ms. Headley said, and another security guard \u2014 the city calls them peace officers \u2014 came to demand that she move.Incensed, Ms. Headley said she asked to talk to a supervisor. The guards walked away, Ms. Headley said, and 10 minutes passed. Then they returned with two police officers.She picked Damone up and rose to her feet. One of the police officers told her they did not want to arrest her and she began to leave, holding Damone and pushing the stroller.Her memory of what happened next is blurry, she said. The police said the first guard grabbed Ms. Headley\u2019s arm and they fell to the ground.\u201cI should\u2019ve left, and I didn\u2019t because if I would\u2019ve left, my son would not have the things that he needs,\u201d Ms. Headley said.Body-cameras worn by the officers recorded the guard telling Ms. Headley that if she did not leave she would be taken to central booking and the city\u2019s child-welfare agency would take her son away, according to a person briefed on the matter.\u201cYou\u2019re a joke,\u201d Ms. Headley replied, then turned to go, according to the person who was briefed. The peace officer replied: \u201cReally?\u201d then lunged at Ms. Headley and grabbed her arm, the person said, and \u201ceveryone tumbles down.\u201dIf the guard \u201chad just swallowed it, this would have been over,\u201d a law enforcement official briefed on the body-camera evidence said.A video posted on Facebook shows Ms. Headley trying to reason once more with the officers. \u201cLet me get up,\u201d Ms. Headley tells the police officers, who appear to be speaking to her. \u201cI have my rights. I have my rights.\u201d She sits upright on the floor, then says, \u201cDon\u2019t touch me when I get up.\u201dBut the two officers then restrained her while the two guards stripped Damone out of her arms. The baby shrieked while onlookers yelled at the police to leave her alone. Ms. Headley fought hard to hold onto him, gripping his shirt in her teeth.Gregory Floyd, the guards\u2019 union president, said the guards, Bettina Barnett-Weekes and Toyin Ramos-Williams, tried to reason with Ms. Headley for 40 minutes before the police arrived, and that there were rows of seats available in the waiting area. He said Ms. Barnett-Weekes was bitten during the fracas.As Ms. Headley\u2019s arrest began drawing attention worldwide \u2014 the Facebook videos have been seen more than 1.3 million times \u2014 the city social services commissioner suspended the two security guards and started the process of firing them.\u201cI could only see my children in that situation, and it\u2019s just heartbreaking,\u201d the commissioner, Steven Banks, said.Mr. Banks said his agency was reviewing tactics for dealing with people accompanying children and would retrain the peace officers. The guards also will now be ordered to talk to a supervisor before calling the police, unless there is an immediate threat to someone\u2019s safety, he said.The bureaucratic headache that kept Ms. Headley at the Brooklyn office for hours is not unusual. The practice of prematurely closing public benefits cases and forcing recipients to reapply is so common that advocates for the poor have a word for it: churning.\u201cThey call the cops for everything, even if you\u2019re smoking outside,\u201d said Mae Green, an administrator at Bethel Baptist Church, a few doors down from the Boerum Hill office.Synthia Jean, 38, said she left the Boerum Hill office last month after waiting six hours for officials to reissue a check that was dated for April, but had arrived in November, and to give her an identification card to cash it. She said public benefits offices are \u201cjust a bunch of aggravation in one place.\u201dThe Police Department has defended the actions of the two officers, saying the security guards were to blame for the incident getting out of hand.

They say the Danish Parliament, which approved the measure, has artificially elevated a social custom to a national value.\u201cIf you arrive in Denmark, where it\u2019s custom to shake hands when you greet, if you don\u2019t do it it\u2019s disrespectful,\u201d said Martin Henriksen, a lawmaker who has been critical of Islam and is the right-wing Danish People\u2019s Party\u2019s spokesman on immigration. \u201cIf one can\u2019t do something that simple and straightforward, there\u2019s no reason to become a Danish citizen.\u201dHe said the law, which will take effect on Jan. 1, was required because of \u201cMuslim immigration to Denmark over a long time,\u201d and added that he hoped it would be followed by a ban on Muslim women wearing veils at citizenship ceremonies.The country\u2019s integration minister, Inger Stojberg, declined an interview, but wrote on her Facebook page that a handshake was a \u201cvisible sign that you\u2019ve taken Denmark to heart.\u201dSome Muslim and Jewish groups prohibit or discourage their faithful from touching members of the opposite sex outside their immediate families.The handshake requirement will deter few applicants for citizenship, officials said, but it sends a harsh message to Muslims, and many mayors who conduct citizenship ceremonies said they would find ways to avoid it.\u201cIt\u2019s against my ideology and conviction to have to force other people to have body contact,\u201d said Thomas Andresen, the mayor of Aabenraa, near the border with Germany.To circumvent the law, Mr. Andresen said, he could either arrange to have local officials of both genders take part in the ceremonies or have state officials take over. Either way, he said, he would look for pragmatic solutions while protesting legislation \u201cgone too far.\u201dMogens Jespersen, the mayor of Mariagerfjord, a northern town, told the national broadcaster that he would disregard the law and accept a nod or a bow from an applicant refusing to extend her hand.\u201cBut I think it\u2019s a hypothetical question I\u2019ll never face,\u201d he said.In Ishoj, a suburb of Copenhagen, immigrants and their descendants constitute 40 percent of the population. But its mayor of 17 years, Ole Bjorstorp, said he had never met anybody who refused to shake his hand.If it were to happen, he said, he would just find somebody else to perform the ceremony.\u201cMy conscience doesn\u2019t allow me to report people on this basis so they won\u2019t become Danish citizens,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a moral and ethical issue.\u201dOne mayor said he had met a female asylum seeker who declined to shake his hand for religious reasons, but he did not find it disturbing.\u201cI was in no doubt that she meant to show the exact same respect in her way as I did in mine,\u201d said Soren Steen Andersen, mayor of Assens, on Funen Island, just off the Danish mainland.The handshake ceremonies, he said, were \u201cawkward\u201d and a \u201cmistaken way\u201d to show that people belonged in Denmark.Billy O\u2019Shea, an Irish translator living in Denmark since 1981, is waiting for an answer to his application for citizenship, but said he would give it up if he were forced to shake hands.\u201cRespect is not something you in a democratic country, can demand by threats,\u201d he wrote in an email exchange. \u201cRespect is something that occurs between equal citizens. We can\u2019t shake each other\u2019s hands if one of us are on our knees.\u201dTo achieve citizenship in Denmark, an immigrant must have legal residence for up to nine years, pass a Danish language test, have no record of serious crime, be financially self-sufficient, and pass a test on Danish politics, history and society.Ms. Stojberg, the immigration minister, who is a member of the center-right Venstre party, told Parliament that municipalities would face fines if they did not abide by the handshake law.A spokesman for The Council of Appeal, the body that oversees local government compliance with laws, said that the mere threat of a fine usually made municipalities comply, and that decades had passed without one being fined.In Aabenraa, Mayor Andresen said he regretted Danes\u2019 negativity about immigration, noting that the country had successfully integrated refugees from the former Yugoslavia, and had built close ties to Germany, a former enemy.\u201cI\u2019d be sad to see us portrayed as a xenophobic country and a xenophobic people.

{"Headline": "Patreon Bars Anti-Feminist for Racist Speech, Inciting Revolt", "Date": "2018-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySam Harris, the polemical atheist neuroscientist known for his popular podcast \u201cWaking Up,\u201d was making tens of thousands of dollars a month from fans who donated to him through Patreon, a crowdfunding site.That stopped this month. On Dec. 6, Patreon kicked the anti-feminist polemic Carl Benjamin, who works under the name Sargon of Akkad, off its site for using racist language on YouTube. That same week, it removed the right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos a day after he opened an account.\u201cThese recent expulsions seem more readily explained by political bias,\u201d Mr. Harris wrote to his followers.The furor is a microcosm of the conflicts that are playing out across the internet as technology platforms try to limit the spread of hateful speech.But as tech platforms try to get a handle on the issue, they are stoking the ire of their content creators, many of whom brand themselves as free speech warriors. Some accuse the companies of censorship. Others say the tech sites are biased and that hate speech is an ambiguous term. Now the digital dissent is becoming increasingly widespread, upending even smaller websites.\u201cThe concept of hate speech is irreducibly subjective and vague,\u201d said Nadine Strossen, author of \u201cHate: Why We Should Resist It With Free Speech, Not Censorship.\u201dWhile the site is relatively small, with a little over 100,000 creators and two million people donating monthly to those creators, it has become the de facto paycheck for a cohort of prominent self-styled internet philosophers who eschew or have been ousted from traditional bastions like universities or magazines.Among Patreon\u2019s hodgepodge of creators is the left-leaning podcast group Chapo Trap House, which makes more than $110,000 a month from the site, according to Graphtreon, which tracks Patreon activity. Mr. Peterson, a best-selling author, earns around $66,000 a month from the site. Sex-related content creators are also getting monthly subscribers on Patreon, and a Pokemon Go community is the top earner, making up to $500,000 a month, according to Graphetreon.Patreon takes a highly personal approach to policing speech. While Google and Facebook use algorithms as a first line of defense for questionable content, Patreon has human moderators. They give warnings and reach out to talk to offenders, presenting options for \u201ceducation\u201d and \u201creform.\u201d Some activists hope this will become a model for a better and kinder internet.\u201cThere are no automated takedowns,\u201d Mr. Conte said. \u201cAs a creator myself dealing with these big tech platforms and getting an automated takedown notice, there\u2019s no appeals process. You can\u2019t talk to a human. And I never want to do that.\u201dIf someone has breached Patreon\u2019s policy, the company contacts the offender with a specific plan, which usually involves asking for the content to be removed and for a public apology.The conversations with creators can quickly become complicated, nuanced, and, well, human, she said. Among other challenges, Patreon has to decide what qualifies as a sincere and thorough apology. Still, having human moderators has changed its users\u2019 behaviors more than simply deleting accounts would, Ms. Hart said.\u201cWe hand-hold creators, and we work with them one on one, and nearly every creator reforms \u2014 and so it\u2019s quite a successful process,\u201d she said.The work takes up a large amount of resources. Ms. Hart said around 10 percent of Patreon employees are dedicated to her team.On Dec. 6, the company told Mr. Benjamin that it would freeze his account and that he could appeal. Mr. Benjamin objected and said the video in question should not fall under Patreon\u2019s rules because it was on YouTube.For Mr. Benjamin, the timing was surprising. \u201cMy brand has been politically incorrect for years,\u201d he said in a video he later posted to his YouTube channel called \u201cThe Patreon Witch Trials.\u201dMr. Benjamin, who did not respond to requests for comment, has 870,000 subscribers on YouTube and had more than 3,000 subscribers on Patreon, from which he had been making around $12,000 a month. Many of his videos show just a static cartoon or a series of images, with his voice speaking against movements for gender equality.More recently, Mr. Benjamin has moved from the fringe toward the heart of the new right. In October, he posted an hourlong interview with Steve Bannon, President Trump\u2019s former chief strategist.Mr. Benjamin did not respond to attempts to engage him in the reform process, Ms. Hart said.\u201cHis response to us when we told him about the reform process was to nitpick and say, \u2018I was being anti-Nazi,\u2019\u201d Ms. Hart said. \u201cYou cannot say those words on our platform. It doesn\u2019t matter who you\u2019re directing them at.\u201dHis removal from Patreon immediately stirred up others on the site.\u201cI think the most likely outcome, if this continues, is that all contentious speech or behavior will put the speaker or actor at risk of serious financial and social sanctions, and strip them of all defense,\u201d Mr. Peterson wrote in an email.Mr. Rubin and Mr. Peterson said they plan to start their own version of Patreon, which will be less censorious. Mr. Peterson said his Patreon subscriptions had dropped to around 7,500, from about 10,000 over the summer, according to Graphtreon.And while many internet creators argue that Silicon Valley is trying to censor free speech, what the companies are doing is legal, said Vera Eidelman, staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s speech, privacy and technology project. \u201cThe First Amendment right is on the side of the company,\u201d she said.\u201cYou can use a press debacle like this to drum up your community and rile people up and get them to support a cause,\u201d Mr. Conte said. \u201cWe welcome competition.\u201dIn his exit note from Patreon, Mr. Harris, who gathered his fan base as a pugnacious atheist and fierce critic of Islam, wrote that he wanted his business interests to be freed from the site. He singled out Ms. Hart\u2019s team.\u201cI consider it no longer tenable to expose any part of my podcast funding to the whims of Patreon\u2019s \u2018Trust and Safety\u2019 committee,\u201d Mr. Harris wrote. He added a link to his own website, where fans can enter their credit card information and choose a monthly contribution.Advertisement"}

I was raised \u201cup the holler\u201d and know the culture intimately. You have no idea of the amount of anger, self-righteousness, bigotry and willful ignorance you\u2019re dealing with. I have seen a blighted small town use a corrupt sheriff and judge to run off a business owned by a black man. I have been present when an entire community looked the other way when a gay couple was burned out of their home. I was born in a tiny central Illinois town. When I was in third grade, my parents made the decision to move to Champaign-Urbana, Ill., so that my brother and I would have the opportunity for a much better education. It\u2019s ironic that small-town and rural folk take so much pride in self-sufficiency yet won\u2019t move to improve their prospects. In the 1930s the government began implementing economic policies intended to move people off farms and into manufacturing, such as mines and timber mills. Small-town factories kept rural areas afloat for a while but were among the first to close in the \u201970s and \u201980s. At the same time, the farms kept getting bigger. We are seeing the culmination of all that now. A bison commons would not be a stretch. Ecological restoration is an urgent need across vast stretches of rural America that have suffered from poor land use, extraction industries, invasive species, loss of native biodiversity and a blighting of the rural landscape. There are huge opportunities for employment in restoration: native plant and seed nurseries, stewardship of nature preserves, creation of native pollinator habitats, hunting properties, sustainable farming and outdoor recreation facilities are just some.

I didn\u2019t want to take her dignity away.So, we muddled through. I cooked elaborate meals for her, filling the house with the smells of childhood, which reminded us both of happier times. When I wasn\u2019t at the office, I was most often with her, telling stories, holding hands, helping her through the misery of chemotherapy. I brought her hats after she lost her hair, and soft clothes to make her as comfortable as I could.At one point, one of her doctors pulled me aside. \u201cHow\u2019s my D.A.?\u201d the doctor asked, referring to my role as the elected prosecutor of San Francisco. The question caught me off guard. I had been so focused on my mother\u2019s well-being, I hadn\u2019t made room for anything else. I started to choke up. I was scared. I was sad. Most of all, I wasn\u2019t ready.The doctor asked me if I had heard of \u201canticipatory grief.\u201d I hadn\u2019t, but the term made perfect sense. So much of me was in denial. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to believe that I was going to have to say goodbye. But underneath it, I was aware. And I had started grieving for my mother already.She ended up in the hospital not long after that. That was when I started to see another change. For as long as I could remember, my mother loved to watch the news and read the newspaper. When Maya and I were kids, she\u2019d insist we sit down in front of Walter Cronkite each night before dinner. But suddenly, she had no interest. Her mighty brain decided it had had enough.  She still had room for us, though. I remember that I had just entered the race for California attorney general and she asked me how it was going.\u201cMommy, these guys are saying they\u2019re going to kick my ass,\u201d I told her.She rolled over and looked at me and unveiled the biggest smile. She knew who she\u2019d raised. She knew her fighting spirit was alive and well inside me.My mother died on Feb. 11, 2009, two months after her 70th birthday. One of the last questions she asked the hospice nurse was, \u201cAre my daughters going to be O.K.?\u201d She was focused on being our mother until the very end.And though I miss her every day, I carry her with me wherever I go. I think of the battles she fought, the values she taught me, her commitment to improve health care for us all. There is no title or honor on earth I\u2019ll treasure more than to say I am Shyamala Gopalan Harris\u2019s daughter. As I continue the battle for a better health care system, I do so in her name.Kamala D. Harris is a Democratic senator from California and the author of the forthcoming book \u201cThe Truths We Hold: An American Journey,\u201d from which this essay is adapted. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hwaban Is the Modern Korean Restaurant Where You\u2019d Take Your Mother", "Date": "2018-12-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRestaurant Review10 PhotosMore often than not, the audience for these items is young. Youth, in fact, has been a key part of the story of how kimchi and other dishes spread from immigrants\u2019 kitchens to the Instagram feeds of diners without a single Korean ancestor. You might get a Chonut at Smorgasburg with your roommate, take down a bo ssam at Momofuku Ssam Bar with your friends from college and sit at Atomix\u2019s U-shaped counter to celebrate your first anniversary.The dining room is spare, sleek and uncontroversial. The brick walls have a recent coat of white paint, and there is plenty of light by which to read the menus. The banquettes and benches have gentle curves and soothing neutral colors. The only vaguely menacing items in sight are the canteloupe-size eyeballs hanging on the walls, but they turn out to be high-tech speakers, and the cocktail jazz they play never rises above a murmur.Just inside the front door is a lattice of shelves holding simple, geometric bowls and teaware. These give Hwaban the look of a cloistered Parisian salon de th\u00e9, which it resembles in other ways as well. Exceptional green tea from South Korea is brewed along with tisanes \u2014 made from mulberry leaves, mistletoe stems or dried wild pears \u2014 that Korean mothers brew in winter for sneezing and sniffling children.The illusion that you\u2019ve wandered into a tearoom somewhere on the Right Bank is extended by the drinks list, which has only two Korean sojus and a handful of Japanese sakes but several pages of wines from France. The rest of the menu is unmistakably Korean, and very often it is based on Korean family cooking.\u201cThis is my mother\u2019s recipe,\u201d Mihyun Han, who owns the restaurant with her husband, Key Kim, will say on one of her frequent circuits around the tables.She said it one night about the shaggy white meatball of chicken, tofu and mushrooms \u2014 the menu calls it a dumpling \u2014 sitting in a warm and transfixing soy-milk broth. Another time, she was talking about what she calls \u201csnowy bibimbap,\u201d a gentle, agreeable wintertime variation on the classic rice dish made with strands of mung bean jelly and shaved burdock, bellflower root, and other vegetables in shades of ivory, cream and bone.The chef, Woong Jang, does very fine work in white. One of Hwaban\u2019s most luxurious dishes is a length of king crab leg with spinach and a poached egg, all surrounded in a rich pine-nut sauce the color of hotel sheets.One of two pork belly dishes on the menu involves ssamjang, the potent soy-chile paste now sold in supermarkets throughout the land, but the other does not. In that one, you eat a slice of simmered pork belly together with a pickled mushroom and a square of cabbage kimchi.The service style is similar at Hwaban, but it plays better there. A meal at Hwaban is also about three times less expensive, at $55 for an appetizer and two main courses. The mains are served at the same time, which Ms. Han says is her attempt to reproduce the abundance of Korean family tables like her mother\u2019s.Her mother also gets credit for the two-sided fritters of minced shrimp pressed against zucchini coins on the short \u00e0 la carte menu. They\u2019re served with a crisp pair of fried shrimp and little cubes of jelly that melt into dipping sauce on contact with the warm fritters. The same soy jelly accompanies a kimchi-jeon that\u2019s topped with browned mozzarella \u2014 in other words, a kimchi pizza. It would fit right in at Smorgasburg.Advertisement"}

Humbled, in fact. But knowing that the cruelty of our elections process would ultimately splash back on people whom Diane and I love, but who hadn\u2019t signed up for the journey, was more than I could ask,\u201d Mr. Patrick said in the statement. He did not specify who he was referring to.In an interview with WBUR in Boston on Thursday morning, Mr. Patrick also said his wife had been diagnosed with stage 1 uterine cancer and had undergone surgery. \u201cHer prognosis is excellent,\u201d he said, according to a tweet by WBUR. \u201cWe thank God and the doctors at M.G.H. for that.\u201dIt was never entirely clear that Mr. Patrick was on board for a grueling presidential election. He had also expressed some reluctance about a possible presidential run, telling David Axelrod, a former Obama adviser, that he wasn\u2019t sure there was a place for him.Mr. Patrick\u2019s decision was first reported by Politico on Tuesday. He did not make the announcement Wednesday due to the national day of mourning for President George H.W. Bush.Since leaving the governor\u2019s office in 2015, Mr. Patrick has been a managing director for Bain Capital, running a $390 million fund designed to invest in socially-responsible businesses.Already, social media memes had appeared attacking Mr. Patrick\u2019s Bain connection.Steve Elmendorf, a Washington lobbyist and former Democratic operative, said the large field of candidates said to be considering a run for the Democratic nomination will likely shrink dramatically.\u201cAs they look at the enormity of it and the money and the staff, and the fact that Donald Trump will begin attacking you immediately and \u2014 do you really want to do this?

His wife, Diane, a labor attorney, had been hospitalized with depression early in his first term as governor under the weight of negative media articles. She first entered the hospital under an assumed name but later openly discussed her illness. Mr. Patrick had recounted the episode in his 2011 book \u201cA Reason to Believe.\u201d\u201cShe hated the campaign and wanted to have a limited role,\u201d said Dan Payne, a Massachusetts political consultant who was involved in Mr. Patrick\u2019s first race.Mr. Patrick was also one of several African-American politicians who were considering a Democratic nomination bid. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and Senator Kamala Harris of California are expected to announce their intentions in the coming weeks.Advertisement"}

At the core of their questions was a concern over the company\u2019s commitment to free expression.\u201cAll of these topics \u2014 competition, censorship, bias and others \u2014 point to one fundamental question that demands the nation\u2019s attention,\u201d said Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House Republican leader. \u201cAre America\u2019s technology companies serving as instruments of freedom or instruments of control?\u201d\u201cBecause a free world depends on a free internet, we need to know that Google is on the side of the free world,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said.Representative Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee, highlighted the importance of scrutinizing Google because of the company\u2019s market power in search, cloud-based email and its Android mobile operating system.Mr. Goodlatte also raised concerns that the liberal-leaning political biases of employees may also affect filtering decisions for its search engine. He mentioned a leaked video the day after the 2016 presidential election showing top officials lamenting the victory of President Trump.\u201cThis committee is very interested in what justifies filtering,\u201d Mr. Goodlatte said. \u201cGiven the revelation that top executives at Google have discussed how the results of the 2016 elections do not comply with Google\u2019s values, these questions have become all the more important.\u201dMr. McCarthy is among several Republican members who have made online political bias a talking point in campaign fund-raisers. Claims of anti-conservative bias within the technology of Google, Facebook and Twitter have been disputed by numerous technologists and academics.Democrats had their own set of tough questions for Mr. Pichai on privacy and the company\u2019s competitive practices. But they also expressed frustration with the political bias claims.\u201cI must dispense with the complete illegitimate fantasy dreamed up by some conservatives that Google and other platforms have anti-conservative bias,\u201d said Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the top Democrat on the committee.Officials were expected to be merciless for Mr. Pichai\u2019s first appearance before Congress. When he declined to appear in a Senate hearing in September, lawmakers called the act \u201carrogant,\u201d and they put out an empty chair in his absence.Though lawmakers asked Mr. Pichai a variety of pointed questions, they also lauded Google as an American icon.\u201cYour company should really be held out as a success story of America\u2019s free enterprise system,\u201d said Representative Keith Rothfus, a Republican of Pennsylvania.\u201cDespite the nature and scope of today\u2019s hearing, Google is still the story of the American dream,\u201d Mr. Goodlatte said.\u201cWe do not want to impose burdensome regulations on your industry,\u201d said Representative Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana.Going into a third hour of the hearing, Republicans offered little detail on how they would follow up on concerns about privacy and anti-conservative bias.Democrats, in large part, defended the company of political bias claims.Representative Ted Lieu, Democrat of California, said negative news coverage of members like Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa, were perhaps the result of his views on immigration.\u201cDon\u2019t blame Google or Facebook or Twitter, consider blaming yourself,\u201d Mr. Lieu said.During Mr. Pichai\u2019s testimony, the first question from Mr. Goodlatte was about whether consumers understand the frequency and amount of location data that Google collects from its Android operating system.The sharpest exchange came when Representative Ted Poe, Republican of Texas, held up his smartphone and asked Mr. Pichai whether Google was tracking his whereabouts if he walked to the other side of the room.Mr. Pichai said, \u201cnot by default,\u201d adding that it depended on the congressman\u2019s settings on the apps he had installed. But when Mr. Pichai would not respond yes or no, Mr. Poe raised his voice and said Mr. Pichai appeared to be evading his question.\u201cYou make $100 million a year,\u201d he said to Mr. Pichai, who is one of the highest-paid executives in the technology industry. \u201cYou should be able to answer that question,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m shocked you don\u2019t know. I think Google obviously does.\u201dBefore the hearing, Google\u2019s critics drew attention to their grievances against the company that became fodder for lawmakers.\u201cBut just as Google wants to convince the public that it can handle consumer privacy matters behind closed doors,\u201d the employee group wrote, \u201cit tells the same to its employees by forcing arbitration, requiring them to waive their right to sue or participate in a class-action lawsuit in all cases of discrimination.\u201dSeparately, more than 50 human rights organizations signed a letter to Mr. Pichai demanding that the company stop working on Project Dragonfly, the initiative within Google to build a censored search engine that it may use in the Chinese market. A search engine that restricts content banned by the Chinese government is \u201ctroubling,\u201d the groups said, because it would contribute to repressive censorship and surveillance.Google has eight products with more than one billion monthly users, including search, YouTube and Google Drive, its suite of productivity apps. But a product that has struggled to amass users provided fodder for questions from lawmakers about Google\u2019s handling of user data.Google announced on Monday that it found a security vulnerability last month in Google Plus, the company\u2019s answer to Facebook. The problem exposed the personal information of 52 million users to third-party developers even if the users had set their information to private. Google said it had no evidence that any developers were aware of or had misused the vulnerability during the six days that the bug existed. Google said it would now move up the timing of when it plans to shutter the consumer version of Google Plus, to April from August.In October, Google announced that it found a similar security issue with Google Plus. Google found this vulnerability in March but did not report it immediately, waiting seven months to disclose the bug because it had found no evidence that anyone had exploited the problem to obtain user information. However, it brought new light to questions about how big technology companies handle user data.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How \u2018Subtle Asian Traits\u2019 Became a Global Hit", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA group of Asian-Australian students started a Facebook group to share jokes and memes about their experiences. Now, it has nearly a million followers all over the world.SYDNEY, Australia \u2014 The Facebook group was supposed to be a fun distraction from high school exams.Its creators, a crew of Melbourne students who had bonded over weekends in Chinese language school, had noticed a Facebook group called \u201cSubtle Private School Traits.\u201d They started joking about their own experiences: the struggles and joys of being a first-generation immigrant. \u201cWe were like, what if we made a \u2018Subtle Asian Traits\u2019 page,\u201d said Anne Gu, 18.The concept was simple: Share jokes about the traits, subtle or otherwise, that characterized the Asian-Australian experience, from cultural clashes with parents and the sanctity of bubble milk tea, to the groan-worthy pickup lines from white men on dating apps. (Are you from Asia? Because I\u2019m China get your number.)In September, they created a Facebook group and added their friends, expecting it would live and die within the young, Asian community in Melbourne. But as memes and jokes flowed, the follower count soared. Now, it\u2019s edging close to 1 million followers, spawning spinoffs, and catapulting the conversation to the United States, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong and the Netherlands.\u201cIt kept on growing and we couldn\u2019t believe it ourselves,\u201d said Ms. Gu. \u201cIt\u2019s tapped into something.\u201d Powered by global immigration and the borderless procrastination magnet of social media, the Facebook group has become a gathering place for laughs and reflection on the complicated experience of first generation Asian immigrants who have grown up reconciling the expectations of their heritage and the identity of the country they call home. \u201cWe\u2019ve been brought up in the in-between,\u201d said Angela Kang, 21, another co-founder. And in the group that background is the norm.\u201cEveryone\u2019s just more supportive,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone understands.\u201dAnne Gu recalled a memory that reflects the kind of experiences driving the group. One day at her private high school, her teacher discovered she didn\u2019t speak Mandarin or Cantonese at home, but Shanghainese \u2014 one of more than 100 dialects. \u201cHe stopped the whole class and asked if everyone knew there was a different dialect,\u201d she said.She said she doesn\u2019t mind that her friends ask her about her heritage, although answering questions can be \u201ca bit tedious.\u201d The endless stream of memes in the \u201cSubtle Asian Traits\u201d group provides relief \u2014 it\u2019s a chance to belong for once without having to try. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to explain stuff,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard because part of us wants to fit in and be in the crowd and be like them,\u201d said Ms. Gu, of Anglo-Australians. \u201cI\u2019ve felt sad about who we are, where we come from, and just the identity that we hold.\u201dAnd in Subtle Asian Traits, those differences are not so different after all; they\u2019re the norm.These memes \u2014 witty, visual and catered to the audience \u2014 have powered the group\u2019s explosive growth by allowing self-reflection. \u201cMemes express a culture\u2019s belief, they tell its stories, they pass along these narratives from person to person,\u201d said Dr. Justine Humphry, a lecturer in digital cultures at the University of Sydney. The simple act itself of sharing a meme and being able to decode it positions people as insiders within a culture, she added.\u201cThose kinds of practices \u2014 of sharing and creating jokes that are readable within a community \u2014 are actually very, very powerful,\u201d she said. Underneath the humor, weightier issues have become a topic of group discussion, such as the differing expressions of love across cultures and families. One woman shared a meme from the group with her mother, which led to a surprising conversation.\u201cSubtle Asian Traits got me my first \u2018I love you\u2019 from my mom so I\u2019d like to thank you all for that,\u201d she posted.Careful moderation of the group, which has set its tone, is a key factor of the group\u2019s success, said Dr. Humphry. Members wanting to submit content to Subtle Asian Traits must first have their post approved by an administrator.\u201cThey provide a place where these kinds of conversations can be a lot more playful and a lot more experimental,\u201d she said.These days, about 3,000 posts daily keep the moderators busy, with all pitching in.Ms. Kang often scrolls through posts while on the train to university. Some days, she will sit at the computer for hours, approving posts, with the volume not dropping. \u201cBy the time I approve one post, four posts will come in,\u201d she said.Some people in the group have criticized Subtle Asian Traits for being too focused on the Chinese and Vietnamese diaspora. \u201cWe have noticed that, we\u2019re not going to deny that,\u201d said Ms. Kang, adding most of the posts they receive are for those communities, though they are encouraging other communities to contribute. The group\u2019s founders say they are keeping a close eye on the fun. They are screening posts for racism and even clamping down on memes referring to \u201cgweilo,\u201d a Cantonese slur for white people. People of all ethnicities are welcome in the group so long as they abide by the rules. \u201cWe want to keep it as a safe space for everyone,\u201d said Ms. Gu.For its creators, both the challenges and the success of the group are shocking. They have already received several offers to buy the group. For now, they have all refused. \u201cI\u2019m not in it for the money, I\u2019m not greedy,\u201d said Ms. Kang, a third-year university student who is studying to be in the medical imaging field. \u201cWe\u2019re just a group of teenagers doing it for fun.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Mother and Daughter\u2019s Unlikely Journey as Migrant Workers", "Date": "2018-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bylensXyza Bacani and her mother were migrant domestic workers who left their home in the Philippines for Hong Kong. She photographed her mother\u2019s path and the effect it had on their family. Seated in her eight-room apartment, in a wealthy section of Hong Kong, Kathryn Louey stared quietly at her copy of Xyza Bacani\u2019s first book, \u201cWe Are Like Air,\u201d studying the words and photographs carefully. When she finished, she sought out Xyza\u2019s mother, Georgia, who was in another room of the apartment they share, and the two hugged and cried together.These were not just tears of joy.This book is largely about Georgia\u2019s life story \u2014 as a Filipino domestic worker trafficked and mistreated in Singapore for two years before she ran away and found a safe haven with Ms. Louey, her kind and generous employer in Hong Kong, for the past 20 years.Xyza recalls Georgia leaving abruptly with a small bag and 20 Philippine pesos (about 40 cents in American currency). Xyza\u2019s father, Villamor, was away Monday through Friday as a construction worker, and Xyza did not know how to cook or care for her brother and sister. \u201cI was confused at first,\u201d she said, \u201cand then I missed her so much. I didn\u2019t know what to do with my younger brother and sister.\u201dBefore Georgia left the Philippines, Xyza said, Villamor had worked in Saudi Arabia for two years and was horribly mistreated. He escaped, but without the money his employer had promised, which meant the family\u2019s farm in Nueva Vizcaya was at risk if it could not pay back a loan for its land. So in 1996, Georgia decided she would have to work as a domestic helper in Singapore to save the farm. Despite being mistreated in Singapore and missing her children desperately, Georgia put on a brave front and wrote in occasional letters that she was doing well. The initial letter Xyza received contained a photo of her mother during their first Christmas season apart and sticks like a thorn in her memory.\u201cShe was holding a gift next to a Christmas tree, and she was smiling,\u201d Xyza recalled. \u201cI felt really angry at her \u2014 that she had left us for a better life. I\u2019m ashamed that I was angry at her for a very long time because I didn\u2019t understand what she went through.\u201dGeorgia eventually fled her difficult situation in Singapore and made her way to Hong Kong, where she found Ms. Louey, a wealthy Chinese-Australian woman. A decade later Xyza, who felt a responsibility to help her younger siblings go to college, asked to join her mother in her work. It was difficult to rebuild a relationship after more than a decade apart. Xyza resented when Georgia tried to give her motherly advice or show her what to do at work. But she discovered that her mother always stayed in and never bought anything for herself so that she could send more money home.\u201cSlowly I realized how much she sacrificed for us,\u201d Xyza said. \u201cThen I became nicer to her and our relationship grew.\u201dEvery week on her day off, Xyza explored Hong Kong, marveling at the kinetic city. In 2009, she asked Ms. Louey to buy her a camera. At first, Xyza took photos to show her mother what she was missing in Hong Kong by staying inside. But, slowly, photography became a form of expression, too.Xyza quickly became known as a \u201cnanny photographer\u201d \u2014 a modern-day Vivian Maier, the street photographer whom Xyza had never heard of. Her story, and photographs, also drew attention from migrant domestic workers, many of whom wrote to her that her success gave them hope.Xyza\u2019s next chapter was to document the trafficked migrant workers in Singapore, with a grant by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting. While it was difficult at times to get access from employees, the migrant workers welcomed Xyza like a sister who understood them and with whom they could share intimate stories.\u201cPeople have a stereotype of migrant workers, but they are more than victims of circumstances \u2014 they are also champions of the family they serve and their families left behind who they support,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are like air: They\u2019re not seen but if they were not there, wealthy societies would not function.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the hardest work that I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d Xyza said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m photographing other people there is still some distance. I empathize with them, but the pain is not direct. When I was photographing my family, I share their pain, and there are many tears.\u201dIt was so emotional for Xyza that some of her photos were blurry \u2014 not for artistic effect, but because her hands were shaking. Her parents had rarely shared their experiences with their children, but making this book opened up floodgates of experiences and emotions \u2014 as well as many revealing conversations. The book and exhibit have also informed Ms. Louey about Georgia, the woman she has lived with for 20 years. After reading the book and seeing the photos, Ms. Louey realized how difficult it was for Georgia to be away from her husband, Villamor.

{"Headline": "Italy and 3 Other Nations Arrest Members of Mafia", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 The Italian authorities have arrested 46 members of the Sicilian Mafia, including top leaders in the Palermo area, as part of a sweeping international operation spanning Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.The Italian arrests were announced on Tuesday, nipping in the bud an attempt to re-establish a ruling mob council for the province. One of those arrested was Settimio Mineo, 80, whom top mobsters from the area chose this year as the council\u2019s leader, officials said.Mr. Mineo, the mob capo, or chief, of Palermo\u2019s Pagliarelli district, was arrested along with the heads of the Villabate, Belmonte Mezzagno and Porta Nuova districts, as well as the bosses of 10 Mafia families from Palermo and the surrounding region, Italian officials said in a statement.The four senior Mafia leaders have all served prison time.The council, known as the Cupola in Mafia-speak, aimed to coordinate illegal activities among the area\u2019s principal crime families and make joint decisions on important issues, finding strength in numbers. The Sicilian Mafia had such a structure for decades, until it collapsed in the 1990s.On Wednesday, 90 other people were arrested in Italy, Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands. They were believed to be part of a southern Italian criminal group known as the \u2019Ndrangheta and involved in cocaine trafficking, money laundering, bribery and violence, according to Eurojust, the European Union\u2019s Judicial Cooperation Unit.The arrests on Tuesday were the culmination of a two-year investigation by anti-Mafia prosecutors in Palermo aided by the Carabinieri, Italy\u2019s military police force. The charges included association with the Mafia, illegal gun possession, arson and extortion, Italian officials said.\u201cThis investigation takes us back in time\u201d and to the \u201creaffirmation of the old rules of Cosa Nostra\u201d under unified leadership, the Palermo prosecutor Francesco Lo Voi said at a news conference on Tuesday.Col. Antonio Di Stasio, the Carabinieri provincial commander who oversaw the police role in the case, said the arrests aimed to take the wind out of the nascent organization\u2019s sails.\u201cThere is strength in numbers \u2014 that\u2019s why we had to make these arrests, to stop illicit activities that could have been carried out because of the power that the Cupola gave its members,\u201d he said in a telephone interview.Sicily\u2019s Cosa Nostra first devised the Cupola structure in the 1950s. It was radically co-opted at the beginning of the 1980s when Salvatore Riina, known as Tot\u00f2, a ruthless mobster from the town of Corleone, muscled his way to the top of the Mafia and essentially ran the roost on his own.Under his watch, the Cupola adopted a strategy of attacking institutions and authorities, including the killings, in quick succession, of the top anti-Mafia prosecutors Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino in 1992.Though behind bars, Mr. Riina remained the Mafia\u2019s nominal chief.After Mr. Riina\u2019s death, investigators who had been looking into a series of extortion attempts noticed a \u201cgreat ferment\u201d among local mobsters, and an escalation of meetings between mob bosses in Palermo and its hinterland. On May 29, they assembled in a secret location to elect Mr. Mineo as their leader.\u201cThey named the oldest member as a sign of respect\u201d as well as a sign that the new crop of mobsters had chosen to adhere to the established rules of Cosa Nostra, Colonel Di Stasio said.The Cupola, the mobsters determined, would meet periodically to deal with pressing issues, including choosing local leaders, resolving disputes and punishing those who had transgressed.\u201cIn six months, they managed to reorganize under traditional rules,\u201d Colonel Di Stasio said.Italy\u2019s chief anti-Mafia prosecutor, Federico Cafiero De Raho, said that Mr. Mineo\u2019s election showed that the center of power in the Mafia had returned from Corleone to Palermo, the capital city on the northwestern coast of Sicily. Corleone, Mr. Riina\u2019s home base, is a small town in the interior, made famous by the main character of Mario Puzo\u2019s 1969 novel, \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d who was named after the place.On his Facebook page, Mayor Leoluca Orlando of Palermo praised investigators. \u201cContinuing to attack the mafia\u2019s military force and economic power is indispensable for guaranteeing freedom and democracy,\u201d he wrote.Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, writing on Twitter, called the sweep an \u201cextraordinary operation.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Bush and Donald Trump. As the longtime chief executive of and main creative force behind Fox News, Ailes can be credited not only with changing the nature of political discourse in this country, but also with making a large number of Americans, left and right, significantly angrier. And his career ended after a surge of sexual-harassment allegations and accusations that he had fostered a misogynistic boy\u2019s-club culture at Fox News \u2014 a scandal that forced him from the channel in 2016, a little less than a year before his death.A childhood friend, the actor Austin Pendleton, hypothesizes that Ailes\u2019s hemophilia, which left him at risk of bleeding to death, helped give him an understanding of the fears of others. But Bloom also paints him as a man with an unquenchable, irrational thirst for power. Some of the most eye-opening sections in the film concern Ailes\u2019s forays into town-level politics in Putnam County, N.Y., where he lived and became the owner of a local newspaper, an endeavor worthy enough of his time that he stands accused here of monitoring an employee\u2019s Facebook messages. (\u201cI was just the copy editor,\u201d Alison Rooney says. \u201cWhy does he care?\u201d)Working in a style that owes a lot to Errol Morris (a description of Ailes\u2019s having thrown a chair is accompanied by imagery of a flying chair), Bloom has assembled footage that seems chilling in retrospect. We see clips of scenes that Ailes helped stage to portray awkward politicians like Nixon and Mitch McConnell as men of the people. There is a cringe-inducing conversation between Ailes and Charlie Rose in which Ailes jokes that if you want to have political influence and still get away with womanizing, journalism is the career for you. The former Fox News correspondent David Shuster suggests that Ailes\u2019s contempt toward Bill Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky scandal \u2014 a story that Fox News flogged relentlessly \u2014 stemmed not just from political differences but from Ailes\u2019s perception that Clinton was sloppy for getting caught. A crisis manager quotes Ailes\u2019s wife as saying he was more important than the country.Some important matters are inevitably, and frustratingly, left on the table. Fox News\u2019s growth during the George W. Bush administration \u2014 in spreading fear after Sept. 11 and in trumpeting the Iraq war \u2014 could have used more screen time. But you leave \u201cDivide and Conquer\u201d energized and incensed, and with a grudging admiration for Ailes\u2019s pugnacious instincts.

{"Headline": "TikTok, a Chinese Video App, Brings Fun Back to Social Media", "Date": "2018-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftAbout an hour after downloading TikTok, the popular video-sharing app, I experienced a bizarre sensation, one I haven\u2019t felt in a long time while on the internet. The knot in my chest loosened, my head felt injected with helium, and the corners of my mouth crept upward into a smile.TikTok \u2014 a quirky hybrid of Snapchat, the defunct video app Vine and the TV segment \u201cCarpool Karaoke\u201d \u2014 is a refreshing outlier in the social media universe. A so-called challenge video on TikTok, from the user @spellmantwinz, which encouraged users to make videos of themselves chomping down on food to the beat of a song.There are no ads. There\u2019s no news, unless you count learning about viral dance crazes. There are few preening Instagram models hawking weight-loss tea, and a distinct lack of crazy uncles posting Infowars clips.Instead, TikTok \u2014 a Chinese-made app that was known as Musical.ly until ByteDance, the Chinese internet conglomerate, acquired the company in 2017 and merged it with a video app it owned \u2014 has a simple premise. Users create short videos set to music, often lip-syncing along, dancing or acting out short skits. The app contains templates and visual effects to spice up the videos. There is also a live-streaming feature that allows users to send virtual \u201cgifts\u201d to their favorite creators, which can be bought with real money. The rest works like any other social app \u2014 followers, hashtags, likes and comments.It doesn\u2019t sound like much. But, somehow, it adds up to what might well be the only truly pleasant social network in existence.I feel comfortable making that call because I go on social networks for a living, and I have spent thousands of hours wading through an unholy slurry of Twitter spammers, Instagram scammers, teenage YouTube fascists and baby boomers whose brains have been turned to pudding by too many Facebook memes.TikTok has none of that. Instead, it\u2019s that rarest of internet creatures: a place where people can let down their guards, act silly with their friends and sample the fruits of human creativity without being barraged by abusive trolls or algorithmically amplified misinformation. It\u2019s a throwback to a time before the commercialization of internet influence, when web culture consisted mainly of harmless weirdos trying to make each other laugh.\u201cIt\u2019s a safe haven for people that are seeing the world on fire and being like, \u2018I need silliness,\u2019\u201d he said.TikTok\u2019s global head of marketing, Stefan Heinrich, said in a statement that the company\u2019s mission was to \u201ccapture and present the world\u2019s creativity, knowledge and moments that matter, directly from the mobile phone.\u201dBefore I go any further, let\u2019s get one thing out of the way: If you\u2019re reading this, you are almost certainly too old to feel at home on TikTok. The company declined to provide information about its users, but judging from what\u2019s on the platform, the median TikTok user seems to hover in the midteens. TikTok is full of acne-studded faces, barely concealed tween angst and impenetrable youth-culture references. As far as I can tell, there is no way for adults to use it without feeling as if they are chaperoning a high school dance.\u201cIt\u2019s clearly a really popular, cool site, but you also have the issue of kids being significantly too young for it,\u201d said James P. Steyer, the chief executive of Common Sense Media, a nonprofit that reviews tech products for families. \u201cIt\u2019s not that the content on TikTok isn\u2019t O.K. for your 15-year-old. It\u2019s what happens to your 6- or 7-year-old.\u201dWhile using TikTok, I never saw examples of bullying or harassment. (Both of which are prohibited by TikTok\u2019s community guidelines, as is sexually explicit content.) There are, however, a decent number of videos featuring teenage girls dancing suggestively \u2014 which, if you are a 31-year-old newspaper columnist and not a 16-year-old boy, is fairly unsettling.A TikTok spokeswoman said in a statement that promoting safety and positivity on the platform is \u201cour top priority.\u201d She added, \u201cwe periodically add to and adjust our protective measures, policies and moderation efforts to support the well-being of our users.\u201dIs TikTok a Facebook killer? No, probably not. For all the variety in its videos, it is still a fairly limited app, with a more narrow appeal than more populist social platforms.But by purposely limiting its features, by resisting the temptation to monetize its users aggressively and by keeping trolls and bullies off its platform, TikTok has done something truly impressive \u2014 it has built a social network that is genuinely fun to use.There might be a lesson there.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "An Insect Flees Danger. Suddenly, It Picks Up a Tiny Hitchhiker. ", "Date": "2018-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesWhen running for safety, aphid nymphs crawl onto the backs of their elders. The adult aphids don\u2019t seem to like it. A spring-green aphid clambers over a clot of soil, busily making its way to the shelter of a forest of plants in the distance. The insect\u2019s long legs help it lever itself over the uneven ground at surprising speed, but if you look closely at its back, you\u2019ll see that it has a passenger: A tiny juvenile aphid, or nymph, is riding the adult cowboy-style.Aphids generally prefer to stay in their airy roosts among the foliage of their host plants, said ecologists Moshe Gish and Moshe Inbar of the University of Haifa in Israel, the paper\u2019s authors. The insects drop to the ground mainly when they sense serious, unavoidable danger, heralded by the plant\u2019s trembling and the warm breath of a grazing mammal intent on devouring their home.Once they hit the ground, they are vulnerable to other predators, and so they rush to make it to a new host. While studying this behavior, the researchers noticed the peculiar sight of the young riding their elders.To study the strategy more closely, they arranged a bare patch of earth surrounded by a ring of plants. Then, they held a potted plant bearing a thriving colony of aphids over the arena, shook it gently, and exhaled on it, prompting the insects to drop. With cameras rolling and the clock ticking, the researchers watched the aphids begin their march to shelter.Many nymphs headed straight for adults and tried to climb aboard. When they clung to the adults\u2019 legs or lower back, the adults shook them off, or tried to. The cowboy riding position, with the nymph centered on the adult\u2019s upper back, seemed to be a sort of compromise.\u201cThat was actually the least irritating position for the adult,\u201d said Dr. Gish.The senior aphids wasted time trying to get the young off as the nymphs crawled on their antennas and limbs, but once a nymph got all the way up into that spot, an adult was likely to cut its losses and just start moving toward the plants.Rider nymphs reached safety about four times faster than nymphs walking on their own, suggesting that the behavior aids in their survival. Adults bearing a nymph, once they actually started walking, were no slower than adults without passengers.\u201cWe would expect that this added burden on the adult would slow it down, but actually it\u2019s not that much,\u201d said Dr. Gish.You might think that the adults, despite their irritation, are carrying the young out of some instinct to save their families. But experiments with groups of aphids whose members were closely related and groups with a variety of different genetic backgrounds showed no difference in the behavior. Even if it is not pleasant for the adults, however, the behavior probably does help the group survive in the long run, said Dr. Gish.\u201cFor the nymphs, it\u2019s life or death,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the adult, even if it does slow them down a little bit, it\u2019s probably not that significant.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They are often brought by lawyers claiming to police public morals by regulating attire, behavior and even jokes under the guise of protecting a brittle version of Egyptian nationalism.But sometimes the charges stick, resulting in prisons sentences for entertainers convicted of breaching public morals. The prosecutions have had a chilling effect on free speech at a time when Egypt\u2019s news media is largely under the sway of Mr. Sisi, and his government has engaged in a harsh crackdown on the gay community.Egypt\u2019s overcrowded prisons currently include a singer who was imprisoned for making lewd gestures in a pop video, and a female human rights activist who had broadcast a profanity-laced video on Facebook about being sexually harassed in public.Women\u2019s dress has always been a fault line in the culture wars of Egypt, where the tradition of belly dancing inspires both admiration and revulsion.The dress that Ms. Youssef wore at the film festival \u2014 a semitransparent outfit that exposed most of her legs \u2014 led some Egyptians to support her prosecution.Others said the case revealed the mind-set of the men who had brought the charges, using a law that allows one Egyptian to file a lawsuit against another for vague crimes like immorality and \u201cinsulting\u201d the nation.Ms. Youssef apologized for wearing the dress and stressed that she respected Egyptian cultural and moral values. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect this reaction, and if I had known, I wouldn\u2019t have worn this dress,\u201d she said in a statement.Mr. Sabry, who supports Mr. Sisi, has also brought lawsuits against the president\u2019s political opponents, including members of the Muslim Brotherhood.In 2013, many Egyptians supported the military takeover that brought Mr. Sisi to power out of fear that the Muslim Brotherhood, whose leader, Mohammed Morsi, was ousted from power, would restrict women\u2019s rights and social freedoms. On Sunday, some noted acerbically on Twitter that those same rights had been eroded under Mr. Sisi.Charges against public figures involving morality or nationalism often move at a brisk pace \u2014 Ms. Youssef is due in court on Jan. 12 \u2014 while political prisoners or detained journalists languish in jail for years, awaiting trial in cases that proceed at a crawl.It also overshadowed the Cairo film festival, which was celebrating its 40th year and awarded its Golden Pyramid prize to the film \u201cA Twelve-Year Night.\u201dAs for Ms. Youssef, she will most likely hope that her coming court case does not become an example of life imitating art.Mohamed Ezz contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why the F.T.C. Is Taking a New Look at Facebook Privacy ", "Date": "2018-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter a yearlong string of news reports that have called Facebook\u2019s data-sharing practices into question, federal regulators are taking a hard look at how the social media company handles the personal information of its users.It is not the first time Facebook has drawn government scrutiny. About seven years ago, after charges were leveled by the Federal Trade Commission, the company made an agreement with the agency to overhaul its privacy practices. That agreement, called a consent decree, provides a road map for how the F.T.C. is likely to scrutinize Facebook over the coming months.In 2007, Facebook introduced Facebook Beacon, a program that broadcast details on users\u2019 online purchases to their friends, initially allowing users to opt out of sharing their purchases only on a case-by-case basis. At the end of 2009, a coalition of nonprofit consumer and privacy groups, led by the Electronic Privacy Information Center, petitioned the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Facebook\u2019s handling of user data. In 2011, the F.T.C. filed charges against Facebook that said the company had deceived consumers about their privacy.The F.T.C.\u2019s complaint charged Facebook with a number of deceptive privacy practices. Among them:\u25a0 Facebook shared users\u2019 personal details with advertisers even though the company had promised not to do so, the agency said.\u25a0 Facebook allowed third-party apps that users had installed to have access to nearly all of their personal data \u2014 even though Facebook had stated the apps could obtain only the personal information they needed to operate, the agency said.\u25a0 The agency said Facebook claimed it certified the security practices of apps participating in its \u201cVerified Apps program,\u201d but the company did not do so.The agency ordered Facebook to put a comprehensive privacy program in place to protect the privacy and confidentiality of users\u2019 information and to manage the risks of existing and new products. It also required Facebook over the next 20 years to undergo biennial audits by an independent third party to certify that the privacy program was properly protecting the information of the company\u2019s users.The voter-profiling company obtained the data from a researcher who had offered a personality survey app on Facebook. Although only about 270,000 Facebook users agreed to share their data to participate in the survey, the Facebook platform enabled the app to improperly harvest the personal details of millions of those users\u2019 friends \u2014 consumers who had not agreed to share their information with the survey app, The Times reported.Privacy experts, law professors and at least one former F.T.C. official have argued that Facebook\u2019s failure to prevent the survey app from obtaining the data of users\u2019 friends violated the federal consent agreement. So did Facebook\u2019s failure to prevent the app developer from sharing both users\u2019 data and the data of users\u2019 friends with Cambridge Analytica, these critics said.They said the Cambridge Analytica episode suggested that Facebook had failed to adequately conduct the risk assessments the agreement required it to do. It also failed to obtain required, explicit consent from users\u2019 friends for the sharing of their data with third parties, the privacy experts said.They also argued that Facebook had failed to operate a comprehensive privacy protection program and take reasonable precautions \u2014 steps the company was obligated to take under the consent decree.Since then, Facebook has made other admissions about privacy problems that experts said could potentially violate the consent agreement or trigger new federal charges of deceptive privacy practices.Facebook said it had developed a privacy program as required by federal regulators and it had not violated the consent decree.\u201cWe are transparent with people about how we use their information and respect people's privacy settings,\u201d Sally Aldous, a Facebook spokeswoman, said in a statement. \u201cWe have a privacy program, which ensures we protect people's information, which we continuously evolve to address the privacy risks of our products and services.\u201dMs. Aldous said the company\u2019s privacy program involved more than three dozen control mechanisms \u2014 including a privacy governance team and security teams that \u201censure privacy risks for product launches and major changes are identified, discussed, and escalated for decisions when necessary.\u201dFacebook said it disagreed with The Times\u2019s characterization of its sharing of user data with Amazon, Apple, Blackberry, Microsoft, Samsung, Yahoo and other companies. The social network said device makers used information from Facebook to integrate certain Facebook features on their platforms and agreed not to use that information for their own purposes. The company also said Spotify and other third-party apps had access to users\u2019 Facebook data only after users signed in with their Facebook account in the third-party apps.Advertisement"}

She was on her way to Nepal for a hiking trip, and he was headed to Bali to celebrate his birthday. He told her he was from Cincinnati. She told him that she taught English to schoolchildren in Taipei.\u201cWe had things in common \u2014 we\u2019re both originally from Long Island, we have similar world views, we\u2019re outward looking and really progressive, we like minimalist living, and are interested in politics,\u201d she said, noting that the two stayed up until 3 or 4 in the morning talking. \u201cThere was just something about him that reminded me of New York, and of home.\u201dThe two commenced a friendship through Facebook messages, and some weeks later, when she was back in Taipei, he suggested that he might visit Taiwan for a week or so.\u201cI was staying in a hostel for maybe five or six days,\u201d he said, \u201cand the assumption was that maybe I\u2019d be staying in Taipei for a week or two.

{"Headline": "\u2018Damaged\u2019 Drone Found Near Gatwick; Arrested Couple Are Freed Without Charge", "Date": "2018-12-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGatwick Airport also announced that it was offering a 50,000-pound reward (about $63,000) for information leading to \u201cthe arrest and conviction of those responsible for the criminal act that disrupted flights.\u201dThe couple had been arrested on suspicion of disrupting civil aviation services and endangering people or operations, the police said in a statement. They are both from Crawley, a town just south of the airport, and the husband\u2019s Facebook page suggested that he was a drone hobbyist. The couple\u2019s pages included several photos of remote-controlled helicopters.The first drone sighting was reported around 9 p.m. Wednesday, forcing officials to shut down the airport\u2019s one runway in West Sussex, south of London, and ground or divert more than 1,000 flights over three days; the runway was buzzed more than 40 times within 48 hours.The chaos affected more than 140,000 passengers in Britain and reverberated around the world, delaying tens of thousands of people traveling for the holidays. Britons and some lawmakers criticized officials\u2019 response to the drone incursions, with some wondering why the police did not shoot down the device.Officials said they had shut down the airport for fear that a drone could cause the deadly crash of a passenger plane by flying into its windows or getting sucked into an engine. The police described the drones seen as \u201cindustrial\u201d models, and were not treating the episode as terrorism-related.The drone incursions raised questions about the safety of Britain\u2019s airports and the slow process of establishing a national registry for drone operators, which is planned for November.The couple were arrested on Friday night, after the airport had been shut down and reopened several times, and as the frustration of travelers mounted.In a phone interview on Sunday night, Chief Tingley said that the couple had been held for \u201capproximately 35 hours\u201d for questioning because the police \u201cneeded to be really sure what we were dealing with.\u201dThe Sussex police have declined to officially name the couple, and the chief said the police had offered them \u201cfull support\u201d after they were released \u2014 including the presence of two officers outside their home if they needed it.Chief Tingley said the damaged drone was found on Saturday morning near the perimeter fencing of Gatwick, in the small town of Horley, by a member of the public who alerted the police. He said an examination by a forensic science team in Britain was being \u201cprioritized and fast-tracked.\u201dInvestigators are looking for two things, he said: digital data on the drone and human DNA. He added, \u201cWe expect results within the next 12 hours.\u201dEarlier, he told the BBC that the authorities had an \u201copen mind\u201d about whether the device found could be one of the drones that had buzzed Gatwick Airport, Britain\u2019s second-busiest. He said the authorities were sifting \u201cmany reports of drone activities\u201d over the past few days, poring over CCTV footage and making house-to-house searches.Asked by the BBC about the possibility that there had been no drone incursions at Gatwick in the first place, he said it was \u201calways a possibility,\u201d but added that the authorities had to go on the reports of the number of people who said they had seen drones \u201cor something that looked like a drone\u201d in the sky near the airport.On Sunday, drone experts on television raised the specter of copycat drone flights at Gatwick and other airports. But since Gatwick shut down briefly on Friday after a suspected drone sighting, no new incursions have been reported nearby, and a steady stream of flights have resumed, with some delays.The chief said that when it came to handling a rogue drone, specialist officers on the ground always had the \u201ctactical option to shoot it down.\u201dIn fact, he said, a commander had given them the authority to do just that within the first 12 hours of the drone sighting.But he noted that drones move quickly, and shooting at the devices would have been untenable because the police were not likely to fire when people were present in other parts of the airport.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Surviving a Criminal Presidency", "Date": "2018-12-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNo one is above the law in America. Opinion ColumnistIt is very possible that the president of the United States is a criminal. And it is very possible that his criminality aided and abetted his assumption of the position. Let that sink in. It is a profound revelation.Stop there.Yes, there is still information dribbling out about Trump\u2019s efforts to build a tower in Moscow during the election and about his campaign\u2019s ties with Russians during the campaign. Yes, there is the question of obstruction of justice, which I believe has already been proven by Trump\u2019s own actions in public. Yes, there are all the people in Trump\u2019s circle who have been charged with or have admitted to lying about any number of things, including their contacts with Russians.But beyond all that, we now have an actual, and one assumes provable, crime. A federal crime. And the president is its architect.Trump likes to say on the issue of immigration that if we don\u2019t have a border, we don\u2019t have a country. I say that if we don\u2019t have justice, we also don\u2019t have a country.America is a country of laws, and if we are to believe that, and not allow that to become a perversion, no man or woman can be above the law.As Thomas Paine wrote in his 1776 pamphlet \u201cCommon Sense\u201d: And yet, Trump, his team and to some degree his supporters in Congress seem to view Trump as very much above the law \u2014 or at least some laws. The defense is bizarre: Since he is the president, there are laws he isn\u2019t obliged to obey. In other words, it is permissible for him to break some laws, but not others.This all holds the potential to further make a mockery of a system of justice that already privileges power.And yet, people keep making excuses for Trump: \u201cWe haven\u2019t yet seen evidence of collusion.\u201d \u201cYes, he lies, but that\u2019s mostly rhetoric.\u201d \u201cSo what; he paid off a porn star to spare his family shame.\u201dNo, no, no.According to prosecutors, Trump directed Cohen to commit a felony. Then he lied about it and either allowed or instructed others to lie about it on his behalf. He misled the American people through a conspiracy of lies, and he did so to help attain, and then maintain, his presidency.There simply must be consequences for such a brazen act of lawlessness.Now, I am under no illusion that Trump will be indicted as a sitting president or that any efforts to impeach him will prove successful.But at some point his term will end, and at that point the statute of limitations may not have expired. As The Times put it, \u201cThe prosecutors in New York have examined the statute of limitations on the campaign finance violations and believe charges could be brought against Mr. Trump if he is not re-elected, according to a person briefed on the matter.\u201dThe statute of limitations for campaign finance violations is five years. Re-election may well be Trump\u2019s only hope of evading justice.But that also gives voters enormous power in 2020. They won\u2019t just be selecting the next president and determining the direction of the country. They may also be deciding whether or not a president will be tried, convicted and imprisoned for the first time in the country\u2019s history.This is a weighty responsibility, but it is a necessary one.

I had no idea how immoral Trump actually is.The fact that Trump would be directly implicated in a federal crime that took place on the verge of the election and may have helped hand that election to him is mind-blowing to me.Trump, for his part, lied about these payments and denied them \u2014 while also having those around him lie about them on his behalf \u2014 until he could simply no longer lie about them anymore. Then came the roulette wheel of revolving explanations that makes one dizzy because of their silliness.How can a family that can\u2019t run a charity run a country?But of course, that is not all. Nearly every aspect of Trump\u2019s life is now under investigation for wrongdoing, something I could not have foreseen.I could not have predicted the extraordinary lengths to which the president would go to obstruct justice and undermine the rule of law, nor that he would do these things in full view, for everyone to see.They are all wrong. This is huge, and the longer we pretend that it isn\u2019t, the more damage we do to the health and stability of our own country.While I am away, I will enjoy not having to follow the hourly insanities too closely, but every day I will worry about the republic in which we live. Trump has the capacity to damage or even destroy it. That\u2019s not hyperbole. That\u2019s an observation informed by a close reading of history.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Christmas Is About Food", "Date": "2018-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a season full of bittersweet memories, cooking and eating can remind us of what is joyful.Contributing Opinion Writer After a certain age, Christmas can arrive with a little darkness. I\u2019m used to it by now, the way the ghosts of Christmas Past sneak up on me, but it\u2019s still hard. I miss my parents. I lament broken friendships. I worry about getting older, about the fate of the earth, about the presidency of this terrible man.So there I was, one morning last week, sitting by the fire in my house in Maine as the tears rolled down. Then my 13-year-old Labrador, Ranger, came over and put his gray muzzle on my lap. His tail thumped upon the floor. Hey you, the dog seemed to say. Remember the good things. Like this?When I focus on the good things, I think, above all, of being around a table with my family.I could tell you about our Christmas Eve dinner tradition, which (since we live in Maine) is a platter of steamed lobsters, placed atop a bed of fresh green boughs clipped from the tree. I know it\u2019s way too Martha Stewart, but we do it anyway, not least because my sister came up with this idea 20 years ago and it stuck.That would be the sister with whom I had a falling out some years back. For a long time we didn\u2019t speak. Now \u2014 gently, shyly, carefully \u2014 we have found our way back into each other\u2019s lives again. Merry Christmas, sister mine. I love you.Likewise I could tell you about supper on Christmas Day \u2014 which with any luck will be steaks and twice-baked potatoes and a hearty French Burgundy. It was my colorful grandmother, Gammie, who started that tradition. She and her constant companion, Hilda, have been gone now these last 28 years.It was my grandmother who decided that when she died, she wanted to be a cadaver, donated to science. Because, she said, \u201cWhen you\u2019re dead, you\u2019re dead.\u201d She talked Hilda into being a cadaver too. It was a thing they did together.But when they were alive, their favorite holiday meal, like mine, was breakfast.When the last present has been opened, I will sneak into the kitchen and don a ridiculous chef\u2019s toque. There will be scrambled eggs. There will be hash browns; I like to make these from red potatoes, tossed with olive oil, kosher salt and chopped mint. And there will be a plate of smoked maple bacon, Smithfield ham, hot Tuscan sausages.Because I am from Pennsylvania, not so far from Amish country, there will also be scrapple.If you don\u2019t know what scrapple is, there is no reason for me to wreck your holidays by going into detail here. Let\u2019s just say that certain pork \u201cbyproducts\u201d are combined to make a kind of cake, which I cut into slices, dredge with flour and fry in a cast-iron skillet. Oh, don\u2019t make a face. You\u2019d like it, if I made some for you.There will be orange juice and apple cider and hot coffee.Now that our son, Sean, and daughter, Zai, are in their 20s, my wife and I are likely to be the first ones up. Deedie will do a jigsaw puzzle by the fire. It\u2019s a far cry from the 1990s, when the kids would wake us up at 5 a.m., leaping into our bed.I miss those days. But these are good days too.When I was a teenager, I loathed sitting around the tree with my family. There they were, my parents talking about Gerald Ford as if he were St. John the Baptist; my grandmother, at just the precise moment, yanking out her latex breast prosthesis and waving it in everyone\u2019s faces while cackling, \u201cLook! It\u2019s a miracle of science!\u201d Then Aunt Gertrude would tell \u2014 again \u2014 the story of Christmas in East Prussia, 1920: her impoverished family barreling through a blizzard in a horse-drawn sleigh, her grandfather clutching the reins. They were spending the holiday at his farm, outside K\u00f6nigsberg. From the forest came the howling of wolves. The six children huddled beneath a blanket.I would rush off to the kitchen to escape. There, alone, I listened to WXPN in Philly as I prepared the giant breakfast. The house filled with the smell of crackling bacon, slowly frying hash browns and onions.I liked cooking for my family; I liked feeding them. I just couldn\u2019t stand to be around them.How I miss them all, these ridiculous people. How I loved them! What I would give to make them breakfast, just one more Christmas morning.But maybe my grandmother was right: When you\u2019re dead, you\u2019re dead. I would be Scrooge-like indeed if I were so blinded by what\u2019s been lost that I could not see what is right in front of my face.Christmas morning, my family will gather around the breakfast table: Sean, Deedie, Zai and me. We will have eggs and bacon and hash browns and scrapple. And by the grace of God, we will have one another.Ranger will look at me with his gray dog face. What did I tell you?

On Saturdays, she saddles up her horse, treks deep into snow-capped mountains and hunts wild beasts with a trusted partner: her trained bird of prey.Zamanbol, 14, is an eagle huntress. A Kazakh nomad in the Altai region of Mongolia, she is part of a generation of nomadic youth who are embracing customs centuries old as they seek connection with their roots and the wild in a world being transformed by technology.RUSSIAMONGOLIACHINA500 miles200 milesRUSSIAkazakhstanSagsaiBayan-OlgiiMONGOLIACHINABy The New York TimesThe young huntress, who goes to school in town during the week and returns to her nomadic family\u2019s ger, or yurt, on the weekend, has been living among eagles her whole life.The demanding craft of eagle hunting was passed on to her by her grandfather, Matei. With him by her side, she and her eagle have even hunted wolves.Her grandfather taught her all he knew of hunting with eagles \u2014 how to call to the bird in the sky, how to whisper to it soothingly when perched on her arm. When he died, she inherited his prized bird.\u201cAfter my grandfather\u2019s death, I wanted to continue his way,\u201d Zamanbol said.Just as Zamanbol began learning the craft at a young age, the training of the birds starts soon after an eaglet is captured from the nest, often after a hunter has made a rugged climb up a cliff. The resulting relationship between hunter and eagle is close and spans years; some last more than a decade, with a few hunters even talking about the eagle as if it were their child.Hunters will often sing to their eagles to get them used to their voice.Female eagles, larger and stronger than males, are used almost exclusively in the hunt. Once grown to about 15 pounds, the eagles ride with their hunters on horseback into the mountains, where they are released to scan the landscape for prey, typically foxes and rabbits.Eagle hunting almost vanished in the last century. It was kept alive by the Altai Kazakhs in western Mongolia in Bayan-Olgii province, where at least 400 ethnic Kazakhs have formally registered as eagle hunters.The province is the only one in Mongolia that is majority Kazakh, and majority Muslim.Now, for perhaps the first time in its history, the art, and its essential role in Altai Kazakh culture, is being shared with outsiders.Hunters come together for the Golden Eagle Festival to compete with each other in a two-day gathering open to tourists.During the festival, Soviet-era vehicles dot the steppe, with local vendors selling tapestries depicting Kazakh life, leather-bound books with Mongolian sayings and intricate bottles for Mongolian snuff. Children sit on the ground, playing games with shagai, sheep knuckle bones.The number of foreign tourists coming to the festival is growing, with a record of more than 1,000 this year, according to government officials.This year, 120 eagle hunters took part: From the top of a mountain, the eagle is released as its hunter waits on horseback in a makeshift arena set up at the mountain\u2019s foot.The goal is to have the bird meet its hunter within a targeted area some 20 yards wide. To prod the eagle, the hunter holds aloft a piece of meat, and makes a loud cry for the bird.A reunion within the target area is no given: This year, just 18 eagles were up to the task. For each successful convergence between hunter and eagle, gasps and cheers of awe erupted across the steppe.The winning eagle is chosen after a second round, judged on how they hunt a mammal carcass tied to a galloping horse.The eagle hunter Kholkhanat, 24, who like many Altai Kazakhs is customarily known by his given name, recalled seeing a foreigner at the festival for the first time 10 years ago, when some came to his village, Sagsai, to photograph him after he won his first competition at age 14.During this year\u2019s festival weekend, tour guides brought visitors to his home to share a meal with his family and take photos with his children.Some scholars worry that the festival presents eagle hunting as performance rather than showing it in its cultural context, as a search for fur and food.But many eagle hunters see the festival as a way to celebrate their heritage. Asker, the father of another young hunter, said he welcomed outsiders and enjoyed the attention of photographers from around the world.\u201cThe photograph is a history of me,\u201d he said.For an older eagle hunter, a photograph can still be something to marvel at. But for Altai Kazakh youth, in a time of smartphones, photographs are just another fact of life, like wolfskin, eagles and gers.When Zamanbol rides out into the mountains to hunt, she often lets her friends come along, all moving confidently atop their horses over the rough terrain, bantering with each other at full gallop.In the selfies the girls post on Facebook, Zamanbol\u2019s eagle appears with them like a peer. \u201cYour eagle is lovely,\u201d one of the Facebook comments reads.Technology has widened gaps between generations across the world, and Bayan-Olgii is no exception. But eagle hunting, for the few who practice it, has been a bridge connecting Kazakh youth to their elders.Aigerim, 14, has been drawn to her eagles since she was small. On a recent hunt with her father, Asker, their two eagles separately took flight from their arms, and then unexpectedly came together, seizing a fox.In his long history of hunting, Asker said this moment of togetherness with his child and eagle stood out in his memory as a cherished moment.For Zamanbol, her eagle embodies her grandparents, although the bird she hunts with today is not the one her grandfather gave her.Out of custom and love, the eagles are eventually released back into the wild. Zamanbol was 13 when she let go her first eagle, the one she inherited from her grandfather.Many hunters described deep sorrow coupled with a sense of well-wishing as their partner took the final flight from their arm.Before her eagle was let go, Zamanbol\u2019s family slaughtered a sheep for the occasion. She then tied a white ribbon around its leg, went up to the mountains and bid farewell.\u201cI was sad,\u201d Zamanbol said, \u201cbut I wanted her to be free.\u201dSuvdantsetseg Tsagaanbaatar contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Port\u2019s Dilemma: \u2018Before Dinner Is Too Early; After Too Late\u2019", "Date": "2018-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWine SchoolFor many Americans, wine is something to be studied rather than felt.Of course, wine is an alcoholic beverage, and plenty of people drink it for exactly that reason, paying little attention to anything beyond a pleasant flavor and an enjoyable buzz. But for those who have decided to plunge deeper, wine often becomes a course of study, a subject to be mastered.We practice tasting wines blind in order to divine their identities, narrowing down the options through careful deduction. We memorize places, people, soil types and grapes. We take courses in \u201cwine appreciation,\u201d so that we are equipped to comprehend it in all its aesthetic glory.Yet the intense attachment many people feel to certain wines is powerfully emotional. Our taste is personal, and woe to anyone who would seem to demean another\u2019s favorite.Here at Wine School, we try to recognize both sides of this equation. We believe that a better understanding of where wine comes from, who made it and why leads to deeper pleasures in its consumption. That\u2019s why we are called Wine School, after all.But we never want to underestimate the emotional relationships people develop with wine, and the passions that great wines inspire. These feelings motivate us to want to learn more about winemaking, though these sentiments are dismissed sometimes as romantic, or unworthy.I have been thinking about wine\u2019s appeal to both the intellect and the heart as we have examined tawny port over the last month. In introducing the topic, I confessed that I rarely drink port, maybe once a year, which drew sniffs from a few readers.I suppose the notion that I don\u2019t drink port more regularly might seem insulting, but I was simply being honest about my own habits. I would prefer to think that I was conveying respect for port\u2019s long history as a great and coveted wine by wondering why I was so rarely drawn to it.It\u2019s possible to understand intellectually that a wine is superb and delightful in its own right, and yet rarely be motivated to drink it. For me, port is a perfect example. By looking at tawny port this month, my ulterior motive was to re-examine my own feelings about it, and to see whether port might have a greater role in my own drinking life.The idea of choosing the same producer was to focus on the wines and, if you drank more than one of them, to consider the effects of aging, while eliminating variables that might be introduced by comparing ports from multiple producers.Port is as much a British invention as a Portuguese wine. Back in the 17th century, when conflicts blocked Britain from importing French wines, many merchants went to Portugal in search of substitutes. Taking a liking to the strong, dark wines from the Douro, the British added brandy to the wine to stabilize it for the ocean voyage home. This process of fortification results in a wine that is generally about 20 percent alcohol, 50 percent more than most still wines, which may be 13 or 14 percent.Port can be made from dozens of different grapes, though practically speaking most ports are made from five varieties: touriga nacional, touriga franca, tinta barroca, tinto c\u00e3o and tinta roriz, which is better known by its Spanish name, tempranillo.While many styles of port are made, they essentially break down into two groups: those, like vintage port, which are aged for years in bottles, and those like tawny, which are aged in barrels. The responsibility for aging vintage ports is left to the consumer, while tawny port is aged by the producer and is ready to drink at the time of purchase.Vintage ports may require decades of aging before they are ready. Taylor Fladgate\u2019s Fine Tawny (at $17, the least expensive of the three ports I recommended) requires less than three years in barrels before it is bottled, indicating that its base wine is much less tannic than the wine used to make vintage port.Like white or ruby port, other easygoing port styles, the Fine Tawny was light and frisky, sweet and unpretentious, with flavors of herbs, nuts and dried fruit. In a strong light, I could see the browning edges of the ruby-colored wine, faint evidence of tawniness, but it was really just a young port. I thought it was best with an ice cube in a glass, served as you would a tangy, refreshing aperitif like vermouth.Now we come to the 20 Year Old, which to me is the ideal tawny port and has always been my favorite. It was far mellower than the 10 Year Old, still quite sweet but much more complex, with caramel, chocolate and mineral flavors in addition to the dried fruit, nuts and herbs. This is the proverbial contemplative drink for sipping in front of the fire.Sadly, I don\u2019t have a fireplace at home. Nor do I often have a place for port, which says more about my habits than my feelings about port. If I\u2019m at home, I like to drink wine with dinner. By the time I\u2019m done eating, I\u2019m usually done drinking. I love port with cheese \u2014 I especially liked it with Ossau Iraty, a hard sheep\u2019s cheese from the Pyrenees, though two-year-old Cheddar and the time-honored pairing, Stilton, also work.But I rarely eat cheese after dinner, or before, although I do have it occasionally for a quick lunch, not the best time to consume port.Readers gamely tried port in a variety of ways, drinking it through dinners, sipping it with cheese and desserts or enjoying it alone. As Michael of White Plains, N.Y., said, \u201cGood tawnies don\u2019t really need an accompaniment.\u201dWell, I don\u2019t often eat dessert, either. I\u2019m afraid port often falls into a category of things that I enjoy but don\u2019t often have a place for, like good whiskey or a cocktail. It\u2019s a pretty rare situation where I will opt for either over another glass of wine.I hope that does not translate as an insult, though I imagine some people might take it that way. From a critical point of view, it\u2019s a far different thing to praise a style but drink it rarely than it is to criticize a style as imbalanced, overbearing or somehow flawed.While I intellectually appreciate it, I don\u2019t love port enough to find a way to drink more of it. I will finish the bottles I have over the next few weeks, then most likely wait a good while before returning to port again.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Data Sharing and Privacy Rules: 5 Takeaways From Our Investigation", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere are five takeaways from our investigation.\u201cWe don\u2019t sell data to anyone,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s founder, told Congress during a hearing in April. His pledge \u2014 that the torrent of data Facebook collects from its 2.2 billion users will always remain safely in Facebook\u2019s hands \u2014 has been a cornerstone of the company\u2019s defensive strategy this year, as lawmakers, regulators and activists have pummeled the social network over a series of privacy breaches and public relations blunders.While it is true that Facebook hasn't sold users\u2019 data, for years it has struck deals to share the information with dozens of Silicon Valley companies. These partners were given more intrusive access to user data than Facebook has ever disclosed. In turn, the deals helped Facebook bring in new users, encourage them to use the social network more often, and drive up advertising revenue.Internal documents obtained by The Times show that Facebook shared data with more than 150 companies \u2014 most of them tech businesses, but also automakers, media organizations (including The Times) and others. While Facebook users can control what data they share with most of the thousands of apps on Facebook\u2019s platform, some companies had access to users\u2019 data even if they had disabled all sharing. Many of the partners\u2019 applications never even appeared in Facebook\u2019s user application settings. According to Facebook, each of the outside companies acted as an extension of the social network. Any information a user shared with friends on Facebook, the company argues, could be shared with these partner companies without additional consent.The data partnerships date to 2010, at the start of a period of headlong growth and expansion for Facebook. Within a few years, the social network had struck so many of these deals that Facebook employees built a tool to track the different types of access the partners had.Despite this, Facebook appears not to have kept close tabs on how its users\u2019 data flowed out into the world. A Russian social media company, Yandex, that has been accused of having overly close ties to the Kremlin, still had access to Facebook\u2019s unique user IDs for years after Facebook had cut off other applications from the data, citing security concerns.Likewise, Facebook gave Yahoo the ability to display a Facebook user\u2019s news feed \u2014 including friends\u2019 posts \u2014 on the search company\u2019s home page. Yahoo got rid of the feature in 2012. But as of last year, it still had access to data for close to 100,000 people a month. Under the terms of a 2011 consent agreement with the Federal Trade Commission, Facebook was required to strengthen privacy safeguards and disclose data practices more thoroughly. The company hired an independent firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers, to formally assess its privacy procedures and report back to the F.T.C. every two years.Facebook maintains that the partnerships are covered by an exemption to the consent decree. A spokeswoman for the F.T.C., which last spring opened a new investigation into Facebook, declined to say whether the commission agreed.Advertisement"}

Contributing Opinion Writer The Russian trolls have been really good customers of Facebook, Google and Twitter.Now we know that the tech companies were not particularly helpful in trying to work with government investigators to unravel the mess, asserting that they were in the dark about the situation, both as the deception was happening and well after it was pointed out to them.Regrets? Apparently, tech has a few, but not enough to do a full mea culpa that might allow us to avoid this kind of disaster in the future.While all of the companies have insisted that they are committed to transparency, the fact is that they have long been resistant to the kind of self-reflection needed to fix the situation for the long term. The only solution is to overhaul their systems in ways that would force them to behave less like bystanders in what will be a never-ending \u201chigh-stakes information war.\u201d This is the disturbing term used in one of Senate reports that Ren\u00e9e DiResta, a disinformation expert and director of research at New Knowledge, worked on. It looked at over a thousand YouTube videos, upward of 100,000 Instagram posts, more than 50,000 Facebook posts and more than 10 million tweets.\u201cEach of the platforms has great visibility into their own platform, and third-party researchers have information and signal from across the platforms,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at dissemination platforms and trends and saying: \u2018We think this is inauthentic. You\u2019ve got device IDs, you\u2019ve got I.P. addresses, you\u2019ve got a number of other signals that we don\u2019t have access to.\u2019\u201dIn other words, as was described in more detail this week, the tech giants have been holding back. It\u2019s a crouch posture that I think has its origins in the souring of the industry\u2019s relationship with government agencies in 2013 in the wake of Edward Snowden\u2019s revelations about incursions into tech platforms by the N.S.A. surveillance program Prism.That moment deeply damaged what had once been a more cooperative back and forth between government and tech over issues of national security. While no one in tech was na\u00efve enough to be surprised about some level of government spying on information-rich environments \u2014 you rob banks because that is where the money is, after all \u2014 the level of it was indeed a shock to some.What will happen next?But in the end, such changes may prove impossible, given how the United States thinks about free speech. As the report noted: \u201cWe have conversations about whether or not bots have the right to free speech, we respect the privacy of fake people, and we hold congressional hearings to debate whether YouTube personalities have been unfairly downranked. It is precisely our commitment to democratic principles that puts us at an asymmetric disadvantage against an adversary who enthusiastically engages in censorship, manipulation, and suppression internally.\u201dFor now, it\u2019s not clear what we can do, except take control of our own individual news consumption. Back in July, in fact, Ms. DiResta advised consumer restraint as the first line of defense, especially when encountering information that any passably intelligent person could guess might have been placed by a group seeking to manufacture discord.\u201cThey\u2019re preying on your confirmation bias,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen content is being pushed to you, that\u2019s something that you want to see. So, take the extra second to do the fact-check, even if it confirms your worst impulses about something you absolutely hate \u2014 before you hit the retweet button, before you hit the share button, just take the extra second.\u201dIf we really are on our own in this age of information warfare, as the Senate reports suggest, there\u2019s only one rule that can help us win it: See something, say nothing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Should Kids Whose Parents Could Earn Higher Salaries Get Financial Aid?", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe EthicistI have a friend with school-age children who is a professional in a fairly lucrative field. The spouse is in a nonlucrative field. My friend chose to work fewer hours to spend time with their growing children, greatly reducing the family\u2019s take-home pay in the process.This friend wanted the kids to go to an expensive private school that has a scholarship program with income requirements to qualify for student aid. Aid was applied for and received.I feel that it is inappropriate to use scholarship funds when the lack of income was merely a choice and not a circumstance. That scholarship money (which is limited) could have gone to a parent who had no capacity to make more money, regardless of effort.But I can\u2019t accept your contention that it\u2019s wrong to accept financial assistance \u2014 scarce funds to which one is entitled under the rules \u2014 if one could have obviated the need by making different career decisions. In particular, deciding to be more actively engaged in the lives of your children is an honorable choice, and I\u2019d urge the school to support it. And how would you generalize your principle? There are people who could have gone into investment banking but instead brought their financial acumen to the nonprofit world. Yes, they chose to earn less money, but it can\u2019t be right that they are thereby obliged to renounce the scholarships for which their kids are qualified.All of this takes place, of course, against a disquieting background: In our society, some parents must decide between private schooling that is excellent and public schooling that is not. If that is the situation here, these parents are entitled to do the best they can for their kids (given the constraints of honesty and obedience to the rules), even if it disadvantages others. But it would be better to live in a society where parents didn\u2019t face that decision.Evangelizing Christians played a role in the abolition of the Atlantic slave trade, contravening settled traditions in both Britain and Africa; in late-19th-century China, missionaries played a role in ending foot-binding. All that was indeed good news. More recently, in Uganda, a handful of American evangelical ministers evidently helped spur the passage of legislation that sought to drastically increase the penalties for homosexual acts. That was bad news. It\u2019s useless to try to draw up a ledger sheet here of good and evil. The point is that God and the Devil are in the details.Still, you might want to suggest to your grandniece that if she wants these South Asians to be open to hearing her good news, she should probably be open to hearing theirs, too. That way, she can make an effort to understand the traditions of the place she\u2019s going, which you rightly suggest is a good idea. Whether she should honor those traditions as well depends on what they are \u2014 and she won\u2019t be able to decide about that if she doesn\u2019t know anything about them. There are, after all, a great many ways of not being a Christian.I teach journalism at a major state university, and one of my favorite courses is basic editing. I give 10 A.P.-style quizzes in the first half of the course, graded from 0 to 100. Student grades run from very low to 100. I always tell students the grade range when I hand quizzes back, but I exaggerate. If the lowest grade was 45, I tell them the lowest grade was 40. Similarly, if the highest grade was 90, I say it was 95. I do this so the worst-performing students don\u2019t feel quite so bad and the high achievers have something to strive for.

Supported byI picked my way across the crust, pocked by holes just large enough to twist an ankle. After a mile, we climbed over a heap of rocks that slid beneath our feet and emerged at the summit of the crater.Mr. Soto and I gazed across the maw at a scene of otherworldly bleakness: A curving wall, tinted green, splattered with bird feces, or whitewash, and riven with crevices, formed the volcano\u2019s lip. Steep slopes of scree and soil laden with red-tinted hematite fell away into the abyss. The cries of buff-necked ibises, large rodent eaters with cream-and-russet throats and curving gray bills, echoed off the canyon. A peregrine falcon rose, plummeted into the crater, circled back up and disappeared inside a crevice.Three eruptions \u2014 the first taking place 3.8 million years ago, the most recent 15,000 years ago \u2014 covered the steppe with spills of black lava and pillars, columns and parapets of basalt, which glow yellow, red and greenish-gray in the harsh desert sunlight. Half a dozen craters and collapsed cones loom over the terrain like broken teeth.Despite the bleakness, this 31-square-mile reserve, established by the Chilean government in 1970, teems with wildlife: hares, tuco-tucos (mole-like rodents), skunks, armadillos, gray foxes, pumas, guanacos, lizards and dozens of species of birds unique to Patagonia. Chilean flamingos, splashes of pink and orange in a charred landscape, gather in the park\u2019s soda lakes. Buff-necked ibises build nests high in trees or inside the extinct volcanoes, sharing the ledges with peregrines \u2014 a symbiotic relationship rare among birds of prey. As part of the deal, the government set aside an additional nine million acres to enhance the country\u2019s national park network. A total of 17 national parks have now been linked by the Route of Parks, a hiking trail that winds past mountains, glaciers, volcanoes, forests and arid steppe, and roughly follows the Carretera Austral, the country\u2019s storied Southern Highway (also known as Route 7) through Patagonia.I made my forays from Punta Arenas, a windswept city of about 125,000 on the Strait of Magellan. Navigated by the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan in 1520, the strait remained one of only three options, along with the Drake Passage and Beagle Channel, to sail between the Atlantic and Pacific until the Panama Canal opened in 1914.Guanacos, with brown coats and creamy white bellies, placidly munched the hardy yellow grass known as coir\u00f3n. A few panic-stricken beasts leapt over the fences of cattle ranches along the road. \u201cSome of them get snagged and can\u2019t extricate themselves,\u201d Mr. Soto said. They become easy prey for the pumas that prowl the pampas at dawn and dusk.\u201cYou\u2019re the first visitors in the park today,\u201d the gatekeeper told us. It was 1 p.m. According to Chile\u2019s National Forest Corporation, which administers the park, Pali Aike received just 2,537 visitors in 2016, half of whom were foreigners. That works out to seven people a day.\u201cThis isn\u2019t a park for everybody,\u201d the gatekeeper said, adding that many visitors have a particular interest in volcanic geology or the fauna of Patagonia. He said he had started working at Pali Aike only two weeks earlier, after spending most of his life as a gaucho in southern Patagonia. Now in his 60s, he had decided he wanted a more sedentary existence. He invited us inside the hut to share a mate \u2014 the caffeine-rich drink consumed everywhere on the pampas \u2014 and served it the traditional way, repeatedly pouring boiling water into a mug stuffed with leaves, and inviting us to sip through a metal straw.Gracias, I said, after the first sip. Then, when I asked for more, he gave me a lesson in mate-drinking etiquette. \u201cWe only say \u2018gracias\u2019 when we\u2019re finished,\u201d he said.100 milesChilePatagoniaSantiagoAlerce Andino National ParkArgentinaArea ofdetailTorres del Paine National ParkR\u00edo Gall\u00e9gosPuerto NatalesAtlanticOceanPali-Aike National ParkStrait of MagellanPunta ArenasIsla Grandede Tierradel FuegoChilePacificOceanCabo de Hornos National ParkBy The New York TimesOn the yellow plain now far below us, a long line of guanacos \u2014 the Tehuelche\u2019s sole source of protein, clothing and shelter \u2014 headed toward a pocket of water. Mr. Soto, armed with a guidebook to the birds of Chile, silently pointed to a small passerine with a brilliant red breast that had settled atop a lichen-covered lava tower beside us: It was a long-tailed meadowlark, a rare species found only in southern Patagonia and the Falkland Islands. A least seedsnipe, a small gray-and-brown bird, one of Patagonia\u2019s most common, swooped down beside it.Descending to the shore via a steep trail cut into the cliff, we approached a plywood shanty sheltered behind boulders. \u201cI saw a pair of pallidos flying above the cliffs this morning,\u201d the occupant, a fisherman in a black gaucho hat, told us. \u201cJust head down the beach and you\u2019ll find them.\u201dAs we headed back toward Punta Arenas, one more avian spectacle awaited us. On a stretch of dirt road through the pampas, running parallel to the Bah\u00eda Poses\u00edon, Mr. Soto motioned for me to pull over. Here, not marked on any map, lay a nondescript puddle, just a few dozen yards across, that seemed to have attracted every species of water bird in Patagonia. Thumbing through his guidebook, Soto identified red-gartered coots, white-tufted grebes, four varieties of ducks, blue-winged teals, silver teals, oystercatchers, upland and crested geese, tawny-throated dotterels, Magellanic snipe and, on hard ground yards past the pond, another cluster of flamingos.We lingered for an hour, alone on the pampa, fascinated by the variety of avian life squeezed into such a small space. Our disappointment over missing the elusive pallid peregrine had receded. Mr. Soto tossed his bird book in the back seat, and we continued down the dirt track toward the Ruta del Fin del Mundo.Joshua Hammer\u2019s new book, \u201cThe Falcon Thief,\u201d will be published by Simon & Schuster next year.Advertisement"}

Mr. Putin, a former spy, has mostly kept his daughters out of sight.The coverage, as fawning as that accorded to Mr. Putin, portrayed the research as groundbreaking and vital for Russian technology, suggesting an emerging role for Ms. Tikhonova as a champion of Russian science.Her appearance on state television suggests a potential public role for the presidential family, a fraught topic in Russian political culture since Soviet times, Nina Khrushcheva, a professor of international affairs at the New School in New York and a granddaughter of the former Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev, said in a phone interview.Joseph Stalin kept his family cloistered from public view, even while promoting his sons in the army, but in 1959 Mr. Khrushchev toured the United States with his family, Ms. Khrushcheva said. President Boris Yeltsin\u2019s daughter was a public figure in the 1990s, before Mr. Putin reversed course.The apparent shift now, amid sagging ratings in the polls for Mr. Putin, \u201cis a way to show the family is involved in building Russia, and it\u2019s not just Putin sitting in the Kremlin,\u201d Ms. Khrushcheva said. \u201cIt was to show that his girl, his family, is putting a stamp on the future, on science, on the future of Russia.\u201dMr. Putin\u2019s youngest daughter, born Yekaterina V. Putina while her father was posted in Germany as a spy, is now 32. Her mother, Lyudmila Putina, mostly vanished from public view midway through Mr. Putin\u2019s tenure, and the two divorced in 2013. She has since reportedly remarried.Putting Ms. Tikhonova on television, Ms. Khrushcheva said, is showing Russians that \u201cthere\u2019s more than one Putin working for us.\u201dFor the television program, Ms. Tikhonova was interviewed in front of a computer graphic of a head seemingly wired to electrodes. Plugged into these devices, she said, \u201cyou can really say that a person realizes the potential of technology, and himself, at the same time.\u201dThe Kremlin has declined to comment on Ms. Tikhonova\u2019s identity. During the television show, she was identified as \u201cdirector of Innopraktika and deputy director of the Institute of Mathematical Study of Complex Systems at Moscow State University.\u201dMs. Tikhonova\u2019s marriage to Kirill N. Shamalov, a Russian investor, had raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest when a Russian state pension fund provided a $1.75 billion below-market-rate loan to Sibur, a petrochemical company that was at the time partly owned by Mr. Shamalov.In his fullest explanation about the secrecy around his daughters, Mr. Putin suggested a desire in 2017 that his grandchildren \u201clive like ordinary people,\u201d out of the public eye.Mr. Putin said that his daughters are \u201cinvolved in science and education,\u201d and \u201clive normal, everyday lives.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Even now, it feels like Christmas week, as I\u2019m constantly searching for Scotch tape and scissors.Here are five dishes for the week:__________Before I left the office on Wednesday, I asked my brilliant colleague Julia Moskin what she was making for dinner. The answer was this recipe, a side dish she tosses with penne or a similarly sized pasta to turn into a main course. This is one reason we all love Julia: She has the best ideas. Scale up the recipe if you like; use extra pans to avoid crowding the vegetables. This would also make a great side for roast chicken like the one below._____This is a Melissa Clark dish that is scant on active time, but does require the kind of opening in your schedule that allows you to brine 8 hours in advance and then remove the chicken from the fridge an hour before roasting. (I never said it was hard; you just need to hit your marks.) It is utterly delicious, a beloved recipe online and justly so. Serve with roasted potatoes and sturdy greens._____My gift to you is a foolproof turkey chili for a crowd that can be made in 45 minutes and will please everyone who tries it. (I\u2019ve even seen picky kids eat it.) I serve mine over rice with the works: sour cream, avocado, cilantro, cheese, scallions or minced red onion. This tastes better on Day 2, so let it sit if you can. I\u2019d make a spinach salad to go alongside, but steamed or pan-seared broccoli would work well, too._____Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Year in Pictures 2018", "Date": "2018-12-20", "News": "Looking back, moving forward: Our editors picked the compelling images that capture the year. Scroll left and right to explore the imagePut together at the end of a year, though, their essence is restored. The images here compel us to look closely, look twice, look slowly. And in doing so, we can ask ourselves: How do we react to what we see \u2014 not only in the moment we look at it, but in our daily lives? How does that reaction prepare us for the way we will face the future?The word \u201cempathy\u201d has been tossed around a lot lately, which probably signals its actual absence in so many spheres of human interaction. It is said of a particular book that it is written with \u201cgreat empathy,\u201d or that a certain film is good because it \u201cteaches empathy.\u201d Perhaps our standards should be higher. Empathy is the minimum, but we need to step into the world with more than that. What about art teaching us indignation? What about rage and historical responsibility?At first glance, these photographs are a retrospective of the year we are about to leave behind. If many of them seem, on closer inspection, like a recurring nightmare, it\u2019s because yes, they are. Most of the crises, conflicts and natural disasters they capture aren\u2019t new, but are ones dragged on from previous years, or are otherwise a resurfacing of symptoms of social ailments that have gone unattended for too long. If we look even more closely, we realize these are in fact photographs about the future.There is the disturbingly sad gaze of a baby girl being embraced by her mother, a victim of the opioid crisis. How can a baby\u2019s eyes look this sad? It\u2019s as if she were staring into a future that most of us dare not imagine. Every 15 minutes in the United States, a baby is born with neonatal abstinence syndrome. Imagine their future.There are young palms raised high during a student protest, shortly after the Parkland school shooting. On each palm is a word, and together these words compose the shattering, almost stuttered sentence: again / don\u2019t / shoot/ don\u2019t /shoot / never. How do we articulate that future?There is the skyward-facing Ja\u2019Mal Green standing next to Jedidiah Brown, Chicago activists who have fought mass incarceration and police brutality in African-American communities. There are approximately two million people in prison in the United States, the majority of them black and brown. An African-American male is more likely to go to prison than to college. Let\u2019s change that future.We see the cardboard cutouts of Mark Zuckerberg wearing a T-shirt that reads \u201cFix Fakebook,\u201d as part of an effort to denounce the role the company may have played in spreading disinformation and affecting electoral results around the world \u2014 most recently, the election of a far-right leader in Brazil. Let\u2019s tell that future: We\u2019re watching you, too.It is impossible to look at the searing image of Amal Hussain, 7, photographed at a hospital in northern Yemen, and not think of the future she will not have. She died in November. What is the future for other children in Yemen?What many of these pictures have in common is not only the tragedies they depict, but also the fact that underlies those tragedies, which is that while some die or are killed, while some fall prey to addiction, while their countries fall into the hands of authoritarians, others may profit. Pharmaceutical companies profit, arms companies profit, Facebook profits. We see here the dispossession that enables the few \u2014 all those suits and ties \u2014 to silence the many.But then there is the woman from Central America, holding her little boy\u2019s hand. She\u2019s wearing a T-shirt that reads \u201cFemme Power.\u201d She has just been released from a detention center at the border, during the summer of family separations. The image begs us not only to think about how asylum seekers are treated in this country, but also to consider how undocumented immigrants can be locked into a narrative that diminishes their agency, one that reduces their fierceness and dignity to victimhood, at best. Look at this woman\u2019s eyes, see how she stares at the world in front of her. Look at yourself, looking. Then look at her gaze again. And remember it, because she is the future. \u2014 Valeria LuiselliMs. Luiselli is the author of \u201cTell Me How It Ends: An Essay in 40 Questions\u201d and the forthcoming novel \u201cLost Children Archive.\u201dWashington, Jan. 9President Trump meeting with members of the Senate in the White House.Gekhy, outside Grozny, Russia, Jan. 30Hava Beitermurzayeva with her son.

{"Headline": "Mumbai, a City Both Uplifting and Heartbreaking", "Date": "2018-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byfrugal travelerIndia\u2019s largest city is known for both the poverty of its slums and the richness of its history, museums, nightclubs, restaurants and street food.After a four-day visit this past October, it was easy to see why: The shopping and entertainment options were excellent, and opportunities for great dining were second-to-none. And while the rupees flow freely in Mumbai, I was able to keep my spending under control.Any explorer of Mumbai will eventually need to try one of thousands of street vendors and restaurants that grace the city. Fortunately, there is no shortage of good options, and nearly every price point is covered. The Bombay street sandwich is one you\u2019ll see everywhere and, if you\u2019re feeling adventurous, certainly worth trying. A typical example features sliced cucumber, potato, onion, tomato and beetroot on toasted bread, served with a variety of spicy chutneys. At 25 or 30 rupees, it\u2019s an absolute steal.A very good sour eggplant toast (350 rupees), sweetened with tamarind and covered with caramelized onions, functioned as a kind of tangy eggplant p\u00e2t\u00e9. A twist on pani puri, the classic street food, filled the thin shells with a cactus salad and corn mousse (350 rupees). Something described as pork okonomiyaki (500 rupees) really was like a sweet-glazed pork taco, competently prepared and served with a nice cabbage slaw. My server, Ayush, was particularly good and made me feel right at home.I picked up a shirt for 250 rupees and, after a bit of haggling over the initial ask of 1,000, walked away with a pair of jeans for 600 rupees. Satisfied with my haul, I walked through the Karnatak Sports Ground, where organized teams were playing games of cricket. As the sun began to set, I crossed the street to Azad Maidan, past food vendors selling snacks and couples lounging on the grass while groups of boys played decidedly more casual pickup cricket games with tennis balls.Over a good dinner at the Parsi restaurant Ideal Corner, I reflected on my time in a city that has so much to offer \u2014 too much for one trip, certainly. Some trips are draining, but Mumbai left me feeling energized. I would have to return again to this dynamic city, and soon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Am I \u2018Old\u2019?", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs with beauty, the meaning of \u201cold\u201d depends on the person you ask. A few years ago at a college reunion, I listened transfixed as the silver-haired philanthropist David Rubenstein urged us \u201cto accelerate\u201d as we entered the last chapters of our lives. Pick up the pace? So many of my contemporaries were stopping \u2014 if not stooping \u2014 to smell the roses.With his admonition in mind, I recently spoke with Mr. Rubenstein, now 69, and asked him if he considers himself old. \u201cSixty-nine seems like a teenager to me,\u201d he replied. Coincidentally, just a few days earlier, a 68-year-old poet I know, in between surgeries to help her mend after a fall, told me point blank, \u201cI am an old lady now.\u201dWhat makes one sexagenarian identify as old when another doesn\u2019t? And what is \u201cold,\u201d anyway?Dr. Scherbov says for Americans, it\u2019s roughly 70 to 71 for men and 73 to 74 for women, though, as he has written, \u201cyour true age is not just the number of years you have lived.\u201d\u201cThe main idea of the project,\u201d he told me, \u201cis that an old age threshold should not be fixed but depend on the characteristics of people.\u201d Factors such as life expectancy, personal health, cognitive function and disability rates all play a role, he said, and today\u2019s 65-year-old is more like a 55-year-old from 45 years ago.To that very point, I was curious to see how my friends who are 50-plus defined old \u2014 and asked them on Facebook. Among the dozens of responses, two made me smile: \u201cOld is my current age + 4.\u201d And this: \u201cTomorrow. Always tomorrow. Never today.\u201d Perhaps the one most difficult to hear: \u201cWhen you get called \u201cma\u2019am instead of \u201cmiss.\u201d (That will never happen to me, although I\u2019m constantly called \u201csir\u201d these days.)Other friends pointed to various physical milestones as the visible line in the sand. A colleague posted: \u201cWhen you can\u2019t jog a 15-minute mile.\u201d Another friend said, \u201cWhen I have to stop playing tennis.\u201d Others ominously noted cognitive benchmarks: \u201cWhen you stop being interested in new information and experiences.\u201d Many focused on \u201cmemory issues\u201d as defining the onset of old.The bottom line: \u201cold\u201d is subjective, a moving target.That\u2019s why David Rubenstein, 69, the board chairman of both the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and the Smithsonian Institution and co-founder and co-executive chairman of the Carlyle Group, can claim he\u2019s not old, while my poet friend, a year younger than he is, refers to herself as old. Recently, because of problems getting around, she had to bring in a home health aide for assistance, only deepening her increased dependence on others. Indeed, as Dr. Scherbov discovered, loss of independence and mobility are among the characteristics that define \u201cold.\u201dThe good news is that those views can be altered. \u201cLike sexism and racism, changing social norms is possible,\u201d wrote John Beard, WHO\u2019s director of aging and life course. \u201cIt is time to stop defining people by their age.\u201d Hear, hear!Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "T.M. Landry and the Tragedy of Viral Success Stories", "Date": "2018-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWe focus on outliers and ignore systemic injustice.I was once a poster child for a certain version of the American dream. The one where poor black children need unforgiving discipline to overcome the inevitable obstacles in their lives so they can vault themselves into the meritocracy.Around the world, people reacted in horror to the story. I was disturbed by what I read too. But I was also disturbed by the way this one school was being described as a singular, extraordinary case of fraud and abuse perpetrated by two villains. The truth is much worse.T.M. Landry is an inevitable result of systemic injustice, of decades of school and housing policies designed to maintain white supremacy and punish the poor and working class. Part of what drives this system, and distracts from its horrors, is a myth in which we all participate: the American dream.The American dream relies on stories like mine and the Landry situation to distract from the American reality: There is a conveyor belt that sends most young people, especially from neighborhoods like mine, from nothing to nowhere, while the chosen few are randomly picked off and celebrated.Now we condemn the people who ran the school \u2014 who gave us, for years, what we wanted \u2014 while letting ourselves off the hook.I was born, as the myth goes, on the wrong side of the tracks in Oak Cliff, a Dallas neighborhood. I was raised by my grandmother, who worked as a domestic, and by my sister, who adopted me when our mother disappeared. I watched my father struggle with addiction and watched my friends endure the same or worse.Then, when I was 17, a man from Yale showed up at my high school to recruit me for its football team. The Yale man said, everybody said, that this was the best thing that could happen to me and to the whole community. \u201cTake this ticket, boy,\u201d they told me.I wasn\u2019t so sure. Yale seemed like another world. I tried to find excuses for not going. On the first day of my recruiting visit, I texted my sister: \u201cThese people are so weird.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll fit right in,\u201d she replied.I took the ticket and worked hard to fit in. I played varsity football. I interned on Wall Street. I worked in Washington in the early years of the Obama administration. I went to Harvard Business School, where I started a nonprofit to support small-business owners.But one story like mine or one Landry scholar does not mean the system works. It doesn\u2019t. Children suffer because we have starved their schools and neighborhoods of resources. And because we have convinced them that their only hope is an assimilation that demands they forsake who they are and where they come from.When we highlight those few against-all-odds stories, we send the message that all it takes to succeed is grit and resilience and willpower. We tell kids that if they don\u2019t succeed, it\u2019s their fault \u2014 not the inevitable outcome of a decades-old program of structural cruelty advanced by neoliberals and conservatives, not to mention the centuries of white supremacy on which the nation was founded.We sensationalize a school like Landry as a miracle when it seems to work, as a crime scene when it doesn\u2019t. And that\u2019s abetted by an ecosystem of Ivy League admissions committees and media outlets that fetishize kids who have escaped their seemingly doomed environment but pathologize those kids who don\u2019t.There is another secret, too: The American dream can also destroy people who make it \u201cout.\u201dI had achieved, by my late 20s, about everything a kid is supposed to, but I was cracked up by the process. So were many of my friends. Before I finished my book about that experience, one of my closest friends from Yale, who\u2019d made a similar Horatio Alger journey, took his own life.He came to me in a dream a few months later and told me: \u201cYou know, we did a lot of things we wouldn\u2019t advise anybody we loved to do.\u201d I knew what he meant. If you catch it from the right angle, a kid picking himself up by his bootstraps can look like a suicide.We \u201csuccess stories\u201d are driven from elementary school on to be perfect. To ignore whatever hardships we\u2019ve endured, whatever loneliness or pain we feel in the new worlds we\u2019re sent off to.We are given the kind of advice I heard a senior administrator offer a group of black Yale freshmen a few years ago: \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be a token, just be the best token you can be.\u201d And as the ones who \u201cmade it,\u201d we feel no right to complain about this bitter bargain that offers us the keys to the kingdom as long as we leave pieces of ourselves behind.I\u2019ve traveled the country over the past few months and learned that there is a generation, maybe more, of traumatized high achievers, suffering in silence.It\u2019s time to break the silence.We can\u2019t let the tragedy of Landry be blamed on the people directing it, rather than being seen as a symptom of a national disease.That disease stems, in part, from political choices that have rotted the social safety net and made access to a good education the birthright of only a tiny elite. But the disease is also, more perniciously, the legacy of the demand that black children be raised as John Henrys, no matter if it kills them in the process.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "I Tried to Make My Dog an Instagram Celebrity. I Failed.", "Date": "2018-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixLast spring, I started an Instagram account that featured my dog, Max, trying to eat my home-cooked meals. I was confident it would be an overnight sensation.Foodies and corgi lovers, after all, are two of the biggest audiences on the photo-sharing site. Combining the two, I jokingly told my colleagues, would be my ticket to early retirement (or, at the very least, some free kibble).I did all the homework. I heeded advice posted on the web from internet-famous dog owners and social media mavens: Find a shtick, publish your posts at strategic times, craft funny captions and engage with your audience. I even invited a professional photographer over for a consultation.So I turned to some obscure marketing blogs that suggested a simpler path: Buy some bots, otherwise known as fake followers, to make the account look more attractive to real people and to help expand an audience. I bought 2,500 bot followers and waited for the likes to pour in and the audience to swell. To my surprise, Max became even less popular. His number of followers hemorrhaged, presumably because Instagram purged many of the phony accounts. The average number of likes on the posts dipped to about 45. This week, I asked Ahalogy, a marketing technology business in Cincinnati, for a reality check.\u201cYou just can\u2019t be an overnight success,\u201d said Bob Gilbreath, who leads Ahalogy. \u201cThis is a real job that takes a lot of effort. Stay at it with several posts a day, several ideas, and build relationships.\u201d Above all, he said, \u201cno shortcuts.\u201dOne tip echoed by many Instagram marketing blogs was to become noticed by influencers, or accounts that were already popular, in the hope that they would spread the word about my food-obsessed dog.Maangchi eventually posted a comment on a photo of Max with a paw rested next to a bowl of kimchi: \u201cGood looking dog! Looks very smart!\u201d But that didn\u2019t do much for making Max more popular.Could it be that the photos were not good enough? I invited a professional photographer, RC Rivera, over for an assessment. His advice: Try photographing the pup and food with creative angles and more postproduction. Also, use visual aids like props and dog clothing. As a last resort, consider buying a fancy camera like a DSLR or hiring a social media agent who specializes in doggy influencers, he said.Still, Max\u2019s following did not grow.Another tip that came up frequently was to buy fake followers. The premise: The only good time to buy followers is when you are small and just getting started, because accounts with medium-size followings look more attractive and thus could persuade people to follow you. In other words, people find comfort in conformity.This made sense to me, so I sent $19 via PayPal to Social10X, a site that offers services to improve your social media presence, and bought a package of 2,500 followers. The followers on Max\u2019s account quickly grew, an experience that was as eerie as it was satisfying. I visited some of the followers\u2019 profiles. Many of them looked like real people.Social10X did not respond to a request for comment.\u201cFraudulent activity is bad for everyone on Instagram,\u201d said the company, which is owned by Facebook. \u201cWe have a strong incentive to prevent people from spreading spam and low-quality content.\u201dOne legitimate way to lure followers is to get exposure to a wide audience. A primary method is to embed photos with hashtags, or keywords after the pound symbol, such as #cutedog. If people look up the hashtag #cutedog, they might stumble upon a slow-motion video of Max gobbling up a piece of Thanksgiving turkey.Another way to reach new audiences is to pay for an ad on Instagram. On an Instagram post, you can click the Promote button and then select the demographic you are targeting and the number of days you want the ad to run.I tried both approaches. I experimented with dozens of hashtags, including extremely popular ones like #chinesefood, #dogsofinstagram and #yummy, as well as less popular tags like #californiadog, #beefy and #meatsweats. But this didn\u2019t do much.I also paid $24 for a weeklong promotion of Max smiling beside a bowl of squid-ink pasta. The photo reached 5,165 people, but the campaign gained only 11 new followers for the account. I essentially paid about $2 a follower.Mr. Gilbreath shared Max\u2019s Instagram profile with members of his marketing team at Ahalogy. They offered tough feedback.\u201cWe think the recipe focus plus dog idea is confusing and probably splits the audience in a way you don\u2019t want,\u201d they told me. \u201cAnimal lovers would be turned off by the recipe content and foodies aren\u2019t going to be impressed by the imagery or haphazard dog integration.\u201dIn other words, the entire concept of @cookingwithfatmax may have been flawed to begin with. I was humbled. While walking Max one morning, I shared the feedback with my partner, the real brains behind most of the dishes we cook.\u201cI think it\u2019s just too late for us to get into this game,\u201d I said. \u201cI think there are too many doggy influencers on Instagram.\u201d\u201cIt just seems that the field is too professionalized,\u201d she replied. \u201cTo get in you need fancy cameras, lights, friends who are influencers and a doggy agent?\u201dThis was all beginning to feel too serious for an Instagram account that started as a silly project documenting our love for dogs and food. We agreed to keep publishing @cookingwithfatmax but to stop trying to make our corgi an influencer. We also agreed to never buy ads or bots again.Max, of course, is still a big winner from all of this \u2014 he gets to taste our food. Next up on the menu: steamed fish.Advertisement"}

Then she fell in love.They started this job more than a year ago. Most homeowners would be annoyed at how long it\u2019s taking. I\u2019m not. They\u2019re building it for free. They\u2019re building it for me.I bring them water. I kiss one good night but not the other. One is my boyfriend of 10 years. The other is my husband. My husband and I actually consider ourselves exes, but we never divorced. We still love each other, just not romantically. We have lived together all these years under the same roof, although not the same bedroom.What happened was this: 15 years ago, I woke up in the night, nudged him awake and said, \u201cI need your permission to have an affair.\u201dOur then 2-year-old son had just left the family bed. My husband and I were alone again with a gaping hole where passion should be. We had tried to bring it back through counseling, sex therapy and lingerie. I needed the dance of knee against knee under the table. I needed an unabashed, open-mouthed kiss. So we came to an agreement.\u201cI don\u2019t want to know,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t bring it home.\u201dThis went on for several years. I met men at hotels and at their homes in the hills.Then, I met a new guy at a bar in the Mission District, the perfect place to meet before a one-night stand. Except I fell for him the moment he handed me a red Gerber daisy. I fell for the small gap between his teeth. I touched his hand by feigning interest in the ring he had made from a bicycle spoke. We loved the same obscure music.Days later, he waltzed with me on Berkeley Pier, my gloves arranged in his breast pocket like a kerchief. He created a rabbit out of a squeegee and a towel and made me laugh at its antics.The afternoon I chose to tell my husband, light streamed into our yellow kitchen. Our son was in his room, playing with Hogwarts toys.\u201cThis wasn\u2019t our agreement,\u201d he said. We discussed it calmly. One of us mentioned divorce. One of us said, \u201cShould we move apart?\u201d Then it was silent again.I was a child of divorce. When I came home from school, the house was empty. My mother worked an hour away and didn\u2019t get home until after 6.I saw my father on Sundays, sometimes. He would take us to car shows or to buy fish for our aquarium. I don\u2019t think he ever wanted children. He wasn\u2019t interested in talking to me about books or cheerleading. He once jokingly tossed me over the side of a boat, saying, \u201cThat\u2019s how you learn to swim!\u201dMy siblings were wild, sneaking out to parties in the woods. I grew up mostly alone. I dreamed of having a family to travel with or joke together over dinner.I had this now. We made Lego villages, played music, sang out of tune. We stopped for smiley-face pancakes when we drove to San Diego to see my in-laws. We took up a whole row on the airplane, creating our own happy world of snacks, cartoons and surprises for our son.I couldn\u2019t imagine not waking up in the house with my child, having to drop him off at his father\u2019s house, not kissing his sleepy cheeks every night.I wanted my family. And I wanted my boyfriend.When I suggested we could be roommates, my husband agreed. I clung to the idea like a life raft.We ordered another bed and turned my husband\u2019s office into a second bedroom. I didn\u2019t know if it was possible to create a new kind of family, but like a child who pushes against the boundaries of her parents\u2019 rigid rules, I wanted to find out.Months later, I said, \u201cI want to introduce him to our son.\u201d\u201cIf you bring someone else in,\u201d my husband said, \u201cwe need to move apart. I don\u2019t want to meet him.\u201dWeeks passed. Then my husband said, \u201cWild Side West. 5:30. Wednesday night.\u201dI don\u2019t remember if I drove to that meeting with my husband or my boyfriend. I do remember sitting in the beer garden with sweat on my forehead.We sat in a little triangle, my husband sitting stiffly and my boyfriend leaning back as if to give us more room. I perched on a rickety stool. We could have been in a lawyer\u2019s office, drawing up papers.The moment was about a child. The conversation was about who we are to this boy. Who will we be to him and to each other? How do we trust?We set a meeting for the playground the following week. We three adults had planned it out carefully. My son and I would be playing on the monkey bars. My boyfriend would show up and I would introduce him as my friend.When he arrived, he was carrying an old radio and some tools. He had remembered from our conversations that my son loved to disassemble electronics.My boyfriend juggled two screwdrivers and a wrench and made my son laugh. He smiled and said, \u201cHey buddy, want to take this thing apart with me?\u201dWhen this began, we still lived in a large apartment in the Mission; there was room for privacy the nights my boyfriend stayed over. It was awkward at first, but as the years passed we spent more time as a foursome \u2014 cooking, playing board games.Twice a year we all traveled to my mother\u2019s house in Ohio, along with my husband\u2019s parents, spending two weeks in a flurry of card games, water balloon fights and lingering meals.Then the owner of our apartment decided to sell and offered us an enormous sum of money to surrender our rent-controlled lease. In most places, that money could have bought us a house. In the Bay Area, it wasn\u2019t even a down payment. The only place we could afford was half the size of our apartment. There wouldn\u2019t be room for home offices, most of our furniture or my boyfriend.At the new house, my beau built a platform so I could store the mattress beneath a raised office, but it never felt right. It wasn\u2019t sexy to sleep with him under piles of papers and the glow of the computer screen saver.One day when he and I were lying in the trundle bed staring up at a jumble of cords, he said, \u201cLet\u2019s talk about building you a studio.\u201d But I didn\u2019t have the money.\u201cWe could scavenge what we need,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we start by building a foundation, maybe it will come together even if we don\u2019t see how it can work.\u201dThe backyard was a mess of dirt, broken bottles and rusty metal when he began digging. He patiently began clearing it out. One day my husband donned work gloves and jumped in, too. When we ran out of scavenged materials, my husband generously purchased supplies.Months of Sundays passed to the synchronized beat of hammers and the sound of music and laughter as the framing was built. My husband taught me how to use the nail gun. My boyfriend took pictures as I nailed on the avocado-green siding. There\u2019s a selfie of the three of us grinning from behind our dust masks, covered with flecks of fiberglass on the day we stuffed insulation into the walls.Those two men painstakingly installed layers of drywall, reaching their long arms to the ceiling over and over. Before they hung the last piece, I hid gold dollar coins inside next to the studs and a photo of three generations of people who are related in ways there aren\u2019t words for.They left the beautiful thick beam in the ceiling exposed. After you walk into the studio and admire the golden light and the warm oak floors, that exposed beam catches your eye. It\u2019s the through line, reminding me of our love for our son.We wanted this child to grow up in a happy household. That beam was strong enough to convince us all to hold onto the vision. It\u2019s like a dream I have had countless times in which I discover a room in my house that I didn\u2019t know was there.That\u2019s our life now. We are building a family without a blueprint.Advertisement"}

As recently as the early 1960s, air travel was still glamorous and exciting; you dressed up to get on a plane, and looked forward to the food aloft. That was when Trans World Airlines opened a futuristic new terminal, designed by the Finnish architect Eero Saarinen at what was then best known as Idlewild and is now Kennedy International Airport.The 200,000-square-foot-building, with its sinuous curves and swoops sheathed in white penny tiles, is a city, state and federal landmark, connected to Jet Blue\u2019s Terminal 5. But it has not been used for 18 years. The restaurant, with 200 seats, will have the same name as its predecessor in the original terminal: Paris Caf\u00e9. Next to it will be the Lisbon Lounge (another name from the original terminal), serving cocktails and food.Waiters and other personnel at the new restaurants will be dressed in outfits that echo what crew members wore at the dawn of the jet age, often bearing designer names like Valentino and Pierre Balmain. (Mr. Morse pointed out that before their industry was deregulated in 1978, airlines could not compete on price, only on service, so details like food, comfort and presentation counted.)From an open kitchen, Paris Caf\u00e9 will serve breakfast, lunch and dinner. The hotel is in walking distance from all the Kennedy terminals, and will be open to anyone, even without a boarding pass. \u201cA big community, not just travelers, lives nearby,\u201d Mr. Morse said. The hotel, with 512 rooms in two new seven-story buildings, will be able to hold events like weddings, and has a separate kosher kitchen.Advertisement"}

She pinched her wrist and held her breath.These records were hers. She was the one smart enough to grab them before Cambridge Analytica blew up and kicked her to the curb. What she was doing was no different than what her employer had done to Facebook and what Facebook had done to their users. And had those users not valued the serendipitous reconnections with high school boyfriends, the ego strokes from bragging about their expensive vacations and their little child prodigies and a public forum in which to harangue their elected officials, they would not have put their private information out there.Facebook users understood that they had to give away a part of themselves for easy connections and the much-coveted limelight.Sofie tore off a hangnail with her teeth. She had become her father. She\u2019d thumbed her nose at his poker dens and bookie operation, signed her name to a boatload of student loans and declared independence.

Without self-respect, she was nothing.She returned to her auction site on the dark web. Still no action. Her reserve price had surfaced the four whales.

{"Headline": "Let the Fountain Pens Flow! ", "Date": "2018-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn this coldly pixelated age, old-fashioned writing implements make a small but meaningful comeback. In fact, it quickly became clear that these were nerds. Twenty-first-century pen nerds.Lamy was handing out free Vibrant Pink Al-Stars, a sleek aluminum-bodied pen, and plastic Safaris (each around $40). And then there was the guest of honor: Brian Goulet, of Goulet pens, who had the handsomeness of a 1950s young dad, thick hair like mink, broad shoulders, a warm handshake. \u201cHe\u2019s, like, a rock star in the world of pens,\u201d said Steve Birkhold, the C.E.O. of Universal Luxury Brands, which own the American distribution rights to Lamy. Mr. Birkhold, formerly the C.E.O. of Diesel and Lacoste, has started his own company with a partner, Eli Hollander, to bring niche, design-focused European brands to the United States.Lamy, whose headquarters are in Heidelberg, is still owned by the German family that founded it in the 1930s. Its Lamy 2000, introduced in 1966, a Bauhaus-inspired minimalist steel pen, made the brand\u2019s reputation as the cool pen maker. This year Mr. Birkhold opened the SoHo store and another in the Palace Hotel in San Francisco. \u201cBusiness has already tripled,\u201d he said, since he bought the United States distribution rights in 2017. The office supply and paper company that held them previously, he added, didn\u2019t understand how to take an \u201comni-channel\u201d approach and correctly market the \u201cpen brand for millennials.\u201dThe fountain pen has been imperiled since the rise of disposable ballpoints in the 1960s; by the \u201990s and early aughts the almighty keyboard was positioned to kill it off entirely. Once-stalwart household names like Sheaffer (Sylvia Plath\u2019s preferred brand) were closing American factories to manufacture cheap parts in Asia and seeking corporate buyers. Holdout users were mainly aging collectors, and only a few companies, like Montblanc, which had been acquired in 1988 by Richemont, were flourishing.During his store appearance, he at first was standing by himself. As the evening drew on, and free champagne flowed, attendees edged closer to him, the way children may shyly creep toward a storyteller. Soon they were asking questions eagerly: What was his favorite pen? Favorite nib? Does he think a \u201cdemonstrator\u201d pen that shows its mechanism, by the upstart Taiwanese brand Twsbi, look like a vape? Would he be eating one of the large sugar cookies of his head in icing Lamy had set out for the party from the bakery Cupcake Market? (No, he would be taking them home for his two grade-school children, who will of course be learning cursive.) An avid woodworker, Mr. Goulet originally planned for the website to sell wooden fountain pens he made, but soon noticed that the accessories he sold to go with them, paper and ink, were doing well, without the hours of labor.Generationally at ease with the so-called pivot (he majored in commercial real estate management at Virginia Tech), he gave up on his own pens. The company\u2019s website cannily bottles and sells small ink samples and walks you through how-tos: how to \u201cflush\u201d a pen, how to use a wax seal (there are now flexible ones that can go through the postal machines). There are also reviews of new pens and interviews with pen personalities.Instagram, where illustrators post video demonstrations, has inevitably furthered pen nerd-dom. Fountain-pen ink looks beautiful as it dries, since it often has shading, or color variations, and sometimes shifting iridescence. There are hundreds of new, delicious ink colors and small-batch companies with romantic bottles and names like poems or perfumes (Organics Studio, Nitrogen; Colorverse, Andromeda, DeAtramentis Black, Roses, Pilot Iroshizuku, Kosumosu, Robert Oster Fire & Ice, Monteverde California Teal). Manufacturers like Diamine in England, once almost moribund, have customers again. Then there are the new start-up offices, coffee shops, which lack supply closets. \u201cSomeone might pull out a notebook from CVS and a Bic,\u201d Mr. Birkhold said. \u201cBut someone else has a cool notebook and fountain pen. They personify your personality.\u201dOriginally a straightforward system of organizing your how-to lists (and life) on pages with small points arranged as a grid, bullet journaling has become almost an art form. And it is one that is enhanced by a fountain pen, or so Kara Benz (a.k.a., Boho Berry) demonstrated at the Lamy event, where she was a host. The journaling is perfect for a form of faux calligraphy that involves fattening every down stroke, the rudiments of which anyone can learn in an hour or two.Ms. Benz, who lives in New Jersey and has electric-violet hair, uses shelves of different writing implements to create her impossibly artful rainbow pages of lists that include items like \u201cdeclutter X or Y\u201d or \u201cbook a spa day,\u201d and never \u201cspend all day making this page.\u201d But the company\u2019s customers are not all such obvious free spirits. \u201cA lot of people are administrative professionals who just have normal cubicle office jobs, and they just want interesting tools to make their day more their own,\u201d Mr. Goulet said.\u201cI got into fountain pens about three months ago,\u201d said Jeremy Whelchel, a young man in a puffer jacket during a holiday event at the Manhattan Fountain Pen Hospital downtown. The store is one of the few general pen shops that has survived, because it has the Wall Street crowd\u2019s business. Most of the people piling up to the counters there looked like the sort of 50-and-ups who would of course love a fancy, fusty fountain pen. The old-guard pen scene, like the cigar aficionados, appreciates a certain gaudiness. \u201cEncrusted\u201d might be the defining adjective to apply to the pricey, themed wares (\u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d Samurai) of Montegrappa, an Italian brand. But dotted among the blur of boomers were next-gen fellows like Mr. Whelchel, the sort who comfortably use terms like \u201cEDC\u201d (everyday carry).He had an old fountain pen lying around for years, but it was always dry and scratchy. \u201cI used to associate them with status seekers, with Montblanc, guys with fancy watches,\u201d Mr. Whelchel said. \u201cI\u2019m not into that, I\u2019m into the gadget aspect.\u201d The subreddit is \u201ca great community,\u201d he said, \u201cwith useful instructionals.\u201d He started with one Pilot Metropolitan, then bought a bunch of them to get familiar with the interchangeable nibs and mechanisms. \u201cIt\u2019s like a bike: If you keep them tuned up and take care of them, they\u2019re great.\u201d He is curious to see the Homo Sapiens Evolution, by the Italian brand Visconti. It is made from Mount Etna lava.\u201cI\u2019m not a convert, but it\u2019s nice to mark up a document with one,\u201d said his girlfriend, Hailey DeKraker, a lawyer. \u201cNow that I have my ink guy!\u201dMr. Whelchel doesn\u2019t tend to use the pens for daily correspondence. \u201cMore like notebooks,\u201d he said.Mr. Whelchel is an engineer at Google, and he likes the pens\u2019 through-line to the previous implications of that job title: building bridges, drawing plans on paper. With the same familiar irony that applies across the recent analog revivalism, the engine that was killing the fountain pen (and the pen store) as a necessity has resurrected it as a pure pleasure and a novel way to display personal style.The \u201cdisruption\u201d of the fountain-pen market provides a soothing escape from all the others: Amazon\u2019s unnerving dominion, Facebook\u2019s alleged tainting of democracy itself, and childhood\u2019s fast fade into screens.\u201cPeople describe drawing ink into their pen from an ink bottle and wiping the nib as a Zenlike experience,\u201d said Stephen Brown, 34, a cognitive psychologist from the Netherlands who teaches at a community college in Red Deer, Alberta. \u201cPeople are also reading studies coming out indicating that writing things down helps you remember,\u201d said Jane Andreasen, 27, a pen nerd with a Mia Farrow crop and Fury Road boots. \u201cIt\u2019s an easy step to go from, \u2018I want to write more to, \u2018and now I have a fountain pen,\u2019 to \u2018now I have five, what happened to me?\u2019\u201d Ms. Andreasen is the resident fountain-pen expert at the happening Oakland, Calif., outpost of Flax Art & Design, an art supply store. Nibs recall a time when the act of signing documents promised law and order. A time when Thomas Jefferson used his (up-to-the-minute) metal pen to draft the Declaration of Independence for people who had faith in a \u201cwe the\u201d and the God indicated as the key witness to the ensuing signatures.Considering this, it makes sense that one of the world\u2019s largest pen shows is in Washington, D.C. It also makes sense that there\u2019s some pen political drama, captured by the ink maker Nathan Tardif, whose Noodler\u2019s inks are known for their inventiveness, affordability and the libertarian convictions hidden in their charming illustrated labels.Mr. Tardif follows his ethics of self-sufficiency in the woods of Massachusetts, where he concocts and bottles his inks by himself. His Bernanke Black Ink is fast drying \u2014 an allusion to the Federal Reserve\u2019s act of essentially printing money by lowering interest rates during the financial crisis \u2014 and his Berning Red, also fast drying, a red for lefties, shows Bernie Sanders\u2019s head in front of the state seal of the Soviet Socialist Republic of Azerbaijan. Mr. Tardif\u2019s says his Warden\u2019s ink has properties that make it fraud proof. Mr. Tardif is an eccentric and not representative, Mr. Brown said, but, in his observations, the pre-internet dealers did tend to lean right and male.Mr. Brown\u2019s wife, Aziza Asgarali, runs Gourmet Pens, a pen blog. \u201cJust to reveal how much of a pen nerd I am, we met when we were both guests on a fountain-pen podcast,\u201d Mr. Brown said. But even though the pen world contains a few female luminaries, like Beate Oblau at Lamy (known for riding a Ducati) and Regina Martini, a dealer specializing in vintage collectibles and Pelikan, \u201cfemale enthusiasts are less visible,\u201d Ms. Andreasen said. She knows how to de-rust a vintage ink reservoir and replace ancient cracked bladders, but four years ago she was belittled on the Fountain Pen Network forum by a male commenter who didn\u2019t like a millennial woman disagreeing with him. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to try again because the whole community is changing,\u201d Ms. Andreasen said.Mr. Brown\u2019s subscribers are global, many from India and Asia, where fountain pens are more common. But when Ms. Asgarali, whose parents came to Canada from Trinidad, was featured in a YouTube review with her husband, a commenter wrote: \u201cI used to respect you, but I don\u2019t now that I see you\u2019re married to a half negro.\u201d\u201cI guess this says less about the pen world,\u201d Mr. Brown said with a sigh, \u201cand more about the world.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the name of a pen brand. It is Sheaffer, not Schaeffer.Advertisement"}

But either way, I agreed to help my mom.I am 13 now, and I still write holiday cards to people in prison. It\u2019s really fun to think of nice things to say to people you\u2019ve never met. I always try to imagine what I would want to hear if I was forced to be away from my family and was being treated poorly. I would be terrified, sad and worried that nobody remembered that I existed.I usually end up writing something simple, like \u201cI care about you,\u201d or \u201cWe will not forget you.\u201d And then I make colorful little drawings of flowers or Christmas trees or smiley faces or fruit. I know that those silly drawings make people really happy; there isn\u2019t much color in prison.The holiday cards make some prisoners smile. Others cry because they didn\u2019t think people on the outside cared about what was happening to them. I know this because Just Detention International, the organization that passes my cards along (and also where my mom works) has showed me many of the responses it gets from the cards it sends around.

{"Headline": "The Tao of Gravity ", "Date": "2018-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySportingAll martial arts are a quest for beauty and transcendence. I found those not in doing karate but rather having karate done to me.Mr. Joyce is a features editor for Sportsnet.Two hundred men and women knelt in rapt and reverential silence. All of them wore crisp, white karate outfits, or gis, cinched with black belts. Hardened karate-ka who had trained two decades and earned third- and fourth-dan black belts took honored places in the front row. I was in the back by the fire exit. We were gathered in a university gym in Toronto for an international tournament. I was in my late 30s at the time. With my still new first dan, I felt like a humble 10-handicapper in the company of Tiger Woods.At the front of the hall stood the shihan, a master instructor with a seventh dan. He was demonstrating leg sweeps, techniques associated with judo more than karate. In Japan, he had been a university judo champion.At this point, the shihan passed over the champions up front and summoned me from the ranks. Karate etiquette demands stoicism, but the skepticism in the ranks was not entirely disguised.\u201cKame,\u201d he said. Kame was my far-from-fearsome handle in the dojo. English translation: Turtle. This wasn\u2019t intended to evoke Gamera, the monster turtle who fought Godzilla in Japanese horror films. And all of this predated the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. No, Turtle had been my boyhood nickname because I had a pet tortoise. The tag proved apropos for an entirely different reason, a gift that revealed itself in the dojo: I could fall. Yes, my best asset was a durable back.I know what you\u2019re thinking: Anyone can fall, it\u2019s just gravity. But you\u2019re wrong. Breaking a fall is as complex as any offensive technique. You\u2019re utterly exposed and in immediate danger of real physical harm. Your opponent has weaponized the ultimate blunt force object: the floor. In this instance with the shihan, a hardwood floor.I was 200 pounds back then and my break-falls produced thunderclaps, like sound effects laid over fight scenes in \u201cEnter the Dragon.\u201dIn hockey circles, they\u2019ll say that a guy on the wrong end of a one-sided fight has been \u201crag-dolled.\u201d In karate circles, they say nothing. Instead, they kneel and study the physics of bodies in motion.All martial arts are a quest for beauty and transcendence. I found those not in doing karate but rather having karate done to me. I was honored to be tossed like a bag of wet cement by the shihan.There was no looking down for a soft spot to fall, nor for the leg that would undercut my own. I had to properly simulate the fighting condition, willing myself unaware of my fate so that I didn\u2019t reflexively start falling until I was actually being felled.On my descent, I locked eyes with the shihan and grabbed a fistful of the sleeve of his gi. I had let him and gravity do their business and landed in position to counter. He might have been the only one in the room who recognized this, but no matter \u2014 it wasn\u2019t about me, and I wasn\u2019t brought up to compete.In the material world the martial arts are often described and even advertised as a means of self-defense. You sincerely hope you never have to use your martial art outside a dojo. And you definitely hope that you never have to perform a break-fall in any situation. That said, my ability to fall spared me injury and possibly saved my life in the workplace.I was interviewing Hart and minding my manners when he asked me about a splint on the middle finger of my left hand. To my instant regret I told him my finger had been dislocated blocking a roundhouse kick in the dojo. This prompted what old-school wrestlers called a \u201csnatching,\u201d an act of bodily appropriation that I was powerless to fend off while trying to take notes.\u201cI could shoot an angle,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019d be the wrestling reporter.\u201d Before I could beg off this narrative, I was in fact a wrestling reporter, or at least a reporter being wrestled. Hart lifted me to shoulder height and body-slammed me onto his dining-room floor. Thankfully his wife, Helen, happened on the scene. Rather than counting me out, she offered profuse apologies and upbraided her husband for snatching yet another guest. I thanked her for the well-timed intervention but told her no apology was necessary. If you want to start to understand a fighting art, you have to be willing to go to the mat. The warrior might be as sacred as Shihan or as slapstick as Stu, but regardless best viewed from the ground up.Gare Joyce, a features editor for Sportsnet, is the author of \u201cThe Code,\u201d a mystery novel that was adapted for the television series \u201cPrivate Eyes.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Huawei Arrest Shows Trump Has No Game Plan Against China", "Date": "2018-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBy escalating tensions over national security, the United States may be hurting its own position in trade talks.The administration is going to face many more difficult moments like this as its steps up competition with China, but its actions thus far suggest that it doesn\u2019t have a fully formed plan for how to manage the task.While it appears that the timing of Ms. Meng\u2019s arrest was coincidental, this is not the impression in Beijing, where the move is seen as a political play to create leverage on trade or cripple Chinese technology companies. If this is not the case, the administration needs to come out much more clearly with a solid message about Ms. Meng\u2019s arrest and where it fits within broader American goals toward China.Moreover, the fact that American officials allowed the summit to play out without raising the issue \u2014 or informing Mr. Trump, apparently \u2014 sends another muddled message to Beijing. Does it suggest the administration will continue to throw curveballs regardless of what China brings to the table? Or does it simply reveal a team that is hopelessly divided between factions with competing goals? Either way, if China concludes that the United States will pursue a barrage of punitive actions no matter what steps China takes to address American concerns, this will leave Beijing with little appetite to make meaningful concessions.If Ms. Meng and Huawei violated the law, then the United States has every right to seek her arrest and bring her to trial. Suggesting that this principle is for sale would cheapen the idea that the United States cares about playing by the rules. It would also signal to American allies and to China that American concerns about technology theft or violations of sanctions against Iran can simply be traded away for other priorities. Using the arrest for political ends could also encourage China and other nations to employ more heavy-handed tactics against American businesses in the future.Moreover, continued moves against Chinese technology firms will have long-term implications for America\u2019s interests abroad. The administration is right to be concerned about America\u2019s technological prowess and protecting sensitive infrastructure. But if our actions lead China to accelerate its plans to achieve self-sufficiency in key technologies \u2014 a likely development \u2014 we will be creating a more formidable competitor.

{"Headline": "Vietnam\u2019s Sad Hunt: 300,000 Missing Souls ", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDecades after the war with America ended, Vietnamese families continue to search for the remains of their kin who are still missing in action. Mr. Babcock, a teacher of writing, is working on a book about contemporary Vietnam.On July 27, the day a collection of remains believed to be those of American soldiers lost in the Korean War were flown out of North Korea, I was driving from Hanoi to Vietnam\u2019s rural northern province of Yen Bai. My host that morning was Ngo Thuy Hang, the 42-year-old vice director of Marin, a local nonprofit devoted to helping Vietnamese families locate the remains of their loved ones.More than 300,000 Vietnamese soldiers are still missing from the war with America, a heartbreaking statistic that reverberates across thousands of Vietnamese families, mostly in the north. And though Vietnam\u2019s government has made scattered efforts to search for remains, the resources devoted to finding the missing Vietnamese are a small fraction of those devoted to recovering the 1,600 Americans still listed as M.I.A. from the same war.Having a missing family member is particularly traumatic in Vietnam\u2019s culture of ancestor worship, which dictates that if the dead aren\u2019t found and buried along with other ancestors in their hometown, where relatives can pray and honor them, the dead person becomes a lost soul, wandering homeless and hungry, in a kind of permanent purgatory.We were headed to a small village outside of Yen Bai\u2019s sleepy main town to visit Nguyen Thi Sinh, 96, who lost two sons in the war with America. In 2014 the government made her one of 40,000 Heroic Mothers of Vietnam, an official title given to \u201cmothers who have made numerous contributions and sacrifices for the cause of national liberation,\u201d the sacrifices being losing more than one son, losing an only son or losing one son and having another return wounded. The younger of Ms. Sinh\u2019s two sons killed in the war, Binh, died in 1973 near the city of Hue; his body was recovered and buried in the family cemetery. Her older son, Ky, who reportedly died in 1968 in the southern-central province of Binh Dinh, is still missing.\u201cI try not to worry because worrying doesn\u2019t help,\u201d Ms. Sinh said, smiling, \u201cbut it would be great if my son could come home by the end of this year.\u201dTo the right of where we sat was a large, carved wood altar holding fruit and incense. On the wall above the altar hung pictures of Binh and Ky in military uniform.A volunteer from Ms. Hang\u2019s group sitting next to Ms. Sinh took her hand and said the process took time, with a lot of old paperwork to sort through and people to contact.\u201cYes, yes, I know,\u201d Ms. Sinh said, her voice wavering a bit but still firm. \u201cReally, I am happy to just hear any news at all about my son.\u201dBack in Hanoi, Ms. Hang runs Marin from a two-bedroom apartment in a leaky building on the city\u2019s outskirts. The apartment doubles as her home. Marin is financed by small, individual donations and operates on an annual budget of about $10,000. \u201cYou need to call the local military office in Ninh Thuan province and find out where and how he was killed,\u201d she told a caller who was looking for his uncle.After 15 years of helping families track down missing soldiers, Ms. Hang has become an expert on the minutiae of military records and arcane government paperwork. The families seeking her help usually have little more information than that on the official death notice \u2014 name, birth date, enlistment date, date and place of death (which is often recorded simply as \u201cThe Southern front\u201d). For many families, Ms. Hang is their only hope.Since the fighting between Americans and Vietnamese ended in 1975, the Vietnamese government has taken some steps to recover the bodies. Shortly after the war ended, official remains-gathering teams traveled to the central provinces, to the sites of some of the worst battles, to dig up hastily buried or abandoned soldiers. The task of identifying the remains was complicated by the brutal nature of the war; the artillery used by Americans and their Southern Vietnamese allies was so powerful it often obliterated everything in its path. Even when the search teams found a corpse or a set of bones, identification was difficult because North Vietnamese soldiers weren\u2019t issued dog tags as their American and South Vietnamese counterparts were.It wasn\u2019t until the early 2000s, when Vietnam\u2019s economic situation had improved after market reforms in the 1990s, that families began to search in earnest for their missing loved ones. In overwhelmingly self-financed efforts, they pooled resources and began to travel from the north to the central provinces to search for the bodies of relatives. Though the Vietnamese government has made overtures of support for gathering and identifying remains, its efforts continue to be mostly limited and often inept, according to volunteers and families with whom I spoke.\u201cIn theory,\u201d one Hanoian who had spent 10 years looking for the body of her uncle told me, \u201cmy family could make an application and request the army to go find the body of my uncle, but I knew it would take lots of time and not be much help.\u201dThe Vietnamese government has focused its search efforts mostly on mass graves and offers help only to families who already know the exact place where their loved one died. The thousands and thousands of other families who don\u2019t have this information are on their own.In 2014, the Vietnamese government announced that it would invest about $25 million in a huge DNA identification project \u2014 a joint venture with a German biotech firm named Bioglobe. But little has been done so far. \u201cThey say they\u2019re building something, but we never know,\u201d the woman who was still looking for her uncle said, adding that she assumes any funds actually set aside for identifying remains would just end up in the pockets of corrupt government officials.The United States spends about $100 million annually on efforts to find its own 1,597 service members who are listed as missing in Southeast Asia. Since 1991, the United States has maintained an office in Hanoi dedicated to finding its missing; today it operates as an outpost of the Defense P.O.W./M.I.A. Accounting Agency on Tran Phu, one of downtown Hanoi\u2019s most beautiful leafy streets.In the Vietnamese government, there is no similarly centralized office devoted to finding the missing Vietnamese soldiers. There is, though, a centralized government office devoted to finding missing American soldiers. The missing Vietnamese soldiers are hardly forgotten, though. The search for remains has become something of an obsession for the public. Remains-gathering stories are the subject of TV specials, postwar literature and local newspaper stories. \u201cIt\u2019s just normal to us,\u201d a Vietnamese friend remarked.One night, I started chatting with a taxi driver, Tuan, and found out that two of his uncles were killed in the war and listed as missing. The family had gone on multiple search trips, driving all day down to Quang Ngai province, to look for the bodies.

{"Headline": "The Generals Won\u2019t Save Us", "Date": "2018-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPeople who saw Jim Mattis as a check against Trump misunderstand the role of the military in a democracy.Ms. Schake is the deputy director general of the International Institute for Strategic Studies.In a pique of anger over Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis\u2019s resignation letter, President Trump announced over the weekend that Mr. Mattis would be out of a job on Jan. 1, instead of the end of February, as the secretary had recommended in order to provide a stable transition. The hunt for his replacement is now on, setting up a rushed conversation in the news media, and then in the Senate, over what sort of person should follow Mr. Mattis in leading the Pentagon \u2014 and with it, a debate about the state of civil-military relations. Given the way the public praised Mr. Mattis, and then bemoaned his departure, we have some work to do.President Trump originally picked Mr. Mattis because, according to reports, he looked the part of a battle-hardened warrior, and had even been called \u201cMad Dog\u201d by an enterprising journalist. That Mr. Mattis was equally known for lugging around a footlocker of Western novels and stoic philosophies, testifying in favor of greater spending for diplomacy, standing Christmas watch for enlisted Marines and writing thoughtfully about civil-military challenges 45 years into America\u2019s experiment with an all-volunteer force were, evidently, matters of indifference to the commander in chief.The president\u2019s political opponents, including me, heaved a huge sigh of relief at Mr. Mattis\u2019s nomination; we knew him as an intelligent, measured leader. But some among us, on both sides of the political divide, went further, anticipating that the recently retired general (and other veterans in the new administration) would save us from the president and his policies \u2014 even though, for better or worse, the American people had voted him into office on the basis of those policies. Many also cheered Mr. Mattis\u2019s forthright resignation letter, which detailed his fundamental differences with the president on national security. But these attitudes, welcome as they are to those of us who share them, need to be tempered by the other important element of the Mattis letter: that the president has the right to have cabinet officials who work assiduously to carry out his policies. This is especially true where the vast power and influence of the Department of Defense is concerned.Drawing those associated with the military into highly charged political arguments, as the president did when he called Mr. Mattis \u201csort of a Democrat,\u201d is unquestionably bad for our military as an institution. But the president\u2019s opponents make the same dangerous mistake when they demand a secretary of defense who acts to oppose his or her own president. Moreover, the president has the right to be wrong, and the Department of Defense has the obligation to carry out lawful orders rather than set themselves up as uniquely virtuous arbiters of the good of the country. The solution to the dangers posed by the president is not to put our faith in a Roman tribune. Rather, it is to use the legislative and political tools available to us as citizens to hem in the chief executive, and wrest those powers from him at the ballot box.Kori Schake is the deputy director general of the International Institute for Strategic Studies.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can We Really Inherit Trauma?", "Date": "2018-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMINDHeadlines suggest that the epigenetic marks of trauma can be passed from one generation to the next. But the evidence, at least in humans, is circumstantial at best.But behind the scenes, the work has touched off a bitter dispute among researchers that could stunt the enterprise in its infancy. Critics contend that the biology implied by such studies simply is not plausible. Epigenetics researchers counter that their evidence is solid, even if the biology is not worked out. \u201cThese are, in fact, extraordinary claims, and they are being advanced on less than ordinary evidence,\u201d said Kevin Mitchell, an associate professor of genetics and neurology at Trinity College, Dublin. \u201cThis is a malady in modern science: the more extraordinary and sensational and apparently revolutionary the claim, the lower the bar for the evidence on which it is based, when the opposite should be true.\u201dThe debate centers on genetics and biology. Direct effects are one thing: when a pregnant woman drinks heavily, it can cause fetal alcohol syndrome. This happens because stress on a pregnant mother\u2019s body is shared to some extent with the fetus, in this case interfering directly with the normal developmental program in utero.But no one can explain exactly how, say, changes in brain cells caused by abuse could be communicated to fully formed sperm or egg cells before conception. And that\u2019s just the first challenge. After conception, when sperm meets egg, a natural process of cleansing, or \u201crebooting,\u201d occurs, stripping away most chemical marks on the genes. Finally, as the fertilized egg grows and develops, a symphony of genetic reshuffling occurs, as cells specialize into brain cells, skin cells, and the rest. How does a signature of trauma survive all of that?And that change, in turn, is strongly associated with alterations in how their offspring handle stress: namely, the young mice are numbed, or less reactive, to the hormones compared to control animals, said Dr. Bale, director of the university\u2019s Center for Epigenetic Research in Child Health and Brain Development. \u201cThese are clear, consistent findings,\u201d she said. \u201cThe field has advanced dramatically in just the past five years.\u201dPerhaps the best explanation for how such trauma marks could be attached to a father\u2019s sperm cells comes from Oliver Rando at the University of Massachusetts. His studies, also in mice, have zeroed in on the epididymis, a tube near the testicles where sperm cells load before ejaculation. There, they learn to swim over a period of days, and their genes can be marked, said Dr. Rando.The molecules that affect the changes appear to be \u201csmall RNAs,\u201d fragments of genetic material that scientists are still learning about, Dr. Rando said.And this debate concerns only the animal research. The human studies thus far are much less persuasive, most experts agree, and have identified no plausible mechanism for epigenetic transmission. Some of the studies have focused not on small RNAs but on an altogether different chemical signature, called cytosine methylation, that could very well be added after conception, not before, Dr. Rando said.The idea that we carry some biological trace of our ancestors\u2019 pain has a strong emotional appeal. It resonates with the feelings that arise when one views images of famine, war or slavery. And it seems to buttress psychodynamic narratives about trauma, and how its legacy can reverberate through families and down the ages. But for now, and for many scientists, the research in epigenetics falls well short of demonstrating that past human cruelties affect our physiology today, in any predictable or consistent way.Advertisement"}

These agreements lay out a reform plan negotiated by federal law enforcement officials and the local government. After seeing the videotaped beating, Elkhart\u2019s mayor, Tim Neese, asked the Indiana State Police for a \u201cvery thorough and far-reaching\u201d investigation of his police department. But the state police turned him down, so he asked the Justice Department for help. His timing could hardly have been worse. Less than three weeks earlier, Jeff Sessions, who was then the attorney general, had sharply limited the Justice Department\u2019s ability to use court-ordered agreements to address abuses by local police departments. It was one of his last actions before he stepped down.Consent agreements were an important part of the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to address misconduct allegations. Cleveland entered into a consent decree in May 2015, six months after an officer shot and killed Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old playing with a gun that fired plastic pellets. A report this summer on Cleveland\u2019s continuing reforms cited a nearly 40 percent drop in officers\u2019 use of force from the previous year. Ferguson, Mo., approved a consent decree in 2016, two years after the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown set off widespread protests. At a status hearing this year, a federal judge said she was seeing \u201ca great deal of progress.\u201dBut Mayor Neese may be left on his own trying to fix a department with a tumultuous history.Elkhart, sometimes called the \u201cRV Capital of the World,\u201d is a city of about 50,000 people near Indiana\u2019s northern border with Michigan. Police problems are nothing new there. In the mid-1990s, a study by two policing experts commissioned by the city called out the department\u2019s \u201creputation for brutality\u201d and its failure to rein in officers who had \u201cabused citizens, violated civil rights, [and] alienated segments of the community.\u201d Many of the problems cited in that long-ago report can still be found today.In early November, we obtained the video of the two Elkhart officers repeatedly punching a handcuffed man in the police station\u2019s detention area. \u201cIf you spit again, we\u2019re going to party,\u201d one of the officers said just before the beating began. The police chief, Ed Windbigler, never mentioned the punches when he told the city\u2019s civilian oversight commission that the two officers had gone \u201ca little overboard\u201d when taking the man to the ground.The chief said he had opted to reprimand the officers, rather than impose more serious discipline, because of their clean records. But one of them had an extensive disciplinary history, with six suspensions and two reprimands in his first five years. Once, according to his personnel file, he arrested a woman for public nudity, then, after she was released from jail on bond, he sent her a friend request on Facebook and seven text messages, asking to \u201chang out.\u201dHe isn\u2019t alone. Of the department\u2019s 34 supervisors, 28 have disciplinary records in their personnel files. One is the mayor's son, a sergeant once reprimanded for firing 13 times at a dog, with at least two bullets striking a house. Fifteen of the supervisors have been suspended, including the chief, assistant chief and patrol captain. Three were convicted of criminal charges during their careers. The assistant chief has been unwelcoming of outside scrutiny. At a town hall meeting in November, he defended the police department while criticizing the news media.

{"Headline": "Inside Facebook\u2019s Secret Rulebook for Global Political Speech", "Date": "2018-12-27", "News": "Under fire for stirring up distrust and violence, the social network has vowed to police its users. But leaked documents raise serious questions about its approach.Supported byMENLO PARK, Calif. \u2014 In a glass conference room at its California headquarters, Facebook is taking on the bonfires of hate and misinformation it has helped fuel across the world, one post at a time.But for Facebook, it\u2019s also a business problem.The company, which makes about $5 billion in profit per quarter, has to show that it is serious about removing dangerous content. It must also continue to attract more users from more countries and try to keep them on the site longer.How can Facebook monitor billions of posts per day in over 100 languages, all without disturbing the endless expansion that is core to its business? The company\u2019s solution: a network of workers using a maze of PowerPoint slides spelling out what\u2019s forbidden.Every other Tuesday morning, several dozen Facebook employees gather over breakfast to come up with the rules, hashing out what the site\u2019s two billion users should be allowed to say. The guidelines that emerge from these meetings are sent out to 7,500-plus moderators around the world. (After publication of this article, Facebook said it had increased that number to around 15,000.)The closely held rules are extensive, and they make the company a far more powerful arbiter of global speech than has been publicly recognized or acknowledged by the company itself, The New York Times has found.An examination of the files revealed numerous gaps, biases and outright errors. As Facebook employees grope for the right answers, they have allowed extremist language to flourish in some countries while censoring mainstream speech in others.Moderators were once told, for example, to remove fund-raising appeals for volcano victims in Indonesia because a co-sponsor of the drive was on Facebook\u2019s internal list of banned groups. In Myanmar, a paperwork error allowed a prominent extremist group, accused of fomenting genocide, to stay on the platform for months. In India, moderators were mistakenly told to flag for possible removal comments critical of religion.The Facebook employees who meet to set the guidelines, mostly young engineers and lawyers, try to distill highly complex issues into simple yes-or-no rules. Then the company outsources much of the actual post-by-post moderation to companies that enlist largely unskilled workers, many hired out of call centers.Those moderators, at times relying on Google Translate, have mere seconds to recall countless rules and apply them to the hundreds of posts that dash across their screens each day. When is a reference to \u201cjihad,\u201d for example, forbidden? When is a \u201ccrying laughter\u201d emoji a warning sign?Moderators express frustration at rules they say don\u2019t always make sense and sometimes require them to leave up posts they fear could lead to violence. \u201cYou feel like you killed someone by not acting,\u201d one said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he had signed a nondisclosure agreement.Facebook executives say they are working diligently to rid the platform of dangerous posts.\u201cIt\u2019s not our place to correct people\u2019s speech, but we do want to enforce our community standards on our platform,\u201d said Sara Su, a senior engineer on the News Feed. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in our community, we want to make sure that we\u2019re balancing freedom of expression and safety.\u201dMonika Bickert, Facebook\u2019s head of global policy management, said that the primary goal was to prevent harm, and that to a great extent, the company had been successful. But perfection, she said, is not possible.\u201cWe have billions of posts every day, we\u2019re identifying more and more potential violations using our technical systems,\u201d Ms. Bickert said. \u201cAt that scale, even if you\u2019re 99 percent accurate, you\u2019re going to have a lot of mistakes.\u201dThe Facebook guidelines do not look like a handbook for regulating global politics. They consist of dozens of unorganized PowerPoint presentations and Excel spreadsheets with bureaucratic titles like \u201cWestern Balkans Hate Orgs and Figures\u201d and \u201cCredible Violence: Implementation standards.\u201dBecause Facebook drifted into this approach somewhat by accident, there is no single master file or overarching guide, just a patchwork of rules set out by different parts of the company. Facebook confirmed the authenticity of the documents, though it said some had been updated since The Times acquired them.The company\u2019s goal is ambitious: to reduce context-heavy questions that even legal experts might struggle with \u2014 when is an idea hateful, when is a rumor dangerous \u2014 to one-size-fits-all rules. By telling moderators to follow the rules blindly, Facebook hopes to guard against bias and to enforce consistency.Facebook says the files are only for training, but moderators say they are used as day-to-day reference materials.Taken individually, each rule might make sense. But in their byzantine totality, they can be a bit baffling.One document sets out several rules just to determine when a word like \u201cmartyr\u201d or \u201cjihad\u201d indicates pro-terrorism speech. Another describes when discussion of a barred group should be forbidden. Words like \u201cbrother\u201d or \u201ccomrade\u201d probably cross the line. So do any of a dozen emojis.The guidelines for identifying hate speech, a problem that has bedeviled Facebook, run to 200 jargon-filled, head-spinning pages. Moderators must sort a post into one of three \u201ctiers\u201d of severity. They must bear in mind lists like the six \u201cdesignated dehumanizing comparisons,\u201d among them comparing Jews to rats.\u201cThere\u2019s a real tension here between wanting to have nuances to account for every situation, and wanting to have a set of policies we can enforce accurately and we can explain cleanly,\u201d said Ms. Bickert, the Facebook executive.Though the Facebook employees who make the rules are largely free to set policy however they wish, and often do so in the room, they also consult with outside groups.\u201cWe\u2019re not drawing these lines in a vacuum,\u201d Ms. Bickert said.As detailed as the guidelines can be, they are also approximations \u2014 best guesses at how to fight extremism or disinformation. And they are leading Facebook to intrude into sensitive political matters the world over, sometimes clumsily.Increasingly, the decisions on what posts should be barred amount to regulating political speech \u2014 and not just on the fringes. In many countries, extremism and the mainstream are blurring.In June, according to internal emails reviewed by The Times, moderators were told to allow users to praise the Taliban \u2014 normally a forbidden practice \u2014 if they mentioned its decision to enter into a cease-fire. In another email, moderators were told to hunt down and remove rumors wrongly accusing an Israeli soldier of killing a Palestinian medic.\u201cFacebook\u2019s role has become so hegemonic, so monopolistic, that it has become a force unto itself,\u201d said Jasmin Mujanovic, an expert on the Balkans. \u201cNo one entity, especially not a for-profit venture like Facebook, should have that kind of power to influence public debate and policy.\u201dIn Pakistan, shortly before elections were held in July, Facebook issued its moderators a 40-page document outlining \u201cpolitical parties, expected trends and guidelines.\u201dPakistan, one of the world\u2019s largest and most fragile democracies, enforces an Election Day blackout on campaigning. Facebook is a center of news and discussion during voting.The document most likely shaped those conversations \u2014 even if Pakistanis themselves had no way of knowing it. Moderators were urged, in one instance, to apply extra scrutiny to Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam, a hard-line religious party. But another religious party, Jamaat-e-Islami, was described as \u201cbenign.\u201dThough Facebook says its focus is protecting users, the documents suggest that other concerns come into play. Pakistan guidelines warn moderators against creating a \u201cPR fire\u201d by taking any action that could \u201chave a negative impact on Facebook\u2019s reputation or even put the company at legal risk.\u201dIn India, Chinmayi Arun, a legal scholar, identified troubling mistakes in Facebook\u2019s guidelines.One slide tells moderators that any post degrading an entire religion violates Indian law and should be flagged for removal. It is a significant curb on speech \u2014 and apparently incorrect. Indian law prohibits blasphemy only in certain conditions, Ms. Arun said, such as when the speaker intends to inflame violence.Facebook says it is simply urging moderators to apply extra scrutiny to posts that use the phrase. Still, even this could chill activism in Kashmir. And it is not clear that the distinction will be obvious to moderators, who are warned that ignoring violations could get Facebook blocked in India.In the absence of governments or international bodies that can set standards, Facebook is experimenting on its own.The company never set out to play this role, but in an effort to control problems of its own creation, it has quietly become, with a speed that makes even employees uncomfortable, what is arguably one of the world\u2019s most powerful political regulators.\u201cA lot of this would be a lot easier if there were authoritative third parties that had the answer,\u201d said Brian Fishman, a counterterrorism expert who works with Facebook.\u201cSometimes these things explode really fast,\u201d Mr. Fishman said, \u201cand we have to figure out what our reaction\u2019s going to be, and we don\u2019t have time for the U.N.\u201dBut the results can be uneven.The slides are apparently written for English speakers relying on Google Translate, suggesting that Facebook remains short on moderators who speak local languages \u2014 and who might understand local contexts crucial for identifying inflammatory speech. And Google Translate can be unreliable: Mr. Mladic is referred to in one slide as \u201cRodney Young.\u201dThe guidelines, said Mr. Mujanovic, the Balkans expert, appear dangerously out of date. They have little to say about ultranationalist groups stoking political violence in the region.But puzzled activists in Myanmar say that, months later, posts supporting the group remain widespread.The culprit may be Facebook\u2019s own rulebooks. Guidelines for policing hate speech in Myanmar instruct moderators not to remove posts supporting Ma Ba Tha. Facebook corrected the mistake only in response to an inquiry from The Times.Employees also touted their decision to shut down Facebook accounts belonging to senior military officials in Myanmar.But the company did not initially notify Myanmar\u2019s government, leading the barred officers to conclude that they had been hacked. Some blamed Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the country\u2019s de facto civilian leader, and the episode deepened distrust between her and the military, lawmakers say.Facebook\u2019s most politically consequential document may be an Excel spreadsheet that names every group and individual the company has quietly barred as a hate figure.Moderators are instructed to remove any post praising, supporting or representing any listed figure.Anton Shekhovtsov, an expert in far-right groups, said he was \u201cconfused about the methodology.\u201d The company bans an impressive array of American and British groups, he said, but relatively few in countries where the far right can be more violent, particularly Russia or Ukraine.Countries where Facebook faces government pressure seem to be better covered than those where it does not. Facebook blocks dozens of far-right groups in Germany, where the authorities scrutinize the social network, but only one in neighboring Austria.The list includes a growing number of groups with one foot in the political mainstream, like the far-right Golden Dawn, which holds seats in the Greek and European Union parliaments.For a tech company to draw these lines is \u201cextremely problematic,\u201d said Jonas Kaiser, a Harvard University expert on online extremism. \u201cIt puts social networks in the position to make judgment calls that are traditionally the job of the courts.\u201dThe bans are a kind of shortcut, said Sana Jaffrey, who studies Indonesian politics at the University of Chicago. Asking moderators to look for a banned name or logo is easier than asking them to make judgment calls about when political views are dangerous.But that means that in much of Asia and the Middle East, Facebook bans hard-line religious groups that represent significant segments of society. Blanket prohibitions, Ms. Jaffrey said, amount to Facebook shutting down one side in national debates.And its decisions often skew in favor of governments, which can fine or regulate Facebook.Kate Cronin-Furman, a Sri Lanka expert at University College London, said this prevented Tamils from memorializing the war, allowing the government to impose its version of events \u2014 entrenching Tamils\u2019 second-class status.Facebook\u2019s policies might emerge from well-appointed conference rooms, but they are executed largely by moderators in drab outsourcing offices in distant locations like Morocco and the Philippines.Facebook says moderators are given ample time to review posts and don\u2019t have quotas. Moderators say they face pressure to review about a thousand pieces of content per day. They have eight to 10 seconds for each post, longer for videos.The moderators describe feeling in over their heads. For some, pay is tied to speed and accuracy. Many last only a few exhausting months. Front-line moderators have few mechanisms for alerting Facebook to new threats or holes in the rules \u2014 and little incentive to try, one said.One moderator described an officewide rule to approve any post if no one on hand can read the appropriate language. This may have contributed to violence in Sri Lanka and Myanmar, where posts encouraging ethnic cleansing were routinely allowed to stay up.Facebook says that any such practice would violate its rules, which include contingencies for reviewing posts in unfamiliar languages. Justin Osofsky, a Facebook vice president who oversees these contracts, said any corner-cutting probably came from midlevel managers at outside companies acting on their own.This hints at a deeper problem. Facebook has little visibility into the giant outsourcing companies, which largely police themselves, and has at times struggled to control them. And because Facebook relies on the companies to support its expansion, its leverage over them is limited.One hurdle to reining in inflammatory speech on Facebook may be Facebook itself. The platform relies on an algorithm that tends to promote the most provocative content, sometimes of the sort the company says it wants to suppress.Facebook could blunt that algorithm or slow the company\u2019s expansion into new markets, where it has proved most disruptive. But the social network instills in employees an almost unquestioned faith in their product as a force for good.When Ms. Su, the News Feed engineer, was asked if she believed research finding that more Facebook usage correlates with more violence, she replied, \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d\u201cAs we have greater reach, as we have more people engaging, that raises the stakes,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I also think that there\u2019s greater opportunity for people to be exposed to new ideas.\u201dStill, even some executives hesitate when asked whether the company has found the right formula.Richard Allan, a London-based vice president who is also a sitting member of the House of Lords, said a better model might be \u201csome partnership arrangement\u201d with \u201cgovernment involved in setting the standards,\u201d even if not all governments can be trusted with this power.Mr. Fishman, the Facebook terrorism expert, said the company should consider deferring more decisions to moderators, who may better understand the nuances of local culture and politics.But at company headquarters, the most fundamental questions of all remain unanswered: What sorts of content lead directly to violence? When does the platform exacerbate social tensions?Rosa Birch, who leads an internal crisis team, said she and her colleagues had been posing these questions for years. They are making progress, she said, but will probably never have definitive answers.But without a full understanding of the platform\u2019s impact, most policies are just ad hoc responses to problems as they emerge. Employees make a tweak, wait to see what happens, then tweak again \u2014 as if repairing an airplane midflight.In the meantime, the company continues to expand its reach to more users in more countries.\u201cOne of the reasons why it\u2019s hard to talk about,\u201d Mr. Fishman said, \u201cis because there is a lack of societal agreement on where this sort of authority should lie.\u201dBut, he said, \u201cit\u2019s harder to figure out what a better alternative is.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated a restriction imposed by Pakistan on Election Day.

Multiple titles \u2014 Bob Woodward\u2019s \u201cFear,\u201d Bill Clinton and James Patterson\u2019s \u201cThe President Is Missing\u201d and Michelle Obama\u2019s \u201cBecoming\u201d \u2014 have passed the million-copy mark, while there is also a surprisingly strong appetite for literary fiction.But what should be good news for publishers, agents and authors has created headaches during the crucial holiday sales season, as printing presses struggle to keep up with a surge in demand, creating a backlog that has led to stock shortages of popular titles.The industrywide paper jam has been building for months \u2014 a result of shrinking and consolidation among printing companies, the collapse of one of the major printers this summer, global paper shortages and a tightening job market that\u2019s made it difficult for printers to hire additional seasonal workers. But it has become increasingly acute and visible at the industry\u2019s peak sales season, when consumers are shopping for must-read titles to give as gifts, and finding that Amazon\u2019s virtual shelves are bare.For authors whose books have been out of stock in the run up to the holidays, it can be hard to recover the lost royalties and sinking Amazon rankings. In a Facebook message, Ms. Makkai urged readers to shop at independent stores for her novel after Amazon listed it as out of stock and indicated it wouldn\u2019t ship until after Christmas. \u201cThis whole situation is rotten, and my press is doing everything they can, but ugh, this is really, really bad timing,\u201d she wrote.Agents and authors say part of the problem is that publishers and retailers have become more risk averse. Publishers are printing smaller first runs, partly because retailers are ordering fewer copies initially, waiting to see which titles take off to avoid making the wrong bet and getting stuck storing unsold inventory. In the past, it was often easy to get another batch of books printed in a week or two if a title sold unexpectedly well, but these days some publishers say it can take one or two months.On top of that, the seemingly bottomless appetite among readers for a handful of blockbuster titles has tightened the bottleneck at the printing presses, consuming what little slack there was in the system. Mr. Woodward\u2019s \u201cFear\u201d has sold nearly two million copies in all formats, while Mrs. Obama\u2019s \u201cBecoming,\u201d which came out in November, has sold 3.8 million copies.\u201cThe capacity is so tight that if you get a book that takes off like \u2018Becoming,\u2019 you have to stop what they were printing and print more \u2018Becoming,\u2019 then whatever they were printing is late,\u201d said Dennis Abboud, the chief executive of ReaderLink, the main book distributor to Target, Walmart and other outlets. \u201cThen the train is really off the rails.\u201dAt the same time, publishers have been caught off guard by a handful of surprise best sellers, literary titles from lesser-known authors that are now in short supply the week before Christmas, the worst possible time to be out of stock.\u201cAll of the sudden, there\u2019s just no capacity,\u201d said the literary agent Chris Parris-Lamb, who represents Ms. Halliday. \u201cThe books that become outliers, the ones that are actually selling, then they become a victim of their own success.\u201dThe backlog is so severe that it is spilling over into next year, causing publishers to shift the release dates for some January books because they can\u2019t print copies in time. At Penguin Random House, at least a dozen titles scheduled for early 2019 have been pushed back, typically by a few weeks, according to a company executive. Other publishers said that a handful of titles were being delayed because of the backlog at the printers.\u201cIn the macro, business is healthy and there are plenty of books on shelves across America for people to buy,\u201d said Michael Cader, a book industry analyst and the founder of Publishers Marketplace. \u201cBut if it\u2019s your book and there\u2019s demand and it\u2019s out of stock, that\u2019s very painful.\u201dEvery year during the holidays, a handful of unexpected breakout books sell out of stock, frustrating consumers and the authors who wrote them, but leaving the industry as a whole unscathed. But this year the shortages are more widespread, and the factors driving them are more systemic and harder to mitigate.\u201cIt\u2019s more complex than it\u2019s been in the past. You can\u2019t just count on making a phone call to your printer and saying this book is taking off, let\u2019s do a press run this week,\u201d said Adam Rothberg, senior vice president of corporate communications at Simon & Schuster. \u201cThis is the new normal for the foreseeable future.\u201dMadeline McIntosh, the chief executive of Penguin Random House U.S., said that most of the company\u2019s in-demand titles were available through other outlets, despite being out-of-stock at some major retailers, and noted that \u201cat this time of year, we are always working through issues related to spiking holiday demand for hot books.\u201dThe biggest cause of the bottleneck, publishers and agents say, is consolidation and collapse among printing companies. One large printing company, Edward Brothers Malloy, shut down this summer. Next year, two of the largest printers in the United States, Quad Graphics and LSC Communications, are expected to merge, which publishers worry will lead to fewer options for printing services.The printing industry has its own problems, including paper shortages and price increases. And the low unemployment rate has made it harder for printers to hire additional workers. Quad Graphics, which has 55 print-production centers and 22,000 employees worldwide, \u201chas experienced staffing challenges due to record low unemployment,\u201d according to a company spokeswoman.Surprisingly, some of the current chaos has come about because the publishing industry is not only stable but seems to be thriving. After years of declining print sales, hardcover and paperback editions have been rising recently, while e-book sales have fallen. Publishers\u2019 revenues from hardcover sales rose 3.5 percent in the first 10 months of this year, while revenue from digital books fell 3 percent in the same period, according to the Association of American Publishers.Some big publishers have been investing in print infrastructure and inventory management in recent years, expanding their warehouses and improving their ability to refill orders from retailers quickly, but they have little control over the printing presses, where capacity has shrunk.The effects are reverberating across the industry. This fall, W. W. Norton had to scramble to salvage an author\u2019s book tour when they learned that books wouldn\u2019t be available on his October publication date because the printers were overbooked. The author, James M. Scott, had more than a dozen events planned in October to promote his book, \u201cRampage: MacArthur, Yamashita and the Battle of Manila,\u201d but the printer couldn\u2019t deliver books until roughly a month later.Norton was able to get a small batch of books to sell at the events, before the first print run was ready, but at great cost: It involved taking unbound pages, gathering them by hand and having them bound and shipped overnight to the event sites.\u201cIt\u2019s an editor\u2019s nightmare,\u201d said John Glusman, vice president and editor in chief of Norton.Norton also struggled to meet unexpected demand for Mr. Powers\u2019s novel \u201cThe Overstory,\u201d which was released in April with a first printing of 25,000 copies. Sales continued to climb throughout the year, and they got a boost when the novel was a finalist for the Man Booker Prize.In mid-October, worried that stock would run out just before the holidays, Norton ordered a 10th printing of the book, an additional 10,000 copies. A priority rush order typically takes two weeks, but Norton was told that it would take two months. The new editions arrived at the publishers\u2019 warehouse on Dec. 17, but those copies still needed to get to retailers in time for holiday purchases. Norton just ordered an 11th printing, which will bring the total copies in circulation to 115,000.Still, it may be too late for some holiday shoppers.\u201cDemand has delightfully exceeded expectations,\u201d Mr. Glusman said. \u201cIs there such a thing as too much demand?\u201dThe print shortages have left both large and small retailers scrambling, though a huge company like Amazon can more easily absorb the impact of lost sales than a small independent store.Barnes & Noble\u2019s stores have been hit with \u201climited quantities, delays in publication dates, and more just-in-time minute-by-minute delivery that has driven delivery expense,\u201d said Tim Mantel, Barnes & Noble\u2019s chief merchandising officer.Independent bookstores have also been struggling to meet demand for unexpected best sellers, though many placed more robust orders this year in anticipation of holiday shortages.Catherine Bock, the book buyer at Parnassus Books in Nashville, said the store has run out of a handful of popular titles, including \u201cAsymmetry\u201d and \u201cSalt, Fat, Acid, Heat.\u201dRobert Sindelar, the managing partner of Third Place Books in Seattle, said it\u2019s been unusually difficult to restock popular titles this year. His store ran out of the Frederick Douglass biography before Thanksgiving. It sold out of \u201cSalt, Fat, Acid, Heat\u201d about a week ago. It recently got a small shipment of the title, but those were already presold, he said. \u201cWe probably could have sold another 100 of that one,\u201d he said.Ms. Nosrat, whose cookbook came out in April 2017 and has sold nearly 300,000 copies, said she and her agent realized in early December that copies of her book would most likely sell out before the holidays, even after an additional domestic printing this fall of 30,000 copies.\u201cI feel like I got punched in the gut a little bit,\u201d Ms. Nosrat said. \u201cBut I\u2019m aware that this is a rare and lucky problem to have.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The End of Privacy Began in the 1960s", "Date": "2018-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChoices that Congress made decades ago allowed tech giants to become as powerful as they are.Dr. O\u2019Mara, a professor of history, is the author of a forthcoming book about the history of Silicon Valley.The House Judiciary Committee is scheduled to question Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google, over allegations of bias in its algorithms, and energized Democrats are vowing to turn up the heat on tech companies over antitrust and privacy when they take over House leadership in January. There is a growing recognition in Silicon Valley and Washington that current data privacy regulations need to be changed. Understanding how American lawmakers approached these issues in the past is essential to getting it right this time.The mid-1960s were the heyday of punch-card-powered mainframe computers. In the two decades since their invention, digital machines had proved capable of processing a dizzying amount of information. Much of this data was personal, from medical information to military records to the type of cereal families bought at the supermarket, and there were no legal limits on what kind of data could be collected or by whom. The targeted marketing business until then had been largely left alone by regulators because it was so inexact. The computer age, however, transformed consumer targeting into a far more powerful science.Unnerving amounts of personal information now could be sucked into bureaucratic databases, Packard observed. \u201cThere are banks of giant memory machines that conceivably could recall in a few seconds every pertinent action \u2014 including failures, embarrassments or possibly incriminating acts \u2014 from the lifetime of each citizen,\u201d he wrote.The uproar killed the National Data Bank. Over 100 pieces of data privacy legislation were introduced over the following years. The few that passed were landmarks \u2014 the Freedom of Information Act in 1967, the Fair Credit Reporting Act in 1970, and the Privacy Act in 1974 \u2014 but all of them focused on individuals\u2019 right to know about the information these databases held. None addressed the question of whether this information should have been gathered in the first place.In being so relentlessly focused on the government\u2019s use and abuse of data, Congress paid little attention to what private industry was doing. American companies remained free to gather data on the people who used their products. Congress is again wrestling with the balance between freedom of information and the right to privacy. Proposals for greater transparency \u2014 such as labeling bots so people know when they are interacting with a machine, and providing access for consumers to the data that companies obtain about them \u2014 are important first steps. But industry and lawmakers need to take a hard look at the data that companies are allowed to collect in the first place.Congress should recognize what it did not half a century ago: protecting privacy is bigger than quashing one databank, condemning one company or curbing one industry. And the decisions made now will shape technological generations to come.The computer never forgets.

The restaurant, named for the intrepid women who dive for seafood near Jeju Island in South Korea, opened in late November. Fish and assorted seafood are significant components on the menu, which Ms. Kwak oversees as chef. Do Hwa and Ms. Kwak\u2019s original restaurant, Dok Suni\u2019s in the East Village, helped expose Western palates to Korean food beyond the Seoul-centric enclave of restaurants on West 32nd Street. Here, in an understated, graciously lit dining room, she gives her food refreshing touches, like topping grilled oysters with seaweed butter and parking brioche toast alongside, and adding chorizo to a rice cake. Pillowy, sugar-dusted beignets are a signature sweet. Ms. Kwak\u2019s mother, Myung Ja Kwak, who owned the other restaurants, has retired, though she is still making the kimchi.This Smorgasburg fixture is opening a more permanent stand in Chelsea Market. The fried mozzarella sticks it produces in Brooklyn and sells at music and sports events will be front and center, made on the premises. Also on the menu are chicken parm bites; burrata stuffed with pesto; garlic fries; and caprese pesto sandwiches. Fresh mozzarella made all day long will be sold to take away. (Opens Thursday)Named for a street in central Dublin, this theater-district pub in a new boutique hotel takes a fairly traditional route when it comes to pub fare, like fish and chips, burgers, smoked salmon and a seafood chowder. But instead of making a classic shepherd\u2019s pie, it uses the ingredients, lamb and potatoes, to fill an empanada zapped with salsa verde. The room suggests a pub in modern, not vintage, terms. This West Chelsea bar with literary and artistic roots will close at the end of January. On the bar\u2019s website, the partners \u2014 Scott Anderson, a writer; his wife, Nanette Burstein, a filmmaker; and Sebastian Junger, also a writer \u2014 posted that the nightly readings and events for which the bar has been known since 2000 will be permanently interrupted by \u201cfinancial reality.\u201d This steakhouse on East 22nd Street owned by ESquared Hospitality has closed. It was originally a partnership between ESquared and the chef Laurent Tourondel, who coined the name, which stands for Bistro Laurent Tourondel. The partners became tangled in a dispute leading to the chef\u2019s departure. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tinder and Bumble Are Hungry for Your Love", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe big online dating rebrand means the apps want you to fall in love with them now.After all, it\u2019s been more than half a decade since they were invented, and if you\u2019ve been single in the last five years, chances are you\u2019ve used one. In its annual survey of 5,000 Americans, Match Group, the dating conglomerate that owns Tinder and OkCupid, found that singles met first dates on the internet more than through any other venue, and that 62 percent of millennials surveyed had used a dating app. Elie Seidman, Tinder\u2019s chief executive and the former head of OKCupid, said that the company wants to brand itself as the leader of early-adult dating. \u201cWe actually embrace the fact that our members are in that dating-as-a-leisure activity phase of life,\u201d Mr. Seidman said. He added that, with the new editorial content, Tinder hoped to offer users a positive outlook on that landscape. Tinder relationships often don\u2019t go anywhere at all \u2014 and that\u2019s fine! Still, she praised Tinder for spurring her cross-country move, even though the relationship was a bust. \u201cLittle did I know, when I used the app last summer, I wasn\u2019t swiping for love or anything crazy like that \u2014 I was swiping for change,\u201d she wrote.\u201cGET ON TINDER,\u201d reads the large, hyperlinked button at the end of the piece.If Tinder has taken a page from the confessional style of sites like Thought Catalog or xoJane, Bumble\u2019s strategy seems inspired by the Forbes\u2019s annual 30 Under 30 lists. Its \u201cFind Them on Bumble\u201d campaign collects the 112 \u201cmost inspiring New Yorkers,\u201d according to the company, and subtly links their success to Bumble\u2019s services. (In addition to being the second-most popular dating app in the United States according to App Annie, Bumble connects people to new friends through Bumble BFF and with professional contacts through Bumble Bizz.) In interviews, some of the campaign\u2019s participants said that they had only joined the app as a condition of appearing on billboards and bus stops. That is to say, you could not \u201cfind them on Bumble\u201d until shortly before Bumble said you could.Mr. Neiman is single, but when asked about whether he uses dating apps, he was explicit: \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cNo, no, no, no.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the devil\u2019s playground,\u201d he said. \u201cI try to avoid all that temptation.\u201dTodd Wiseman, another New Yorker featured in the Bumble campaign and the founder of the video production studio Hayden 5, said that he did use Bumble to find romantic prospects before he was chosen to embody the brand. If he could choose, though, he said: \u201cI would prefer to meet someone out in real life.\u201dThe ballerina Isabella Boylston, who is also in the campaign and also married, said that she was on Bumble\u2019s BFF platform, though she politely declined to answer a question about whether she uses the app regularly.Alex Williamson, Bumble\u2019s head of brand, said that the search to find the New York Bumble representatives was extensive.\u201cFor years we\u2019ve been talking about an opportunity to showcase our users and their stories,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile we love our product, our product in some ways is really our people.\u201d Swipe Life received only 4,000 unique views on desktop in October, its first month, according to comScore.

But this is something that we hope can accompany our users on their dating journey.\u201dMs. Williamson said that Bumble\u2019s campaign has been a success. Though she could not provide specific numbers, she said that the app had seen a \u201csignificant uptick\u201d in users since the campaign started in October, and that the company would be choosing cohorts of spokespeople in other large markets.The campaign, she said, was \u201ca celebration of what we\u2019ve been able to build\u201d \u2014 even if that isn\u2019t lasting romance.\u201cWe really are trying to connect people to meaningful relationships,\u201d Ms. Williamson said. \u201cWhatever shape and form that looks like for you.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the source of a comment from Scott Chen, Grindr's president.

{"Headline": "Chatbots Are a Danger to Democracy", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWe need to identify, disqualify and regulate chatbots before they destroy political speech.Mr. Susskind is a lawyer. As we survey the fallout from the midterm elections, it would be easy to miss the longer-term threats to democracy that are waiting around the corner. Perhaps the most serious is political artificial intelligence in the form of automated \u201cchatbots,\u201d which masquerade as humans and try to hijack the political process.Chatbots are software programs that are capable of conversing with human beings on social media using natural language. Increasingly, they take the form of machine learning systems that are not painstakingly \u201ctaught\u201d vocabulary, grammar and syntax but rather \u201clearn\u201d to respond appropriately using probabilistic inference from large data sets, together with some human guidance.It\u2019s irrelevant that current bots are not \u201csmart\u201d like we are, or that they have not achieved the consciousness and creativity hoped for by A.I. purists. What matters is their impact.Unless we take action, chatbots could seriously endanger our democracy, and not just when they go haywire.The most obvious risk is that we are crowded out of our own deliberative processes by systems that are too fast and too ubiquitous for us to keep up with. Who would bother to join a debate where every contribution is ripped to shreds within seconds by a thousand digital adversaries? A related risk is that wealthy people will be able to afford the best chatbots. Prosperous interest groups and corporations, whose views already enjoy a dominant place in public discourse, will inevitably be in the best position to capitalize on the rhetorical advantages afforded by these new technologies. But more needs to be done.A subtler method would involve mandatory identification: requiring all chatbots to be publicly registered and to state at all times the fact that they are chatbots, and the identity of their human owners and controllers. Again, the Bot Disclosure and Accountability Bill would go some way to meeting this aim, requiring the Federal Trade Commission to force social media platforms to introduce policies requiring users to provide \u201cclear and conspicuous notice\u201d of bots \u201cin plain and clear language,\u201d and to police breaches of that rule. The main onus would be on platforms to root out transgressors.We need not treat the speech of chatbots with the same reverence that we treat human speech. Moreover, bots are too fast and tricky to be subject to ordinary rules of debate. For both those reasons, the methods we use to regulate bots must be more robust than those we apply to people. There can be no half-measures when democracy is at stake.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Secret Experiment in Alabama Senate Race Imitated Russian Tactics", "Date": "2018-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs Russia\u2019s online election machinations came to light last year, a group of Democratic tech experts decided to try out similarly deceptive tactics in the fiercely contested Alabama Senate race, according to people familiar with the effort and a report on its results.The secret project, carried out on Facebook and Twitter, was likely too small to have a significant effect on the race, in which the Democratic candidate it was designed to help, Doug Jones, edged out the Republican, Roy S. Moore. But it was a sign that American political operatives of both parties have paid close attention to the Russian methods, which some fear may come to taint elections in the United States.One participant in the Alabama project, Jonathon Morgan, is the chief executive of New Knowledge, a small cyber security firm that wrote a scathing account of Russia\u2019s social media operations in the 2016 election that was released this week by the Senate Intelligence Committee.An internal report on the Alabama effort, obtained by The New York Times, says explicitly that it \u201cexperimented with many of the tactics now understood to have influenced the 2016 elections.\u201dThe project\u2019s operators created a Facebook page on which they posed as conservative Alabamians, using it to try to divide Republicans and even to endorse a write-in candidate to draw votes from Mr. Moore. It involved a scheme to link the Moore campaign to thousands of Russian accounts that suddenly began following the Republican candidate on Twitter, a development that drew national media attention.\u201cWe orchestrated an elaborate \u2018false flag\u2019 operation that planted the idea that the Moore campaign was amplified on social media by a Russian botnet,\u201d the report says.Mr. Morgan said in an interview that the Russian botnet ruse \u201cdoes not ring a bell,\u201d adding that others had worked on the effort and had written the report. He said he saw the project as \u201ca small experiment\u201d designed to explore how certain online tactics worked, not to affect the election.Mr. Morgan said he could not account for the claims in the report that the project sought to \u201cenrage and energize Democrats\u201d and \u201cdepress turnout\u201d among Republicans, partly by emphasizing accusations that Mr. Moore had pursued teenage girls when he was a prosecutor in his 30s.\u201cThe research project was intended to help us understand how these kind of campaigns operated,\u201d said Mr. Morgan. \u201cWe thought it was useful to work in the context of a real election but design it to have almost no impact.\u201dThe project had a budget of just $100,000, in a race that cost approximately $51 million, including the primaries, according to Federal Election Commission records.But however modest, the influence effort in Alabama may be a sign of things to come. Campaign veterans in both parties fear the Russian example may set off a race to the bottom, in which candidates choose social media manipulation because they fear their opponents will.\u201cSome will do whatever it takes to win,\u201d said Dan Bayens, a Kentucky-based Republican consultant. \u201cYou\u2019ve got Russia, which showed folks how to do it, you\u2019ve got consultants willing to engage in this type of behavior and political leaders who apparently find it futile to stop it.\u201dThere is no evidence that Mr. Jones sanctioned or was even aware of the social media project. Joe Trippi, a seasoned Democratic operative who served as a top adviser to the Jones campaign, said he had noticed the Russian bot swarm suddenly following Mr. Moore on Twitter. But he said it was impossible that a $100,000 operation had an impact on the race.Mr. Trippi said he was nonetheless disturbed by the stealth operation. \u201cI think the big danger is somebody in this cycle uses the dark arts of bots and social networks and it works,\u201d he said. \u201cThen we\u2019re in real trouble.\u201dDespite its small size, the Alabama project brought together some prominent names in the world of political technology. The funding came from Reid Hoffman, the billionaire co-founder of LinkedIn, who has sought to help Democrats catch up with Republicans in their use of online technology.The money passed through American Engagement Technologies, run by Mikey Dickerson, the founding director of the United States Digital Service, which was created during the Obama administration to try to upgrade the federal government\u2019s use of technology. Sara K. Hudson, a former Justice Department fellow now with Investing in Us, a tech finance company partly funded by Mr. Hoffman, worked on the project, along with Mr. Morgan.A close collaborator of Mr. Hoffman, Dmitri Mehlhorn, the founder of Investing in Us, said in a statement that \u201cour purpose in investing in politics and civic engagement is to strengthen American democracy\u201d and that while they do not \u201cmicromanage\u201d the projects they fund, they are not aware of having financed projects that have used deception. Mr. Dickerson declined to comment and Ms. Hudson did not respond to queries.The Alabama project got started as Democrats were coming to grips with the Russians\u2019 weaponizing of social media to undermine the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton and promote Donald J. Trump.Mr. Morgan reached out at the time to Ren\u00e9e DiResta, who would later join New Knowledge and was lead author of the report on Russian social media operations released this week.\u201cI know there were people who believed the Democrats needed to fight fire with fire,\u201d Ms. DiResta said, adding that she disagreed. \u201cIt was absolutely chatter going around the party.\u201dBut she said Mr. Morgan simply asked her for suggestions of online tactics worth testing. \u201cMy understanding was that they were going to investigate to what extent they could grow audiences for Facebook pages using sensational news,\u201d she said.Mr. Morgan confirmed that the project created a generic page to draw conservative Alabamians \u2014 he said he couldn\u2019t remember its name \u2014 and that Mac Watson, one of multiple write-in candidates, contacted the page. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t do anything on his behalf,\u201d he said.Mr. Watson, who runs a patio supply company in Auburn, Ala., confirmed that he got some assistance from a Facebook page whose operators seemed determined to stay in the shadows.Of dozens of conservative Alabamian-oriented pages on Facebook that he wrote to, only one replied. \u201cYou are in a particularly interesting position and from what we have read of your politics, we would be inclined to endorse you,\u201d the unnamed operator of the page wrote. After Mr. Watson answered a single question about abortion rights as a sort of test, the page offered an endorsement, though no money.\u201cThey never spent one red dime as far as I know on anything I did \u2014 they just kind of told their 400 followers, \u2018Hey, vote for this guy,\u2019\u201d Mr. Watson said.Mr. Watson never spoke with the page\u2019s author or authors by phone, and they declined a request for meeting. But he did notice something unusual: his Twitter followers suddenly ballooned from about 100 to about 10,000. The Facebook page\u2019s operators asked Mr. Watson whether he trusted anyone to set up a super PAC that could receive funding and offered advice on how to sharpen his appeal to disenchanted Republican voters.Shortly before the election, the page sent him a message, wishing him luck.Inside the Moore campaign, officials began to worry about online interference.\u201cWe did have suspicions that something odd was going on,\u201d said Rich Hobson, Mr. Moore\u2019s campaign manager. Mr. Hobson said that although he did not recall any hard evidence of interference, the campaign complained to Facebook about potential chicanery.\u201cAny and all of these things could make a difference,\u201d Mr. Hobson said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely frustrating, and we still kick ourselves that Judge Moore didn\u2019t win.\u201dWhen Election Day came, Mr. Jones became the first Alabama Democrat elected to the Senate in a quarter of a century, defeating Mr. Moore by 21,924 votes in a race that drew more than 22,800 write-in votes. More than 1.3 million ballots were cast over all.Many of the write-in votes went to then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Condoleezza Rice \u2014 an Alabama native and former secretary of state \u2014 certain popular football coaches and Jesus Christ. Mr. Watson drew just a few hundred votes.Mr. Watson noticed one other oddity. The day after the vote, the Facebook page that had taken such an interest in him had vanished.\u201cIt was a group that, like, honest to God, next day was gone,\u201d said Mr. Watson.\u201cIt was weird,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole thing was weird.\u201dJonathan Martin and Rachel Shorey contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "An American Photographer\u2019s Pilgrimage to the Italian Village of Luzzara ", "Date": "2018-12-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bylensMore than 60 years after Paul Strand\u2019s seminal photos of Luzzara, photographer David Maialetti documented the Italian village and its residents.In the world of photography, Luzzara is a known entity. In the early 1950s, Italian screenwriter and neorealist theoretician Cesare Zavattini, who was born there, introduced Paul Strand to the town, and together they produced \u201cUn Paese,\u201d which was published in Italy in 1955 and in the United States in 1997. Portraits of townspeople and images of their livelihoods and landscape were accompanied by oral histories recounting people\u2019s experiences of working the land, surviving the war, and enjoying life\u2019s mundane pleasures.Mr. Maialetti\u2019s visual challenge of \u201creturning\u201d to the documented Luzzara is further complicated by the fact that he was preceded by such luminaries as Gianni Berengo Gardin and Stephen Shore, who also made projects of photographing the town, in 1973-74 and 1993, respectively.How does one make sense of a place, even one as small as Luzzara, that has witnessed such intense and focused visual documentation? There is an inherent and lingering nostalgia that needs to be confronted and overcome in such an undertaking. Mr. Maialetti tips his hat, visually, to his predecessors by photographing the few remaining elderly women Strand had met six decades earlier. His portrait of four men and a bicycle placed theatrically in front of a building and staring at the viewer is a visual homage to both Strand and the Lusettis, one that asks us to consider history and change in this specific location.As the title of his book suggests, Mr. Maialetti offers not simply \u201canother look\u201d but a personal take. While the collection opens with the river and Luzzara\u2019s rural outskirts, it is Italian town life that is featured and celebrated by his sympathetic eye. In more than one of his images, arcaded porticos and building facades are graced by elongated shadows created by the storied Italian sunlight. The viewer is made privy to the quotidian spaces of the market, the cafe, the barber shop, and other locations where men, women and children participate in the cherished realm of Italian public life.Some of the many pleasures of Mr. Maialetti\u2019s engaging works are the various portraits of everyday townspeople photographed meeting the viewer with resolute gazes, greeting the visitor with smiles and laughter, asking us to look anew at Luzzara and its inhabitants. From youths gamboling in the streets to elders seated on benches, the photographer offers a panoply of Italian life in the 21st century.Joseph Sciorra is a director at Queens College\u2019s John D.

I also don\u2019t like crowds.But I also hate the way searching for the perfectly priced present reminds me that for many Americans, especially African-American shoppers, prices are never going to be perfect.I saw this for myself when I walked into a holiday sale at Rent-A-Center in Flatbush, Brooklyn. Oversize flat-screen TVs lined the walls and overstuffed couches filled the floors. The large \u201cNo Credit Needed\u201d sign on the window made me feel as if I might actually be able to afford something.While walking me through the season specials, a sales representative pointed out an advertisement selling Beats by Dre headphones for $20 a week. It sounded reasonable enough until I read the fine print that explained after a 61-week payment plan the headphones would cost $1,219.39.You can buy the headphones outright for $349.95 or less. So that\u2019s not just an exorbitant markup. In some states it could be illegal.I have not been tempted to finance an Xbox this way, even though I grew up in black neighborhoods south and east of Atlanta \u2014 areas with no shortage of rent-to-own stores. I was lucky, though, to hear this simple advice from my dad from an early age: Spend cash, not credit.This is what he taught on our Saturday-morning shopping trips. Whether we were on the way to buy a new refrigerator or look at a used car, the lesson was the same: \u201cIf you don\u2019t have enough to buy it cash, don\u2019t buy it,\u201d he\u2019d tell us.Mom\u2019s lessons were equally sober. She had a few credit cards but hated them all. Whenever she finally paid one off, she\u2019d call us into her room. There, she asked us to help her demolish the card. We twisted it. We bent it. We folded it until the blue and red plastic turned white along the creases. Then, finally, we\u2019d snip it to pieces. It was a ceremony of sorts. The itinerary concluded in a lecture about the evils of interest and how we were now free from the shackles of another company. By the time I reached the age of 18, my approach to finance was \u201cJust say no.\u201d\u201cNo, I do not want to sign up for a store credit card.\u201d\u201cNo, I do not want to finance a computer over several payments.\u201dNo. No. No.I had internalized the distrust my parents taught me, but it wasn\u2019t until I went to college that I began to better understand where they were coming from.It doesn\u2019t have to be this way. Black neighborhoods can support legitimate stores.In the void, many urban black neighborhoods are left with few alternatives. Online shopping is a good option for some people. But a lack of reliable internet access and the necessity of having a credit or debit card prevent many low-income people from participating in this digital economy. Not everyone lives in a neighborhood where packages and presents can sit safely on a stoop while they are at work.My dad\u2019s advice was simple \u2014 spend cash, not credit.

{"Headline": "It\u2019s a Great Age for Jazz, but Don\u2019t Call It Golden", "Date": "2018-12-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLeave open the possibility that the music can get even better rather than locking it in a gilded frame. Mr. Chinen, a former jazz critic for The Times, is the author of \u201cPlaying Changes: Jazz for the New Century.\u201dMs. Spalding is exceptional in every sense of the word, but she\u2019s also part of a cresting wave. The music we call jazz has been undergoing an explosion of creative possibilities, carried out by musicians with an impressive range of new skills and ideas. Some of them have found traction with impassioned young audiences, achieving a rare balance of popular success and critical approval \u2014 enough, in some corners, to bring talk of jazz\u2019s new golden age.I just wrote a book about jazz in the new century, so I might be waving that banner, too. The music\u2019s plurality of style, embodied by Ms. Spalding and so many others, amounts to an extension of the jazz tradition rather than any kind of heretical crisis. The music is meant to evolve, and we\u2019re in the midst of its most wildly adaptive, thrillingly unruly evolutionary phase in some 40 years.So why do I balk whenever someone declares that jazz has entered another golden age? On some level it\u2019s reflex: a resistance to hyperbole, and an awareness that whatever my convictions, we don\u2019t have enough distance to see our moment with total clarity. On some level, too, it\u2019s wariness about any exercise that weighs one era against another, brushing aside the broader context. But I have even more fundamental reservations. To declare a golden age is to freeze a moment in time, locking a gilded frame around its edges. It ends up crowning some figures and crowding out others, distorting a reality that\u2019s far richer and messier in practice.His pronouncement is familiar and humbling \u2014 and hard to argue with, in historical terms. I\u2019m in my early 40s, and like many jazz fans of my generation I spent a substantial portion of my early listening experience fighting the feeling that I\u2019d missed out on all the good stuff. The music industry fed this perception with a steady outpouring of classic albums reissued on CD. And the jazz media seemed to present every emerging young face as a jazz-historical avatar: a new Miles, a new Ella, a new Billie.I called Ravi a few days after the show, to hear his impressions. \u201cI felt a lot of pride, really,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s something very enduring about this music. I spent a lot of time watching my mother drag her harp onstage, playing in very similar environments, with a spiritual vibe moving through the room. It felt like a beautiful affirmation of what a lot of artists from that period did.\u201dStill, Ravi chuckled when I brought up the notion of a new golden age. \u201cThere will always be great players,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes the wave goes up, and we have what seems like an insurgency of new talent.\u201d This is a great time for jazz, but it\u2019s important to leave open the possibility that it can get even better.It\u2019s tempting to see those landmarks as a fulfillment of certain grand pronouncements. But the musicians weren\u2019t setting out to justify the rhetoric of a golden age. Then as now, they were just pursuing their interests, filtering out distractions, doing the work. Their focus was pointed firmly on the road ahead.Nate Chinen, the director of editorial content at WBGO and a former jazz critic for The Times, is the author of \u201cPlaying Changes: Jazz For the New Century.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Ms. Fowler is an editor in the Opinion section.If you thought 2018 was a bad year for tech, 2019 might turn out to be even worse. This year was filled with revelations about privacy, security and cyberwarfare. Next year, the consequences of those revelations will unfold. And we should be very worried about what the future holds. Privacy Is DeadAnd perhaps worse is what the future holds. We most likely aren\u2019t aware of all the companies that hold our personal data and what they are doing with it: the social media companies that know us as well as our friends do, the financial technology companies that sell our bank account transaction data, the messaging apps that hold our private photos and texts.Many of us will delete apps. We will disable as much tracking as we can on our phones. We will delete our Facebook accounts. We will delete our social media histories and old emails and text messages. But it won\u2019t be enough because most people will not care: The trade-off between privacy and convenience will be worth it to them, because the loss of their privacy will have little to no impact on their day-to-day life. Most people will read (or perhaps ignore) the news stories about every new privacy scandal, and they will then go back to their phones.

{"Headline": "Technology Has Destroyed Reality", "Date": "2018-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTurning PointsThe scene was the result of a technical glitch \u2014 a system crash. But it also served as an image of automation run amok, of decades of breaking news finally resulting in broken news.The message still resonates: In this new age of artificial stupidity, technological disruption has turned destructive. Its greatest victim is reality itself.It is a far cry from an earlier period of digital expansion, when internet communication was seen to promote global exchange and understanding. The time when the word \u201cglobal\u201d was likely to attach to the word \u201cdigital\u201d is most definitely over. The new elites in many Western countries are no longer cosmopolitan and globalist, but rather isolationist and identitarian. Before, technology was supposed to connect and mediate. The online world seemed like a Disney vision of multiculturalism, promoting sterile tolerance from above. Now technology divides and fragments; it identifies and ranks people.This rise of artificial stupidity is the antithesis of, or rather the millions of shabby little cousins to, artificial intelligence. Just as socialism in practice has been a far cry from the glorious promises of revolutionaries, artificial stupidity is a mediocre and greedy version of the sublime machine intelligence intended to elevate and improve human life.All sorts of minor communication applications are artificial stupidities. And though they may not seem impressive, their real-world effects are baffling: the destruction of public discourse and the polarization of populations; wages and hours managed by algorithms; customer service, clerical, counseling or legal work eliminated by virtual assistants or chatbots.Even simple things, such as buying a ticket for a plane, train or concert, have become arduous and frustrating chores in an era of targeted, opaque pricing. Instead of a common reality and a set of rules that apply to everyone, we have frustration, dysfunction and a waste of precious time and energy.And automation is not alone in chipping away at modern society. The few platforms that effectively own the digital communication sphere today operate without serious checks and balances, or even basic competition in an open market. Their algorithms are proprietary and unknown. There are few alternatives, if any, for consumers.The result is an endless cycle of broken news and quarter-truths, stretched and repurposed ad nauseam, because in the age of artificial stupidity, truth is traded for popularity and reach.This is our real, existing digital world: nothing more than hourly waves of feverish and toxic agitation, played out over stale mainstream channels that discourage innovation and experimentation, drown in excruciating advertisements and drain people\u2019s attention and souls.An unpopular truth cannot survive online in such a world, because traction is privileged over veracity. And to artificially stupid automatons and algorithms, reality is defined as brute quantity, by ranking, ratings and elimination.The truth doesn\u2019t fit into that mold.The truth is a piece of work with unruly and messy details that nevertheless require attention and never fully add up. It is usually much too complicated to be entertaining, and it may not be to everyone\u2019s liking at all. It may not make things easier or more efficient \u2014 quite the opposite, in fact. If truth is not a marketable item, like clean environments or livable neighborhoods, the platforms that manage digital communication seem to show little interest in maintaining it, letting broken news propagate.Facts, on the other hand, are often quite unspectacular. They will not improve, and may even deteriorate, if they are \u201cliked\u201d or shared. And both facts and the truth rely on strong institutions, not consumers, to defend them: judiciaries, scientific communities, an independent press. It is no coincidence that all those institutions are being undermined in many countries around the world \u2014 see the rioters in Chemnitz fuming at the \u201clying press,\u201d the defunding of scientific research throughout the Western world or attempts at the partisan realignment of judicial institutions, such as Poland\u2019s Supreme Court.There are many short-term solutions to help prevent the further onslaught of broken news. Challenging or regulating monopoly platforms is one of them. Making their algorithms transparent and open to public assessment, legislation and debate is another. We can ban bots and anonymous accounts from social media, and strengthen institutions with durable and tested rules to establish and confirm facts.But we cannot have our factuality cake and eat it too. Truth will rarely be popular or profitable. To expect its popularity to correspond to its veracity is not even artificially stupid, but just stupid.Hito Steyerl is a German artist, filmmaker and writer whose work examines media, technology and the distribution of images.

{"Headline": "The End of Europe?", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrance is pivotal in holding the European Union together.Opinion ColumnistPARIS \u2014 Ever since World War II, the liberal global order that has spread more freedom and prosperity around the world than at any other time in history has been held up by two pillars: the United States of America and the United Nations of Europe, now known as the European Union. Both of these centers of free markets, free people and free ideas are being shaken today by rural and beyond-the-suburbs insurgencies of largely white working-poor and anxious middle classes, which have not generally benefited from the surges in globalization, immigration and technology that have lifted superstar cities like London, Paris and San Francisco and their multicultural populations.Having just seen the shocking sight of Parisian stores boarded up right before Christmas to protect against rioting along the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es by some of France\u2019s yellow-vested protesters; after being told in Rome a few days earlier that Italy, a founding member of the E.U., could conceivably shuck off both the E.U. and the euro one day under its new bizarre far-left/far-right governing coalition; after watching Britain become paralyzed over how to commit economic suicide by leaving the E.U.; and after watching President Trump actually cheer for the breakup of the E.U. rather than for its good health, it is obvious to me that we\u2019re at a critical hinge of history. The core challenge for both the U.S. and the E.U. is the same: These rapid accelerations in technology and globalization have brought many more immigrants into many more remote corners of their societies \u2014 public housing in Paris today is dominated by immigrants \u2014 at the same time as many long-frozen social mores have changed \u2014 like acceptance of gay marriage and transgender rights \u2014 and as average work no longer returns an average wage that can sustain an average middle-class lifestyle.The middle classes that powered the growth of the U.S. and the E.U. in the 20th century were built on something called a \u201chigh-wage, middle-skilled job.\u201d But robotics and artificial intelligence and outsourcing and Chinese imports have wiped out a lot of middle-skilled routine white-collar and blue-collar work. Now there are high-wage, high-skilled jobs and low-wage, low-skilled jobs. But high-wage, middle-skilled jobs are vanishing, leaving a considerable cohort of people with stagnant incomes and burning resentments at the globalized city slickers who they think look down at them and have mastered the nonroutine skills required for a high-wage job today.When you simultaneously challenge all these things that anchor people \u2014 their sense of home, their job security, their prospects for growth and the social norms that, for better or worse, defined their lives \u2014 and then amp it all up with social networks, you can get a really ferocious blowback, as France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, saw across his country.There was Bruno Binelli, 66, a retired carpenter from Lyon, reacting to Macron\u2019s raising the taxes on diesel to combat climate change, leading to fuel costs that hit people in the countryside particularly hard because they have only cars to get around: \u201cI have a little diesel van and I don\u2019t have the money to buy a new one, especially as I\u2019m about to retire. We have the feeling those from the countryside are forgotten.\u201dAnd there was Marie Lemoine, 62, a schoolteacher from Provins, who said she was neither \u201cright or left,\u201d explaining: \u201c I\u2019m here for my children and grandchildren and all those people left crying by the 15th of the month because they\u2019ve gone into the red. \u2026 Macron is our Louis XVI, and we know what happened to him. He ended up at the guillotine.\u201dIt is going to take extraordinary leadership for the U.S., Britain and the E.U. to come up with a strategy for these grievances.And to now watch the Conservative Party hacks who pushed that lie, led by Boris Johnson, continue to demand that their prime minister deliver this fantasy Brexit in the face of the reality that it\u2019s impossible \u2014 and in the face of how bad even the second-best option will be \u2014 is to watch a once-sane country write a suicide note in a moment of irrationality and then argue endlessly over how to carry it out \u2014 death by hanging, poison or a gunshot to the head. They\u2019ve got to reconsider. Disconnecting in a connected world is nuts.Macron, by contrast, dared to do the right things to unlock growth in France, at the right time, \u201cbut he did not understand the difference between being right and doing it right,\u201d a French economist, Ludovic Subran, told me. And he did not understand how his policies differently affected \u201cthe beer drinkers and the wine drinkers.\u201dMacron set up a totally imperial presidency, built around a tiny team \u2014 \u201cthey were like a commando unit,\u201d Le Monde writer Alain Frachon remarked to me.Macron pushed through four vital structural fixes that fostered growth: pro-investment tax reforms, reduced pensions for the bloated railway union, relaxed labor rules to make it easier to fire and hire workers, and big new public investments in skills and education for the most disadvantaged.But because Macron\u2019s party didn\u2019t exist until he ran for president, it had no mayors to connect locally with the people and feel their pulse. So Macron was stunned when his royalist, let-them-eat cake, top-down approach produced a vicious backlash after he cut taxes for the wealthy and corporations and sought to pay for some of it with taxes on diesel fuel and pensions \u2014 without exempting the rural working classes, which have no mass transit and need to drive everywhere. Feeling humiliated, they donned their yellow vests, drove into the heart of Paris and other cities and lashed out: \u201cCan you hear us now?\u201dMacron \u201cthought he was governing Singapore, not France \u2014 a revolutionary country,\u201d added Frachon. \u201cHe made every political mistake. He did not miss one.\u201dTo save his presidency, a shellshocked Macron busted his budget and canceled the fuel tax hike, raised the minimum wage by 100 euros ($114) a month and scrapped a planned tax on pensions under 2,000 euro ($2,272) per month. But because the Yellow Vests have no leader, no one knows what happens next.\u201cFrance today has a leader with no followers and an opposition with no leader,\u201d said U.S. foreign policy expert Michael Mandelbaum.And the reason that matters is France and Germany were always the two adults whose partnership and adherence to the E.U. budgets and standards were the cement that held the whole E.U. pillar together.Here is what\u2019s really scary, though. I don\u2019t think there are national solutions to this problem \u2014 simply cut taxes or raise taxes \u2014 in the way there were in the past. I think the countries that will thrive in this era are the ones that have the most nimble cities, with the most nimble local leaders, who build adaptive coalitions of businesses, educators and social entrepreneurs, who can compete locally, regionally, nationally and globally. In this world, highly centralized countries will fare much worse than decentralized ones. That\u2019s the real shift France has to make, and, if it can\u2019t, watch out for falling pillars. France matters.Dominique Mo\u00efsi, one of France\u2019s top foreign policy analysts, put it to me like this: At a time when America, which was always the European Union\u2019s life insurance policy against predatory threats from the East and was the world champion of democracy, begins to withdraw from the world; when Russia returns with a vengeance to global politics; when Germany turns inward and Italy rebels against E.U. spending limits and moves closer to autocratic Russia; when so many roads now lead to Beijing; and when the U.K. is hellbent on suicide, \u201csuddenly what happens in France goes beyond France. We are the last barrier protecting the European idea. If Macron fails, it can bring the end of Europe.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "France\u2019s Combustible Climate Politics", "Date": "2018-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byClimate policy should be about solving problems, not salving consciences.Opinion ColumnistEmmanuel Macron\u2019s government was forced this week to suspend a planned 6.5-cent-per-liter tax increase on diesel and 2.9 cents on gasoline \u2014 collected for the purpose of speeding France\u2019s transition to renewables \u2014 after weeks of protests and violent rioting throughout the country. French consumers already pay more than $6 for a gallon of gas, compared to a current national average of $2.44 in the U.S. So much, also, for the fantasy that our main climate challenge is that nobody in power has the spine to do something about it. The real problem is that so far most of those somethings haven\u2019t worked, or won\u2019t work, or won\u2019t work anytime soon, or come at too exorbitant a price.Before accusing the so-called do-nothings of being good-for-nothings, shouldn\u2019t the self-declared do-somethings first propose something serious to do?Consider the list of somethings.This is not a climate-change policy. It\u2019s a politics of gestures, destined to achieve the opposite of what it intends \u2014 at the expense of the people who can least afford it. None of this is to say that the world should give up. Beyond nuclear power, we need to be placing medium-sized bets on potentially transformative technologies not funded by regressive taxes or industrial subsidies, and not dependent on future breakthroughs that might still be decades off, if they happen at all. Let thousands of climate-startups bloom \u2014 and let markets, not governments, figure out which ones work.But a long history of climate policy failures might also cause climate activists and the politicians they support to be more humble about their convictions, more sensitive to the human effects of their policy, and more willing to listen to criticism. To have a diagnosis is not to have a cure, and bad cures can be worse than the disease. Those who think otherwise are also living in denial.Advertisement"}

In fact, the coloring results from exposed blood vessels.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to eye color in humans with albinism.

{"Headline": "The 12 Best Book Covers of 2018", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe year 2018 was only four days and 90 push alerts young when I abandoned all prior delusions that it could be a quieter, more nationally introspective sun cycle than 2017 had been. Subtlety and nuance might be in fashion again in some distant future, but probably not this year. Confrontation would remain the default setting.To the (trivial) extent that book covers ought to reflect the spirit of the age, this year demanded that they be confrontational if not out-and-out blunt, topically and conceptually. Stylistic subversion was for the most part off the menu. A book about jazz standards would not be confused, visually, with a book about failing democracies. A memoir would, perhaps rightfully, look precisely like an internal odyssey. A romance between a woman and a fish would be unambiguous. Several of the covers that stood out to me featured inventive variations on the human face, as if the whole of publishing altogether sought to remind anyone shopping for books that humans who are not famous still do, in fact, exist \u2014 and that they matter. It\u2019s an idea that seemed to be gaining the tiniest bit of traction at the end of this year.

But they believe it to be much deeper.Its other distinguishing feature is a gushing river formed by melting glaciers above. It exits the cave about 1.3 miles away through another opening, called a resurgence.Mr. Pollack took hundreds of photographs from various heights in the helicopter and stitched them together to create the 3D rendering above.\u201cCaves are hard to measure because they\u2019re so irregular,\u201d said Mr. Pollack, who has been surveying them since the late 1960s.\u201cThere\u2019s an art to it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re not just collecting data; you\u2019re filling in the blanks.\u201dMr. Hollis was the person on the September expedition who descended into the cave. He carried about 50 pounds of gear, including a hulking battery-powered hammer drill to set bolts into the rock and about 500 feet of rope.\u201cIn my 30-plus years of caving, this is by far the biggest pit that I\u2019ve had the privilege to descend,\u201d he said.According to Dr. Hickson, the cave is most likely tens of thousands of years old, and the rocks are hundreds of millions of years old.They\u2019re what\u2019s known as \u201cstripe karst,\u201d which means layers of marble, schist and quartzite that, over millenniums of pressure and heat, have fused together to form a stripelike pattern.Mr. Hollis descended about 280 feet into the maw of the cave as the cascade roared. Because the cave is in a shaded area, the bottom of the pit was full of last winter\u2019s snow, creating a misty haze.The September expedition took about 10 hours. The team is planning to make at least two more forays between now and 2020.\u201cAs a geologist, there aren\u2019t necessarily a lot of things we do that excite people,\u201d said Dr. Hickson.But there is a mystery here, she said. \u201cCaving is all about the exploration of the unknown.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Person of Interest\u2019 Arrested in Suspected Road-Rage Killing of New York Firefighter", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFaizal Coto fought fires for a living, and rapped and composed lyrics as a hip-hop artist in his spare time. But his life came to a brutal end on the shoulder of the Belt Parkway early Sunday morning, in what police believe was a road rage incident that turned deadly.Police said on Tuesday that they had tracked a silver Infiniti that sped away from the scene of Mr. Coto\u2019s killing to a motel in New Jersey, where they arrested Joseph C. Desmond, 29, on a parole violation.Mr. Desmond, who was being questioned by the police about Mr. Coto\u2019s death, had been released from prison in April after serving four years in New York for drug possession and an unrelated assault, prison records show.The killer left Mr. Coto, 33, near the road, bludgeoned and bleeding from the head, the police said. By the time emergency services found him, it was too late. Mr. Coto was pronounced dead at Coney Island Hospital shortly afterward.\u201cHe was just a beautiful brother I\u2019m going to miss forever,\u201d his older brother, Ishmael Coto, said Tuesday. \u201cBest guy you could ever know.\u201dOn Saturday night, he was out with friends in the Bay Ridge area of Brooklyn, where he lived. At about midnight, he posted a screen shot of himself hoisting a beer at a neighborhood bar called Skin Flints. Nearly five hours later, he was driving onto the eastbound Belt Parkway, when his vehicle collided with a silver or gray Infiniti G35 as both cars merged onto the highway, police said.At 4:47 a.m., the two cars pulled over to the side of the parkway near Exit 4, at 14th Avenue and Bay 8th Street. For reasons that remain unclear, the other driver then appears to have viciously attacked Mr. Coto, possibly with a baseball bat, the police said.Shortly afterward, the Infiniti was spotted by security cameras fleeing east on the Belt Parkway. Emergency responders found Mr. Coto on the ground, next to his vehicle, with severe trauma to his head, police said.His Facebook page on Tuesday was filled with remembrances about his buoyant spirit.\u201cHe was proper, decent and lovely, friend with all and a dream maker,\u201d wrote Louis Rigaud Bois, who said later in an interview that the two had met at Coney Island Hospital when Mr. Coto worked as a clerk there, before becoming a firefighter three years ago. \u201cNot a hint of malice, always smiling.\u201dLaw enforcement officials said on Tuesday that New York detectives and United States Marshals had used license-plate readers to track the silver Infiniti to the Circle Motor Lodge in South Amboy, N.J., where they arrested Mr. Desmond at about 11 p.m. on Monday.He was being held Tuesday evening at the Middlesex County jail in New Brunswick, N.J.In 2014, Mr. Desmond pleaded guilty to a second-degree assault classified as a hate crime, and was sentenced to one year in jail. According to the criminal complaint filed with the Queens district attorney, in 2012, Mr. Desmond approached a man on the street in Ridgewood, Queens, near where he lived at the time. He called the man a homosexual slur, then shocked him with an electric stun gun.In 2013, before he was imprisoned on that charge, Mr. Desmond was arrested in Staten Island and pleaded guilty to drug possession. He was sentenced to serve four years in prison and five years probation, the Staten Island Advance reported. Corrections records show Mr. Desmond entered prison in 2014 was released on parole in April.\u201cHe was a great guy, everyone around him enjoyed his spirit and how happy he was all the time,\u201d said Albert Bravo, a firefighter who met Mr. Coto during their time at the Fire Academy, in an interview. \u201cHe was a talented music artist, also.

{"Headline": "What\u2019s That Smell?", "Date": "2018-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.A decade ago Marie and Surinder Uppal fulfilled what they considered their American dream: the construction of a two-story home next to vineyards in Sonoma County.But earlier this year, besieged by a mysterious, pungent odor, they wondered if they had made the right decision.\u201cWe said, \u2018What the heck is that smell?\u2019\u201d Ms. Uppal said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t figure out what it was. The stench was very bad, stronger than a skunk.\u201dThe Uppals are among hundreds of people across California who have showed up at town hall meetings, petitioned city councils and hired lawyers to fight an unanticipated consequence of marijuana legalization: the stink from pot farms across the state.Those affected by the smell say it is much more potent than the pot cloud above a Grateful Dead concert or the medicinal smell of a cannabis dispensary.In the case of the Uppal family, the cannabis was being grown in greenhouses nestled in the vineyard several hundred feet away. One member of the Uppal family with muscular dystrophy, Jiwan, had trouble breathing and was admitted to the intensive care unit of a hospital.\u201cThe smell was so bad we couldn\u2019t even go outside,\u201d Ms. Uppal said.The smell stretched to the nearby Old Adobe Elementary Charter School, where children playing outside asked what the odor was, according to the school\u2019s principal, Jeff Williamson.\u201cSome parents were really upset about it,\u201d Mr. Williamson said.With three other families in the neighborhood, the Uppals sued the pot grower, Carlos Zambrano, who was found to be operating without a license, according to the Uppals\u2019 lawyer, Kevin Block.The Uppals and their neighbors sued in federal court under the RICO Act \u2014 the decades-old law designed to prosecute organized crime \u2014 to stop the cannabis operation and recover $60,000 they paid in legal fees so far. The court will hear a motion to dismiss the case on Thursday.Under a settlement agreement with the county, the grower was ordered to pay more than $400,000 in fines and back taxes. But the settlement came with a twist that puzzled the Uppals: He was allowed to harvest and sell his crop in part so that he could pay the fines.\u201cI told my husband, \u2018We are in the wrong business,\u2019\u201d Ms. Uppal said.(A note: We often link to content on sites that limit access for nonsubscribers. We appreciate you reading Times stories, but we\u2019d also encourage you to support local news if you can.)Initially, there was supposed to be a system of electric pods that could move 16 people at a time. Instead, a Tesla was lowered into the tunnel. The company said vehicles would be able to move up to 150 miles per hour, but the test was much slower.Still, Mr. Musk was upbeat.\u201cWhat we believe we have here is a real solution to the traffic problem we have on earth,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s much more like an underground highway.\u201dCalifornia Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "In Ethiopia, Visual Storytelling From a Deeper Perspective", "Date": "2018-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bylensAddis Foto Fest, founded by photographer Aida Muluneh, aims to give photographers from Africa a platform to capture the cultural complexities and diverse histories of the countries they call home. Aida Muluneh was a middle school student in Canada when local newspapers and magazines started running dramatic images of starving children in Ethiopia. The photos struck her as odd.She was born in Ethiopia, and the pictures were nothing like the memories she had of the country she left when she was 5. They also didn\u2019t match the stories her mother told her of life there.\u201cThis is not to say the famine didn\u2019t happen, but there are so many different stories in Ethiopia \u2014 it\u2019s not just the story of famine or the priest with the cross,\u201d Ms. Muluneh said. \u201cThere\u2019s so many things that have yet to be documented.\u201dThe memories of these photos didn\u2019t just stay with Ms. Muluneh, they motivated her to become a photographer as well. She returned to Ethiopia in 2007, intent on teaching and establishing a photography community.\u201cWe need to be more engaged,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause we need to be telling stories from our own perspective because obviously someone based in the country will provide deeper insight than someone flying in for a week.\u201dLocal photographers come to the festival and discover that photography can be a viable profession and that they \u201ccan have a voice through images,\u201d Ms. Muluneh said. During portfolio reviews, they get advice on how to be competitive in the international market, while visiting editors and curators are able to find new talent.\u201cI could have chosen to only do a festival for Africans only,\u201d Ms. Muluneh said. \u201cBut I felt that we live in a global world, and we have to be engaged in a global way. The whole point is we shouldn\u2019t be the best in Ethiopia or the best in Africa. We have to be the best in the world.\u201dMs. Muluneh was born in Addis Ababa, but moved around growing up, from Yemen to England to Cyprus, and finally, to Canada, as her mother searched for better opportunities for her children. She graduated from Howard University in Washington, D.C. with a degree in film and started photographing for The Washington Post on a freelance basis.Eleven years later, she is still there.\u201cIt was the first time I felt a sense of home,\u201d she explained.Ms. Muluneh offered workshops at a university there, but soon realized that in order to create a vibrant photo community and a viable photo industry in Ethiopia, she needed not only to teach photographers, but also to show \u201csociety that photography is more than just studio or wedding photography.\u201dInspired by her experiences at the Bamako festival, Ms. Muluneh launched the Addis festival in 2010 to \u201cchange the whole conversation about photography in Ethiopia and to educate the masses around visual language.\u201d It hasn\u2019t exactly been easy, she said, but the festival has grown in size and prominence \u2014 and Ethiopia\u2019s community of photographers has expanded.Although her current work is firmly in the sphere of art, Ms. Muluneh believes that photojournalism remains the foundation for visual storytelling. She is now looking to develop and expand opportunities for African photographers.\u201cThere are a lot of photographers who come to the continent and take photos and go back to publish their books, make their exhibitions and make their money,\u201d Ms. Muluneh said. \u201cPhotography is a $9 billion business. My question is: How much of that do we have access to in Africa?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Under Trump, the Swamp Is Draining", "Date": "2018-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA grifter president has inspired an elite housecleaning.Opinion ColumnistIt isn\u2019t just that he\u2019s already implicated in actions (for instance, paying off a porn-star mistress in possible violation of campaign-finance laws) that a hostile Congress might reasonably cite as a reason for impeachment. It\u2019s that the whole Trump operation, now lying exposed on Mueller\u2019s table \u2014 the shady business empire, the constant practice of deceit, the dim-bulb hangers-on \u2014 screams corruption in a way that few politicians\u2019 circles do. With Trump there is no pretense of respectability or rectitude. There is only the open, shrugging grift.That hasn\u2019t worked out; it turns out that when you send a businessman-grifter into the world of political grifters he hires some of the worst of them to help him with the fleecing.But there is one odd way in which Trump\u2019s supporters have gotten what they wanted. Trump isn\u2019t draining the swamp himself, but the shock of his ascent has created swamp-draining conditions \u2014 in which other corruptions have suddenly been exposed, and there have been many deserved falls from grace.Some of these scandals might have come out under any president, and Clinton was overdue for a feminist reassessment. But Trump has clearly been a catalyst: The sense of moral crisis created by his ascent, the sense of moral outrage felt by women, especially, and the finger-pointing within a divided, freaked-out establishment has made it easier to acknowledge rot in meritocracy, and to purge the grossest examples from our entitled class.In fact our elite is rotten and deserves judgment, yet Trump\u2019s mix of kleptocracy and kakistocracy is worse. So the question of how you replace a bad elite with a better one, not just with something more corrupt, is what both left and right should be pondering while this particular purgation runs its course.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Piano Makes a Terrible Coffee Table", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRight at HomeBut beloved objects bring life to our homes, which is why we sometimes get irrationally attached to certain things, even when it makes no sense to keep them. My baby grand piano has been in my house longer than I\u2019ve been alive. When my husband and I bought our first home on New Year\u2019s Eve six years ago, it was sitting roughly in the same place it is now: at the front of the living room.The piano, made by Kranich and Bach, a now-defunct New York City company once popular for its diminutive line of grand pianos known as \u201cGrandettes,\u201d belonged to the previous owners of this house \u2014 a family, with three sons, that had lived here for half a century. The wife played it every day until her death, her husband told me. It had been her piano since childhood and it came with her when they got married. When I spoke with the husband, he was probably in his 90s, living in Florida, and had no more use for it. His sons, long grown, I assume had declined the opportunity to take it.But I was smitten, moved by the legacy of this storied instrument and its place in the home where we would raise our children. When we saw the house, it was the only piece of furniture remaining. It looked so elegant standing there alone, and with nothing else in the room, didn\u2019t seem that large to me. How could I toss something out that had been here for so many decades?My husband, who actually plays musical instruments, unlike me, knew exactly how to turn it down. \u201cIt\u2019s too big for the room,\u201d he said.But where my husband saw a hulking obstruction, I saw only romance. I imagined our children, a toddler and a kindergartner at the time, learning to play. I imagined a house full of music, with someone (not me, but someone) playing Christmas carols at the holidays.And so, since I can be very persuasive, we kept it.On moving day, two cranky workers dumped our blue sofa opposite the piano, in the only place where it would fit. I sat on my sofa and stared at the sturdy legs of what suddenly seemed like a shockingly tall object. We had no space left for a coffee table. Only room for two end tables, an accent chair and our television. My husband, of course, was right. It didn\u2019t fit.In the years that followed, I learned four truths about baby grand pianos.1. \u201cBaby\u201d is a peculiar word choice for an object that measures nearly five feet long, five feet across at its widest, and stands over three feet tall.2. Baby grands are a natural source of conversation among guests, who invariably will tell you to never part with yours. (This is particularly true of people who do not actually own baby grand pianos.)3. Baby grand pianos make terrible coffee tables.4. Baby grands make the most beautiful sound you can imagine, and when your son learns to play your wedding song on yours, you forget all your gripes and stop everything to listen.Soon after we settled in, I learned a practical reason a family might part with a piano: because it\u2019s worthless.Kranich and Bach, it turned out, made finicky instruments that are difficult to maintain, despite their rich sound. And ours needed work. We spent about $400 repairing it, an investment the tuner said would buy us about five years of life on an instrument that, he said, was decent enough for a student.We soon found a teacher, a young Australian pianist whose enthusiasm inspired my son to practice and play. He was hooked. Our house hummed with the clunky, awkward sounds of learning.And he kept playing, switching teachers along the way, to a Georgian woman with a heavy Eastern European accent who has brought the hearty Russian composers into our home. Other instruments followed. A violin for our son. A guitar for our daughter. See! I was right. Plunk an instrument in the middle of the room and someone will pick it up.But as the years ticked on, more keys broke. More repairs were required. Children grow, but rooms do not. And the tight space in the living room felt only tighter. The better my son got, the more he could hear the piano straining under his nimble fingers. What was once the object of his unwavering devotion became a source of frustration, as a pedal would break and keys would stick. We paid for more repairs, only for more keys to fail.My husband and I began to imagine another life for our living room, one with enough furniture \u2014 and a coffee table! \u2014 to entertain. Perhaps, I suggested to my son, we could let the piano go and invest in something of a more manageable size. A console or studio piano \u2014 what I had always thought of as an upright piano, for example, could sit against the wall, leaving room for other furniture. Eventually, he too saw that maybe it was time to move on. \u201cI want room to run around,\u201d he said finally.But objects in a home \u2014 even unlikely ones you might have inherited \u2014 are what give a home life, which is why you can become irrationally attached to items even when it no longer makes sense to keep them. Pianos, in particular, can manage to find allies in friends and family who inexplicably rise to their defense. Tell someone you want to part with a piano and you might as well have told them you were planning to toss a diamond in the trash.Even potential buyers seemed alarmed by our decision. In early December, we posted the piano on Facebook Marketplace, offering it for free to anyone who would pay the cost of moving it. One person responded to the ad, saying simply, \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious. Free?\u201dThe first person to come look at it, a young jazz musician, told me I should keep it. I told him we needed space. He said his living room was even smaller than ours, and then, perhaps realizing the scale of his decision, didn\u2019t take it.I wondered if we were making a mistake, and felt guilty abandoning the piano to a stranger who couldn\u2019t possibly appreciate its value the way I did. I took the listing down, pulled out the tape measure and set to work, searching for a way to make the piano fit better. My husband, willing to appease me one last time, patiently helped me try every possible arrangement. But no configuration made sense.In a small home, rooms often have to serve more than one use. Our piano, I realized, was preventing us from using a central room in all the ways that we needed to use it.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t give away a beautiful instrument if it belonged here,\u201d my husband said. \u201cBut this one doesn\u2019t.\u201dThe next afternoon, he and I went to a furniture store and ordered a new sofa, armchairs and a coffee table (finally!). We will buy a used console or studio piano next.Luckily for our Grandette, the items are back-ordered and will not arrive until early February, giving it a six-week reprieve. By then, we will have found it a new home, ideally some place where another student can eke more life out of it. Hopefully, our piano will forgive us.Advertisement"}

But critics also focused on statements that Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, had made in recent months while defending the company.Senator John Kennedy, the Louisiana Republican, said the revelations made him question Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s decision making. \u201cI know he\u2019s smart, but sometimes I think he\u2019s got no sense,\u201d Mr. Kennedy told Fox News, adding that the disclosures were cause to consider stricter privacy laws. \u201cCongress is going to have to regulate them and stop this, and I hate to do it, but by God I will if they can\u2019t clean up their act.\u201dFacebook officials said the deals did not violate user privacy \u2014 or a 2011 consent agreement with the Federal Trade Commission that barred it from sharing data without permission \u2014 because the companies were acting on Facebook\u2019s behalf.In a post published on Facebook on Tuesday, Konstantinos Papamiltiadis, the company\u2019s director of developer platforms and programs, defended the partnerships, saying the company entered into the agreements to let users interact with Facebook friends across devices and popular websites.\u201cNone of these partnerships or features gave companies access to information without people\u2019s permission,\u201d Mr. Papamiltiadis wrote, asserting that most partners did not have to seek consent before obtaining users\u2019 data because they were serving as extensions of Facebook.But he also acknowledged that Facebook had made mistakes in managing some of the deals. \u201cWe recognize that we\u2019ve needed tighter management over how partners and developers can access information,\u201d he wrote.Facebook was already dealing with fallout from reports that a political consulting company, Cambridge Analytica, obtained the personal data of tens of millions of Facebook users. Cambridge used the information to build tools later deployed in President Trump\u2019s election campaign. The F.T.C. launched an inquiry into Facebook\u2019s practices after the data leak became public, and the Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission are also investigating the social network.News of the deals on Wednesday further roiled the technology industry as policymakers and privacy advocates directed anger at Facebook\u2019s leaders and its partners.Senator Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat, attacked Mr. Zuckerberg for not disclosing the full scope of the agreements during a Senate hearing in the spring, when Mr. Zuckerberg assured officials that users had complete control of their data.\u201cMark Zuckerberg had a lot of chutzpah telling Congress that Americans could control their data, when seemingly every other week Facebook faces a new privacy scandal for abusing our personal information,\u201d Mr. Wyden said.Senator Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut Democrat, called for the F.T.C. to police the company more aggressively. \u201cFacebook\u2019s seemingly unrestrained sharing of user data is the privacy equivalent of the BP oil spill,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal wrote on Twitter. \u201cOngoing, uncontained & toxic. We will be paying the price for decades.\u201dDamian Collins, a British lawmaker whose parliamentary committee is investigating online disinformation, said Facebook officials should answer for why they had not been more forthcoming. \u201cI feel that we have been given misleading responses by the company when we have asked these questions during previous evidence sessions.\u201dAnd Barbara Underwood, the New York attorney general, said her office would examine the deals as part of a continuing investigation into Facebook. \u201cThe news that Facebook struck data-sharing partnerships with other corporations reflects the many unanswered questions to which New Yorkers deserve clear answers,\u201d said Amy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for Ms. Underwood\u2019s office.Facebook has sought to contain the damage in part by winding down many of its data-sharing partnerships. Facebook said on Wednesday that it had brought more than 60 of its agreements to a close.But deals with two giants of the technology world \u2014 Amazon and Apple \u2014 remain in place. Facebook officials said the deals must continue because of contracts the social network signed with the companies.Records obtained by The Times showed that the social network granted Apple devices broad access to people\u2019s personal data, even when users had disabled sharing. Facebook gave Amazon access users\u2019 email addresses without permission, among other things, the records revealed.An Amazon spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. An Apple spokesman said that the company stopped integrating Facebook into its operating systems earlier this year, but that the access continued to accommodate users of older systems.In addition to those partnerships, Facebook will continue allowing special access for Tobii Technology, a company that makes devices allowing people with neuromuscular diseases to use the social network, a Facebook spokeswoman said.Facebook also had a deal to share the data of users\u2019 friends with Microsoft, and agreements that gave Spotify and Netflix full access to users\u2019 private messages. Users were especially incensed at the Spotify and Netflix deals, which appeared to go far beyond what the companies required for their integrations.Spotify\u2019s Facebook feature, still active, allowed users to share music with friends; Netflix\u2019s integration, discontinued in 2015, let users share movie and TV recommendations. A Netflix spokesman on Wednesday said the company did not view personal messages for any other reason.\u201cThe total lack of respect for user wishes is the infinitely repeating scandal of 2018,\u201d she added.An earlier version of this article misattributed a statement made to Fox News about Facebook. The statement was made by Senator John Kennedy, the Louisiana Republican, not Senator Roy Blunt, the Missouri Republican.Matthew Rosenberg contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Our Cellphones Aren\u2019t Safe", "Date": "2018-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySecurity flaws threaten our privacy and bank accounts. So why aren\u2019t we fixing them?Mr. Quintin is a senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.This should be at the top of our cybersecurity agenda, yet policymakers and industry leaders have been nearly silent on the issue. While government officials are looking the other way, an increasing number of companies are selling products that allow buyers to take advantage of these vulnerabilities. How did we get here, and why is our cellular infrastructure so insecure? The international mobile communications system is built on top of several layers of technology, parts of which are more than 40 years old. Some of these old technologies are insecure, others have never had a proper audit and many simply haven\u2019t received the attention needed to secure them properly. The protocols that form the underpinnings of the mobile system weren\u2019t built with security in mind.Another protocol, GSM, invented in 1991, allows your cellphone to communicate with a cell tower to make and receive calls and transmit data. The older generation of GSM, known as 2G, doesn\u2019t verify that the tower that your phone connects to is authentic, making it easy for anyone to use a cell-site simulator and impersonate a cell tower to obtain your location or eavesdrop on your communications. The lack of action could be because it is a big task \u2014 there are hundreds of companies and international bodies involved in the cellular network. The other reason could be that intelligence and law enforcement agencies have a vested interest in exploiting these same vulnerabilities. But law enforcement has other effective tools that are unavailable to criminals and spies. For example, the police can work directly with phone companies, serving warrants and Title III wiretap orders. In the end, eliminating these vulnerabilities is just as valuable for law enforcement as it is for everyone else.As it stands, there is no government agency that has the power, funding and mission to fix the problems. Large companies such as AT&T, Verizon, Google and Apple have not been public about their efforts, if any exist. This needs to change. To start, companies need to stop supporting insecure technologies such as 2G, and government needs a mandate to buy devices solely from companies that have disabled 2G. Similarly, companies need to work with cybersecurity experts on a security standard for SS7. Government should buy services only from companies that can demonstrate that their networks meet this standard.Finally, this problem can\u2019t be solved by domestic regulation alone. The cellular communications system is international, and it will take an international effort to secure it. We wouldn\u2019t tolerate gaping potholes in our highways or sparking power lines. Securing our mobile infrastructure is just as imperative. Policymakers and industries around the world must work together to achieve this common goal.Cooper Quintin is a senior staff technologist with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, where he investigates digital privacy and security threats to human-rights defenders, journalists and vulnerable populations.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe 52 Places Traveler With two more stops to go, our 52 Places columnist, exhausted after nearly a year on the road, finds beauty and respite in the temples and valleys of this Buddhist kingdom.The valley was unspeakably beautiful: honey-colored hills flanked by mountains covered in pine trees. Dark shrubs dotted the expanse, as did wandering cows, temples and clusters of 108 white Buddhist prayer flags. Relatives of the dead plant the flags \u2014 thin strips of fabric that run the length of tall poles \u2014 during the 49 days it takes to guide and protect the soul as it moves toward the next life.Every time I\u2019d see those flutterings of white, I thought of the effort and devotion that had gone into covering this landscape in so many acts of love.My energy levels were close to empty when I arrived in Bhutan\u2019s Phobjikha Valley, far enough east from the only international airport in this lush, underdeveloped Himalayan kingdom that it had taken many, many hours of driving to get to.The cranes seem to time their arrival and departure to auspicious dates on the Buddhist calendar, according to Phuntso, circling the sky three times above the valley\u2019s 17th-century Gangteng Monastery. There\u2019s video evidence of it at the Crane Information Center run by the Royal Society for Protection of Nature (R.S.P.N.) overlooking the protected wetlands. Every November, the monastery hosts a crane festival featuring dancers dressed as deities of the forest, or imitating the cranes\u2019 bowing, jumping, wing-flapping mating dance known as the thrung thrung karm.To visit Phobjikha is to feel as if you\u2019ve reached some inner sanctum of the earth. We drove there on Bhutan\u2019s single east-west highway, which twists along vertiginous cliffs, cresting passes 10,000 feet high. Wind-bowed trees clung to the mountainside as if by sheer force of will. No guardrails stood between our van and 1,000-foot drops. At times, we\u2019d come across a bite mark of pavement that had tumbled down the slope, a mudslide of toppled trees, and large rocks we had to drive around. Another time, the highway turned to dirt, with a lone mountain biker huffing through the dust.And this was the good road, the national highway.We made a sharp right turn and drove an hour more on a dirt road lined with yaks. You can\u2019t understand what cranes mean to this valley without going to Gangteng Monastery on a hill overlooking the valley floor. Its whitewashed stucco was crumbling, and the lack of other outsiders seemed to allow room for more sacred energy. Monks were in the courtyard practicing choreography for an upcoming festival in which they would dance with masks depicting the wrathful form of Padmasambhava, or the Lotus Born, who is credited with bringing Buddhism to Bhutan in the eighth century. \u201cWatch out for the land mine!\u201d Phuntso joked, as we dodged cow manure on our hike through the forests above the wetlands. The cranes were white dots on the valley floor, black necks bent down as they feasted on dwarf bamboo, their main sustenance. We couldn\u2019t get much closer because of park regulations; the cranes don\u2019t interact well with humans. But all day and all night, their unsteady, high-pitched calls echoed across the valley as if on a loudspeaker.It wasn\u2019t until I\u2019d been there for hours that I realized what was really different about this place: the total lack of above-ground wires. Back in 2008 when the government proposed a plan to bring electricity to the valley, the R.S.P.N. stepped in to pay for solar paneling and convinced the government to do all of the wiring underground, to guard against the cranes running into electric poles.Threats still abound, though, from predators like foxes, leopards and feral dogs. One of them attacked a juvenile crane, rendering his left wing unmovable and keeping him grounded, unable to fly back to Tibet in summer. The R.S.P.N. named him Karma. He has spent the last four years in a protected enclosure at the crane center, and is the only crane you can see up close.More pernicious, of course, are the human threats, particularly from farmers illegally encroaching on the cranes\u2019 habitat to grow more potatoes, the area\u2019s cash crop. The worry is that someday the people are going to want more than sporadic underground electricity. For now the R.S.P.N. is working hard to convince residents that it\u2019s in their interest to keep Phobjikha a place where cranes will come. Schoolchildren help with scientific fieldwork. The government also encourages certain locals to earn income by offering home stays to tourists. I went to one called Aum Passang Zam Farm House for a delicious dinner and a bath in a wooden shed, heated with stones straight from a campfire.But I had come to Punakha not just for penis imagery, but also to visit what Phuntso and my other guide and driver, Kinga Tenzin, said was the best dzong, or fortress in all of Bhutan. It\u2019s a vast complex with both administrative offices and monastic spaces, including temples that tell the story of Buddha\u2019s life. The week I was there, it was hosting the Moenlam Chhenmo (The King of Aspirational Prayers), an annual festival for the faithful in which the Chief Abbott, the top religious officer in Bhutan, recited blessings and prayers for world peace over a loudspeaker.For miles heading to the dzong, the road was lined with pilgrims: men in traditional gho outfits (a knee-length robe tied at the waist, with a colored sash across the chest to show societal rank) and women in their brightest silk jackets and ankle-length wrap skirts called kiras. When we arrived, a field was filled with thousands of devotees, along with tents where they\u2019d sleep for up to two weeks. Some were taking a break to see the country\u2019s longest suspension bridge nearby. They\u2019d traveled days from other parts of Bhutan, and had never seen this part of the country.\u201cYou must have accumulated enough merit in a previous life to be part of the event,\u201d he said. \u201cOr maybe you are already associated with it in your previous life, so now it\u2019s a continuity.\u201d People who\u2019d seen me there, he said, likely thought the same thing, which is why no one seemed to give me a second glance.\u201cWe are Bhutanese-born here and still we did not get the opportunity to see the blessings,\u201d he went on, \u201cand you did.\u201dHad I arrived at Bhutan any earlier in my 52 Places trip, I\u2019m not sure I would have been as grateful as I am now, so close to the end of my journey. I spent so many months stressed out about logistics or finances or work. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because of the exhaustion that set in when I was in China and hasn\u2019t lifted, or the asceticism of living out of a suitcase for a year, but the Buddhists stories my guides told me all seemed to make sense.My trip had begun with a visit to the recently completed giant golden Buddha statue, known as Great Buddha Dordenma, who overlooks Thimphu and is filled with 125,000 smaller Buddhas. There I learned to point with an open hand, and to prostrate myself as I thought of the teachers who have helped to get me to this moment. My last morning, we went to the ancient Jowo Temple of Kyichu in the western city of Paro. Oranges grow in the courtyard, even though the climate prevents them from growing anywhere else in the valley. Circling the grounds clockwise were half a dozen frail and elderly Bhutanese, some with hunched backs and canes, chanting the six perfections that lead to enlightenment: generosity, morality, patience, energy, meditation and wisdom. Phuntso said the elderly come here and do this all day, every day. \u201cThey are preparing for the afterlife.\u201dI even began to believe the story about Padmasambhava riding on the back of a tigress to fight a demon on the high cliff where one of Bhutan\u2019s most popular tourist attractions, the Tiger\u2019s Nest Monastery, is. It takes over four punishing hours to hike there, round trip, and was, by far, the most crowded tourism spot I visited. Yet mysticism still drenched the air. On the way back, Phuntso and I saw a figure drop from a tree that turned out to be a gray langur monkey. We had seen gray langurs once before on our trip, and Kinga had stressed what good luck they are. Phuntso said that on all his many trips to Tiger\u2019s Nest, he had never seen one on this trail.As we left, we pointed the monkey out to a Bhutanese family. The father agreed with Phuntso that spotting one here was of great portent.\u201cHe must be a disciple of Buddha,\u201d he said, matter-of-factly, and walked off, down the trail.Previous dispatches:Next dispatch: Laos and CambodiaAdvertisement"}

Like many families, mine shares a login for the ubiquitous delivery behemoth. Every time my dad or my sister orders an item, I see a cheerful red badge pop up on my app: \u201cYour Amazon.com shipment is on its way!\u201dLately, those red badges have started coming several times a week. In 2018 alone, my family has spent nearly $7,000 on Amazon.My dad, a former professor with an impressive library, used to buy only books on the site. Now nearly everything he needs comes from Amazon: physical therapy balls, elevated toilet seats, a better wheelchair than Medicare can cover, cheap tubs of protein powder, even staples like kitty litter and T-shirts.My sister Kim faces this irony, too. Last year, just before her 60th birthday, she found out she had breast cancer. The chemo wreaked havoc on her immune system, and she took a seven-month leave from work. Afraid of making her health worse during a historic flu season, she barely left the house and started ordering the most prosaic products on Amazon Prime in bulk: tissues, a fleece jacket, a lemon squeezer, dinner forks, deodorant. As her cancer treatment ramped up, the red badges signaled other items: wig caps, pill organizer, the Book of Common Prayer, a St. Peregrine patron saint of cancer medal. When her chemo resulted in a raging case of hemorrhoids, she was grateful not to have to ask our brother, who was caring for her, to fetch her sitz bath salts and witch hazel pads. After her reduced disability pay began to catch up with her, she used Amazon for the discounts. She once ordered 27 rolls of toilet paper for just $16.97.My sister spends her days as a social worker in hospice, giving her a front-row seat to the travesty of end-of-life care in the United States. A bleeding-heart liberal, she\u2019d been known for fierce Facebook posts on things like President Trump and gay marriage. When she was going through treatment, her heart was bled dry. \u201cWhen I was in survival mode, I couldn\u2019t think of anything else but feeling better,\u201d Kim told me. \u201cI really wasn\u2019t thinking globally.\u201dIf I wanted to quit the service forever because it offends my values, I could probably do that without upending my life. But even for someone like me, who isn\u2019t sick or disabled or poor or living in a rural area, Amazon Prime helps alleviate the pressures of a sped-up economy. I don\u2019t use it just because I\u2019m lazy and love to stream \u201cTransparent.\u201d I use it (and other timesaving apps like Seamless and Uber) because I\u2019m overworked and one-click ordering spares me time. Yet, as Kim observed, it\u2019s hard to care about the big picture when you\u2019re simply putting one foot in front of the other. Because of seemingly remote forces \u2014 an inaccessible elder care system, insufficient health coverage, stagnant wages, long work hours \u2014 those of us who see corporate monopolies as detrimental to this country nevertheless rely on them for anything from dish soap to our paychecks.The Libertarian presidential candidate Harry Browne famously warned that the government will break your legs, then hand you crutches. Mr. Browne, an ardent fan of the free market, could have been describing the economy of cheap convenience.

What it did not say: The campaign is out of money anyway after a frantic push to the finish line, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to discuss the finances.Another company, the drugmaker Amgen, said that it had been able to cancel a $5,000 check before it was cashed by the campaign, but that it was still waiting for another $4,000 in earlier contributions to be returned.A host of other companies, including some of the nation\u2019s largest, said they had not received checks or even a promise of returns. Among them were AT&T, Union Pacific, Aetna and Pfizer. Google and Facebook, which had also requested refunds, did not return requests for comment.But she is not required to return the contributions, and on the campaign trail she never said she would do so. Federal law and campaign finance regulations require only that campaign committees refund prohibited or illegal contributions or checks that exceed the maximum allowable dollar amount.\u201cIn other words, the act and regulations don\u2019t mandate refunds upon request,\u201d said Judith Ingram, a spokeswoman for the Federal Election Commission.Ms. Hyde-Smith declined to discuss the refund requests. \u201cI don\u2019t even have a list,\u201d she said briskly in the Capitol, referring additional questions to her campaign. On Friday, a top campaign official declined to comment on the matter.The senator\u2019s decision not to return the money puts many of the companies in a difficult position. Corporate giving is typically handled by government affairs specialists in Washington and funneled through a company\u2019s political action committee to help smooth relationships with lawmakers. But the companies have little recourse or even incentive to demand the money at this point. And they will have to decide soon whether to support Ms. Hyde-Smith in her re-election campaign in 2020.Ms. Hyde-Smith\u2019s \u201cpublic hanging\u201d comments, which surfaced in November in the run-up to a special election to fill the seat of Senator Thad Cochran, helped infuse the contest with questions about race and racism.Her problems worsened with the release of a second video that appeared to show her joking about voter suppression, but which her campaign said was selectively edited.Walmart, the country\u2019s largest retailer, said that \u201cSen. Hyde-Smith\u2019s recent comments clearly do not reflect the values of our company and associates\u201d and asked for its $4,000 contribution back.Union Pacific, one of the country\u2019s largest rail systems, wrote on Twitter that it \u201cin no way, shape or form condones or supports divisive or perceived to be divisive statements.\u201dAnd a spokeswoman for Boston Scientific, a medical device maker, which last month issued a tweet announcing that \u201cwe reject the Senator\u2019s statements, which are not aligned with our company\u2019s core values,\u201d said Thursday that the company had followed up several times with the campaign about its donation, without luck.Advertisement"}

And yet it has been treated as niche and unimportant.Ms. Frank created the podcast \u201cThe Longest Shortest Time.\u201d If you\u2019d asked me back then if I was a feminist, I might\u2019ve shrugged and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d To be honest, I thought the word was a bit of an insult.In 2010, my luck changed. That\u2019s the year I became a mother.My daughter arrived healthy, but I was injured so severely that I was unable to walk for two months. I spent eight solid weeks on an air mattress because I couldn\u2019t handle the stairs to the bedroom. Here I was with a baby \u2014 one I\u2019d wanted very much \u2014 but I felt completely unable to care for her. The worst part was, I barely had anybody to talk to about it. Most of my friends hadn\u2019t had babies yet and I didn\u2019t want to scare them.This is, in part, what led me to start working on a podcast about parenting called \u201cThe Longest Shortest Time.\u201d I\u2019ve been making it for eight years now.I have learned a lot. That parents can be civil with one another on the internet. That naming an episode \u201cBoobs\u201d will make it your most popular one ever. And that there is a special kind of misogyny reserved for mothers.When I started the show, you couldn\u2019t make a living making a podcast, so I needed to get some episodes on the radio. I sent a sampling to my longtime editor at a big public radio station. He said he was into it but couldn\u2019t get the higher-ups to bite. \u201cIt\u2019s weird,\u201d he said sheepishly. \u201cOne of them said you sound like a little girl.\u201dEven when I was a little girl, I didn\u2019t sound like a little girl. I listened to the clips again, trying to figure out what seemed little-girlish. The only answer I could come up with, the thing that set this work apart from my previous work, is that I \u2014 and the other women I was interviewing \u2014 sounded a little emotional. A little angry. A little raw. These are the qualities that supposedly make radio powerful. Was it being mothers that made us sound weak?I met rejection after rejection. \u201cWe\u2019re just not sure there\u2019s enough of an audience for this kind of thing,\u201d an editor said. \u201cThis is just too \u2026 small,\u201d another said. One guy put it more bluntly: \u201cWho would want to listen to this except for moms?\u201dSo this bias was definitely about moms. But it\u2019s a really ignorant bias to have.Let\u2019s just imagine it\u2019s true that only moms would ever want to listen to stories about moms. Hooray, you\u2019re in business. Moms are one of the most coveted demographics for advertisers.But it\u2019s also nonsense to say that stories about moms are not relatable. I don\u2019t hear anyone fretting over whether \u201c99 Percent Invisible\u201d listeners are all architects or \u201cRadiolab\u201d listeners are all scientists. In story-based reporting, this is what we do: We take the specific and we present it in a compelling way, to make other humans connect with it.When I pitched a public radio editor, she told me it was an interesting topic but that you just can\u2019t talk about something that sexually explicit on the air. I brought the story to another radio editor, this time with an economic peg. I told him the question I wanted to ask was: What is the cost of saving a mom\u2019s sex life?He told me he wouldn\u2019t commission the story because the answer to why we don\u2019t prioritize pain-free sex is that sex is extra. It\u2019s not essential.When you talk about male sexual dysfunction, you\u2019re talking about problems with arousal. When you talk about childbirth injuries, you\u2019re talking about problems with chronic pain. From a health perspective, one talk seems much more essential than the other. And it doesn\u2019t involve discussing boners. NPR. It has driven me to feminism.Motherhood is the biggest, most complex topic I have ever reported on. I\u2019ve had the honor of interviewing a pregnant transgender man, a mixed-race kid who schools her white mom on what it means to be black via freestyle rap, and Terry Gross of \u201cFresh Air\u201d on why she chose not to have children. And yet it has been treated as small, niche and unimportant, and covering it has changed how I am treated by my colleagues.\u201cI know you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re the baby lady.\u201d\u201cI guess,\u201d I said.He shouted gleefully, \u201cI\u2019m going to give you a baby!\u201d\u201cI already have one of those,\u201d I said, backing away.\u201cNo,\u201d he yelled in my face, \u201cI\u2019m going to give you a baby tonight! I\u2019m going to take you upstairs and give you a baby tonight!\u201dFortunately, a few of his co-workers pulled him off me and I ran away.In this guy\u2019s eyes, I wasn\u2019t a radio maker; I was a baby maker.What I wish I\u2019d said back is, \u201cNo, I\u2019m one of the most prominent podcasters.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Manchester United Thrives Off the Field. That\u2019s the Problem.", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn SoccerMANCHESTER, England \u2014 Inside Old Trafford, 75,572 fans stood at attention. On the field, Manchester United\u2019s players gathered in a huddle, fresh from victory against Swansea City, arms draped around each other\u2019s shoulders.In the center circle, Alex Ferguson shuffled from foot to foot. He was about to say goodbye to the club he had managed for 27 years. This had been his final home game, his final league title, his final triumph. He had \u201cno script\u201d for the speech he was about to give.As Ferguson planned what he was going to say, Alan Keegan, United\u2019s longstanding stadium announcer, had the microphone. He called Old Trafford to order. He listed Ferguson\u2019s achievements, though everyone in attendance knew them by rote. He described the club the Scot had built: \u201crulers of English football, the most revered club in the land.\u201d\u201cWe have history at our mercy, and our destiny is firmly in our own hands,\u201d Keegan said.Finally, the rain pouring down, soaking him through, Ferguson spoke. He thanked the fans, the club, the staff. He informed the crowd that their \u201cjob is now to stand by your new manager.\u201d He offered a final instruction to the players, too. \u201cDon\u2019t ever let yourselves down,\u201d he said. \u201cThe expectation is always there.\u201dThat was May 2013. Old Trafford was that sort of place then, the center of English soccer\u2019s greatest empire. Ferguson\u2019s power was absolute. A few days previously, he had summoned David Moyes, his handpicked replacement, to his home. He had not asked him if he wanted the job. He just told him he had it. His wish was his command. He spoke, and the fans and the players listened. It felt like the sun would never set.Not yet six years on, English soccer\u2019s landscape has undergone an almost unimaginable shift. When Manchester United meets Cardiff City on Saturday, those fans\u2019 job is to get behind their fifth manager since Ferguson\u2019s departure; Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, a much-loved former player, has been appointed as caretaker after the sacking of Jose Mourinho. He is on loan from his Norwegian club, Molde FK, until the season\u2019s end. His last managerial job in the Premier League was with, coincidentally, Cardiff.Manchester United is no longer a team that can regard itself as the ruler of English soccer. It has not won the Premier League since Ferguson\u2019s departure. It has reached just one Champions League quarterfinal. In two of the last five years, it has not even taken part in Europe\u2019s elite competition. It is, most certainly, not the most revered team in the land.Ever since the rain-soaked day that Ferguson left, this is a club that has let itself down.To many, the cause of that failure is in the one field where United still leads the world: For all the disappointments of the last five years, it remains a corporate and commercial juggernaut. In September, it registered record revenues of 590 million pounds ($748 million), despite another disappointing display in the Champions League.It is a social media behemoth, too. As Richard Arnold, its managing director, said on a conference call, Manchester United has more Facebook followers than the N.B.A., the N.F.L., the N.H.L. and Major League Baseball combined.It does not need to be successful to make money or to be popular. Manchester United has, the theory runs, focused so much of its attention on its off-field business that its on-field performance has been left to drift.There is some merit to that assessment; certainly, it raises an interesting question as to whether the game\u2019s elite clubs any longer need to win games and trophies to turn a profit, and if they do not, at what point those in charge of running profitable enterprises are likely to notice that something is wrong.Yet those with an intimate knowledge of how the club is run suggest that the problem is, in fact, the polar opposite. United is not suffering because too few people are employed to think about how to improve the team, but because there are too many.When Ferguson left, Ed Woodward, United\u2019s executive vice chairman \u2014 the man who runs the business on behalf of the owners, the Glazer family \u2014 insisted repeatedly that he did not see the need to appoint a technical director, someone to oversee the sporting operation while he focused on the commercial side.Despite being employed by every major club on the planet, that model, he felt, did not work for United. Together with the manager and the recruitment department, Woodward was adamant that he had the global network to bring in the superstars he felt United, as a brand, required. On one occasion, he gleefully held up his cellphone to a group of journalists to show that Jorge Mendes, soccer\u2019s most powerful agent, was calling him.Under Woodward\u2019s auspices, though, United\u2019s recruitment operation has been a mess. Though it has wasted millions on poor signings, just as damning is the money it has not spent: spending months preparing deals for the likes of Toni Kroos, Cesc F\u00e0bregas and Cristiano Ronaldo, only to find them signing for rivals or being given more lucrative contracts at their current clubs. Last January, United called to ask how much it would cost to sign Virgil van Dijk from Southampton as he was having a medical evaluation at Liverpool. The paperwork had already been signed.Until July, the club had three employees nominally running the recruitment department: Marcel Bout, the head of international recruitment; Javier Ribalta, the head of recruitment; and Jim Lawlor, the chief scout appointed under Ferguson. (Ribalta has since left to take a position at the Russian club Zenit St. Petersburg.)The three oversaw an army of 55 full-time scouts around the world: one watching senior players and one for junior players in every major market on the planet. Manchester City, the Premier League champion and, to most eyes, the gold standard of player recruitment, has just 35.The result has been a surfeit of information and a dearth of responsibility, as competing factions jostle for supremacy. Agents, like Mendes and Paul Pogba\u2019s representative, Mino Raiola, have drifted in and out of favor (all four players that United signed in 2016 came from Raiola\u2019s client list). Where City and Liverpool, in particular, can move swiftly and nimbly in the market, United is slow, lumbering.That applies in other fields, too. The academy is overseen by John Murtagh, Nick Cox and Nicky Butt. They serve as head of youth development, academy operations manager and head of academy.As with recruitment, it is hard to discern a clear plan, a grand vision; just a club made heavy by its bloated staffing levels, stuck between legacy appointments and new hires. In some cases, executives have two personal assistants, one longstanding, the other brought in to replace someone who has not left.That lack of decisiveness, of direction, is evident elsewhere. United was forced to pay Marouane Fellaini, the midfielder, \u201cdouble\u201d what he had initially asked for \u2014 according to Eladio Paremes, a former spokesman for Mendes \u2014 because it delayed for so long over offering him new terms. Other players, unable to agree to a deal, have had automatic one-year extensions triggered in order to buy the club time.Though the youth structure has improved considerably in recent years, United still does not pay expenses for those enrolled in its development programs; most of its rivals do. Unlike City, it does not place its scholars in one of Manchester\u2019s most illustrious private schools. In July, its respected head of youth scouting, Derek Langley, left because of his belief that the club\u2019s leadership was not listening to his concerns.The result is a club lacking in direction and vision, unaware of what it wants to be. Woodward has, at least, climbed down on the need to appoint a technical director. Part of the reason Solskjaer has been brought in short term as manager is to allow the club time to identify the right candidate for the senior position.When Ferguson left, Manchester United\u2019s destiny was in its own hands. It has squandered that privilege. Now, it is in a race simply to keep up, to make sure it is not consigned to history.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Best New Year\u2019s Eve Party Is in Seat 17A", "Date": "2018-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGet on a plane. It will make the passage of time that much more palatable.Ms. Schaap is a writer.When the clock struck midnight at the Oakland Coliseum on Jan. 1, 1990, I should\u2019ve known that it would all go downhill from there for my future New Year\u2019s Eves.I was at a Grateful Dead concert. I\u2019d scored a \u201cmiracle\u201d\u2014 that\u2019s Deadhead for a freebie ticket, often bestowed in the 11th hour. The band played \u201cDark Star\u201d (they almost never played \u201cDark Star\u201d). I was happy that the \u201980s were finally over; any nostalgic notions that it was a kind and gentle decade are deeply misguided.And the main thing is, I was young. Why lament the passage of time rather than celebrate it when you\u2019ve got all the time in the world stretched out ahead of you? What 18-year-old has the foresight to have foresight?My New Year\u2019s Eve memories from the decade that followed are fragmentary and faintly rotten, like milk just starting to sour. There were awkward parties I squirmed out of before I had to stand around a TV pretending that watching people in parkas watching a ball is entertainment. There was the time a swaying stranger on the subway threw up much too close to my feet for comfort.Yet I persisted in the performance of forced merriment demanded of us by this bully of a holiday \u2014 until I went to another concert, one that featured a former punk idol whose dissolution and incoherence made for a disheartening, not-fun-at-all spectacle, followed by a long wait for a taxi in frigid weather in hopes of quelling the possibility of anyone barfing near my boots on the subway again. No taxi came, but I sure felt that hypothermia would. I took a vow: I would never go out on New Year\u2019s Eve again.Not long after I made that promise to myself, the man I would later marry moved in with me. He was a great cook, and didn\u2019t like crowds, so small dinner parties at home were exactly his speed for New Year\u2019s Eve, and that suited me fine. It became our tradition to spend most of the week between Christmas and New Year\u2019s Eve making cassoulet, that excellent bean casserole of southwestern France. We submitted duck legs to nice confit baths, cured slabs of pork belly, sometimes even made sausage; we went for it.Finally, on the night itself, we ate it in the company of a few friends with equally robust appetites, whom we shooed out of our small apartment as soon after midnight as politeness permitted, and as gently as we could.Seven years after we married, cancer killed my husband. Of course there could be no more New Year\u2019s Eve cassoulet after that \u2014 not because I couldn\u2019t cook it by myself, but because, well, I couldn\u2019t cook it by myself.Then, a couple of years ago, work required me to be in England in early January. As I looked at flights from New York to London, I noticed that if I left two days sooner than I\u2019d intended, the price dropped substantially. That, I assumed, was because flying two days earlier would mean flying on New Year\u2019s Eve.I embraced the scheme, as though, like some kind of strategic mastermind, I\u2019d planned it that way all along. Flying on New Year\u2019s Eve provided a ready excuse to turn down invitations (or to feel fine if I didn\u2019t get any). I also didn\u2019t mind saving a couple of hundred bucks. Plus, I\u2019d heard a rumor that the airlines serve Champagne, gratis, to their New Year\u2019s Eve guests.Although I can\u2019t presume to understand what dwelled in the hearts and minds of my fellow passengers, they struck me as kindred spirits: No one showed any sign of caring that it was New Year\u2019s Eve. I saw not one sparkly hat. Zero noisemakers. Not a single fleck of confetti. We were quietly united in our not-celebration. I really liked those people.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Writer Who Destroyed an Empire", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Scammell is the author of \u201cSolzhenitsyn: A Biography.\u201dWhen the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, pundits offered a variety of reasons for its failure: economic, political, military. Few thought to add a fourth, more elusive cause: the regime\u2019s total loss of credibility. Solzhenitsyn was no youthful beginner. Born a hundred years ago, on Dec. 11, 1918, just 14 months after the Bolshevik Revolution, he was virtually the same age as the Soviet state and had experienced every phase of its development. As a youth and college student he had been swept up in the revolutionary euphoria of the communist experiment and fervently believed in the premises of Marxism-Leninism. In World War II he served as the commander of an artillery sound-ranging battalion and was awarded two medals for valor. But Solzhenitsyn\u2019s promising career was brutally cut short by his arrest in February 1945 on a charge of anti-Soviet activities; he was swiftly sentenced to eight years of hard labor in the gulag. His crime? Criticizing Stalin and the Soviet Army in letters exchanged with a school friend on another front.This Dickensian reversal of fortune plunged Solzhenitsyn into despair, but it also opened his eyes to the hideous underbelly of Soviet communism and gave him glimpses of the reign of terror and lies that had kept it going for so long. He had already written poems, stories and half a novel, most of them on patriotic themes; he now resolved to dedicate the rest of his writing life to exposing the monstrous machine that had, as he later discovered, murdered or incarcerated millions like himself.After publishing two more tales focused on the plight of simple peasants, Solzhenitsyn was blacklisted by the censors, but he was able to complete the two big autobiographical novels he had been working on: \u201cThe First Circle\u201d and \u201cCancer Ward.\u201d \u201cThe First Circle\u201d was about a group of privileged prisoners, including Solzhenitsyn, chosen to work in a secret lab run by the gulag authorities, while \u201cCancer Ward\u201d described the circumstances in which Solzhenitsyn, while working as a schoolteacher in administrative exile after his release, was successfully treated for abdominal cancer in Tashkent. Both novels were notable for their ethical scrutiny of Soviet society and discussion of the government\u2019s crimes, and both were denied publication in the Soviet Union. Like \u201cDoctor Zhivago,\" they were quickly smuggled to the West and, like \u201cDoctor Zhivago\u201d and \u201cA Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich,\u201d they became instant best sellers.By the end of the 1960s, the leading writers and activists came to be known as the Dissident Movement. Their goal was to bring about freedom of expression and peaceful political change in the Soviet Union, and they garnered a global audience of readers. Besides writers, their ranks included scientists, engineers, academics, lawyers, even rebellious workers; their unofficial leader was the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Andrei Sakharov.Solzhenitsyn sympathized and cooperated with Sakharov and the other dissidents, but he didn\u2019t always agree with them, and he continued to follow his own path. In 1973, still in the Soviet Union, he sent abroad his literary and polemical masterpiece, \u201cThe Gulag Archipelago.\u201d The nonfiction account exposed the enormous crimes that had led to the wholesale incarceration and slaughter of millions of innocent victims, demonstrating that its dimensions were on a par with the Holocaust. Solzhenitsyn\u2019s gesture amounted to a head-on challenge to the Soviet state, calling its very legitimacy into question and demanding revolutionary change.He continued to blast Soviet leaders for their corruption and offered reams of advice for the future, but it was not an altogether happy time for the writer. His broadsides carried less weight in the Soviet Union than when he had still lived there. Strident attacks on America and Western democracy soon alienated his liberal supporters in the West, while his fierce criticisms of former allies in his memoirs seriously damaged his reputation at home.None of this diminished Solzhenitsyn\u2019s desire to see the Soviet system brought down, and when the government of Mikhail Gorbachev collapsed in 1991 he enjoyed both the thrill of success and the satisfaction of being proved right in his predictions of disaster. Three years later, he returned to Russia and received a hero\u2019s welcome. But he didn\u2019t much like what he saw there. President Boris Yeltsin\u2019s government was chaotic, and Solzhenitsyn disapproved of what he saw as the new regime\u2019s adulation of the West and its foolish desire to introduce a form of Western democracy. What he advocated was a strong leader, who maintained strict order in the country, encouraged more religion and state support for the Orthodox church, together with a revitalized patriotism and a return to traditional values.He seemed to get his wish in 2000, when Mr. Yeltsin handed the presidency over to a man who shared Solzhenitsyn\u2019s nationalist views and personified his ideal of a strong leader: Vladimir Putin. The new Russian leader made a show of welcoming Solzhenitsyn to his residence and seeking his advice, and in 2007 he bestowed a state award on the author for his humanitarian activities (Solzhenitsyn had refused similar awards from Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Yeltsin).Solzhenitsyn died in 2008, before Mr. Putin showed his true colors with the coldblooded murders of opposition figures, the creation of an authoritarian state, the invasion of Ukraine and the Crimea, and the whittling down of local democracy in the provinces. (Solzhenitsyn might well have approved of the Ukrainian measures, since he was half-Ukrainian by birth, but not the others.)After his death Solzhenitsyn was given a sumptuous funeral and buried at the Donskoy Monastery in Moscow. In 2010 \u201cThe Gulag Archipelago\u201d was made required reading in Russian high schools. Moscow\u2019s Great Communist Street has been renamed Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn Street, his centennial is being celebrated with great pomp this week in Russia, and a statue of him in Moscow is planned for the near future.All this would give the writer great satisfaction. But though feted and exploited by questionable allies, Solzhenitsyn should be remembered for his role as a truth-teller. He risked his all to drive a stake through the heart of Soviet communism and did more than any other single human being to undermine its credibility and bring the Soviet state to its knees.Michael Scammell is the author of \u201cSolzhenitsyn: A Biography\u201d and \u201cKoestler: The Literary and Political Odyssey of a Twentieth Century Skeptic.\u201dAn earlier version of this article gave the wrong name for a Russian author and dissident during the Soviet era. It was Yuli Daniel, not Alexander Daniel. Also, an earlier version of the photo caption gave the incorrect date on which Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn traveled by boat to Oslo. It was Feb. 25, 1974, not Feb. 24, 1974.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Far-Right Proud Boys Reeling After Arrests and Scrutiny", "Date": "2018-12-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter his appearance in Manhattan led to a brawl, the founder of a far-right group, the Proud Boys, said it was little more than a \u201cfun, silly, men\u2019s club\u201d that had defended itself against an attack by leftist protesters.But two months later, as prosecutors move ahead with charges, the all-male Proud Boys group is in disarray. Ten members have been arrested in connection with the violence, charged with riot and attempted assault as part of an investigation into their activities.Even the founder, Gavin McInnes, has distanced himself, announcing on YouTube in late November that he was quitting the group \u201cin all capacities, forever.\u201d His departure left the Proud Boys without a figurehead, though the group has since said in an online message that, \u201cWe\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201dThough Mr. McInnes has said he disavows racism, he wrote that the prominent white nationalist Richard B. Spencer \u201ccomes across as perfectly reasonable in conversation,\u201d and he said Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, who is black, is \u201ckind of like Sambo.\u201d When he quit the group, he blamed \u201crumors and lies and terrible journalism\u201d for undermining \u201cthe greatest fraternal organization in the world.\u201d\u201cThis whole idea of white nationalists and white supremacy is a crock,\u201d he added. \u201cSuch people don\u2019t exist.\u201dAt the same time, previously unreleased video obtained by The New York Times shows that the Proud Boys initiated the attack in Manhattan against a handful of anti-fascist protesters, not the other way around, as Mr. McInnes had initially said.Prosecutors said at court appearances for some of the accused Proud Boys members that video evidence will prove that the Proud Boys started the fight.Asked about the Proud Boys, John Miller, deputy police commissioner for intelligence and counterterrorism, confirmed that \u201cincidents like this make it more likely that they\u2019ll be higher on the radar.\u201dEnrique Tarrio, chairman of the administrative chapter of the Proud Boys, maintained that the group repudiates hate and racism and pointed out it has ordered white supremacists to leave its events in the past.Outside a crowd of left-wing protesters chanted \u201cNo Nazis, No KKK, No fascist U.S.A.\u201d After the event, the police kept the attendees and protesters separate, but a handful of leftists, wearing masks, circled the block and tried to intercept the Proud Boys on East 82d Street, the police said.The security video from a nearby building shows that at 8:19 p.m. two men in Proud Boys shirts, Maxwell Hare and Geoffrey Young, strode briskly east from Park Avenue on 82nd Street toward about six protesters some 100 feet away.Then, Mr. Hare charged the leftists, and a protester threw a plastic water bottle, which sailed past him, the video shows. Mr. Hare crashed into one of the protesters, hurling punches.Just before he charged, another video filmed by a freelance videographer recorded that someone yelled: \u201cProud Boys! You ready? Proud Boys!\u201dWithin seconds more men rushed down the block from Park Avenue and joined the fray, the two videos show. The brawl lasted about 60 seconds.A third video filmed by a man who was with the Proud Boys showed Mr. Hare and others after the fight exulting about \u201csmashing\u201d the head of a \u201cforeigner.\u201dBoth Mr. Young and Mr. Hare have pleaded not guilty and claim through their lawyers they were attacked.One challenge facing prosecutors is that the victims of the attack have refused to cooperate with the authorities, which means the case will rely heavily on videos from security cameras and onlookers.The indictment refers to the victims as \u201cShaved Head,\u201d \u201cPony Tail,\u201d \u201cKhaki\u201d and \u201cSpiky Belt.\u201d\u201cThe identity of these Antifa members remains unknown,\u201d Joshua Steinglass, an assistant district attorney, told a judge at an arraignment for seven of the defendants on Dec. 14.The people who turned out to hear Mr. McInnes speak at the Metropolitan Republican Club in October represented a cross-section of New York\u2019s far-right subculture: libertarians, conspiracy theorists and nationalists who have coalesced around their opposition to Islam, feminism and liberal politics.Irvin Antillon, 49, who is accused of kicking protesters on the ground, is a member of a Latino skinhead group, Batall\u00f3n 49, who traveled to Charlottesville last year for the \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally, where an anti-racist protester was killed, experts said.In one online photograph, he poses shirtless, showing off tattoos of Nazi symbols.Mr. Hare, 26, of Harrisburg, Pa., was filmed in early October punching leftist protesters at a \u201cResist Marxism\u201d rally outside the statehouse in Providence, R.I., and traveled to another far-right rally in Portland, Ore., in August, where Vice News Tonight filmed him wearing what appeared to be a bulletproof vest.Mr. Young, 38, of Rockland County, N.Y., who is accused of punching and kicking three people, has called Muslims \u201ca virus\u201d who \u201cfeed off the host nation until it\u2019s dead\u201d in an online video.\u201cI think the president was correct in saying that there were good people on both sides and bad people on both sides,\u201d Mr. Tarrio said.Advertisement"}

What to pack? The six questions you should ask before you take your pup on a plane.Wouldn\u2019t it be nice to take Chester home for the holidays to meet the family?No, not your new boyfriend, the one you love above all others: your dog.But before you start packing Chester\u2019s carry-on, you need to know how to make it a safe and stress-free experience.Here are some questions to ask before deciding whether or not your dog will also be your traveling companion.As with most things, safety first. Always consult your veterinarian before planning your trip, as certain breeds and dogs are at a higher risk.Also, only smaller dogs that can safely fit in a carrier bag and be stowed underneath the seat in front of you can fly in the cabin. Large dogs, as long as the breed is approved by the airline, have to fly in cargo.The I.P.A.T.A. does not recommend giving tranquilizers to any pet during air travel. It said sedation suppresses respiratory and body temperature regulation and can have other negative effects on the animal\u2019s physiology.But other types of medications or natural calming aids can make a big difference, from toys or treats to anything that has prescribed by your vet after a consultation about the upcoming trip. While you\u2019re asking your vet about health issues, you also need to fill out the necessary paperwork for your trip. You don\u2019t want your pup to be detained at customs, do you?Typically, you need an accredited veterinarian to perform an exam before your trip to obtain a Certificate of Veterinary Inspection (CVI). But depending on your destination, there are different admission requirements per state and country.\u201cThe actual under-seat dimensions will vary by airline carrier, and things really get complicated when you consider the type of pet carrier, airline class seat, and short-haul or long-haul flights,\u201d Mrs. Wells said.\u201cIt\u2019s soft-sided, which is more comfortable for my pets and easier for me to carry, it is flexible enough that I can fit it underneath the seat in front of me without squishing my pet, and it\u2019s extremely durable,\u201d she said.Large airports are only required by law to provide pet relief areas for service animals \u2014 so unless you do your research, Princess Poochy may have to hold it for awhile.\u201cSome airports are more dog friendly than others, and not all of them have relief areas for animals,\u201d Mrs. Well said.She recommends mapping out where the relief areas are in advance, as they\u2019re not always easy to find and may be located in some terminals and not others.But some airports are making travel easier for pet owners, so traveling a bit further beyond your usual airport to locate one might be worth it.No matter the airport, get there early, \u201cso you have time to check-in for your flight, check your bags, and give your pet a bathroom break before you even head through security,\u201d Mrs. Wells suggested.\u201cWhen traveling with your pet, treat them like a newborn and come prepared,\u201d said Mrs. Wells.Keep in mind that your dog will most likely count as one of your carry-on items, so you may have to pack light yourself. You\u2019ll also need room for items to keep your dog happy and healthy.\u201cMy dog Sutton always gets a Kong stuffed with some dog-friendly peanut butter or cheese whiz to keep her entertained on the flight, and I pack a spare,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Charges Dropped Against Brooklyn Mother Who Had Baby Ripped from Her Arms by Police", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe woman, Jazmine Headley, 23, was released from Rikers Island, where she has been held for five days, at 9 p.m. and was reunited with her baby boy a half-hour later, family members said. She still faces charges in a credit card fraud case from 2016 in Mercer County, N.J., where she must return to court on Wednesday.Earlier in the day, Justice Craig S. Walker ordered Ms. Headley released during a hearing in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn. The judge said that the video of Ms. Headley\u2019s arrest was a \u201chorrific scene that was broadcast all over the United States.\u201d He said that both Ms. Headley\u2019s experience during her arrest and \u201cthe amount of time she has served\u201d factored into his decision.On Friday, Ms. Headley was sitting with her 1-year-old son, Damone, on the floor of an office in the Human Resources Administration building in Boerum Hill, where she had gone to try to get her child-care benefits reinstated. She had brought her son along because his day care center had informed her the city was no longer paying his fee, her lawyer and a family member said.After sitting for some time on the floor, she got into an argument with a security guard who asked her to move. After that, somebody called the police.The officers pried the boy from Ms. Headley\u2019s grip, and one officer waved a stun gun at an outraged crowd, some of whom were filming the arrest on their phones.Ms. Headley was charged with resisting arrest, acting in a manner injurious to a child, obstructing governmental administration and trespassing. All those charges were dismissed.The Brooklyn district attorney, Eric Gonzalez, said in a statement that he was \u201chorrified by the violence depicted in the video and immediately opened an investigation\u201d into the arrest. He said a review of the case showed that it was not handled properly.\u201cThe consequences this young and desperate mother has already suffered as a result of this arrest far outweigh any conduct that may have led to it,\u201d he said. \u201cShe and her baby have been traumatized, she was jailed on an unrelated warrant and may face additional collateral consequences.\u201dIn court on Tuesday, Jeremy Shockett, deputy chief of the trial division, said his office did not object to Ms. Headley\u2019s release. But he said she had missed two or three court appearances in the New Jersey case, and Mercer County officials wanted her detained until they could pick her up on Thursday.Still, he said, his office had been inundated with calls from community leaders who assured him that Ms. Headley would appear in court in New Jersey on Wednesday to answer charges there.Ms. Headley was arrested in July 2016 after an investigation involving counterfeit credit cards, the Mercer County prosecutor\u2019s office said. She was charged with two counts of credit card theft and one count of trafficking in personal identifying information, the prosecutor\u2019s office said. A judge in Mercer County Superior Court issued a warrant for her arrest after she did not show up in court.Ms. Headley\u2019s history of missing court dates might cause problems for her in New Jersey. The state no longer has cash bail and judges make the decisions on releasing defendants based on whether they are likely to return for future court appearances.After the hearing on Tuesday, Lisa Schreibersdorf, the executive director of Brooklyn Defender Services, said that the organization was asking the Mercer County prosecutor\u2019s office to consider dismissing the charges against Ms. Headley.\u201cShe\u2019s been through enough, in our opinion,\u201d Ms. Schreibersdorf said.She also said that she expected Ms. Headley would appear in court on Wednesday, especially given the amount of attention her case has garnered.\u201cI think with all of that, the judge was pretty clear that she would appear, and she will,\u201d Ms. Schreibersdorf said.The video of Ms. Headley\u2019s arrest drew fierce criticism on social media. Several elected officials called for an investigation, including the Brooklyn borough president, Eric Adams, the City Council speaker, Corey Johnson, and the public advocate, Letitia James.Mr. Johnson held a rally on the City Hall steps on Tuesday to protest Ms. Headley\u2019s treatment and call for her immediate release. \u201cEvery day that she sits on Rikers Island we are compounding this tragedy,\u201d he said. He added that he was furious over what he saw in the video and that \u201canyone who saw it has an obligation to speak out and make our system better.\u201dMayor Bill de Blasio has yet to speak publicly about the incident and ignored reporters\u2019 questions at a police oversight event on Monday. Later in the day, he said on Twitter that the video was disturbing and he had \u201ca lot of questions\u201d about how the arrest was handled.In court on Tuesday, Ms. Schreibersdorf said Ms. Headley was \u201cvery distraught,\u201d but remained unaware of the firestorm her arrest in Brooklyn had generated on social media.\u201cThe entire country is talking about her, and she hasn\u2019t been able to engage in any of that,\u201d Ms. Schreibersdorf said.Nikita Stewart and William Neuman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

He and his wife, Felicia Montealegre, hold a white shirt, his gaze locked on her; is he seeking comfort, or are they really just fixing the shirt? There\u2019s not much time. Soon he is to walk out on the Carnegie Hall stage as the new music director of the New York Philharmonic on the opening night of its 1958-59 season.\u201cI was using the Library of Congress a lot and I started seeing photograph after photograph of him by my heroes,\u201d Mr. Sherman said. \u201cWhen I was a kid and the new issue of Life or Look magazine would come into our house, I would grab it and go up to my room, close the door and spend hours looking at their pictures.\u201dThe book is divided into two main parts. The first and larger consists of photographs of Mr. Bernstein, including some by Mr. Sherman himself; the second is a sampling of archives, musical scores, letters and writing. There are several narratives. The first is chronological, the second emotional and the third somewhat a history of photography.One of those photographs, from December 1949, shows Mr. Bernstein chatting behind a hazy cloud of cigarette smoke, framed by Betty Comden of the writing team Comden and Green, who created libretti for many hit Broadway shows and musicals.\u201cFor me, that photograph has nothing to do with the Jackie O. story,\u201d Mr. Sherman said. \u201cIt\u2019s really about how do you get a family up a tree?\u201dThere is a range of emotions that informs the images. In some of the photos, Mr. Bernstein looks quite tormented, while other photos show him ecstatic, in the arms of his loved ones, bursting with impatient ideas. One photo shows him embraced by Aaron Copland with the biggest grin in the world, and another shows Mr. Bernstein with his hand on the shoulder of a young musician about to have a huge night.\u201cHis whole approach to life was that he was so curious about everything,\u201d Ms. Bernstein said. \u201cAnd the minute he found out anything that he was interested in, he had to immediately turn around and share it with somebody else.\u201dMr. Sherman included a few of his own pictures of the maestro conducting. When Mr. Bernstein conducted, it was almost like he was a vessel transmitting the most urgent signals from some magical place.\u201cL. B. really used his body to express the music,\u201d Ms. Bernstein wrote in an email. \u201cPeople thought he was dancing on the podium. Audiences \u2014 critics too \u2014 thought he was carrying on for their benefit, and he was often criticized for being flamboyant. But if you ask any orchestra musician who worked with him, they will tell you that his every gesture was a precise and specific communication to the players.

{"Headline": "Is Listening to a Book the Same Thing as Reading It?", "Date": "2018-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEach is best suited to different purposes, and neither is superior.Mr. Willingham is a psychologist at the University of Virginia.A few years ago, when people heard I was a reading researcher, they might ask about their child\u2019s dyslexia or how to get their teenager to read more. But today the question I get most often is, \u201cIs it cheating if I listen to an audiobook for my book club?\u201dAudiobook sales have doubled in the last five years while print and e-book sales are flat. These trends might lead us to fear that audiobooks will do to reading what keyboarding has done to handwriting \u2014 rendered it a skill that seems quaint and whose value is open to debate. But examining how we read and how we listen shows that each is best suited to different purposes, and neither is superior.In fact, they overlap considerably. Consider why audiobooks are a good workaround for people with dyslexia: They allow listeners to get the meaning while skirting the work of decoding, that is, the translation of print on the page to words in the mind. Although decoding is serious work for beginning readers, it\u2019s automatic by high school, and no more effortful or error prone than listening. Once you\u2019ve identified the words (whether by listening or reading), the same mental process comprehends the sentences and paragraphs they form.What happened? Note that the subject matter was difficult, and the goal wasn\u2019t pleasure but learning. Both factors make us read differently. When we focus, we slow down. We reread the hard bits. We stop and think. Each is easier with print than with a podcast.Print also supports readers through difficult content via signals to organization like paragraphs and headings, conventions missing from audio. Experiments show readers actually take longer to read the first sentence of a paragraph because they know it probably contains the foundational idea for what\u2019s to come.So although one core process of comprehension serves both listening and reading, difficult texts demand additional mental strategies. Print makes those strategies easier to use. Consistent with that interpretation, researchers find that people\u2019s listening and reading abilities are more similar for simple narratives than for expository prose. Stories tend to be more predictable and employ familiar ideas, and expository essays more likely include unfamiliar content and require more strategic reading.This conclusion \u2014 equivalence for easy texts and an advantage to print for hard ones \u2014 is open to changes in the future. As audiobooks become more common, listeners will gain experience in comprehending them and may improve, and publishers may develop ways of signaling organization auditorily.But even with those changes, audiobooks won\u2019t replace print because we use them differently. Eighty-one percent of audiobook listeners say they like to drive, work out or otherwise multitask while they listen. The human mind is not designed for doing two things simultaneously, so if we multitask, we\u2019ll get gist, not subtleties. Still, that\u2019s no reason for print devotees to sniff. I can\u2019t hold a book while I mop or commute. Print may be best for lingering over words or ideas, but audiobooks add literacy to moments where there would otherwise be none.So no, listening to a book club selection is not cheating. It\u2019s not even cheating to listen while you\u2019re at your child\u2019s soccer game (at least not as far as the book is concerned). You\u2019ll just get different things out of the experience. And different books invite different ways that you want to read them: As the audio format grows more popular, authors are writing more works specifically meant to be heard.Our richest experiences will come not from treating print and audio interchangeably, but from understanding the differences between them and figuring out how to use them to our advantage \u2014 all in the service of hearing what writers are actually trying to tell us.Advertisement"}

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.Give one group of New York officials a pat on the back, and another inevitably slaps you in the face.It was good news that a special pay committee recommended that state legislators not only get a substantial raise to recognize that their positions are full-time jobs but also that there be strict limitations on their outside income and bureaucratic perks.Now legislative leaders may be scheming to get one without the other. (Guess which one they want.)Silly us for thinking they wouldn\u2019t do that and, even though many legislators objected to restrictions on outside income, this important block on corruption would finally become law.Now there\u2019s word that the Republican John Flanagan, in his final days as State Senate majority leader, is considering calling his chamber into session to approve the raise and reject the reforms.

Since Ms. Stewart-Cousins does not think legislators should reject the committee\u2019s recommendation, she could face up to this mess as a matter of honor, reject the bill and show leadership on ethics even before she takes over leadership of the Senate.Republicans have been consistent opponents of ethics reforms for years, so Mr. Flanagan\u2019s position is to be expected.But it\u2019s sad that, as Democrats prepare to control both houses of the Legislature after being elected on a promise of reform and transformation, Mr. Heastie might take a stand that would make voters feel like saps.Don\u2019t reject the pay committee\u2019s recommendation.

{"Headline": "The Dangers of Doing Favors for Donald Trump ", "Date": "2018-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe president is often unable or unwilling to spot the difference between a favor and a crooked scheme. Mr. Hettena is the author of \u201cTrump/Russia: A Definitive History.\u201dThe problem for Mr. Trump is that he is unable or unwilling to spot the difference between a favor and a crooked scheme. And that goes a long way toward explaining why he has surrounded himself with people in trouble with the law and why his presidency is in the grip of intensifying federal investigations. Two former federal officials told me (though Mr. Cohen denied this) that information they collected from Russian sources indicated that Mr. Cohen had been hired by Mr. Trump as a favor to Mr. Cohen\u2019s father-in-law, Fima Shusterman, a Ukrainian \u00e9migr\u00e9 who has a 1993 conviction for a crime related to money laundering. Mr. Shusterman, who owned at least four New York taxi companies, set his son-in-law up in the yellow cab business. In the Southern District sentencing memo, prosecutors said that Mr. Cohen turned that into a very lucrative business. It\u2019s telling that prosecutors in Manhattan did not sign a cooperation agreement with Mr. Cohen in part because he specifically refused to answer questions about past criminal conduct. President Trump himself made a cryptic reference to Mr. Shusterman\u2019s ties to unknown sources of wealth when he wrote on Twitter, after Mr. Cohen\u2019s guilty plea to charges of lying to Congress, that his former lawyer \u201cmakes up stories to get a great and already reduced deal for himself, and get his wife and father-in-law (who has the money?) off Scott Free.\u201dAnother favor, one involving Russia, is what landed Mr. Cohen at the center of Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation. As Mr. Cohen knew, Mr. Trump had long sought \u2014 going back to the mid-1980s \u2014\u00a0to put his name on a building in Moscow. It\u2019s no coincidence that the deal for Trump\u2019s long-denied Moscow tower started to come together after he announced his run for the White House. Mr. Putin, a former K.G.B. lieutenant colonel skilled in the art of manipulation, certainly seems to understand that Mr. Trump\u2019s world runs on favors. After all, the Russian president did Mr. Trump the biggest favor of them all. Mr. Putin turned his intelligence services into a virtual extension of the Trump campaign, hacking emails out of the Democratic Party\u2019s computer networks. That, together with the finely tuned, voluminous social messaging pumped out by internet trolls in St. Petersburg, Russia, may have tipped the scales in a close election.This gets to the very heart of Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation. What else is collusion but an exchange of favors? The question is whether this exchange of favors involves more than Mr. Trump\u2019s natural inclination toward the authoritarian Russian ruler. By providing what prosecutors described as useful information on Russia-related matters he learned from Trump Organization executives, Mr. Cohen, a man who once said he would take a bullet for Mr. Trump, is turning favors into betrayal to help investigators understand exactly what his boss promised Russia in return.Seth Hettena, a former investigative reporter for The Associated Press, is the author of \u201cTrump/Russia: A Definitive History.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Often it feels like in American politics, none of the old rules still apply.But in 2018, they did. (At least some of them.) Alien probes aside, this was a year in which things started to make sense again. The Democratic landslide in the midterms proved that the laws of political gravity haven\u2019t been suspended; Trump\u2019s incompetence, venality and boorishness had electoral consequences. Further, it was a year of justice and accountability for at least some of those who foisted this administration on the country. An awful menagerie of lowlifes was swept into power by Trump\u2019s victory two years ago. In 2018, at least some of them started to fall back out again.At the beginning of 2018, Michael Cohen was still Trump\u2019s loyal personal lawyer. Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, was sleeping in his own bed at night. Rick Gates, Manafort\u2019s deputy, had not yet made a plea deal with Robert Mueller, the special counsel. Mueller\u2019s investigation hadn\u2019t yet sent anyone to prison. The Dutch lawyer Alex van der Zwaan, who pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. about work he\u2019d done with Gates for the former Ukrainian president, became the first, in May. He was followed by Richard Pinedo, seller of fake IDs and fraudulent bank accounts, and former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos.If Trump opponents had known a year ago that 2018 would bring so many revelations and comeuppances, we might have assumed that the Trump administration would be entering its terminal phase. But living under Trump has inured many of us to shock; momentous developments, like Cohen being sentenced to three years in prison, end up feeling anticlimactic, particularly with most Republicans refusing to act.Advertisement"}

Shelsky\u2019s smoked fish and other deli items fill the display cases. Bagel and bialy sandwiches are available, along with fried knish pastry filled with hot pastrami, sauerkraut and mustard.

{"Headline": "36 Hours in Chamonix", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySkiers, climbers, foodies and night-life lovers: This French town at the base of a lofty Alps peak welcomes you at its most magical time, the winter.In 1921, the town council of Chamonix, then a quiet French community of 3,000 people, decided to change the municipality\u2019s name to Chamonix-Mont-Blanc, thus forging an official link to the mountain, the highest in Western Europe, with a summit that soars 12,000 feet above the town center. The council\u2019s goal was to prevent their Swiss neighbors from claiming the mountain\u2019s glory, but there was really no need: It\u2019s impossible when you\u2019re in Chamonix to ignore the gargantuan, icy beauty that looms overhead. And, as in any good mountain resort town, the adrenaline rush promised by the surrounding slopes fuels a sense of revelry and indulgence in the valley below. Perhaps nowhere else is this dynamic so evident as in Chamonix, where you can wander through a landscape that feels as wild and harsh as the moon, then, half an hour later, soak in a Jacuzzi under the stars. Chamonix is a glorious place for visitors, especially in winter, when the town and its mountains are cloaked in snow. Professional climbers, weekend skiers, gourmands, night-life lovers, devoted adrenaline seekers \u2014 Chamonix welcomes them all with the classic French double kiss.If you\u2019re visiting in the new year, start your final day in Chamonix by taking the stomach-dropping cable car ride up to the top of the Aiguille du Midi, an icy, steep peak that hosts a cluster of buildings and walkways for visitors to explore (\u20ac61.50 round trip; closed for repairs until later this month). The cable car whisks you straight from the busy streets of Chamonix into one of the continent\u2019s harshest and most beautiful landscapes. From the top of the lift, hardened mountaineers set off on expeditions to the summit of Mont Blanc and beyond. But no ice axes are required to tour the Aiguille du Midi complex where you can browse exhibits on the history of mountaineering and the geology of the Mont Blanc massif. Those feeling brave can walk through a glass-floored exhibit that dangles over a 3,000-foot drop.Wander back through Chamonix\u2019s bustling, pedestrian-only zone to Pie, an intimate spot that\u2019s perfect for a quick, fresh lunch before you head out of town. Owned by the Paris-trained pastry chef Charles Guillaume and his wife St\u00e9phanie, the restaurant features a rotating selection of tarts, both sweet and savory. Order the quiche of the day (\u20ac9.80), which comes with a lightly dressed salad, then enjoy a decadent hot chocolate embellished with chestnut cream (\u20ac5.90) for dessert.Apartment rentals are easy to find in Chamonix\u2019s lively and walkable city center, where nightly rates for a one-bedroom range from \u20ac79 to about \u20ac160 on Airbnb.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Year That Bill de Blasio Became Donald Trump* and 9 Other Improbable Transformations", "Date": "2018-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBig CityThe drama of the past year played out locally in big civic and social changes: surprise political upsets and reversals, decent reputations gone bad and bad reputations gone much worse. Here, a highly subjective (and in some cases exaggerated) list of who and what seemed to morph into someone or something else.When Bill de Blasio Became Donald Trump (*Wait, what?)When an Unknown Bartender Became a Che Guevara T-shirtAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez rose from obscurity over the summer to defeat longtime incumbent Joseph Crowley in the Democratic primary to represent the city\u2019s 14th Congressional district. But that is easily the dullest and least relevant way to describe her change of fortune. On the left she has become a symbol of working-class grievance, of an urban youth class mired in student debt and locked out of domestic comforts by a national housing crisis. On the right she has become a lightning rod for those who fear and loathe a rising progressive energy. Is she weak on policy? Does it matter? She is leading an emotionally charged movement.When Andrew Cuomo Became the Bartender Who Became the Che Guevara T-shirtWhen the New York City Housing Authority Became the Ultimate SlumlordIn June the federal government delivered a brutal rebuke to the nation\u2019s biggest public housing authority, accusing it of gross mismanagement and failure to provide a safe living environment for residents, especially children who had been exposed to lead paint. The city was supposed to move quickly making repairs; it didn\u2019t. Reports of squalid conditions continue, and in one complex, thousands of residents didn\u2019t have heat or hot water on Thanksgiving.When Amazon Became Philip MorrisSo it turned out that Amazon was more or less just kidding when it solicited proposals from cities around the country hoping to be home to the company\u2019s second headquarters. The company affirmed its elitist commitments when it chose to locate in New York and suburban Washington over, say, Detroit or Pittsburgh. And while that was maddening enough to plenty of urbanists, many New Yorkers have greeted the impending arrival of Amazon with a rage toward the company that was not necessarily foreseeable. Amazon\u2019s encroachment into Queens, where the terror is that it will drive housing prices up even further and deny jobs to the people who really need them, has made the retailer the brightest new emblem of corporate malevolence.When Sheryl Sandberg Became Ayn RandMany women in New York\u2019s pop intellectual and publishing communities embraced Sheryl Sandberg\u2019s book \u201cLean In\u2019\u2019 when it came out a few years ago. Its simple advice for female empowerment: Women need to just buck up and assert themselves if they wanted more from the patriarchy.

{"Headline": "From 2018, Indelible Messages From the Past", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe PourThe best wines of the year were not always the most profound, but the bottles that captured a moment. Sometimes, the moment was long ago. It\u2019s a privilege and necessity of my job to drink many wines over the course of a year. All have a story to tell, sometimes dull, other times fascinating. Some are simply unforgettable.The wines that stay with me are not always the best or the most profound. Sometimes the surprise of a discovery can transform the perception of a wine\u2019s potential. More often, it\u2019s a wine that so completely captures the spirit and emotion of a moment that it brands the memory with its scent and flavor.What follows, from young to old, are a dozen remarkable wines, with stories that endure.Great producers see the potential that others overlook. When Fernando Garc\u00eda and Daniel G\u00f3mez Jim\u00e9nez-Landi found vineyards of old-vine garnacha that were languishing on granite hillsides in the Sierra de Gredos outside Madrid, they envisioned beauty.This bottle \u2014 from a vineyard of almost pure granite, with ancient vines interspersed with trees \u2014 smelled like concentrated rose petals. It was likewise floral on the palate, yet strikingly saline, an unforgettable combination.Of their excellent wines, their Argetsinger Vineyard riesling, from a gravel-and-limestone slope rising above the east side of Seneca Lake, may be the best. When I drank the 2009 in August, I was riveted by its depth, complexity and insistent intensity. This was a great wine, perhaps the best American riesling I\u2019ve had, and, at nine years of age, it had miles to go.It was just as I remembered, more rugged than pretty but absolutely without artifice. I can\u2019t wait to see these wines again.As a constantly shifting blend of grapes \u2014 generally some combination of grenache, mourv\u00e8dre, syrah and cinsault, among others \u2014 from a constantly changing array of vineyards, Cigare has hardly been the expression of terroir to which Mr. Grahm has long aspired. Nonetheless, it\u2019s been a consistently good, often excellent and always underrated wine, of which he can rightfully be proud.We tasted 21 wines, and I was particularly struck by the 2005, a lively, lovely grenache-dominant blend that was powerful, yet tense with aromas and flavors of black fruit, flowers and minerals. Mr. Grahm called it his \u201cPlatonic ideal of Cigareness.\u201dSometime after the tasting, Mr. Grahm announced that Bonny Doon\u2019s focus would shift to the wines of terroir he is trying to make at his Popelouchum Vineyard near San Juan Bautista, Calif. After several more unreleased vintages are sold, the Cigare Volant brand will transition to juicy, easygoing, thirst-quenching wines. Meanwhile, thanks for the memories.By Mr. Verset\u2019s last vintage in 2006, Cornas had come to be prized around the world. The supply of Verset wines was dwindling by the time Mr. Verset died, at age 95, in 2015. The 2004, consumed at a dinner party in June, was deep, pure and rustic in the best sense of the word, alive with the flavors of olives and bacon, a wonderful tribute to the life\u2019s work of an unassuming man.Mount Eden was purchased and planted in the early 1940s by Martin Ray, an iconoclastic, pioneering winemaker whose name, like his mentor Paul Masson's, lives on in brands under different owners. The property, now owned by Jeffrey and Ellie Patterson, is also better known for its pinot noir and chardonnay. The 2001 was gorgeous, and still a baby, with flavors of graphite, violets and a signature savory spiciness. I can only hope I will encounter it again.La Paul\u00e9e de Meursault is a glorious celebration of Burgundy held every November in Meursault. Based on the informal parties traditionally held after the harvest, it has evolved into a 700-person extravaganza of local Meursault producers, their families, friends and guests, and a lot of wine, often poured by the winemakers.The B\u00e2tard-Montrachet, a grand cru white poured by Mr. Morey, was both pure B\u00e2tard and pure Morey. It did not leap out of the glass, yet rewarded close observation with its deep, stony, mineral aroma. It smelled so good that for a while I could not bring myself to drink it. When I did finally taste it, the wine was sublime. Whenever it was made, this Chartreuse was stunning, unlocking for me the reason so many people cherish these liqueurs. It was a bit sweet, profoundly bitter, complex and fascinating. Above all, it was refreshing, a welcome digestif after a long and bibulous meal.Aside from 16 vintages of one of the world\u2019s greatest wines, the party included a fascinating array of personalities, like the director and winery owner Francis Ford Coppola and his son the filmmaker Roman Coppola; the actor Dominic West; the wine writer Neal Martin; the chef and author Mimi Thorisson; and the hosts, Baron \u00c9ric de Rothschild and his daughter, Saskia de Rothschild, who now directs the estate.The most memorable \u2014 simply for its profound age and the history it conjures up \u2014 was the 1868, a wine that survived 150 years of joys and catastrophes to tell its story, with delicate yet indistinguishable energy. Unforgettable.Madeira, beloved by early Americans, is a virtually indestructible wine, capable of withstanding long journeys on sailing ships and, as I learned at a tasting held by Christie\u2019s in October to publicize the auction, almost two centuries in an attic.The amber-colored 1846, made from the sercial grape, one of the drier varieties of Madeira, was remarkable. The aromas were complex: dried fruits, flowers, vanilla. The flavors were intense and penetrating, underscored by Madeira\u2019s characteristic bright acidity: more fruit and flowers, a touch of caramel and a refreshing salinity.It was just a taste of history, but the memory it left was indelible.An earlier version of this article misstated the name and location of a museum where three cases of colonial-era Madeira were found. It is Liberty Hall Museum at Kean University in Union, N.J., not Liberty Museum in Jersey City.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Criminal Justice Reform Is a Step in the Wrong Direction ", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe First Step Act denies help to those who need it most. Mr. Wattley is a lawyer.The bill provides incentives for some people in federal prison to participate in educational, vocational and therapeutic programs by awarding them time-reducing credits for completing them. It also increases the use of home detention, post-release transitional programs and electronic monitoring. But it prevents those convicted of the most serious crimes from reducing their sentences at all, and in doing so it perpetuates the false narrative that people who commit violent crimes are fundamentally different from those who commit nonviolent crimes. Ironically, it prevents those convicted of the most serious crimes from reducing their sentences by participating in the programs this bill cites as essential to smart criminal justice reform. I know from my experience as the executive director of UnCommon Law, a nonprofit law firm, that this is counterproductive in the fight for meaningful criminal justice reform. We spend months and even years working with people in prison for violent crimes, helping them to develop the emotional intelligence and communication skills they\u2019ll need upon release from prison. More than 200 of our clients have been released from life sentences, and not a single one has gone on to commit a violent crime. But this bill tells my clients their personal transformation doesn\u2019t matter.In my experience, violence has its roots in feelings of inadequacy and rejection dating back to childhood trauma. And most people who commit violence also have the capacity to reinterpret and overcome their traumatic experiences in a way that brings understanding to, and remorse for, their own actions, along with a newfound commitment to helping others learn from their experience. They are not fundamentally different from people who have committed nonviolent offenses. They and the communities to which they return would most likely benefit the most from incentives to participate in educational and therapeutic programming, as well as earlier release.I stand with advocates seeking to bring people home from prison sooner rather than later. It\u2019s what I do. But we should not be tempted by the false promise that this is the beginning of a more expansive reform effort. Those in control have not taken any steps toward real criminal justice reform, which ideally would involve developing real alternatives to incarceration. When policymakers want to have that conversation, please count me in. But any would-be reform effort that begins by denying the benefits of therapeutic, educational and vocational programs to the people who could benefit most is not a \u201cfirst step\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s a step in the wrong direction.Keith Wattley is the executive director of UnCommon Law, a nonprofit law firm that provides therapeutic and legal counseling for people serving lengthy prison terms in California prisons.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Second Canadian Arrested in China, Escalating Diplomatic Feud", "Date": "2018-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 China intensified its punitive campaign against Canada over the arrest of a top Chinese technology executive by arresting a second Canadian working here and announcing on Thursday that both men faced charges of undermining China\u2019s national security.China\u2019s foreign ministry confirmed the second arrest, a day after suggesting that the first involved a comparatively mild administrative matter involving the registration of a nongovernmental organization.The second case involves Michael Spavor, a writer and entrepreneur who operates a cultural organization that promotes trips into North Korea.Chrystia Freeland, Canada\u2019s foreign minister, disclosed the second case, and during a news conference in Ottawa on Wednesday she urged China to let the legal process unfold. She also warned the administration of President Trump not to further politicize what started as a legal matter involving accusations that Huawei had committed bank fraud.On Wednesday, the same spokesman suggested that Mr. Kovrig worked for an organization that had not been legally registered under a new law, but the latest statements suggested he faced far more serious criminal charges, complicating efforts to win his release, or Mr. Spavor\u2019s.Ms. Freeland said the Canadian government was deeply concerned about Mr. Kovrig, in particular, who had previously worked among the country\u2019s diplomatic corps.\u201cThe fact that he is an employee of my department means a lot of us know him and that adds another layer of concern,\u201d she said. \u201cWe care and we work and fight hard for every Canadian detained abroad.\u201dAlthough she did not identify him by name, Ms. Freeland said Mr. Spavor had reached out to Canadian officials \u201cbecause he was being asked questions by Chinese authorities.\u201d\u201cWe have not been able to make contact since he raised those concerns,\u201d she said.The opacity surrounding the two cases sharply contrasted with the public proceedings that unfolded over three days in a Vancouver courtroom after the arrest of Ms. Meng. After three days of court hearings, where she was represented by lawyers, Ms. Meng was released on bail Tuesday evening, pending further deliberations on whether she should be extradited to the United States.Hugh Pope, the director for communications and outreach for the International Crisis Group, said the organization was surprised and concerned by the accusations against Mr. Kovrig, who since February 2017 worked for the organization from Hong Kong.\u201cMichael regularly visits Beijing to meet officials, to attend conferences at the invitation of Chinese organizations, and on personal visits,\u201d Mr. Pope wrote in a note from Brussels. \u201cHe frequently appears on Chinese television and other media to comment on regional issues.\u201dMr. Lu, at Thursday\u2019s foreign ministry briefing, said that the authorities had notified Canada of both arrests and that \u201cthe legitimate rights and interests of the two Canadians are safeguarded now.\u201dMs. Freeland, however, indicated that Canada was still trying to learn the fate of the two, suggesting neither had been visited by Canadian diplomats. Mr. Pope also said the organization had not been able to learn about Mr. Kovrig\u2019s whereabouts or the reasons for his arrest.Neither Mr. Lu nor other officials offered much pretense that the arrests were not linked to Ms. Meng\u2019s fate in Vancouver. Since she was detained on a layover in Vancouver, British Columbia, officials and the state news media had explicitly warned Canada of retaliatory steps if it did not release Ms. Meng immediately.Her release on bail appeared to have done little so far to defuse the tensions.Ms. Freeland said that Chinese officials, apparently in diplomatic contacts with their counterparts, had not framed Mr. Kovrig\u2019s arrest as a \u201creprisal.\u201d\u201cIt is important to stress that,\u201d she said, adding that relations between Canada and China were important for Canada.Ms. Freeland also appeared to take Mr. Trump to task for his suggestion, in an interview with Reuters, that he would willingly intervene in Ms. Meng\u2019s case if it would help resolve the trade disputes that have soured relations over the last year.\u201cOur extradition partners should not seek to politicize the extradition process or use it for ends other than the pursuit of justice,\u201d she said. She said she had spoken to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the case earlier in the week, and had stressed that Canada was a \u201crule of law country.\u201dShe added that it was up to Ms. Meng\u2019s lawyers whether they decided to choose to raise the comments as part of their effort to block extradition. Then it would be up to the Canadian judicial process to weigh the significance of Ms. Meng\u2019s lawyers\u2019 defense.Citing comments by Canada\u2019s Ministry of Justice, she said that if the Canadian courts decided that the legal threshold for extradition was met, then the Canadian attorney general would make the decision on whether Canada should proceed.Steven Lee Myers reported from Beijing, and Dan Bilefsky from Montreal.

Our three favorite books inspire but don\u2019t intimidate. A good cookbook is one in which a handful of recipes excite you. You dog-ear a few pages and slide the book onto your shelf. Maybe you\u2019ll return to it later, and maybe you won\u2019t. (You probably won\u2019t.) A great cookbook, on the other hand, practically shimmers with possibilities. You begin to dog-ear the pages, but stop halfway through because what\u2019s the point of doing that to an entire book? You go directly to the kitchen and bake.The three best baking cookbooks published this year land squarely in the latter camp.

The crust was flaky and tender, even on the bottom.One of my favorites is her salted dark chocolate layer cake with milk chocolate ganache. It sounds fancy, but it\u2019s a shockingly simple two-bowl affair that skips combining the wet and dry ingredients first \u2014 you just dump everything into a bowl and stir. I was dubious, but it yielded a tender, sophisticated cake that I know I\u2019ll make over and over again. Her caramel popcorn, salted almond and malt cookies were another surprise hit.

The soundtrack continues inside, where the main dining room (there is also a private dining room, called the game room) is dominated by a 32-foot hearth and grill on which the majority of the menu is cooked over open flames.What casual means here is an \u00e0 la carte menu, \u201cHip to Be Square\u201d on the loudspeakers, wood-paneled walls bedecked with the disembodied heads of wild animals, heated toilet seats in the bathroom, private-batch caviar sourced from Sacramento, and $3 butter that has been house-cultured for two weeks from the milk of local cows, including some of Mr. Skenes\u2019s own.On the evening I ate at Angler, both food and service did indeed hover in the vicinity of perfection.

The strongest objection relates to the ways in which rejecting physical currency plays out as a bias toward the poor, advancing segregation in retail environments.According to government data, close to 7 percent of American households have no one in them with a checking or savings account, while an additional 19 percent are considered \u201cunderbanked,\u201d meaning that they rely on products or services outside the conventional financial system. These include money orders and payday and pawnshop loans. The majority of people who fall into these categories are nonwhite.\u201cIt is bad enough that the poor are already so stigmatized, and now we are stigmatizing them even further for the way they consume goods and services,\u201d Mr. Torres told me. \u201cI talk a lot about effective discrimination. But this amounts to intentional discrimination, because these businesses that don\u2019t accept cash know exactly who they are keeping out.\u201dProspect Street in Brooklyn, the heart of a recently manufactured neighborhood known as Dumbo Heights, is as good a place as any to observe the pretenses and contradictions of contemporary capitalism. A stretch of formerly industrial buildings, owned in part by the Kushner Companies, houses the corporate offices of Etsy, the tech-enabled craft empire, and an outpost of WeWork, where the kegs are flowing and the toil of office life has been reimagined as a party.WorkOf, a store absorbing the surrounding mood and showcasing handmade furniture and vases and key chains and lighting fixtures, all from independent designers does not, it turns out, extend its branding in intimacy to accepting cash.Neither does Bluestone Lane, with its live performances and hygge feel and turmeric sweet-potato-hummus toast, or the place next door, Mulberry & Vine, another health-food franchise. Here the motto is \u201cLive Dirty, Eat Clean,\u2019\u2019 which seems to sum up rather efficiently the prevailing ethics of the current moment: \u201cPlunder and pillage all you want, just stay away from trans fats and farm-raised salmon.\u201dWhen I visited the outpost in Brooklyn the other day, everyone behind the counter was black and everyone in front of it was white. But presumably, eating there would help make the world a better place because my fork would be recycled and the charred avocado I had eaten was dressed with non-GMO canola oil.The increasing movement away from cash, which businesses often justify as a defense against crime, even if urban crime rates in many cities are at historic lows, comes with other consequences, many of them negative.It is easier to spend more than you intend when you are paying for your lunch with a credit card, to get the fizzy grapefruit drink when, really, you\u2019d be fine with water. When cash is renounced you carry less of it, or maybe even none of it. And so you are not as prone to certain spontaneous acts of generosity \u2014 to put a few dollars in a tip jar where workers are underpaid or give money to a homeless person on a cold night on your way home from work.Forcing people to use credit cards also forces them into compromising their privacy while paradoxically making everyday exchanges feel more impersonal. Businesses see this as efficiency, and efficiency is profit. And as the recent revelations from Facebook suggest, what else matters?Advertisement"}

Almost every day of the week, the late-night indignation machine seizes on some new comment from Trump, then feeds its interpretations back into a news cycle that Trump himself \u2014 a devoted TV watcher \u2014 consumes.The ouroboros effect is real.The president\u2019s off-the-cuff, often-vitriolic Twitter feed is the hosts\u2019 most consistent source of comic material. In January, Trump seemed to contradict himself with a series of tweets about the Russia investigation, then capped one message with, \u201cGet smart!\u201d It was perfect bait for Colbert.The line between reportage and entertainment has blurred over the past two years. Viewers of John Oliver\u2019s \u201cLast Week Tonight\u201d on Sundays know that he often gets deep into the policy weeds. (Best of Late Night covers only weekday shows.) For late-nights hosts broadcasting every night, it can be hard to match that amount of research.But Samantha Bee broadcasts only on Wednesdays, and usually includes at least one lengthy investigative segment in each show.Colbert, Seth Meyers, Trevor Noah and Jimmy Fallon have all mastered the art of the Trump impression: grimacing, sandy-voiced and full of jerky hand gestures.Jimmy Fallon has caught flak for his reluctance to hammer the president on substantive issues, and it\u2019s true that he treats Trump in a way that reflects how late-night hosts used to deal with past presidents: He portrays Trump as quirky and confused, but rarely expresses real consternation. Fallon\u2019s funniest moments often come when he impersonates Trump. On Halloween, he played the president as a tanning-addicted Dracula.Some hosts never perfected a Trump impersonation. Instead, Jimmy Kimmel and Samantha Bee in particular often use a different tactic: the un-joke. Without relying on parody, it can be hard to find a way to make humor out of Trump\u2019s unorthodox conduct. So they just go slack-jawed, and enact the amazement that many viewers feel.Some of the best laughs of the year came from timely jokes that had nothing to do with Trump. These now feel like a vintage commodity, nearly lost in an era after Jay Leno and David Letterman.Advertisement"}

Second, the United States and the world will continue to rely on affordable and abundant fossil fuels, including coal, to power our economies for decades to come. And third, innovation, not new taxes or punishing global agreements, is the ultimate solution.People across the world are rejecting the idea that carbon taxes and raising the cost of energy is the answer to lowering emissions. In France, the government just suspended a planned fuel tax increase after some of its citizens took to the streets in protest. And in the United States, the results of November elections showed that these plans and other government interventions are just as unpopular. Voters in Washington State rejected the creation of an expensive tax on carbon emissions. In Colorado, a ballot measure to severely restrict drilling was defeated. And in Arizona, voters rejected a mandate to make the state\u2019s utilities much more dependent on renewable energy by 2030 \u2014 regardless of the cost to consumers. All three of these states elected liberal Democrats to Congress on election night. The nation is leading the way not because of punishing regulations, restrictive laws or carbon taxes but because of innovation and advanced technology, especially in the energy sector.Making energy as clean as we can, as fast as we can, without raising costs to consumers will be accomplished through investment, invention and innovation.As chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, I am working across party lines to support the development of new technologies that will further decrease America\u2019s carbon emissions.Washington needs to make it simpler for innovators who are building state-of-the-art nuclear reactors.

The legislation will also simplify the process for building carbon dioxide pipelines, so that we can safely move the gas to where it is needed.In addition to being used for enhanced oil recovery, carbon has the potential to be repurposed in building materials, medical supplies and manufactured goods.Citizens around the world will continue to reject climate policies that cost them personally, either by direct taxation or by undermining the competitiveness of their own economies.

{"Headline": "In Britain, a Team Effort to Help Local News Survive", "Date": "2018-12-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 When Lucy Ashton quit The Sheffield Star in 2009 to have children and work in public relations, she had already seen other reporters steadily leaving the paper as circulation and advertising fell, and figured she\u2019d never see jobs being added again.Now she has returned, as part of a new initiative with a simple goal: to help news organizations cover local government.\u201cThat wasn\u2019t on the agenda,\u201d Ms. Ashton said. \u201cWithout a reporter at that meeting, we wouldn\u2019t have got that.\u201dIn an unusual effort to revive coverage of local government, smaller news publishers in Britain can get a share of the BBC\u2019s license fee, the annual charge paid by every household with a television that has sustained the BBC as local newsroom budgets have shrunk.The money, 8 million pounds a year (about $10.2 million), is used by local newspapers and news sites to pay the salaries of additional reporters, like Ms. Ashton.Publications across Britain can apply for the reporting positions, and so far about 90 percent of the 144 places have been filled. The reporters, who are expected to be experienced journalists, receive additional training from the BBC and are paid a minimum of \u00a322,000 each, a salary broadly comparable to other reporting positions at Britain\u2019s regional news organizations. The reporters are hired by the newspapers for an initial period of about two years.Matt Hancock, a member of Parliament and former minister for the government department responsible for media and culture, said he hoped the program would restore some vigor to the way local government was being covered.Fewer journalists were challenging statements by politicians, he said, and reporters who once covered public officials were now often working for them in public relations jobs.\u201cYou think, hold on, is that really how to have a vibrant democracy?\u201d Mr. Hancock said.The partnership with the BBC has already yielded some significant stories. Among them are these:Stories like these are helping to remind readers about areas that aren\u2019t always being covered, said Jeremy Clifford, editor in chief of Johnston Press, a chain of newspapers that includes The Sheffield Star.\u201cIt\u2019s a really important investment in the lifeblood, our way of life,\u201d Mr. Clifford said.In return for the financing, newspapers cannot use the new positions as an opportunity to cut newsroom staffs, and must assign the reporters to cover local government beats. The BBC and dozens of media organizations are allowed to republish the articles, creating a kind of wire service for local news.For the BBC, the arrangement also serves as a counter to critics in Parliament who say that it can crowd out commercial companies. Some have even argued that the TV license fee should be scrapped.There are no strict benchmarks to determine whether the project has been a success. But organizers at the BBC and the News Media Association said they would measure how the stories were shared, how often they were picked up by other news outlets and whether attendance at meetings was affected by the presence of a reporter.Some officials were taken aback to see reporters at their meetings, said Calvin Robinson, one of the reporters. Others put on a performance when they know that a reporter is in the room, said Daniel Jaines, the other Local News Partnership reporter at the website. \u201cIf there\u2019s a reporter there, they\u2019re a lot more shouty,\u201d he said.The partnership with the BBC will be no more than a Band-Aid over a gaping wound, said Roy Greenslade, a former editor and honorary visiting professor of journalism at City, University of London. \u201cThese companies are gradually going out of business because their business model is wrecked, totally and utterly wrecked.\u201dMr. Ionescu said he had seen the traffic to his site driven by Facebook slow, and advertising money increasingly spent on platforms like Google and Facebook rather than local online publishers.He isn\u2019t sure there is much more that can be done to stave off the growing power of huge technology companies.\u201cI don\u2019t see what more they could do in order to tackle the advertising gap or the revenue gap,\u201d Mr. Ionescu said. \u201cThe publishers who create everything, they just get the scraps.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But after 10 years of documenting the migration flow toward and within Europe, Mr. Rorandelli, a member of the TerraProject photography collective, says he didn\u2019t set out to chase a live story.If anything, the Evros story is part of a broader, international narrative \u2014 about migration driven by desperation and the world\u2019s continuous hostility to those seeking a better life for themselves and their families. Europe is not alone in its inability to handle migration, as the United States has militarized the southern border, tear-gassed families seeking asylum and deflected responsibility for the death of a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl, Jakelin Caal Maquin, who died recently in United States custody.\u201cThe more I get involved with the issue,\u201d Mr. Rorandelli said, \u201cthe more I realize that the narrative has to be thorough and not skimming the surface.

He was 75.The cause was kidney failure, his partner, Jennifer Kitzer, said. He had been incapacitated since having a stroke in 2001.Bleecker Bob\u2019s was immortalized in a 1993 episode of \u201cSeinfeld\u201d (when Kramer and Newman fail to make a windfall selling used records there), in the opening credits of \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d and in Colson Whitehead\u2019s 2009 novel, \u201cSag Harbor.\u201d It was also where a customer named Patti Smith met a record salesman named Lenny Kaye more than 40 years ago and invited him to accompany her on guitar at a poetry reading.

And although it originally specialized in oldies, it soon switched its focus to the cutting edge, helping to popularize emerging musicians by sales and by word of mouth.Customers emerged from local clubs and coffeehouses and lingered in the store until 3 a.m., or as long as the mercurial Mr. Plotnik would indulge them.\u201cI used to cut school and hang out in his store until he threw me out and banned me,\u201d Harley Flanagan, a founder of the band the Cro-Mags, wrote on Facebook. \u201cI remember being mad at him for a long time because of it, but the truth is he just felt that I should be in school and not cutting school. As I got older I realized he was actually a really good guy when he wasn\u2019t screaming at people and kicking them out of his store.\u201dRobert Edward Plotnik was born on Aug. 28, 1943, in Baltimore and raised in New Jersey. His father, Jack, was a cabdriver. His mother, Elsie (Robinson) Plotnik, was a homemaker. In addition to Ms. Kitzer, he is survived by a daughter, Alexandra Plotnik.After earning a degree from New York University, Mr. Plotnik, fulfilling a promise to his parents, graduated from Fordham University School of Law and practiced law for a while. But in 1967 he ventured into the record business with Mr. Trommers, a fellow customer at Times Square Records. Mr. Trommers was known as Broadway Al, and he suggested that his new partner adopt a nickname of his own when they opened Village Oldies at 149 Bleecker Street.What became Bleecker Bob\u2019s Golden Oldies later moved to Macdougal Street and then, in 1981, after Mr. Trommers left the business, to 118 West Third Street, the former home of the popular 1960s nightclub the Night Owl Cafe.Sandwiched between a pizzeria and a walk-in psychic, the store had an inventory that included thousands of albums and singles jammed into countertop compartments, as well as posters and other memorabilia and a collection of clocks. It also had creaky wooden floors and an antediluvian cash register, suggesting that the merchandise was not the only thing stuck in the 1960s. Not Mr. Plotnik, though.Mr. Flanagan said that Mr. Plotnik \u201calways knew what was new and current before the other stores did,\u201d and that he \u201calways supported local bands by buying our records and merchandise directly from us.\u201dMr. Plotnik befriended stars like David Bowie, Bob Dylan and Frank Zappa, as well as rising stars like Madonna, Prince and members of the Clash, who gravitated to the store when they were starting out.\u201cBob,\u201d Ms. Kitzer said in the documentary, \u201cwas a little more famous than they were.\u201dMr. Kaye, who pieced together \u201cNuggets,\u201d his acclaimed 1972 compilation of garage-rock singles, while he worked at Bleecker Bob\u2019s, said in an email: \u201cBob\u2019s was more than a record store. It was an important gathering place to introduce and hear the new and progressive as well as honoring the past, how music lives on to influence and discover its new forms.\u201dIn the mid-1980s, Mr. Plotnik opened a branch of the store on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles, which is where he was when he suffered his stroke in 2001. (He also frequently flew to London in search of new releases.)

{"Headline": "Staying Catholic at Christmas", "Date": "2018-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Gospel reading for the scandal in the church.Opinion ColumnistAt Mass this Christmas Eve, many Catholics who have spent a year reading headlines about abusive priests, indifferent bishops, predatory cardinals and Vatican corruption will sit and hear the long roll of Jesus\u2019s ancestors with which the Gospel of Matthew begins.\u201cUnless you like stats / just skip the begats,\u201d wrote Jeanne and William Steig in their \u201cOld Testament Made Easy.\u201d But before he gets to the angels and the wise men Matthew gives us 39 of them, from the famous names (\u201cAbraham begat Isaac \u2026 David begat Solomon\u201d) to the rather more esoteric, like Jechoniah, the father of Shealtiel.If you only know the Bible vaguely, this litany of names probably sounds a bit pompous, an attempt to elevate the infant Jesus by linking him to great patriarchs and noble kings. But the truth is roughly the opposite: The more you know about Genesis or Chronicles or Kings, the more remarkable it is that Matthew announced the birth of the son of God by linking him to a pack of egregious sinners.Take a line like \u201cJudah begat Perez and Zerah of Tamar.\u201d Just a typical nuclear family, right? Here\u2019s McCabe with the real story: \u201cJudah slept \u2026 by mistake, with his daughter-in-law Tamar: She had cheated him by disguising herself and dressing up as a prostitute \u2026 [When] Judah heard that his daughter-in-law had prostituted herself and become pregnant, he ordered her to be burnt alive. He was disconcerted when he discovered that he himself had been the client and that the child, Perez, was his.\u201dOr again: \u201cDavid begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Uriah.\u201d That \u201cher,\u201d of course, is Bathsheba, upon whom David spied while she bathed and then contrived to marry by murdering her husband; the result of this wickedness was the future King Solomon, \u201cthe next in the line of succession,\u201d McCabe notes dryly, \u201ctoward Christ our savior.\u201dAnd David was Israel\u2019s greatest king; the line that follows him in Matthew includes a few decent men but also a collection of tyrants, child-murderers and worse, none of them remotely pious and many actively at war with the prophets sent by God.If you don\u2019t find that message credible, well, I understand. But if you find it strangely compelling, then you\u2019re close to the case for remaining Catholic at a time when the corruption of the church is driving a number of very public defections from the faith.For American Catholics at least, this era feels understandably like another death \u2014 in which the saints seem hidden, the would-be prophets don\u2019t agree with one another, the reformers keep losing. And it is all-too-understandable that people would choose to leave a dying church.But it is the season\u2019s promise, and in the long run its testable hypothesis, that those who stay and pray and fight will see it improbably reborn.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Macron\u2019s Moment of Truth", "Date": "2018-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWeeks of violent protest by France\u2019s angry working poor are testing a president who promised the people reform but has failed to govern with them, rather than over them. Ms. Kauffmann is the editorial director of Le Monde.PARIS \u2014 He was the savior of Europe. A 39-year-old maverick who rescued France from the populist tide, the newcomer who crushed his far-right opponent Marine Le Pen in a TV debate on the eve of a presidential election. The leader who would make liberal democracy great again. The visionary who had a plan to jump start the European Union. A 21st-century John Kennedy. Some joked that he could walk on water.That was 2017. Eighteen months into his presidential term, Emmanuel Macron, faced with an uprising by a leaderless army of working poor in yellow vests and by violence unseen since the student riots of May 1968, is struggling to take back control of his country. The charismatic young president was jeered by protesters who tried to chase his car this week when he visited a public building set afire by rioters in Le Puy-en-Velay, in south-central France. \u201cMacron, d\u00e9mission\u201d \u2014 \u201cMacron, resign\u201d \u2014 has become the rallying cry of these modern-day sans-culottes, whose anger is directed at him, personally.In a rare show of humility, Mr. Macron admitted a month ago that he had \u201cfailed to reconcile the people with its leaders.\u201d Little did he suspect that the anger would turn into hatred, of the kind thrown in the face of dictators by the Arab Spring. As a fourth Saturday of protests looms, in spite of an olive branch offered by the government, nobody can predict whether this revolt will eventually give way to dialogue or degenerate into an even more profound and dangerous crisis.What went wrong? Two sets of factors have come into play. One is not specific to France: an insurrectional wave that is now a familiar feature of Western democracies shaken by the disruptions of globalization, the aftermath of the 2008 economic crisis and the inability of our traditional political parties to adjust to these new challenges. Brexit, Donald Trump\u2019s election, an emergence of the far right in Germany and a victory of anti-system parties in Italy \u2014 all, though less violent, are part of the same dynamics. Emmanuel Macron was initially seen as a bulwark against this trend. More determined than his predecessors, he would reform France with a progressive agenda that would do away with the injustices of the old world.Unfortunately, nobody can \u2014 not even him. His vertical way of exercising power \u2014 some call it Jupiterian, others monarchical \u2014 became more and more of a problem: his being surrounded by a small team of technocrats; the contempt he seemed to hold for people not lucky enough to be as successful as he was; his lack of knowledge of the local political terrain because he had never been elected before. The combination left people feeling that their president was out of touch. His tax policy made him \u201cthe president of the wealthy.\u201d He ignored his falling approval rates; he had set his course. When Fareed Zakaria of CNN asked him on Nov. 10 whether he would have to slow down his reforms, he defiantly answered, \u201cI have been elected for five years and I have no midterms.\u201dThe Yellow Vests have become President Macron\u2019s midterms, only more brutal. He has been so busy that he forgot to create a new political force to support his agenda. That has left him vulnerable, because his party\u2019s Parliament members, elected a few weeks after him, are as inexperienced in politics as he is.So what if President Macron fails? This is not an easy question. In the uncharted environment created by the collapse of the old French political balances, there is no obvious alternative, no opposition leader prepared to win a snap election, no strong political parties. Whatever happens in the next few days, President Macron will not be able to govern as he did in his first year. \u201cOne cannot govern against the people,\u201d his political ally Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou sternly warned him last week.Most likely, his reform agenda will need a pause. The hard work still to be done \u2014 the reforms of the pension system, of the civil service, of local taxes, of political institutions \u2014 will have to wait or be watered down. Curbing public spending will be an even bigger challenge. The Yellow Vests are demanding fewer taxes and more public services. And the crucial equation between ecological transition and social justice will be even harder to solve.Such a scenario of France reverting to its old woes will do the European Union no good. With Germany absorbed for another year by its domestic political upheavals, the European agenda will be left unattended. This is a cruel dimension of Mr. Macron\u2019s travails: The only leader bold enough to articulate an attractive vision of a renewed European project, he was hung out to dry by those very leaders who had celebrated him. It is difficult to imagine how the pendulum can now swing back: The last bulwark against nationalism is gone. Donald Trump and Italy\u2019s Matteo Salvini may have the last laugh.Yet, if Emmanuel Macron survives this crisis, something good may come out of it. He, along with French and European elites, could draw the lesson from the revolt of the Yellow Vests and find a way to govern with the people, not against them. That is, after all, what democracy is about.Sylvie Kauffmann is the editorial director and a former editor in chief of Le Monde, and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Your Dog Has Seen Me Naked", "Date": "2018-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveI love Fido, but does he have to be on the bed while we have sex?Josie was first, a Chihuahua/Pomeranian mix and an emotional wreck. In her defense, she was often left alone for long periods of time and, well, anything that small is justified in its mania. When her owner finally did come home, Josie would yap incessantly until someone petted her. She was like a furry alarm clock. Ring, ring, ring, and then silence the moment you rolled over and laid a hand on her.That\u2019s all she wanted. One hand. You didn\u2019t even have to pet her. Any contact would do.I did not hate Josie. She wasn\u2019t mean or snobbish as some small dogs tend to be \u2014 just in a constant fight for attention. And in that fight, neither of us was doing very well.The chemistry between her owner and me was less a firework and more an old lighter that works every sixth flick, but that didn\u2019t stop us from entering into a lazy singles agreement to end up at each other\u2019s apartments a couple nights a week.The first time we slept together, things went smoothly with one exception: Josie wouldn\u2019t stop barking. So her owner reached down, plucked her up and sat her on the bed, where she became more uncomfortable as she realized what was happening. By the end, she had gone silent, peeking over a pillow every few minutes to see if we had finished.I barely noticed her that first time. My attention was elsewhere, and having her on the bed seemed preferable to her soundtrack of high-pitched yapping. But when it happened a second, third and eighth time, Josie grew harder to ignore. I imagined things from her perspective, especially in those horrifying moments when we made eye contact.I may not have minded as much if she was simply in the room. But on the bed? That felt too close. Plus, Josie was too small to get down on her own so it was somewhat of a hostage situation.One night, as Josie\u2019s owner and I were switching positions, I accidentally kicked her off the mattress; I looked over my shoulder in horror to see a nose and two tiny paws fall out of sight. I was mortified. Her owner looked over and shrugged.\u201cIt\u2019s O.K.,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s real fluffy.\u201dAnd we went back at it.I could have suggested to Josie\u2019s owner that we take her off the bed or at the least put a tiny blindfold over her eyes, but I didn\u2019t want to further intrude on the intimate bond between pet and owner (a relationship stronger than the one we shared, after all). And I figured she knew Josie better than I did. Maybe that forsaken look in her eyes was, uh, normal?Two months in, the momentum started to slow between Josie\u2019s owner and me. Things ended as they so often do in this era, with an unanswered text. Josie wasn\u2019t the only one in the room with communication issues.The next couple months of solitude took some adjustment. The type of reliable hookup I had with Josie\u2019s owner was a rarity for me. Losing it was like having the restaurant around the corner go out of business. Now, on quiet nights when my relationship refrigerator was bare, I had to figure out something else or go to bed hungry \u2014 usually the latter.I was relieved when I met someone months later, and even more relieved when I met her dog, Rigatoni. Like Josie, he was part Chihuahua, but he had none of her emotional hangups. He was a good boy and he knew it. His strut had bounce. If I had an eighth of Rigatoni\u2019s confidence, I\u2019d be president tomorrow.His owner and I met on a dating app, and that\u2019s how she met Rigatoni too, on some sort of pet adoption app where you swiped yes or no on animals. Under normal circumstances, being virtually selected alongside a pet may have felt unsettling, but clearly she had great taste in dogs and it was flattering to be in such good company. Whatever quality caused her to swipe yes on Rigatoni, I hoped, was also visible in my profile.He chaperoned us on nearly every outing and I didn\u2019t mind a bit. He came along on one of our first dates, a trip to the beach, and guarded our towel while we swam. He nestled up to my chest afterward \u2014 all sandy and warm \u2014 and I was thrilled at his approval.We ended up back at her (tiny) place later and had only been kissing for a few seconds when she pulled back, gasped and said, \u201cYou\u2019re so weird!\u201dI was horrified until I realized she was talking not to me but to Rigatoni, who had suddenly appeared over my shoulder with a menacing look.That became the theme of our next few dates. We would be kissing and then I\u2019d hear, \u201cToni!\u201d and turn around to see her dog looking like he wanted to punch me in the nose.There was nowhere to hide; the apartment was too small. I would never suggest locking him in the bathroom; she would have sooner locked me in the bathroom. And I understood. He was special.When we moved from the couch to the bed, I was disappointed to learn he could jump up on his own. Rigatoni was an agile fellow and, unlike Josie, was not afraid to intervene. He would never bite, but he would try to grab me with his little T-rex arms and wrestle me away from his beloved master.\u201cYou\u2019re making everyone uncomfortable!\u201d she would shout as he had me by the ankle like a little Greco-Roman wrestler. You could see the conflict on his face, the push and pull between obedience and protection. Right when we thought we had successfully distracted him with a toy, he would leap onto the bed like a secret service agent and position himself between us.But even Rigatoni had his price \u2014 a meat-flavored bone \u2014 that could usually buy us 20 minutes. Afterward, he would leap back onto the bed and cast disapproving looks our way until he got sleepy.Rigatoni wasn\u2019t exactly an aphrodisiac, but his heart was in the right place. If someone was going to stop me from having sex, I was glad to know the effort came from virtuous intentions. It could have been worse. When my ex-girlfriend and I used to visit my childhood home, my family dog would run into the bathroom as if he were hunting truffles, snatch my used condoms from the trash, and then drop them in the most heavily trafficked area of our house.Courtship has never been easy for me. I have found the process to be high-risk and emotionally exhausting. It hasn\u2019t helped that nature itself seems committed to my celibacy. Lately, my sex life has felt like a reverse Snow White scenario; I\u2019m scared I\u2019ll unbutton my pants and every woodland creature within a 5-mile radius will come crashing through the window, clutching awkward middle school photos of me in their paws and talons.Whenever I meet a woman, I can\u2019t help but wonder what creature waits in her apartment, eager to make our encounter more awkward for me than it already feels.I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about a date I went on with a woman between Josie and Rigatoni. We had talked for hours, gone from one bar to another and watched the sunset over a pair of Moscow mules. We laughed. She snorted. I found myself listening to her instead of scrambling to think of a new topic to keep the conversation going. The hamster wheel of my mind actually stopped spinning, and when that happens I get excited because it signals something more serious is on the horizon.I really wanted to see her again.But she had to leave town for a couple of weeks. When she got back, I tried to set up another date, but something had changed. Or maybe it was never there. Either way, she read my final text but didn\u2019t reply, and that hurt.She had a dog, too: Bubba. In pictures, he was a tank. Shoulders like a linebacker and jaws like a bear trap. Bubba lived in a house, not a studio apartment, but I doubt that would have mattered. He looked like he could run through a brick wall like the Kool-Aid Man.Maybe I got off lucky with Bubba\u2019s owner. After all, she had the power to hurt me, and she did. Just imagine the damage he could have done.Advertisement"}

Rule of law depends not just on what is written down, but also on the behavior of those who interpret and enforce that rule.If these people don\u2019t regard themselves as servants of the law first, partisans second, if they won\u2019t subordinate their political goals to their duty to preserve the system, laws become meaningless and only power matters.And what we\u2019re seeing in America \u2014 what we\u2019ve actually been seeing for years, although much of the news media and political establishment has refused to acknowledge it \u2014 is an invasion of our institutions by right-wing partisans whose loyalty is to party, not principle. This invasion is corroding the Republic, and the corrosion is already very far advanced.Republicans have been stuffing the courts with such people for decades; O\u2019Connor was appointed by George W. Bush. That\u2019s why his ruling, no matter how bad the legal reasoning, wasn\u2019t a big surprise. The only question was whether he would imagine himself able to get away with such a travesty. Obviously he did, and he may well have been right.But as I said, it\u2019s not just the courts. Even as Trump and his allies spin fantasies about sabotage by the \u201cdeep state,\u201d the reality is that a growing number of positions in government agencies are being occupied by right-wing partisans who care nothing, or actively oppose, their agencies\u2019 missions. The Environmental Protection Agency is now run by people who don\u2019t want to protect the environment, Health and Human Services by people who want to deny Americans health care.The same takeover by apparatchiks is taking place in politics. Remember when the role of the Senate was supposed to be to \u201cadvise and consent\u201d? Under Republican control it\u2019s just plain consent \u2014 there is almost literally nothing Trump can do, up to and including clear evidence of corruption and criminality, that will induce senators from his party to exercise any kind of oversight.So how do people who think and behave this way respond when the public rejects their agenda? They attempt to use their power to overrule the democratic process. When Democrats threaten to win elections, they rig the voting process, as they did in Georgia. When Democrats win despite election rigging, they strip the offices Democrats win of power, as they did in Wisconsin. When Democratic policies prevail despite all of that, they use apparatchik-stuffed courts to strike down legislation on the flimsiest of grounds.As David Frum, the author of \u201cTrumpocracy,\u201d warned a year ago: \u201cIf conservatives become convinced that they cannot win democratically, they will not abandon conservatism. They will reject democracy.\u201d That\u2019s happening as we speak.So Pelosi was right about Reed O\u2019Connor\u2019s ruling being a symptom of a \u201cmonstrous endgame,\u201d but the game in question isn\u2019t just about perpetuating the assault on health care, it\u2019s about assaulting democracy in general. And the current state of the endgame is probably just the beginning; the worst, I fear, is yet to come.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Story of 2018 Was Climate Change", "Date": "2018-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFuture generations may ask why we were distracted by lesser matters.Opinion ColumnistOur best hope may be the weather.For a long time, many people thought that it was a mistake to use the weather as evidence of climate change. Weather patterns contain a lot of randomness. Even as the earth warms and extreme weather becomes more common, some years are colder and calmer than others. If you argue that climate change is causing some weather trend, a climate denier may respond by making grand claims about a recent snowfall. And yet the weather still has one big advantage over every other argument about the urgency of climate change: We experience the weather. We see it and feel it.I wanted to write my last column of 2018 about the climate as a kind of plea: Amid everything else going on, don\u2019t lose sight of the most important story of the year.I know there was a lot of competition for that title, including some more obvious contenders, like President Trump and Robert Mueller. But nothing else measures up to the rising toll and enormous dangers of climate change. I worry that our children and grandchildren will one day ask us, bitterly, why we spent so much time distracted by lesser matters.The story of climate change in 2018 was complicated \u2014 overwhelmingly bad, yet with two reasons for hope. The bad and the good were connected, too: Thanks to the changing weather, more Americans seem to be waking up to the problem.From year to year, the number of serious hurricanes fluctuates. But the last few decades show a clear and disturbing trend.5Annual Category 4 and Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes4Number each year320-yearmovingaverage21019501960197019801990200020105Annual Category 4 and Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes4Number each year20-yearmovingaverage3210\u201950\u201960\u201970\u201980\u201990\u201900\u201910By The New York Times | Source: National Hurricane Center; data on hurricanes is considered most reliable since geostationary satellites began tracking them in the 1970s.I often want to ask these officials: Deep down, do you really believe that future generations of your own family will be immune from climate change\u2019s damage? Or have you chosen not to think very much about them?The second reason for hope is public opinion. No, it isn\u2019t changing nearly as rapidly as I wish. Yet it is changing, and the weather seems to be a factor. The growing number of extreme events \u2014 wildfires, storms, floods and so on \u2014 are hard to ignore.The politics of climate change remains devilishly hard, especially because so many people around the world feel frustrated about their living standards. France\u2019s \u201cgilet jaune\u201d protests, after all, were sparked by a proposed energy tax. Compared with day-to-day life, the effects of climate change have long felt distant, almost theoretical.But now those effects are becoming real, and they are terrifying. To anyone who worries about making a case for climate action based on the weather, I would simply ask: Do you have a better idea?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Internet Church Isn\u2019t Really Church ", "Date": "2018-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byShowing up in person is exhausting, especially compared with live-streaming. But being together is the whole point. Ms. Turner is a writer. When I walk into services on Sunday morning, I\u2019m usually about 30 minutes late. Our 6-month-old wakes up from his morning nap at 10, right when the first chords of a hymn begin to be played in our San Francisco church. My husband and I rush to get the baby dressed, fed and in the car. We drop him off at the nursery 20 minutes after all the other kids have settled in, kiss him goodbye, walk upstairs and find our seats just around the time the sermon is beginning.Not all online church is so flashy \u2014 many congregations simply stream their services for those who just can\u2019t make it in. For many churchgoers, consuming church the way we consume the news is more convenient, and more in line with our lifestyles than the old-fashioned Sunday morning visit.And yet, church calls. Going to church \u2014 sitting in a room with other people for an hour and a half on Sundays \u2014 is nonnegotiable for me, unless I\u2019m out of town. At the same time some people find themselves at brunch with friends or catching up on Netflix in bed, I am in a padded, stackable chair at the Russian cultural center my church rents for our services, sitting under a disco ball and listening to a sermon about Jesus. Live-streaming church services is nothing new, and churches have been making and selling recordings of their sermons ever since the advent of cassette tapes. The intention behind live-streaming services \u2014 to make church, and its attendant benefits of community, prayer and worship, available to everyone with a smartphone \u2014 is a good one. But it presumes that God is primarily present to us one on one, as individuals, rather than as a community of believers. This is not what the Bible says. In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus says that \u201cwhere two or three are gathered in my name, I am there among them.\u201d This passage suggests the necessity of being part of a community in which we approach God, rather than doing it alone.In his letters to early Christian communities, the Apostle Paul describes the church as a body comprising different but equally necessary members. When the church at Corinth was bickering over the importance of different spiritual gifts, Paul wrote to remind them that \u201cthe body does not consist of one member but of many.\u201d He writes, \u201cThe eye cannot say to the hand, \u2018I have no need of you,\u2019 nor again the head to the feet, \u2018I have no need of you.\u2019\u201d Later, he says, \u201cIf one member suffers, all suffer together with it; if one member is honored, all rejoice together with it.\u201dTwo Christmases ago, my husband and I were dealing with our second miscarriage in three months. It was a time that was fraught with anxiety and debilitating sickness. There were so many Sundays when streaming a church service would have been preferable to getting out of bed, and there were Sundays when I couldn\u2019t get out of bed at all. As the holidays approach, I can already feel myself pulled in a dozen different directions. When will we buy the tree? What traditions should we institute for our new family of three? Have I gotten enough work done that I can take a few days off around Christmas? When can I pack for our visit to see family? Every moment seems full of things to do. But instead of wanting to put church on TV in the background while I wrap presents, I find myself pulled toward those stackable chairs, the Advent hymns, the communion bread and cup handed to me with the reminder that they are the body and blood of Christ. I want to hear the children sing off-key during the Lessons and Carols service, smell the musty air in the Russian Center, eat too many doughnuts in the common area with the people who are the church to me. This, then, is the beauty of the church: not that it is perfect or convenient or fits easily into my life but that without it, my life would be deficient. I could still believe in God without the church, could celebrate Christmas without it, or go once a year. But I don\u2019t believe I would truly be a Christian without the real, in-person, Sunday morning church.

{"Headline": "Pop in the Era of Distraction", "Date": "2018-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookIt was a miniature tour de force, and enough to get Whack noticed by the Grammys (which, with typical befuddlement, nominated an earlier, more conventional track, \u201cMumbo Jumbo,\u201d for best music video). In its deceptively casual ambition and ruthless brevity, \u201cWhack World\u201d had a brilliant strategy for combat in the attention economy: keep things short and visual.Because, really, who has time for music?Listeners have work, or school, or both, and work in the internet era has grown infinitely expandable past 9 to 5. Because so much music now arrives via streaming, controlled on a screen, music also has to share attention with everything else on that screen: texts, social media, videos, alerts, news feeds, games, searches, maps, maybe one more check on that work email. Perhaps some single-minded listeners can set all those distractions aside, but they\u2019re a minority.Musicians face countless distractions of their own. The internet shattered the old album cycle of studio seclusion (for audio recording, and then for audio plus video) followed by promotion and touring. That prospect seemed freeing at first, since music could appear when inspiration struck, in any grouping or length.Along came the unintended consequences. Without the routine expectation of, say, a 12-song album every two or three years, the internet looms as a giant, insatiable maw, constantly demanding more content with less payback. YouTube and streaming have made each song a click rather than a purchase \u2014 and not even a click with autoplay, prefab playlists and algorithmic \u201cdiscovery\u201d (which actually pushes toward more of the same niche) guiding the way. In that endless stream, the idea that a song is a thought-out, carefully distilled utterance was bound to erode.Add another factor: social media. The initial promise was increased connectivity, a way to reach and respond to fans quickly and candidly: no gatekeepers, no filters. But for most pop aspirants, the result has been the end of creative seclusion. There\u2019s pressure to keep offering new material, musical and nonmusical, making the promotional cycle as endless as the internet workday. Maybe it\u2019s a song snippet or a glimpse of a video shoot. Or maybe it\u2019s a Twitter feud, a media-ready screed on Facebook or a fashion experiment on Instagram.For the 21st-century pop figure, songs are part of the mix, but so are romances and breakups, professional rivalries and reconciliations and countless rumors and memes that might be generated by the stars themselves, their fans or their trolls. Which in turn feed back into the next round of songs.Perhaps, in a culture that\u2019s constantly staring at a small screen, music was bound to be pushed aside. Songs that become massive streaming hits often sound unfinished, a looped riff and a vocal with a few tweaks. They fit into playlists that go by unobtrusively as background music; they are the ticktock of a soundtrack to everyday life. But songs can also have a higher profile. They can astound us with timbres never heard before and rhythms that kick and shake; they can tell us things we weren\u2019t sure we knew.And there is an audience for them. As the perceived value of recorded music has dropped nearly to zero, people have been willing to pay more and more each year for live concerts \u2014 where the music is the main thing in the room, where distractions are minimized. According to figures from the concert-promotion magazine Pollstar, for the top 100 tours of 2018 alone, gross revenues worldwide were $5.6 billion and average ticket prices rose from $84.63 in 2017 to $93.65 this year. In North America, the leap was even greater, from $78.91 to $92.50. Music can still be a central, overwhelming experience. We just have to put away the phones.Advertisement"}

It also reduced the risk of malaria infection.More research remains to be done, experts said, but knowing that hydroxyurea \u2014 a cheap, effective and easy-to-take pill \u2014 can safely be given to African children may save millions of youngsters from agonizing pain and early deaths.\u201cI think this is going to be amazing,\u201d said Dr. Ifeyinwa Osunkwo, who directs a sickle-cell disease program in Charlotte, N.C., but was not involved in the new study. \u201cThere is currently no treatment in Africa, and a lot of children die before age 5,\u201d said Dr. Osunkwo, who has treated children in the United States and Nigeria. \u201cWe\u2019re going from nothing to gangbusters.\u201dAbout 300,000 babies are born with the disease each year; about 75 percent of them are in Africa, and about 1 percent in the United States. The condition is found throughout the Americas and the Caribbean among descendants of Africans brought to this hemisphere by the slave trade. Sickle-cell disease also is found less frequently in southern Europe, the Middle East and India.But children who inherit the gene from both parents are often left breathlessly weak from anemia, prone to infections and liable to have crises in which their blood cells clump and jam capillaries in the brain, lungs and other organs.The pain is often so excruciating that only opioids can help. Treatment may require blood transfusions or, in wealthy countries, bone marrow transplants, which themselves carry a risk of death.Without treatment, many children die from strokes or organ damage.The new study followed 600 children in Angola, Uganda, Kenya and the Democratic Republic of Congo who were given the drug for more than two years.As with children in wealthy countries, taking the drug daily also made it far less likely they would die or need a blood transfusion because of their sickle-cell disease. They were about half as likely to suffer bouts of severe pain, and somewhat less likely to get other infections.Hydroxyurea is already on the World Health Organization\u2019s essential medicines list, is available in generic form for about 50 cents a pill and can be stored at room temperature, Dr. Ware said. If this study raises interest in buying millions of additional doses for use in Africa, the drug could presumably be made far more cheaply, he added.Even though the study was fairly large, it had some limitations. It was intended to prove only that the drug was safe for children aged 1 to 10. It was not designed to test various dosages to find the ideal one, nor to determine how many lab tests are needed to monitor children taking the drug, nor to determine the long-term effects.So further work will be needed, researchers said.Also, the research was done without a placebo control \u2014 a group of similar children not getting the drug. Oversight boards in the four test countries felt it would be unethical to deny the drug to any child, since it was known to work elsewhere, said Dr. Leon Tshilolo, a pediatric hematologist at the Monkole Hospital Center in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo, and the study\u2019s lead author.To compensate for the lack of a placebo group, the researchers watched children for two months before starting them on hydroxyurea. That established the baseline rates at which the children normally suffered pain crises, needed blood transfusions and got malaria or other infections.The results \u201cmean survival will be better even in very low-resource settings,\u201d Dr. Tshilolo said. Hydroxyurea was originally developed to fight blood cancers like leukemia, and people taking it must be monitored to make sure that it does not dangerously lower their white blood cell and platelet counts. The study, however, used moderate daily doses, and only about 5 percent of the children enrolled needed to have their dosages lowered because their blood cell counts dropped.Dr. Osunkwo said she slowly overcame patients\u2019 reluctance by letting them help design the trials.\u201cAnd,\u201d she added, \u201cI would say, \u2018Being dead is worse than having dark nails.\u2019\u201dIn Africa, enrolling 600 children was relatively easy, Dr. Tshilolo said, because Africans with sickle-cell disease who had visited Europe had heard of hydroxyurea and knew it worked.Sperm counts were obviously not an issue in a children's trial, he added. But African men were usually willing to use the drug once it was explained that the drops in sperm count were relatively small and rebounded when the drug was stopped.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s \u201ca bit like going to the sauna \u2014 everyone is equal,\u201d said one from Finland.Supported byUNITED NATIONS \u2014 They meet in the predawn darkness outside Central Park, less than two miles from the United Nations, where many of them often encounter one another, exchanging knowing glances or a runner-to-runner handshake.Chugging through the dimly lit park on a 30-minute jog, they pass dog walkers, other runners and the occasional homeless person, stopping on a bridge midway through for a group photo and selfies.You might mistake them for tourists.But they are a group of ambassadors and other diplomats who call themselves the \u201cPRunners\u201d \u2014 named for the titles held by many as permanent representatives to the United Nations.On a recent morning, they convened in a frigid pre-winter chill. Many wore white team shirts embossed with \u201cPRunners\u201d and the hashtag #NoExcuses. The range of other attire reflected their varying tolerances for the cold.Richard Arbeiter, the deputy permanent representative of Canada, was hatless and wore shorts. Amal Mudallali, the permanent representative of Lebanon, wore long pants, a jacket, and a headband around her ears.When the Scandinavian diplomats exclaimed that the weather was great for running, Ivana Pajevic, the deputy permanent representative of Montenegro, responded: \u201cHa! Only if you\u2019re Nordic!\u201dThe group invited me, an editor on The New York Times\u2019s International desk who often covers the United Nations, to run with them. (I dressed for the cold: sweatpants, wool cap, hoodie and windbreaker, and managed not to be last.)The diplomats may not always agree on proper running attire or on everything in world affairs. But their weekly runs have bonded them in ways often missing in other gatherings of disparate United Nations diplomats \u2014 like the Security Council or Human Rights Council.\u201cFor me, the runners group is a bit like going to the sauna \u2014 everyone is equal,\u201d said Kai Sauer, Finland\u2019s permanent representative, who coordinates and often leads the runs. \u201cDiplomacy is very hierarchical, but we leave our titles at home when we enter Central Park. It\u2019s more about human than professional interaction.\u201dMr. Sauer, who has run seven marathons, said he never canceled the runs. And while many United Nations meetings have fuzzy start times, Mr. Sauer insists that everyone arrive promptly at 6:30 a.m. \u2014 \u201cno exceptions.\u201dStill, the group, which ranges in age from 40 to 60, applies the United Nations slogan \u201cNo One Left Behind\u201d in practice. \u201cIf necessary, I run with the slowest runner,\u201d Mr. Sauer said.It is \u201csimply a positive group,\u201d he added.Founded by the representatives of Finland and Liechtenstein a few summers ago, the group includes members from Albania, Algeria, Argentina, Austria, Bahrain, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Latvia, Lebanon, Mongolia, Montenegro, New Zealand, Norway, Palau, Portugal, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland and Tunisia.Diplomats from the United Nations Department of Public Information and the International Committee of the Red Cross have also joined.And the runners have sometimes invited family members or visiting dignitaries, like the foreign ministers of Germany, Lebanon and Liechtenstein and the deputy prime minister of Slovakia, to come along, making the event something of an international m\u00e9lange akin to a mini New York City Marathon.The former ambassador from Britain, Matthew Rycroft, and departing ambassador from Iran, Gholam-Ali Khoshroo, used to run with the group, although whether they ever talked about their political disagreements while huffing along together is unclear. (Their shared fondness of running had nothing to do with their departures, other members said.)A replacement for Mr. Khoshroo has not been announced yet. But the Britain-Iran running fellowship is not expected to resume anytime soon. Karen Pierce, Mr. Rycroft\u2019s successor, has made clear her disdain for the predawn tradition of donning jogging suits and sneakers.\u201cI will most certainly not be joining the group,\u201d she said when asked recently. \u201cI wear stilettos.\u201d\u201cI agree that we should have more women on board for running,\u201d Ms. Pajevic said.It is unclear whether Ambassador Nikki R. Haley of the United States, who has said she is leaving her post at year\u2019s end, ever considered joining the group. A spokesman for the American Mission to the United Nations declined to comment.The runners have not gone unnoticed by Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, but he has shown no inclination to participate.\u201cThe secretary general thinks this is a great way to keep ambassadors fit for marathon U.N. meetings,\u201d said his spokesman, St\u00e9phane Dujarric. \u201cHe will be cheering them on from the sidelines.\u201dWhile the banter on the runs may veer into politics or the day\u2019s meetings, it can also focus on aching joints and issues faced by working parents.Part of the reason for the predawn timing, some members said, is that they need to get home to shower and ready their children for school.Many live in the diplomatic residences that dot the East Side neighborhood adjoining Central Park, but some live as far away as Brooklyn and take the subway or a taxi to avoid violating Mr. Sauer\u2019s strictly enforced start-time deadline.The group has become known as one of the more tightly knit networks among the diplomats who periodically rotate through United Nations missions in New York. Several ambassadors besides Mr. Sauer are marathoners, and celebrate their running accomplishments with one another via social media and WhatsApp.Craig Hawke, the permanent representative of New Zealand, who ran his first New York City Marathon this year, called the Central Park jogs a welcome start to the day and \u201cincredibly cathartic.\u201dMs. Mudallali of Lebanon said she had learned about the group on Facebook while living in Washington, and wanted to join when she arrived last year as Lebanon\u2019s first female ambassador to the United Nations.Still, Ms. Mudallali said she did not share the passion of her northern-climate counterparts to run in the snow.\u201cI\u2019m from Lebanon,\u201d she said.The camaraderie was clear at a recent goodbye dinner held at Mr. Sauer\u2019s residence for the departing permanent representative from Denmark, Ib Petersen, one of the earliest members.Mr. Sauer even brought in a Finnish wildlife chef, Mika Manninen, to prepare the meal: salmon soup, eggplant lasagna and filet of beef. (Wild game like venison was unavailable, Mr. Manninen said.)After toasts around the table of generously poured shots of Finlandia vodka, Mr. Petersen led the envoys in a somewhat off-key rendition of the Beatles\u2019 \u201cWith a Little Help From My Friends.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "7 Standards for Your End-of-Year Donations", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFixesOften neglected, these considerations can guide you to increased confidence in your charitable choices. Ms. Martin is the author, most recently, of \u201cThe New Better Off: Reinventing the American Dream.\u201dShould you donate to global organizations that address the most immediate and basic needs for huge numbers of people? Or is it best to invest in your local community, where people are no doubt suffering from food and housing insecurity right under your nose? Should you give all of your money to one organization or spread out smaller gifts to more of them? How can you trust an organization to use your money wisely? And how much should you give?After about 15 years of weighing these questions each December, I still feel mightily confused about the right answers. Which leads me to believe two things: 1) There are no right answers, but there are important, and often neglected, considerations. And 2) We all need to rely on the wisdom of others. (Sounds like good rules for all of life, now that I think about it.)Drawn from interviews with a wide variety of experts, here are seven worthwhile considerations on end-of-year giving:Proximity matters.Many people with whom I spoke said the most critical factor in predicting whether a nonprofit will be successful in its aims is who leads the effort. Those who have experienced the problem that they are trying to solve have hard-earned insights into how to correct it. Further, those who are part of or deeply connected to the communities in which they work are much more likely to design strategies that deliver change. This isn\u2019t to say that a Harvard M.B.A. doesn\u2019t help, but being born and raised in the affected community may matter just as much, if not more. So as you look at organizations you might support, think about the variety and quality of expertise that the leader possesses. Or, as Pamela Shifman, executive director of the NoVo Foundation put it, \u201cLook for community-led organizations who dare to challenge the root causes of injustice \u2014 and are run by people from communities closest to the challenges. Investing in them, including women and especially women of color, is the single best way to contribute to lasting change.\u201dSometimes your social capital is worth as much as your actual capital.Think relationally, not transactionally.The most effective organizations aren\u2019t necessarily the ones with the most impressive websites.Obviously we are visual creatures. We spend much of our lives in a consumer-driven environment well designed to grab our attention and get our dollars. But when you are deciding where to give, try to shift out of consumer mode and into citizen mode. Many hard-working, dignity-restoring direct service organizations don\u2019t put much energy into their \u201cbrand.\u201d Or as Carrie Avery, the president of the Durfee Foundation, put it: \u201cMany groups don\u2019t have influential people on their board and staff and are so stretched doing their job of feeding people, housing refugees and domestic violence survivors, or producing transformative artwork, that they don\u2019t have the resources to connect with donors or produce a snappy website.\u201d In other words, don\u2019t conflate communications prowess with impact.Respond to urgency, but don\u2019t forget root causes.Joy and beauty are not luxuries.Give enough to feel some discomfort.The Hebrew word for charity is \u201ctzedakah,\u201d derived from a word meaning \u201cfairness.\u201d In Judaism, giving to the poor is not viewed as a magnanimous act; it is simply the poor\u2019s due. Similarly, in the Quran (51:19), believers in Islam are praised for giving a rightful share of their wealth to the deprived, an act called \u201csadaqah.\u201d And many Christians take Jesus Christ\u2019s teaching in Matthew 23:23 to heart: \u201cTithing must be done in conjunction with a deep concern for justice, mercy and faithfulness.\u201d That, it seems to me, should be an inspiration to us all \u2014 religious and secular alike. If the Americans making the least amount of money each year figure out how to share it, those of us with more should, too. Perhaps use your own discomfort as a barometer? If you aren\u2019t giving an amount that makes you feel a little freaked out, give a little more. That\u2019s not exactly an edict with biblical or Quranic eloquence, but it makes sense to me.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What It Really Means to Heal", "Date": "2018-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bydisabilityIt is brought about not only by restoring the body, but also by welcoming, accepting and embracing all others into belonging.Ms. Jones is a minister awaiting call in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.\u201cIf you had faith, you would be healed.\u201dThe words came from a stranger who came up to me at the mall, where I was going about my business on the scooter I use for mobility. He then asked to lay hands on me and pray.I can\u2019t remember a time when I wanted healing because of my disability. But I can quickly recall times when I wished our society was healed of its attitudes toward disability. If society were healed, people with disabilities could more easily find jobs and housing. We could go places on the subway and when we arrived, we could enter through the front door. We would be expected to participate in typical social and work activities. We could live our own lives making good or bad choices, just like everybody else.Little do these strangers know \u2014 I do have faith, and the wounds that they see actually bear witness to a miracle. If they only understood that my scars are reminders of prayers answered.There\u2019s a story in the New Testament, in the Gospel of Mark, about Jairus, one of the leaders of the synagogue who came to Jesus and fell at his feet and begged him repeatedly: \u201cMy little daughter is at the point of death. Come and lay your hands on her, so that she may be made well, and live.\u201dFor months an iron lung supported every breath I took, and when the electricity in the hospital failed, Dad would come to the hospital at all hours of the night to hand crank the machine keeping me alive. Dad never spoke about this. He had a humble, quiet faith, and I am the beneficiary of his pleading.Many of the stories of healing in the New Testament actually have nothing to do with the faith of the person who is healed and everything to do with those who have a relationship with that person. It was the faith of Jairus that was enough for Jesus to heal his daughter. It was the tenacity of the boundary-breaking Canaanite mother that led Jesus to heal her daughter. It was the sheer boldness of the four friends who cut a hole in the roof to set their paralyzed friend in front of Jesus to be healed. And sometimes it was Jesus wanting to make a point that was the catalyst for healing. In all these stories and more, the person who received healing usually had no say in the matter, no agency.In the New Testament, Jesus would often say before bringing about a physical healing, \u201cYour sins are forgiven.\u201d The first and most important healing was invisible.This happened to Bartimaeus, who was blind and sitting by the roadside begging. When he called out to Jesus, those around him told him to shut up and sit down, stay in your place. But Jesus called him to come near.When he approached, Jesus asked him, \u201cWhat do you want me to do for you?\u201d Jesus did not assume that Bartimaeus\u2019s lack of physical vision was the most important thing that needed to be restored.People often pray for healing without recognizing that what needs to be healed is the community around them, including themselves. But this sacred, mystical, invisible healing can happen in our communities. It is not brought about by restoring the ability to see or walk or sing on key, but being welcoming, accepting and embracing all others into belonging.A few years ago a member of the church congregation brought Beth, a friend with an intellectual disability, to church. Beth was new to church and was somewhat disruptive during the service. This community was accustomed to all sorts of interruptions, \u201cfree roaming\u201d toddlers and people wandering in with urgent needs. When Beth started coming, people were drawn to her, and a small group quickly formed to accompany her. Gradually she learned the rhythms of the church and the people who loved her. The community missed her when she didn\u2019t come. Beth had become part of the fabric of the community.When those around you understand that you, exactly as you are, are essential to all of creation in a way that we cannot understand, that without you creation would be incomplete \u2014 that is healing.Healing moves you through the turmoil, the regular assault on your being, to move past that which is preventing you from being all that you are meant to be, to knowing that you belong here. Your very existence is good and necessary.The person who approached me at the mall was seeing only the person in front of him. He was not seeing the bigger picture. Although it may not be obvious, my disability is a gift to a community and a vehicle to reach out to others who are struggling. Over the years my personal understanding of disability has opened a place, a path through their struggles, for many people by providing a new perspective.Perhaps our prayers for healing might be not for miraculous \u201ccures\u201d for individuals but for society at large to be more welcoming, inclusive and hospitable to everyone. Then instead of focusing on others\u2019 visible scars, we see all people as they are, with everything that has brought them to be present with us in this moment.Cyndi Jones is a minister awaiting call in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.

At least Black Friday is just about sales. So many people. So much disappointment.We don\u2019t have a proper name for the Day After here in the States, although it\u2019s definitely a good time to stay home if you can. It\u2019s a day for reflection, for eating leftovers, for taking stock of the year just past.For years I trusted this story, which only proves that there are some people who will believe anything, and I am one of them.The real origins of Boxing Day go back to feudal times, when workers on a lord\u2019s estate would ask, on this day, for a Christmas box, in exchange for good service throughout the year. Later, the tradition expanded to include the collection of alms for the poor.There are lots of songs that go with this revelry.

Stephen was the faith\u2019s first martyr, slain for suggesting, among other things, that God was not to be found in the temple, or in any dwelling made by human hands.As a Christian, I can promise you I fall short in lots of ways, especially in my consistent failure to treat other people with the love and grace they deserve. But on the issue of the temple, St. Stephen and I are of one mind. Most of the times that I\u2019ve experienced the eternal are times when I was not sitting in an actual church.Exactly 40 years ago, in fact, on St. Stephen\u2019s Day 1978, I was staring into a fire at a beach house in Atlantic City with some friends. As I sat there looking at the flames, I heard a voice as clear as a bell, speaking out of my own heart: How long, the voice inquired, do you intend to avoid becoming yourself?A little while longer, I thought.This year, on St. Stephen\u2019s Day, I\u2019m almost certain to find myself by a fire once again, looking into the flames, thinking about the road that lies ahead. My daughter, who spent the holidays in Maine with us, will be leaving that morning, stepping onboard an airplane bound for Australia, where she will be joining her fianc\u00e9\u2019s family, halfway around the world.

{"Headline": "Forget the Carbon Tax for Now", "Date": "2018-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s politically toxic. There are other ways to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Mr. Gillis is a former New York Times environmental reporter and a contributing opinion writer.With a bit of calm upon us, now would be a good time for those of us concerned about climate change to engage in some introspection.These tax proposals all spring from basic economic theory. If people and companies are abusing a public good \u2014 in this case, by dumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere \u2014 the answer, economists tell us, is to put a price on that activity that reflects the harm and encourages the development of more benign alternatives. Because most of the gases that cause climate change contain carbon in some form, the shorthand term for this policy is a \u201ccarbon price.\u201dYet the climate movement has, I fear, turned this potentially useful tool into a fetish. Discuss any aspect of the emissions problem these days and you will quickly hear somebody say, \u201cA price is the answer,\u201d or equivalent words. You hear that from the lips of politicians, from newspaper editorial boards, from utility executives and even from the heads of oil companies.Yet the put-a-price-on-it mantra is proving, in practice, to be a political failure. The Democrats could not get such a policy through Congress even when they had big majorities in the first two years of the Obama administration. Efforts to sell Republicans on the idea that this is the most market-friendly approach to the emissions problem have failed miserably, and will continue to fail.Proponents of carbon pricing like to point out that variants of the idea have spread all over the world, including to all the countries of the European Union and several American states and Canadian provinces. This is true, but when you look at how these systems have worked in practice, the picture grows murky. Invariably, huge political capital was spent to push through a carbon price too low to spur the rapid reductions in emissions that we need. Cases that are held up as demonstrating the purported success of carbon pricing, like a tax in British Columbia, mostly prove that if you slap on a modest carbon price, you will get a modest economic response. That people may get used to paying the low tax does not seem to make it much easier, in these jurisdictions, to raise the price to a level where it will really bite.The basic political problem is that the climate movement still does not have the strength of numbers to overcome entrenched opposition and put in the kind of stiff-and-rising taxes we would need to do the job. The oil companies may claim they want carbon pricing, but a subset of them spent more than $30 million in Washington State to kill the tax proposal there, twice as much money as the proponents were able to raise in support of their intelligent, carefully designed plan.Damn the oil companies if you will, but they persuaded 56 percent of the voters to take their side, carrying every county in the state but three. What that vote, and the French protests, tell us is that any proposal to raise energy prices is going to run into a buzz saw of opposition, including from working-class people who already feel like they are being mistreated.The political difficulties are not the only issue with carbon pricing, though. Even in theory, the idea is expected to work in some economic sectors but not in others, yet the fetishists hold it up as the magic answer to all problems.Here is more evidence that a carbon price is no magic bullet: One of the biggest climate problems is poorly constructed buildings that waste energy. A carbon price will not solve that problem, for the elementary reason that the people who put up the buildings, and have an economic motive to skimp on insulation and windows, are not the people who wind up paying the energy bills. The solution is building codes with strict energy requirements, vigorously enforced. Yet across huge swaths of the United States we still have weak building codes and lousy enforcement.To be clear, I am not arguing that a carbon price is unimportant. I would repeal none of the ones that have already passed, and I am in favor of passing new carbon prices everywhere that the politics seem aligned to make it possible. The activists in Washington State who pushed that proposal made a noble effort, and in a better world they would have won \u2014 not least because their plan was designed with the interests of the working class in mind.What I am saying is that we cannot argue for climate policy in a vacuum, ignoring the dangerous political moment we are in, when the anger of working people is being misappropriated by demagogues like Donald Trump and Marine Le Pen in France. We would be wise not to ratchet up that anger, as President Emmanuel Macron of France belatedly acknowledged when he yanked the proposed hike in fuel taxes.Any carbon tax that is put on the table needs to be designed with that in mind. Maybe the opening promise should be that every penny of the money will go to relieve the burden on the working class, perhaps by cutting payroll taxes and putting more cash into its pockets the day the carbon tax goes into effect. Some countries might be able to push that through, even if the United States cannot.In the final analysis, the economic theory is right, of course: We do need a price on carbon. Some of our most important goals, such as cutting emissions from heavy industries like steel mills and cement plants, are likely to be impossible to achieve without it.Maybe we need to use those techniques to convince people that emissions really can be cut without wrecking the economy or further impoverishing the working class. Then, having proved that, we would pull the big tool out last.An earlier version of this article misstated the number of counties in Washington State that voted for a carbon tax referendum in November. It was three, not two.Advertisement"}

Putin\u2019s, who owns the Internet Research Agency and its multiple corporate siblings.Americans might be infuriated by what Mr. Prigozhin\u2019s companies are doing, but they\u2019re doing it well.Here are major takeaways from the reports.The New Knowledge report finds that while \u201cother distinct ethnic and religious groups were the focus of one or two Facebook pages or Instagram accounts, the black community was targeted extensively with dozens.\u201dFacebook ads were targeted at users who had shown interest in black history, the Black Panther Party and Malcolm X. The most popular of the Russian Instagram accounts was @blackstagram, with 303,663 followers.On YouTube, the Russians played on police shootings of unarmed black men with channels with names like \u201cDon\u2019t Shoot\u201d and \u201cBlackToLive.\u201dWhile most media attention has focused on Facebook pages appealing to the political right, the Russian effort aimed at black Americans was actually larger, reaching almost as many people. Of 81 Facebook pages created by the Internet Research Agency, 30 targeted African-American audiences, amassing 1.2 million followers, the report finds. By comparison, 25 pages targeted the political right and drew 1.4 million followers.The N.A.A.C.P., a civil rights group, said that it would begin a weeklong protest starting Tuesday called #LogOutFaceook. The group said it would stay off Facebook and Instagram and asked its social media followers and the organizations with which it works to do the same.The N.A.A.C.P. said that the protest was \u201ca way to signify to Facebook that the data and privacy of its users of color matter more than its corporate interests\u201d and that its users should be protected from \u201cpropaganda and misinformation.\u201dThe group said it also had returned a recent donation from Facebook.One strand focused, once again, on African-American voters. \u201cThese campaigns pushed a message that the best way to advance the cause of the African-American community was to boycott the election,\u201d the Oxford report says. One bogus post declared: \u201cHILLARY RECEIVED $20,000 DONATION FROM KKK TOWARDS HER CAMPAIGN.\u201dThe Russian accounts urged people who had backed Bernie Sanders against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination to stay home or to vote for Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate, in the general election. The New Knowledge report also describes what it calls \u201cmalicious misdirection\u201d and \u201ctweets designed to create confusion about voting rules.\u201dMost of the early media coverage of the Russian campaign focused on Facebook. The New Knowledge report argues that the Internet Research Agency\u2019s presence on Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, has been underestimated and may have been as effective or even more effective than its Facebook effort. The report says there were 187 million engagements on Instagram \u2014 users \u201cliking\u201d or sharing the content created in Russia \u2014 compared with 76.5 million engagements on Facebook.\u201cOur assessment is that Instagram is likely to be a key battleground on an ongoing basis,\u201d the report concludes.Both reports note that there was hardly a social platform, however obscure, that the Internet Research Agency did not invade: Reddit, Google+, Vine, Gab, Meetup, Pinterest, Tumblr and more. The Russian trolls even created a podcast on SoundCloud.Russia had used similar online influence tactics inside Russian borders and in neighboring countries, including Estonia, Georgia and Ukraine. But the campaign against the United States in 2016 was historic on several counts: It was the first major foreign influence campaign aimed at affecting a presidential election; it was the biggest influence operation ever to be aimed at Americans from another country; and it was the biggest attack ever \u2014 using virtual, not physical weapons \u2014 on the United States by its old Cold War adversary, albeit slimmed down from the Soviet Union to Russia alone. It will be studied for years.Inevitably, some American political operatives are learning from Russia\u2019s example, testing the tools of chicanery in their online operations. So the Internet Research Agency may have taught a new generation of tricksters how to swing an election in the cyberage.Remarkably, no. The Russian trolls shift their tactics, swap corporate names and move to new buildings, but they don\u2019t stop. The Oxford group reports: \u201cThe highest peak of I.R.A. ad volume on Facebook is in April 2017 \u2014 the month of the Syrian missile strike, the use of the Mother of All Bombs on ISIS tunnels in eastern Afghanistan, and the release of the tax reform plan.\u201dThe pace was stepped up for Instagram posts in particular: 5,956 in 2017, more than double the 2,611 posts in 2016, according to the Oxford report. While they reacted slowly and reluctantly to the evidence of Russian manipulation, social media platforms have stepped up their efforts to block fraudulent activity. But the Russians often seem to be able to outmaneuver the watchdogs and stay online.\u201cOver the past five years, disinformation has evolved from a nuisance into high-stakes information war,\u201d the New Knowledge report concludes. American concerns about protecting free speech have made both the government and the platforms uneasy about acting decisively, it says.\u201cOur deeply felt national scruples about misidentifying a fake account or inadvertently silencing someone, however briefly,\u201d the report says, \u201ccreate a welcoming environment for malign groups who masquerade as Americans or who game algorithms.\u201dBoth reports suggest that the effort to understand everything that happened in 2016 \u2014 let alone figuring how to prevent a repeat \u2014 is far from finished.Advertisement"}

Germany Is Broken.", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe erosion of the country\u2019s postwar order has created a populace open to messages and movements previously banished to the fringes.Mr. Nachtwey is the author of \u201cGermany\u2019s Hidden Crisis: Social Decline in the Heart of Europe.\u201d But Ms. Merkel, for all her power and influence, is just one politician. Germany\u2019s new political crisis runs much deeper. It stems from an economic system that has resulted in stagnant wages and insecure jobs. The erosion of Germany\u2019s postwar settlement \u2014 a strong welfare state, full-time employment, the opportunity to move up in the world \u2014 has created a populace open to messages and movements previously banished to the fringes.But the system has come at a cost. To maintain their competitive advantage in the global market, companies held down wages. Though for skilled workers in the export-oriented manufacturing sector pay remained stable, or even rose, less-skilled and low-wage workers suffered. This was made possible by decentralizing collective bargaining in the 1990s, which greatly weakened the power of unions.The other, more alarming reason underlying the country\u2019s political crisis \u2014 connected to, but distinct from, the economy \u2014 is the erosion of the German social model in recent decades. Though never as socially inclusive as the Scandinavian countries, postwar Germany had a comprehensive welfare state and robust labor unions, ensuring that citizens from the lower strata could achieve a decent living standard and a bit of wealth through full-time employment. In West Germany, where a secure job was the norm, full-time employment served as the foundation of social integration. The classic metaphor to describe this arrangement was coined by the sociologist Ulrich Beck in the 1980s: the \u201celevator effect.\u201d It implied that though social inequality still existed, everyone was rising in the same social \u201celevator,\u201d meaning that the gap between rich and poor wouldn\u2019t widen. Thirty years later, this society has vanished. Average real incomes declined for nearly 20 years beginning in 1993. Germany not only grew more unequal, but the standard of living for the lower strata stagnated or even fell. The lowest 40 percent of households have faced annual net income losses for around 25 years now, while the kinds of jobs that promised long-term stability dwindled.The number of precarious jobs like temp positions has exploded. At the height of postwar prosperity, almost 90 percent of jobs offered permanent employment with protections. By 2014, the figure had fallen to 68.3 percent. In other words, nearly one-third of all workers have insecure or short-term jobs. Moreover, a low-wage sector emerged employing millions of workers who can barely afford basic necessities and often need two jobs to get by.The German middle class is shrinking and no longer functions as a cohesive bloc. Though the upper-middle class still enjoys a high level of security, the lower middle contends with a very real risk of downward mobility. The relatively new phenomenon of a contracting \u2014 and internally divided \u2014 middle class has set off widespread anxiety.As Ms. Merkel\u2019s political career nears its end, and her possible replacements vie in Hamburg, it seems clear that the economic and social regime over which she presided is breaking down. Rising inequality has contributed to fragmentation in German society, fueling right-wing populism and fundamentally reordering the country\u2019s politics. What comes next is anyone\u2019s guess.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Anchorage Earthquake Was Terrifying. But the Damage Could\u2019ve Been Much Worse.", "Date": "2018-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byANCHORAGE \u2014 The magnitude 7 earthquake that jolted Anchorage on Friday cracked buildings, damaged roads and buckled bridges, drawing swift comparisons to a temblor in 1964 that devastated the region and remains a dominant part of Alaskan history.But on Saturday, even amid hundreds of aftershocks, residents of this port city marveled that the damage had not been much worse. The Anchorage Fire Department responded to four structure fires as a result of the quake, according to City Hall, and two reports of structure collapse are being investigated. No deaths have been reported.It could have turned out very differently, and many thought it would.Experts said that while the quake was significantly less intense than the one in 1964, which was magnitude 9.2, its limited destruction was the result of the region\u2019s growing smarter and much more resilient in the years since. Anchorage was much better prepared for a major earthquake; other cities may not have fared so well.The 1964 quake and the tsunami that followed killed more than 100 people, destroyed scores of homes and wiped out several small towns along the coast. It is the most powerful seismic event in the country\u2019s history and the second-most powerful recorded globally.\u201cWe have come a long way since the 1964 earthquake,\u201d said Joey Yang, the chairman of the civil engineering program at the University of Alaska Anchorage. \u201cAnchorage definitely knows about the power and damage a major earthquake can cause to the infrastructure and buildings.\u201dDevelopers must undergo rigorous requirements before building here, he added, particularly in some of the most seismically sensitive areas. Professor Yang is part of an earthquake commission that advises city leaders, whom he credited with taking the building review process seriously.Although the extent of the damage is still being assessed, building by building and road by road, the city on Saturday had already begun to return to normal as shopkeepers and families cleaned up the mess, grateful to have evaded catastrophe.This is not to say it was all smooth sailing. Pictures of sunken streets circulated widely on social media. Suburban commuters were stranded on Friday because of damage to major roads. Power failures continued well into Friday evening. Some people were left without shelter in below-freezing temperatures as their properties were inspected for structural damage. And significant aftershocks overnight made for restless sleep.The earthquake was among the strongest that longtime residents have experienced, so intense that it frightened even hardened Alaskans who know seismic activity is a fact of life here along Cook Inlet. When it struck a few miles north of Anchorage on Friday morning, panicked Alaskans around the city ducked for cover or ran outside into the chill.\u201cThe whole house was shaking, you could see the floor rolling up and down,\u201d Anders Olmstead said. \u201cDifferent rooms in my house were going in different angles. I was pretty scared. I\u2019ve lived here my whole life. We kind of laugh off earthquakes in Alaska because you\u2019ve been through so many, hundreds \u2014 some of them you sleep through.\u201dMr. Olmstead, 32, said the earthquake had knocked over his toddler daughter. He grabbed her and sheltered in place with her. He said he could hear the \u201cjoints of his house snapping\u201d and things falling all around him.His house ended up being fine, he said. \u201cWe got very lucky.\u201dProfessor Yang said the damage around the city \u201cwas definitely less than I would expect based on the intensity of the earthquake.\u201d He said the relative depth of the temblor, which struck nearly 30 miles below ground, helped mitigate its power.The city\u2019s main utilities were all up and running on Saturday, said Bill Falsey, the Anchorage municipal manager. But Mr. Falsey warned that repair work to the Glenn Highway, a major thoroughfare in the region, could take a long time to complete.Mayor Ethan Berkowitz told city residents on Saturday morning that \u201cwe\u2019re in full recovery mode\u201d and \u201con the road to returning to normal.\u201dMany businesses downtown remained closed, some marked with caution tape, awaiting safety inspectors to assess any structural damage. But in many shops, store managers were already taking stock of inventory. Families were cleaning up their homes, and building owners were meeting with engineers. Schools, according to officials, would remain closed until Tuesday.Still the shock had not quite worn off. Throughout the day, at coffee shops, at gas stations and on Facebook, residents continued to swap stories of confusion and alarm.Maddi Cassel, 21, was at her office near midtown Anchorage on Friday morning when she noticed the shaking. She thought it would be over soon, so she continued working. But the shaking grew in intensity as she was typing. Colleagues around her were exchanging worried glances and several of them ran outside.When they returned to the office, Ms. Cassel surveyed the damage. \u201cThings were thrown off the shelves and walls and there was glass broken. Ceiling tiles had fallen out of the ceiling and there was dust from inside there,\u201d she said. \u201cBut somehow my coffee was completely unspilled though, which was cool.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon Sees in Brazil Continent-Size Profits and Problems", "Date": "2018-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byExpansion south, into the nation where Amazon\u2019s namesake river ends, may prove a little harder.\u201cAmazon is still kind of irrelevant here,\u201d said Raul Prado, a vendor in the rural town of Guaipava, Brazil, who has relied on online retail sites to build up his business. Less than 1 percent of his sales are through Amazon.Brazil, home to more than 200 million people and the world\u2019s eighth-largest economy, is in many ways an obvious target for Amazon\u2019s next major expansion. Google and Facebook have done well in Brazil, but their digital services \u2014 search, social media and advertising \u2014 do not have to overcome the hurdles of selling goods and making deliveries.As a retail behemoth wading into the market, Amazon has found itself playing catch-up with local rivals that know how to navigate Brazil\u2019s distinct challenges: a complicated tax structure, high import costs and the headache of moving goods across a continent-size country.\u201cBrazil is really kind of the natural next country in terms of sheer size,\u201d said Cooper Smith, who was the director of Amazon research at Gartner L2, a business intelligence and research company, but has since left. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge opportunity, and they are laying the groundwork for that today.\u201dNext year, he said, \u201cAmazon is going to be all about Brazil.\u201d His prediction came with a caveat: \u201cBut it\u2019s no small undertaking.\u201dAmazon has been present in Brazil\u2019s online retail market since 2012, but until recently it focused on selling books and its Kindle e-reader. A little over a year ago, Amazon made a splash when it expanded to let third-party brands sell electronics directly to consumers on its marketplace.Shares in local competitors tanked following the news, but they later rebounded when it became apparent that Amazon wasn\u2019t on the cusp of rolling out the services that have helped make it a market leader in the United States: first-party sales, by which brands supply Amazon with products and Amazon is the retailer; and its fulfillment service, which packages and ships products from the company\u2019s warehouses.\u201cAmazon arrived a little late to the game,\u201d said Marcel Motta, the Brazil director of the global research company Euromonitor International. Local, established companies, he said, \u201cknow how to get around the obstacles.\u201dMercadoLibre, for instance, the e-commerce leader that first began in Argentina and modeled itself after eBay, has been in Brazil for 19 years.\u201cWe helped build e-commerce in this region,\u201d said Cristina Farjallat, the head of MercadoLibre\u2019s third-party marketplace. \u201cWe have portfolios of sellers and portfolios of consumers that no one else has.\u201dShe said the company had lured more sellers to its site than any other online retailer by working with vendors to create the tools they need. MercadoLibre has a roster of 12 million vendors and its own fulfillment service, and is rolling out a payment service to bypass banks and credit cards.The company helped Mr. Prado, the vendor, turn a modest business venture \u2014 selling satellite antennas door-to-door in his remote village, where cellphone coverage was virtually nonexistent \u2014 into a national enterprise, with 20 employees.\u201cHonestly, I had no idea what I was doing when I started, but MercadoLibre is the first site people open when they go on the internet,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have the brand name, their own payment plan, the logistics infrastructure and they even offer loans to sellers.\u201dMr. Prado, who created his company, Lojas Mineiras, in 2008, now offers his satellite and telephone products through nearly a dozen online retail sites. More than half of his sales are made through MercadoLibre.That doesn\u2019t mean it will stay that way.This year, Amazon broadened its catalog of products, offering sporting goods, fashion and home accessories, and signed up some major brands \u2014 but all remain independently sold and delivered.As of November, Amazon had just under 1 percent of the market share in Brazil, and was ranked 10th behind online retailers that offer both first- and third-party sales, according to Euromonitor\u2019s research. MercadoLibre had 19 percent of the market share.Experts say the window for Amazon to establish itself as a major player in Brazil is closing, which is why they expect the company to make a significant push in the next year. The question is whether it\u2019s too late.Mr. Smith said he had heard from industry sources, including investors, that Amazon had acquired a lease on a large warehouse outside S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\u2019s biggest city; advertised more than 100 jobs, many of them high level; and started negotiations to sell American brands on its Brazilian site. Amazon declined to comment.\u201cJeff Bezos has always harped on the idea that as Amazon saturates the U.S. market, he can go to emerging markets around the globe,\u201d Mr. Smith said, referring to the company\u2019s chief executive. \u201cClearly, it\u2019s coming. Amazon wants to have boots on the ground in Brazil.\u201dAmazon appears to be moving cautiously in Brazil: It has not had a new platform up and working in the country in time for the Christmas shopping season.\u201cAmazon wants all the pieces of its ecosystem in place first,\u201d Mr. Smith said.One of the major pieces is transportation. Brazil is larger than the continental United States, but its roads are poorly maintained and often flood during rainy season, and the state postal service is widely seen as inefficient and unreliable.Magazine Luiza, one of Brazil\u2019s top e-commerce companies, which began as a mom-and-pop store selling televisions, has said it had overcome these problems by leveraging its pre-existing and growing presence: It has 900 stores across the country.Those stores, which now sell appliances, electronics and furniture to working-class Brazilians, are being converted into mini-distribution centers for Magazine Luiza, and help educate shoppers about the ease of online retail.\u201cPhysical stores are a fundamental part of our platform. We have succeeded in cutting delivery time and price,\u201d said Eduardo Galanternick, the executive director of e-commerce at Magazine Luiza. \u201cWhen you go deep into the interior of Brazil, Magazine Luiza is often the only department store around.\u201dFor example, thousands of rural families use the Magazine Luiza store in Graja\u00fa, a city in northern Brazil\u2019s soybean country, to order appliances and pick up online orders like diapers and brand-name cosmetics.In addition to difficult competitors and terrain, Amazon will face thickets of regulation. Brazil\u2019s convoluted tax structure can make delivering goods across state borders a costly affair, while high import tariffs have priced many foreign-made goods out of reach for all but the wealthiest Brazilians.Nonetheless, the potential for growth \u2014 Brazil represents just 1.1 percent of global sales in online retail \u2014 is expected to attract major investments from Amazon and other companies.Euromonitor forecasts that the Brazilian market will nearly double over the next five years to $35 billion, and some competitors will be squeezed out as obstacles to online retail are eliminated.\u201cIt\u2019s a question of Amazon conforming to our market,\u201d Mr. Prado said. \u201cRight now, they can\u2019t compete. But you never know. I\u2019ll keep offering my products on Amazon, just in case.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Devoted Dads of the Amphibian World", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesThe males of an obscure frog species in Borneo faithfully tend their eggs, undistracted by new mates.In many frog species, the males care for their young. But in a rain forest in Borneo, scientists have discovered a case of unusual paternal devotion. Male smooth guardian frogs scarcely move or eat for days while tending one clutch of eggs, and they seem uninterested in mating with more females. Once hatched, tadpoles clamber on the males\u2019 backs to be ferried to pools of water.Dr. Goyes Vallejos was drawn to the less glamorous smooth guardian frog: a brown, nocturnal creature about an inch long with back patterns that look like dead leaves. In the 1980s, researchers published two short reports of males \u201cin direct contact\u201d with eggs and carrying tadpoles, but since then, the obscure species had been mostly ignored. \u201cI kind of wanted to go with the one that it seemed that nobody wanted to study,\u201d Dr. Goyes Vallejos said.To learn more about its behavior, she captured smooth guardian frogs in Borneo and allowed pairs to mate in glass terrariums. In six of nine instances, the male attended to the eggs. (In the other three cases, eggs were unfertilized, or the male escaped and then ignored the clutch when he was returned to the enclosure.) Attending males spent most of their time stationed on or near the eggs and didn\u2019t seem to eat unless insects or spiders walked right up to them.\u201cThey just sit there,\u201d Dr. Goyes Vallejos said. \u201cI had cameras running 24 hours, and sometimes I would think that they were broken because I couldn\u2019t see any movement.\u201d Males also did not call to females, suggesting they weren\u2019t interested in mating.After about 10 days, the male frog prodded the eggs, prompting the tadpoles inside to spin. Then he stepped on the eggs to break them. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like waking up the children to go to school,\u201d Dr. Goyes Vallejos said. \u201cEverybody get out, we need to go!\u201dThe hatched tadpoles climbed on the male\u2019s back and arranged themselves neatly. Dr. Goyes Vallejos also encountered 10 males carrying their young in the wild.The intensive care for eggs is \u201crather unusual,\u201d said Eva Ringler, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna in Austria, who was not involved in the study. \u201cThey are super occupied with caring for this one single clutch.\u201dThe studies suggest that a rare phenomenon called sex-role reversal may be in play. In such species, females compete among themselves to mate with males, instead of the other way around \u2014 often because males are too busy caring for young. Scientists have seen the behavior in fish and birds, but no clear cases have emerged yet in frogs.Adam Jones, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Idaho who was not involved in the study, said more key pieces of evidence would be needed to conclusively show sex-role reversal in smooth guardian frogs. Still, he said, among frogs \u201cthis is probably one of the best candidates.\u201dGathering the data for the study wasn\u2019t easy. Dr. Goyes Vallejos spent months searching the rain forest nearly every night for the camouflaged frogs. Sometimes, she thought, \u201cI don\u2019t want to go out tonight,\u201d she recalled. \u201cBut then I would think, what if tonight is the night that I see something very cool?\u201dAdvertisement"}

If they accept it, they use a teleprompter of sorts to record a video message, the company\u2019s chief executive, Steven Galanis, said in an interview on Sunday.He said Cameo had facilitated more than 93,000 videos without incident before it learned last week that an account associated with the Goyim Defense League, an anti-Jewish group, had requested videos coded with anti-Semitic messages. The group then reposted Mr. Favre\u2019s video, falsely implying that he was calling out Jewish people, Mr. Galanis said.\u201cShout out to \u2018Handsome Truth\u2019 and the GDL BOYS\u2026,\u201d the request to Mr. Favre said. \u201cYou guys are Patriots in my eyes\u2026 keep Waking em UP! dont let the Small get you down\u2026 Keep up the Fight\u2026 and never forget the USS LIBERTY !!! and all our service men that passed away that day.\u201dThe Goyim Defense League did not respond to a Facebook message seeking comment on Sunday.The U.S.S. Liberty was an American ship that was attacked by Israel \u2014 inadvertently, the Israelis said \u2014 in 1967. It is a source of conspiracy theories and has become a \u201crallying cry\u201d among anti-Semites, according to Heidi Beirich, who monitors hate groups and extremists for the Southern Poverty Law Center.She said the request also included other veiled references to anti-Semitic messaging: \u201cpatriots,\u201d which refers to those who are supportive of the anti-Semitic cause, and \u201csmall,\u201d which is a reference to a yarmulke, the traditional skullcaps worn by Jewish men.\u201cThe person who wrote this message obviously was putting it in coded enough language so that people who were in on the joke would get it but the celebrity wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Ms. Beirich said.\u201cNothing could be further from the truth,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI am sickened by what these groups stand for and concerned about their role in fueling today\u2019s negative political climate.\u201dIn an email on Sunday, Soulja Boy, whose real name is DeAndre Cortez Way, said he also was not aware of the message\u2019s meaning when he recorded the video on Cameo, where his going rate is $100.\u201cI was tricked,\u201d he said. \u201cI apologize to anyone I offended. I thought it was just a shoutout for a fan. I didn\u2019t know it had a negative meaning behind it.\u201dSince learning of the anti-Semitic affiliation, Cameo banned the account that requested the videos, deactivated share links for Facebook and Twitter and asked YouTube and Instagram to delete copies of the video that had been uploaded to their sites, Mr. Galanis said. He said Cameo was also building a database of language that could be associated with hate groups and planned to flag such messages as potentially problematic.\u201cIt really is sickening,\u201d Mr. Galanis said. He added: \u201cThere will be bad actors. Us, as Cameo, all we can do is try to mitigate it and make sure we are getting in front of it.\u201dThe episode has not scared away Mr. Favre, who plans to keep using the platform, a representative confirmed.

{"Headline": "Puritan Tiger Beetles, \u2018Vicious Predators,\u2019 May Soon Hunt Again", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe beetles are New England\u2019s most endangered species. Now scientists have begun an unlikely effort to return them to the banks of the Connecticut River.HADDAM, Conn. \u2014 In row upon row, 436 tiny larvae are presumably fast asleep now, a few months after they were tucked inches deep into trenches dug along the sandy banks of the Connecticut River.  \u201cThis is it for New England,\u201d said Laura Saucier, a wildlife biologist for the state of Connecticut. \u201cIf we lose our population in Connecticut, it\u2019s gone. The stakes are pretty high.\u201dBut for an ecosystem that runs from the Canadian border to the Long Island Sound, maintaining ecological balance is crucial, said Rodger Gwiazdowski, the entomologist who is leading the project and who has been dreaming for nearly two decades about restoring the Puritan tiger beetle.The beetles aren\u2019t an obvious missing link in an ecological chain; no other creature is known to have died or flourished as their numbers diminished, as far as Dr. Gwiazdowski knows. But \u201cthey\u2019re part of a healthy river,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we see a stretch of healthy river, we see beetles.\u201d So, restoring them should help support the health of New England\u2019s longest river, whose watershed is home to more than 2 million people. \u201cIt\u2019s powerfully na\u00efve to think it means nothing\u201d to allow the Puritan tiger beetles to disappear, he said.Which is why Dr. Gwiazdowski found himself motoring down the Connecticut River in October, remembering all he\u2019d done to ensure that these immature beetles arrived safely at their destinations. If the boat should sink, he had a plan to float three tubs of beetle larvae to shore. Still, preparations and plans can go awry. One beach that he had staked out turned wetter than the week before, not ideal for larvae that can\u2019t swim. So rather than installing the larvae into several nearby plots, Dr. Gwiazdowski and crew were forced to release more than 200 of the larvae into one 12-meter stretch of relatively dry sand. There, the larvae created some sort of vertical bubble inside their burrows, protecting them from rising river levels.For the winter, the beetles are in a state of torpor \u2014 essentially hibernating \u2014 all season long. The more mature ones will emerge as adults some time early next summer, if all goes well. They can last the winter without food, but even the larvae are predators. They\u2019ll hide in their burrows, waiting for prey to walk by that they can pull down into their tunnel and consume. Their eyesight is among the most acute of any known insect and they display a very fast muscular response time, Dr. Gwiazdowski said. \u201cComing and going, they\u2019re vicious predators.\u201dThey look a lot like other tiger beetles, but have long strides, are slightly longer and sleeker, and their wing covers are a little shinier and more bronze. \u201cEven in the sand, I can tell species apart by how they move,\u201d he said. It\u2019s unclear when the Puritan tiger beetle began disappearing. It was first named in 1871, but wasn\u2019t nearly wiped out until the late 1980s, perhaps as the result of development along the river.Dr. Gwiazdowski doesn\u2019t want to pinpoint the locations where the beetles still live or where he\u2019s released the larvae. Insect collectors have been known to kill beetle populations, so he avoids specifics.For the release, he picked locations along the Connecticut that already had other species of tiger beetles \u2014 ones that are less selective and hardier than Puritans. He hopes their success means the Puritans will survive, too. But even if the Puritans all die, he said, from a scientific perspective the experiment will have been a success.\u201cI can try and fail and that\u2019s O.K.,\u201d Dr. Gwiazdowski said. \u201cThe scientist in me doesn\u2019t care, as long as we know why.\u201dLast summer, Dr. Gwiazdowski and his team minded 30 or so pairs of adult Puritan tiger beetles they had caught in the spring, feeding them crickets and carefully harvesting their eggs every day, including weekends. Adults are easy to catch but hard to relocate, Dr. Gwiazdowski said. With previous releases of adults, the insects were never seen again, so scientists don\u2019t think the populations survived. The plan this time was to release larvae at different stages of development, hoping some would make it.Raised appropriately in captivity, each female can produce 100 or more offspring. But no one knew the optimal way to raise a Puritan tiger beetle \u2014 what kind of climate, prey or sand type.So the beetle team has been figuring it out by trial and error. Each breeding pair was kept in its own shoe-box sized plastic tub with a sand-filled Petri dish where researchers hoped the beetles would lay their eggs. Every weekday, a staff member sifted through the sandbox looking for eggs to remove, adding live crickets for food and replacing water in gel-form so the beetles could drink. The researchers couldn\u2019t put freshwater in the tubs, because the crickets \u2014 which apparently aren\u2019t very smart \u2014 would drown in it. Egg-laying provided another obstacle. Because beetles exist naturally on the flat surface of a beach, they weren\u2019t familiar with jumping or climbing into their makeshift sandboxes. Filling the tubs with too much sand would make the eggs difficult for researchers to find. Ramps of one type or another were too soft or too hard. Finally, the team obtained fresh clay from a quarry in Vermont. \u201cThe day we put the clay ramps in, the fecundity exploded,\u201d Dr. Gwiazdowski said.Restoring the Puritan tiger beetle\u2019s population had been a fantasy of his since he was an undergraduate student. But it wasn\u2019t until Dr. Gwiazdowski received a pilot grant in 2015 and another in 2017 from the Fish and Wildlife Service that he could start the reintroduction project. The challenge then became \u201chow to rear at scale,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one\u2019s done this before.\u201dHe spent most of that money on salaries and on his Sunderland lab, housed in a former salmon hatchery, where multi-million-dollar, decades-long efforts to reintroduce East Coast salmon had failed. In giant tanks that once housed fish, he installed tubs of Puritan tiger beetles and enough insects to keep them well fed.All 463 larvae were raised in this room, whose climate was meant to constantly resemble a humid summer\u2019s day at the water\u2019s edge. A fan blew constantly across a humidifier, creating a fog-machine-like effect that kept the room at 60 to 80 percent humidity \u2014 enough to stop the sand from drying out, but not so much that the walls would mold.It takes two to three years for an egg to mature into an adult Puritan tiger beetle capable of reproduction. In the lab, scientists can speed up that process and keep adults alive longer.In nature, each female insect will reproduce herself \u2014 leaving on average one mature offspring behind, said Joe Elkinton, a professor of environmental conservation at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, who has collaborated with Dr. Gwiazdowski and helped with the release. But in captivity, insects can multiply themselves 100-fold in one generation, suggesting how many are lost to predators, starvation and other challenges. It also means that reared properly in a lab, it\u2019s feasible to mature enough larvae to make a difference at the population level, Dr. Elkinton said.Males are usually a little bit smaller than females. Researchers put a red dot on the males so they could be easily spotted and grabbed. From midsummer until the larvae collection was complete, the males were moved every day into a tub with a different female to promote breeding. Some females laid no eggs at all; one laid 126.\u201cWhen you put life in a box, it gets very complicated very fast,\u201d Dr. Gwiazdowski noted.Releasing the 463 larvae on the river banks was \u201clike kicking the kids out at 18,\u201d Dr. Saucier joked.Advertisement"}

Roberto Papa, a medical official in Ancona, said during a news conference on Saturday morning that seven were taken to Ancona\u2019s main hospital in critical condition, all in their teens or early 20s. Several others were still under observation.Col. Cristian Carrozza of the Carabinieri, one of the chief investigators, said by phone that \u201cat least 100 witnesses had been interrogated\u201d so far, and that various theories about what had caused the panic were being examined. One was that the use of Mace, or pepper spray, provoked the stampede, he said.He also confirmed that some 1,400 tickets had been sold for the concert, though the club could legally hold only 870 people.\u201cOne hypothesis was that overcrowding was a contributing cause,\u201d he said.Oreste Capocasa, the police chief of the nearby city of Ancona, told RAI that many people were hurt when metal railings on a ramp outside one of the emergency exits collapsed.People tumbled off the ramp, and others fell on top of them, he said. Early reports from Italian news media had indicated that one or more of the emergency exits had been blocked, but Mr. Capocasa said that was not the case.The news agency ANSA said the police were interviewing six bouncers who worked at the club during the evening.\u201cIt\u2019s an absurd way to die,\u201d Mr. Di Maio wrote, pledging that the government would do everything in its power to determine \u201cif all the security measures had been respected.\u201dInterior Minister Matteo Salvini said that investigators were looking into whether some kind of toxic material had been used inside the club, provoking the stampede. \u201cThey\u2019re talking about ammonia, pepper spray, toxic substances, but don\u2019t let me get into things I can\u2019t divulge,\u201d he said.Noting that Saturday is the Catholic feast of the Immaculate Conception, a national holiday in Italy, he added, \u201cIt will be a holiday of tears that we wouldn\u2019t have wanted to shed.\u201dPope Francis prayed for the victims during his Angelus prayer on Saturday.On Saturday afternoon, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and Mr. Salvini made separate visits to Ancona, the capital of the Marches, where they met with investigators. Speaking later with reporters, Mr. Conte said that the estimated 1,400 mostly young fans had been crammed into a single hall, one of three in the club.He called on the managers of nightclubs and discos to respect existing security measures. \u201cThink that your own children could have been there,\u201d he said.Mr. Salvini, who is also deputy prime minister, said that those responsible would have the lives of \u201csix persons who Monday won\u2019t enter into their classrooms on their conscience.\u201dHe declined to confirm the hypothesis \u2014 relayed throughout the day by Italian news outlets \u2014 that pepper spray had provoked the panic.\u201cWhat\u2019s important is that people know that in Italy, those who do wrong will pay,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Officials need \u201cto let people know that this is not acceptable in the United States of America,\u201d he said in a statement.The Times reported that the secret project used deceptive social media practices in the Alabama Senate election a year ago to boost Mr. Jones and damage his Republican opponent, Roy S. Moore. The effort included the creation of a Facebook page designed to look like the work of conservative Alabamians, as well as what an internal report called a false-flag operation to make it appear as if an army of Russian accounts were following Mr. Moore on Twitter.There is no evidence that Mr. Jones, his campaign or Democratic Party officials encouraged or even knew about the small-scale effort.Mr. Moore, a former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court and a conservative Christian, said the meddling was a sign of moral decline. \u201cThe immorality of our society has seeped into our political system to corrupt our election process, threaten democracy and destroy our country,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly an appeal to God and our Constitution can preserve our republic.\u201dA social media expert involved in the project, Jonathon Morgan, said in a statement that it was designed to \u201cbetter understand and report on the tactics and effects of social media disinformation,\u201d not to influence the election. But the internal report portrayed it differently \u2014 as an aggressive effort to divide conservatives, suppress Republican turnout and drive Democrats to the polls.The effort, financed by Reid Hoffman, the billionaire co-founder of LinkedIn, is unlikely to have had a significant effect on the outcome, given its modest budget. It cost $100,000, out of $51 million spent on the entire race, including the primaries.But Mr. Moore seized on the disclosure to suggest that perhaps it did have an impact, saying the Times article amounted to proof of \u201csomething we\u2019ve always known: A lot of people and a lot of money went into a gigantic effort to allow a radical liberal Democrat to steal Alabama\u2019s Senate seat.\u201dThe revelation that tech-savvy Democrats had used fakery in the race was galling for fellow party members, who have been vocal in denouncing such tactics when they were used by Russia to boost President Trump\u2019s election campaign.\u201cThis is something I\u2019ve been warning of for months,\u201d said Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, who as vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee has been critical of Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms for failing to guard against misuse.\u201cThe threat these tactics pose to our democracy are not uniquely Russian, which is why it is imperative that the companies get a handle on the problem now and not later,\u201d Mr. Warner said.On Thursday, Alabama\u2019s chief elections regulator said he had warned Facebook and Twitter last year that he believed there was sustained interference under way from boosters of both Mr. Jones and Mr. Moore, though he thought the candidates were not themselves involved in it.\u201cWe were asking for help,\u201d Alabama\u2019s secretary of state, John H. Merrill, a Republican, said in an interview. \u201cIt was clear to us that this was being done intentionally by certain parties to mislead candidates and mislead candidates\u2019 supporters.\u201dMr. Merrill said he had become particularly alarmed after a wave of bots followed Twitter accounts connected to Alabama politicians and their campaigns.Part of the appeal of online machinations is that they cost so little, said Wendy R. Weiser, the director of the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice.\u201cI am certainly very worried that the tactics that were used by the Russians are going to be repeated and used by others in 2020 and beyond,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that we\u2019re going to see an escalation.\u201dMiles Rapoport, a senior fellow in American democracy at Harvard Kennedy School, said he feared that online deception could degrade the political process. To defend against it, he said, greater skepticism will be required.\u201cCampaigns and voters and citizens now will need to factor in: Where is this information coming from? Who\u2019s generating it? Can I believe it?\u201d Mr. Rapoport said.Attempts to regulate the kind of the tactics used in Alabama could run into constitutional barriers, according to Richard L. Hasen, a professor at the University of California, Irvine, School of Law who specializes in election law.\u201cWe generally don\u2019t have laws \u2014 and the First Amendment prevents us from having laws \u2014 that prohibit candidates from lying,\u201d he said.A requirement for more detailed reporting of what is often vaguely recorded as \u201conline services\u201d might help, at least for activities carried out by an official campaign, he said. But he is not holding out hope for 2020.\u201cIt\u2019s not as though this Congress \u2014 and this president \u2014 is going to pass any kind of campaign-related regulation that would have teeth in it,\u201d Mr. Hasen said.Advertisement"}

Opinion ColumnistDo not believe that we are still living in a functioning democracy. We are not. Republicans across this country are doing everything they can to impede, alter and override the power of the personal vote. This strikes at the very heart of democracy, both undermining people\u2019s faith in it and contorting it until it no long resembles what it claims to be.\u201cAfter hours of mysterious closed-door meetings that went past midnight, the Wisconsin Senate convened at 4:30 on Wednesday morning and passed by one vote a package of bills devised to curb the powers of the incoming Democratic leaders.\u201dAltering the structure of power in a state to limit the influence of an incoming executive of an opposing party wasn\u2019t something I thought I\u2019d ever see in America, but unfortunately this isn\u2019t even the first time we\u2019ve seen it. This is not the first time Republicans have done it.Republican anti-democratic tendencies aren\u2019t limited to the transfer of power. They extend to areas like the widespread efforts to enact voter suppression, from voter ID laws to voter roll purges to shortening early-voting windows to gerrymandering.We found that between 2014 and 2016, states removed almost 16 million voters from the rolls, and every state in the country can and should do more to protect voters from improper purges. Almost 4 million more names were purged from the rolls between 2014 and 2016 than between 2006 and 2008. This growth in the number of removed voters represented an increase of 33 percent \u2014 far outstripping growth in both total registered voters (18 percent) and total population (6 percent).But many people have the same name, which poses a problem for the database. That problem is heightened for minority voters because, as the report says, \u201cAfrican-American, Asian-American, and Latino voters are much more likely than Caucasians to have one of the most common 100 last names in the United States.\u201dEven our current immigration debate is far more about future voters than about safety or criminals or the other canards Republicans typically use to oppose it.That is why immigration is such a burning issue on the right and why Donald Trump is able to exploit it: Immigration, both legal and illegal, represents a loss of political power for Republicans.When the diversity lottery first started in fiscal year 1995, citizens of European countries, including those that were part of the former Soviet Union, received the largest number of diversity visas (about 24,000). In fiscal 2017, which ended Sept. 30, the largest number of visas went to citizens of African countries (about 19,000), while applicants from European countries (nearly 21,000) and from Asia (almost 8,000) received fewer visas.Republican power is increasingly synonymous with white power. The party\u2019s nationalist tendencies are increasingly synonymous with white nationalism.This group will not willingly cede its power just because demographics predict its downfall and current circumstances demonstrate its weaknesses.Advertisement"}

Ships were strictly base camps for Zodiac trips to view the icebergs of Antarctica or hike game trails in remote Alaska.Now the vessels themselves are getting an upgrade from Lindblad and several other lines, freeing passengers from choosing between adventure and comfort.While visiting Antarctica, the ship is designed to keep guests toasty, from heated storage in the cabins meant to dry wet parkas quickly to a two-story solarium with a swimming pool and hot tub.

{"Headline": "Troubled by Lapses, Government\u2019s Voice to the World Braces for New Trump Management", "Date": "2018-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The American government\u2019s broadcast service to the world has a problem: It is becoming the news itself.TV Mart\u00ed, which aims broadcasts at Cuba, aired a segment in May that called the financier and Democratic donor George Soros, a longtime opponent of authoritarianism, \u201ca nonbelieving Jew of flexible morals.\u201dVoice of America, the flagship of American government efforts to promote its values abroad, was rocked in October when 15 of its journalists were fired or disciplined after an internal investigation found they accepted \u201cbrown envelopes,\u201d or bribes passed to them by a Nigerian official.And only weeks later, Voice of America fired the chief of its Mandarin-language section after a billionaire Chinese exile who is championed by some on the American right and is known for making unsubstantiated charges against Beijing was promised a three-hour live broadcast.The debacles are the latest problems that for years have plagued the government\u2019s efforts to meld journalism and political messaging across its array of radio and television channels around the world.And they suggested that under President Trump, the broadcasts are at risk of greater ideological tilt as more political appointees eventually join the organization, the United States Agency for Global Media, formerly known as the Broadcasting Board of Governors.Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee as chief executive of the global government media agency is Michael Pack, who runs a conservative filmmaking business out of his house in suburban Washington. He declined to be interviewed.Mr. Pack, who is awaiting Senate confirmation, has collaborated on films with Mr. Bannon, a former head of Breitbart News, and has asserted that liberal political correctness is stifling the documentary film industry. If confirmed, he would hold considerable power. Recent legislation concentrates authority with the agency\u2019s chief executive, and would replace its current bipartisan board with an advisory council.The current top managers, appointed in the Obama administration and drawn largely from traditional media backgrounds, expect to lose their jobs if Mr. Pack comes in. They include the agency\u2019s current chief executive, John Lansing, a journalist and former president of Scripps Networks, and Amanda Bennett, a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist who runs Voice of America. For now, though, they have intensified its efforts to encourage professionalism, reinforce ethical standards and remind staff of safeguards against political interference.The agency\u2019s work, and the episodes that suggested an ideological shift to the right from some staff members even before Mr. Trump\u2019s team takes full control, have drawn particular scrutiny after signals from the president that he would like to see the government play a bigger role in developing a message separate from the news media.At risk from the recent missteps and the potential for Mr. Trump to impose his own self-interested vision of news, media analysts say, is the agency\u2019s brand as an objective, trusted source of information in nations where freedom of the press is under attack. Reports by the government network\u2019s 3,500 journalists reach more than 345 million people in 100 countries each week.\u201cWhat\u2019s at stake here is the credibility of the United States as a beacon of information, free speech and truth,\u201d said Frank Sesno, a former broadcast journalist and the director of the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University. \u201cIf we go down the road of turning our international broadcasting into a product that appears to be manipulated or becomes a conspiracy network or an apology network for anyone, we will lose stature and standing as a country.\u201dThe agency\u2019s journalists are legally shielded from political meddling, but it is unclear how those protections would be enforced. For decades, an uneasy mix of politics and journalism have led to management problems, turf battles and inertia. In congressional testimony in 2013, Hillary Clinton, then the secretary of state, called the agency \u201cpractically defunct in terms of its capacity to be able to tell a message around the world.\u201dMr. Lansing took over as chief executive in 2015, after a management restructuring. He, Ms. Bennett and a team of seasoned journalists have boosted the networks\u2019 global weekly audience by more than 100 million, and developed models for measuring effect. They have expanded their use of platforms from encrypted live broadcasting to shortwave radio to push content into countries that jam or ban American programming.Current Time, a network broadcasting news, features and documentaries for Russian speakers, started in 2017. Polygraph and Faktograph are new websites aimed at combating a torrent of disinformation by Russia state-controlled media. A new Persian-language service, VOA365, begins broadcasting early next year.As autocratic governments bar, detain and harass the agency\u2019s journalists, it has been deploying freelancers in alias, and sending reporters to remote areas to cover protests, national disasters and elections outside the immediate reach of authorities.But change has been difficult, as the spate of recent journalistic and ethical problems has shown, leaving some employees concerned that the Trump administration or its allies could exploit vulnerabilities as an excuse to reshape the agency\u2019s mission.\u201cIs this going to be fuel for people who want to take us in a very different direction?\u201d Ms. Bennett said of the recent scandals. \u201cWho knows?\u201dMr. Lansing says he has experienced no high-level interference, and he pushed back on reports of discord and nervousness among career staff. But he and his team acknowledge that in a global, federally funded enterprise whose employees embrace a variety of views, there is clear potential for political views to become an issue.This year, reports emerged that Mr. Shapiro, the Trump administration adviser, had allied with a longtime agency executive, Andre Mendes, in an effort to position themselves as Trump-era leaders in the agency.Mr. Mendes subsequently transferred to the Commerce Department, but Mr. Shapiro remains in the Cuba office, which he has reportedly accused of sympathizing with the communist government in Havana.After Voice of America\u2019s Mandarin service chief, Sasha Gong, was put on leave following the live interview with the Chinese billionaire, Guo Wengui, she appeared, while still on the federal payroll, in \u201cTrump@War,\u201d a documentary directed by Mr. Bannon.Ms. Gong was fired last month. She is contesting her dismissal.The agency\u2019s standards editor, Steven Springer, a former CNN journalist, said he has struggled to instill a culture of political balance in the Cuba office, where the broadcast maligning Mr. Soros originated.He said that at times \u201cpeople don\u2019t quite understand certain little aspects of how journalism is supposed to work,\u201d including basics like sourcing, attribution and avoiding plagiarism.Tom\u00e1s Regalado, the White House-appointed director of the Cuba office, is a former Spanish-language journalist who was previously the mayor of Miami and said he was recommended for the post by Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida. Mr. Regalado said that when he arrived at the broadcaster in June, \u201cSome of the hosts of the programs asked me the first thing, \u2018Can we call Ra\u00fal Castro a dictator?\u2019 And I said, \u2018Of course. Go ahead. Bring it on.\u2019\u201dMr. Regalado was not involved in the anti-Soros broadcast and called it \u201ca nightmare.\u201d But in an interview he said Judicial Watch, the conspiracy-minded conservative group relied on by the broadcast for some of the false or misleading material it contained, was a \u201cgood source.\u201dThe piece about Mr. Soros was presented by a TV Mart\u00ed journalist, Isabel Cuervo. The multipart broadcast leveled unfounded, anti-Semitic claims against Mr. Soros, including that he ignited the 2008 financial crisis and that his Open Society Foundation is \u201ca facade for investing in and looting countries.\u201dThe material was distributed on Mart\u00ed television, radio and its website for days. The broadcast drew scrutiny only in October, after a pipe bomb was sent to Mr. Soros\u2019s home.Mr. Lansing wrote letters of apology to Mr. Soros and the Open Society leadership, and ordered an investigation into the episode and a review of all Mart\u00ed content aired over the past year by outside journalists. A report on the broadcast is due out in early January.Mr. Regalado said that so far, two contractors have been fired, and four federal employees suspended, including Wilfredo Cancio, Mart\u00ed\u2019s former news director, and Ms. Cuervo, who continues to display the broadcasts on her personal Facebook page. Links to the broadcasts still appear on Mart\u00ed\u2019s website. Mr. Soros\u2019s representatives are calling for additional oversight of the agency.Ms. Bennett said that it was important that the problems, though embarrassing, be made public.\u201cWe want to use these incidents to say, \u2018Here\u2019s our standards, and having these principles is really important,\u2019\u201d Ms. Bennett said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a fight worth fighting.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Australian Gag Order Stokes Global Debate on Secrecy", "Date": "2018-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisSYDNEY, Australia \u2014 There is a criminal case unfolding in Australia that shall not be named. The defendant is a figure with a global reputation, someone of great influence in the country and the world. The charges are serious and of significant public interest.But publishing news about this case is illegal.Judges in Australia and some other countries, including Britain, often issue gag orders that temporarily restrict the publication of information related to a criminal proceeding on the grounds that it might sway jurors or potential jurors.Sometimes, judges even require the existence of these orders to be kept secret.In this case, something unusual is happening \u2014 the sweep of the restrictions is so all-encompassing that the conflict between the public\u2019s right to know and the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial is rippling across the internet and the world, touching news outlets and institutions in distant countries.If you\u2019re not in Australia, you may have already read recent coverage of the case.If you are in Australia or depend on online news from international organizations like The New York Times, The Associated Press or Reuters, you probably know nothing about it.Gag orders, also known as suppression orders, are supposed to work that way. They usually apply to speech within a specific jurisdiction.But the global nature of the internet has blurred the lines, giving local judges the power to threaten any website accessible to local residents, regardless of where the site or its journalists are based.That includes The Times: The Times is not publishing the latest news of the case online, and it blocked delivery of the Friday print edition to Australia, to comply with the judge\u2019s order. The Times\u2019s lawyers in Australia have advised the organization that it is subject to local law because it maintains a bureau in the country.Two Times journalists who have been covering the case would be at risk. The judge in the case has threatened journalists with contempt of court charges, which can bring up to five years in prison.Some publications that have published the news have no full-time staff in Australia and face no such risk. Even naming them appears to be illegal.But the battle reaches beyond one particular case. It\u2019s a contest of competing democratic values.The core debate is an old one, pitting the right of the accused to a fair trial against the right of free speech, and of the public to know what\u2019s going on in the courtroom. Those poles are not mutually exclusive: Trials in Australia, as in the United States, are usually both open and fair.\u201cWhat you need for a fair trial are fair and unbiased jurors, not people who have been kept in the dark,\u201d said Kurt Wimmer, a media and technology lawyer who is a partner with Covington and Burling in Washington.Because of the way technology has shifted the media landscape, gag orders now raise additional questions of scale and geography. The question now is whether a local judge, in protecting the right to a fair trial, should have the unilateral authority to silence journalists and publishers around the globe.In the case at hand, a criminal matter involving someone whose previous position of power touched the lives of millions all over the world, the stakes are especially high. The defendant is well known, having played a public role with issues and institutions that inspire strong emotions, making bias harder to stamp out.On the other side are not just journalists, but also those who were affected by the defendants\u2019 actions over many years in many places. They demand accountability, and also claim a right to know, seeing secrecy as an accomplice to the crimes of the case.A few news outlets without personnel or a corporate presence in Australia \u2014 and therefore no legal obligation or vulnerability \u2014 have already reported the case\u2019s latest developments online. On Twitter and Facebook, where the news can be found but is not ubiquitous, there has been praise from some Australians that the news was posted, and criticism from others worried that publication has jeopardized justice.Other attempts to maneuver within the law have varied. One news site published the news online but tried to block access to the article in Australia. The New York Times published the news in its American print editions, but not online, while Australian media outlets have tried to sidestep the issue, boldly calling out the court\u2019s restrictions while avoiding mention of the underlying news.Several newspapers published front-page editorials this week. One led with a large-font headline that said: \u201cCensored.\u201dThe court, in turn, has been strictly enforcing limits within a common framework.Suppression orders that completely ban coverage related to continuing sensitive prosecutions have become more frequent in many parts of Australia. It happens more often when there are two related trials in close succession and the goal is obvious: to prevent the risk of prejudice by juries, and to ensure that accusers and the accused can have their cases heard without being undermined at trial or on appeal.But, international lawyers note, there are other ways to accomplish that. In the United States, the First Amendment prohibits prior restraint on publication in nearly all instances. Courtrooms are rarely closed, and those that are shut mostly involve cases with classified information.For the most sensitive, dangerous or high-profile cases, such as O. J. Simpson\u2019s murder trial, juries are sequestered. They are kept in a hotel away from the internet, television and other media when not in court, and ordered not to discuss the case with anyone.In Australia, too, there are states \u2014 Queensland, for one \u2014 that rarely muzzle the media to provide an extra layer of protection for a fair trial. But in Victoria, the location of this particular case, suppression orders have become fairly routine.Hundreds of cases each year in Victoria are subject to such orders, according to court statistics \u2014 a trend that began in the 1990s with dozens of overlapping murder cases involving organized crime. And the scope of these prohibitions tends to be broad. In many cases, they bar all information derived from legal proceedings, including ancillary issues that appear to have little to do with protecting the defendant, like a judge\u2019s ruling on challenges to the gag order itself.Some legal experts in Australia say that such orders reflect a misplaced lack of faith in jurors\u2019 ability to reach a fair conclusion without being influenced by coverage or related cases.\u201cWe should trust juries, and we should give clear instructions,\u201d said Bruce Baer Arnold, a law professor at the School of Law and Justice at the University of Canberra. He added that this was the standard in the United States, as in most of Australia. \u201cTake the law seriously. Obey instructions. You make your decision on the basis of the argument and the basis of the facts.\u201dJournalists and scholars have also argued that there is another problem with prohibiting publication of facts about such a significant case: the suppression of criticism and accountability.Several lawyers in Victoria declined to be quoted about the issues raised by this case, even generally, fearing they would run afoul of the judge.Members of the public who have already spent months in court observing the case\u2019s progress have also been silenced, unable to share their conclusions with the world when they are most relevant and likely to be respected.For now, one judge in an Australian court is altering how the world sees a global figure accused of serious crimes. To preserve a local media blackout, he and the case\u2019s lawyers, who have supported the media ban, demand that the rest of the world not publicly debate their competence or the man being prosecuted to ensure, as much as possible, fair treatment in court.To some, that suppression of information will be seen as a triumph of justice, a noble win for local self-determination and the rule of law.To others it will be seen as an act that, however well intended, undermines transparency and accountability in a case that much of the world would desperately like to discuss.Livia Albeck-Ripka contributed reporting from Melbourne.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Uber Is Said to File for an I.P.O. as It Races Lyft to a Public Debut", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Uber confidentially filed paperwork on Thursday to go public, according to two people with knowledge of the matter, officially moving toward what is expected to be one of the biggest and most anticipated tech company stock market debuts ever.Uber and Lyft are expected to presage a wave of I.P.O.s by other tech start-ups, many of which have delayed going public for years because of the plentiful availability of private capital. But as these companies mature and their early investors push to cash out their stakes, many are readying for their stock market debuts.\u201cIt is like the graduation. The adolescents have become adults,\u201d said Mamoon Hamid, a venture capitalist at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. \u201cThe longest bull run in history is now culminating with a whole slew of I.P.O.s.\u201d He added, \u201cUber is in the same ballpark as Facebook and Google.\u201dMorgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have submitted proposals to take Uber public. Lyft, which was last valued by private market investors at $15 billion, recently picked JPMorgan Chase to lead its I.P.O.Ride-hailing \u2014 where people hail rides through their smartphone and drivers with their own cars supply the rides \u2014 is an inherently expensive business because the company has to pay to recruit drivers, expand in new markets and beat back rivals.Uber\u2019s chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, has focused on paring back the unprofitable segments of the company\u2019s business. He has sold off its operations in Russia and Southeast Asia, where it faced heavy competition from local rivals, while expanding into potential new businesses like food delivery and bike and scooter rentals.\u201cRevenue growth is significantly more important than worrying about the bottom line at this point,\u201d said Barrett Daniels, a partner at Deloitte who advises on I.P.O.s.Uber began as a ride-hailing service for upscale clientele in 2009, the pipe dream of Garrett Camp, an entrepreneur who eventually tapped a friend, Travis Kalanick, to run the company. They quickly pushed the service into numerous cities with little regard for local laws, causing tension with established taxi companies, lawmakers and regulators.As competitors like Lyft appeared, both rushed to compete for smaller fares. The rivals have since spent billions of dollars on fare subsidies to attract people to their platforms.Passengers loved Uber\u2019s convenience and embraced it in cities such as San Francisco, New York and London. Uber now operates in more than 600 cities across 63 countries, providing more than 15 million trips a day.Venture capitalists and other investors, seizing on Uber\u2019s rapid growth, shoveled billions of dollars into the company to help it dominate. The company\u2019s investors include the venture capital firm Benchmark, First Round Capital, TPG, SoftBank, Toyota and Fidelity Investments. Many of them are set to reap big returns from an I.P.O.\u201cUber\u2019s stock is widely distributed, and it will transform the lives of many thousands of families who have worked hard for this outcome,\u201d said Matt Ocko, a venture capitalist who invested in Uber when it was a young company. Many Uber employees will go on to start other companies, he said. \u201cThis \u2018virtuous cycle\u2019 is still a big part of what makes the Valley great,\u201d he added.Mr. Khosrowshahi was appointed Uber\u2019s chief executive a few months later. He has vowed to improve the company\u2019s culture and mend broken relationships with regulators, lawmakers and others.Uber\u2019s backers are eager to put last year\u2019s troubles behind them. \u201cI know Dara has the full trust of investors and employees, and we are confident he knows what he\u2019s doing,\u201d said Chris Sacca, an early investor in the company.\u201cWe\u2019re not done by any means, but if you look at where we were one year ago, we were dealing with fundamental issues of governance, of board alignment, of these continuing battles amongst power-brokers on our board and whether or not we were going to have SoftBank with us or against us,\u201d Mr. Khosrowshahi said in an interview with The New York Times earlier this year. \u201cThose were very important issues to deal with and to resolve, and I think we resolved them quite effectively in a positive way.\u201dMike Isaac and Erin Griffith reported from San Francisco and Kate Conger from Vancouver, British Columbia.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Version of YouTube Takes Shape With Pranksters, Magicians and Cartoons", "Date": "2018-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe tech giant sees Facebook Watch, with its rising number of videos from internet stars, as a key to future growth. A 20-something magician performing on the streets of Thailand and Jamaica. Three Australian brothers who shock bystanders with devious pranks. A conservative commentator in Mississippi who rants about America\u2019s priorities from his car. These are some of the video makers who in recent months have started making serious money from Facebook Watch, the tech giant\u2019s answer to YouTube. Julius Dein, the magician, said his videos had attracted revenue in the \u201csix figures\u201d since July, when he became able to run ads on them. The prankster brothers, known as the Jalals, said they had earned more than $500,000 since August. But creating a space that can attract that money has been a challenge for Facebook. Since beginning Watch in August 2017, the company had limited the number of pages that could run video ads to a tightly curated set of entities, including well-known publishers, TV networks and celebrities like Jada Pinkett Smith and Tom Brady. That has now changed. At the end of August, Facebook started to allow more pages to run ads on videos that were at least three minutes long. The number of Facebook pages that can run video ads has gone from about 3,700 on Aug. 1 to more than 23,000 this month, according to data shared with The New York Times by OpenSlate, an analytics firm that helps advertisers assess online video content. While Facebook has invested in plenty of original programming and established shows like \u201cBuffy the Vampire Slayer\u201d this year, it has also opened up Watch to much more do-it-yourself content from comedians, video bloggers and other digital entertainers. In other words, the YouTube crowd \u2014 though the number of videos on Watch is a small fraction what\u2019s available on YouTube.\u201cThey need premium, hit, intellectual-property-driven stuff to fuel the idea that this is TV-style content,\u201d said Ben Lerer, the chief executive of Group Nine Media, which oversees brands with popular Watch shows like \u201cThe Dodo\u201d and \u201cNowThis.\u201d \u201cBut then they need the volume that comes from News Feed content coming into Watch. That\u2019s a balance that\u2019s really delicate.\u201dWith more pages showing video ads, there are more places for advertisers to run their messages, and more opportunities for Facebook users to get access to videos on the platform. Among the most popular of these pages are entries from mainstream companies like Disney, BuzzFeed and Vice, according to OpenSlate. But in October and December, the most popular pages included a provocative group of bare-chested performers known as Magic Men Live, and others with names like \u201cInsane Stunts,\u201d \u201cJesus Today\u201d and \u201cNurse Blake.\u201d There was little in the way of news and politics. Facebook said on Thursday that more than 75 million people around the world spent at least one minute on Watch every day, and that those users then spent at least 20 minutes there on average. Ms. Pinkett Smith\u2019s \u201cRed Table Talk\u201d is its most-followed show and has the most active Facebook group, according to the company. Fidji Simo, who leads Facebook\u2019s video efforts, said that most users were getting access to Watch by clicking into it from the platform\u2019s main site rather than through videos on their News Feed.  \u201cSeeing how many people are coming in and watching for an average of more than 20 minutes has definitely been encouraging,\u201d Ms. Simo said. \u201cWe\u2019re really seeing this content create communities and social engagement on the platform.\u201d\u201cOne\u2019s a more lean-forward experience, and one\u2019s a more lean-back experience,\u201d said George Manas, who leads performance marketing across Omnicom Media Group agencies. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned that because it\u2019s running across both environments, it\u2019s creating challenges in measurement and, frankly, just in quality control because the user experience just isn\u2019t the same.\u201d Graham Allen, the 31-year-old host of \u201cRant Nation With Graham Allen,\u201d a Watch show from Conservative Review\u2019s CRTV (which recently merged with TheBlaze to form Blaze Media), said the viewership had made up for a sharp drop in traffic to his personal page after Facebook shifted its algorithms to favor its video offering.\u201cMost people don\u2019t even realize that the majority of videos they\u2019re watching now on their News Feeds are from Watch pages,\u201d Mr. Allen said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that was intentional from Facebook, to make it a seamless transition, or they just didn\u2019t think it through enough, like, \u2018Wow, people might not be able to know the difference.\u2019\u201d He added, \u201cAs far as video content goes, if you don\u2019t have a Watch page, you\u2019re kind of dead in the water right this second.\u201d The ad revenue has been welcome, he said, noting that he was previously more reliant on outside deals with sponsors. Mr. Dein, a 24-year-old magician from London who posts videos of street performances around the world, was able to start running video ads on his page in July. He said Facebook\u2019s rules affected the kind of videos that performed well, noting that ads can run after a minute as long as the video is at least three minutes long. \u201cWith me, since I\u2019m magic, I\u2019ll make sure the ad is on an exciting moment of the video,\u201d Mr. Dein said. \u201cIf I\u2019m about to cut my finger open for a magic trick, the ad plays just as the knife goes down.\u201d Mr. Dein said he had found it harder to produce \u201csuper-viral videos,\u201d like one he posted last year about homeless people reacting to magic, which he said had been watched more than 200 million times. But he said it made sense for Facebook to mimic YouTube and adopt longer-form content to appeal to advertisers. \u201cIf someone\u2019s watching a vlogger like Logan Paul and tuned into that person, they\u2019re paying more attention to the ad, whereas if someone is watching a seven-second clip, they don\u2019t care about the video or the ad,\u201d he said. \u201cNews content tends to be on the shorter side, so we\u2019ve seen a lot of news partners have a lot of one-minute videos,\u201d she said. Advertisers are also able to opt out of categories that tend to be closely related to news and politics, like \u201cdebated social issues\u201d and \u201ctragedy and conflict,\u201d she said. 1.

Mr. Manas of Omnicom said that while the service had potential, advertisers were still figuring out how people react to ad breaks in social videos.

There are also numerous other online platforms offering original content, from Amazon, Netflix and Hulu to Snap and Google. \u201cThe burden of proof is on Facebook\u2019s end to be able to illustrate to people that they are providing a longer-form video experience,\u201d Amanda Grant, GroupM\u2019s United States head of paid social, said. \u201cThere\u2019s a role for the highly produced content, but it\u2019s more of the sizzle, not the steak,\u201d said Mike Henry, the chief executive of OpenSlate. \u201cSuccess for these guys will come from scale and diversity of content.\u201d\u201cIf Facebook gets this right and can generate scale of inventory and scale of audience, they have the opportunity to combine sight, sound and motion with incredible user targeting,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the holy grail.\u201d Advertisement"}

He now lives in hiding on a ranch in Costa Rica with 50 strangers, including a ballet dancer who goes by code name \u201cThe Eagle.\u201dInstead, convinced that he was facing an attempted coup by well-financed political parties, Mr. Ortega responded with an increasingly brutal and repressive strategy to quell the opposition movement and has tightened his grip on his power.Now, nearly 40 years after the leftist Sandinista Front led by Mr. Ortega ousted the Somoza dynasty that had ruled Nicaragua for decades, he is accused of becoming the very dictator he helped depose all those years ago.The 73-year-old Mr. Ortega and his wife, 67, control virtually every aspect of government, including the National Assembly, the Supreme Court, the armed forces, the judiciary, the police and the prosecutor\u2019s office. The many Ortega adult children manage everything from gasoline distribution to television stations.Hundreds of civilians who never picked up a weapon or lit a match have been charged with terrorism-related crimes under a new law that broadened the definition of terrorism.In the past few days alone, the government shut down a popular television station, jailed its news director and expelled international human rights observers. Private gas stations that had participated in strikes were shuttered. The police raided the offices of the country\u2019s leading human rights organization and seized its computers.\u201cOur field work demonstrated that crimes against humanity are underway,\u201d said Paulo Abr\u00e3o, the executive secretary of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, who was among the international monitors expelled from the country on Thursday.While Mr. Ortega\u2019s crackdown has managed to silence the dissent for now, mounting international pressure and a plummeting economy \u2014 marked by the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs since the uprising began \u2014 could pose significant challenges to his power over the months ahead.Last week, President Trump signed the Nicaraguan Investment Conditionality Act, or Nica Act, a law aimed at crippling Mr. Ortega\u2019s presidency economically by cutting off lending from international development banks.Those in the opposition fear that this tightening economic noose could result in increasingly desperate acts as Mr. Ortega fights for his political life.Carlos Fernando Chamorro, a journalist whose newsroom was raided and padlocked by the police this month, said he was \u201cabsolutely convinced that this movement is irreversible,\u201d referring to the push to oust the Ortega government. \u201cBut what worries me is: How many people is Ortega going to kill before the police say, \u2018We can\u2019t keep killing people?\u2019\u201dWhen the older people who would see their pensions reduced picketed in Managua, the capital, pro-government mobs attacked them. The college students who rushed to support the protesters were assaulted, and some were killed.\u201cThey didn\u2019t come to injure us,\u201d said a former college student who goes by the name \u201cLa China\u201d and now lives in hiding. \u201cThey came to kill us.\u201dThe surge of social unrest quickly spread to other cities as the social security measure became an unexpected detonator of a monthslong campaign to end Mr. Ortega\u2019s rule. He returned to the presidency in 2007, after heading the country from 1979 to 1990.University students took over college campuses, and masked residents armed with homemade mortars and other weapons set up road blocks around the country that paralyzed commerce. Some protesters set fire to government buildings and burned cars, while the police responded with deadly force against even unarmed groups of protesters, human rights observers say.Officially, the organization no longer exists: The National Assembly eliminated the legal status for her group and six others accused of financing or plotting a coup.\u201cWe are all terrorists, according to them,\u201d said Ms. N\u00fa\u00f1ez, 80.Ms. N\u00fa\u00f1ez, a former Sandinista who was held as a political prisoner in 1970s, said the repression Nicaraguans are experiencing today was far worse than anything the Somozas did. Her organization took reports from activists who said they had been sexually assaulted with bayonets. In the first days after the protests, men were stripped naked and tortured, and were then released barefoot with shaved heads.Rallies now require a permit, which no antigovernment group receives. People are afraid to carry the flag or sing the national anthem for fear of being viewed as a subversive.Experts estimate that 60,000 people have fled, with more than 23,000 of them seeking refugee protection in Costa Rica.On Thursday, before the O.A.S. observers released their investigative report, the government kicked them out, saying they were operating under the direction of the Trump administration.\u201cDespite much evidence of the violent nature of the supposed peaceful protests, the existence of police and citizens who were assassinated with high-caliber fire arms, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights characterized said protests as peaceful,\u201d said Denis Moncada Colindres, Nicaragua\u2019s foreign minister, reading from a statement.The Ortega administration channels all media requests through the office of the vice president, which did not respond to repeated requests for interviews. In past communiqu\u00e9s, Ms. Murillo described the protesters as petty criminals and gang members who were financed by right-wing political parties.The O.A.S. observers found that of the 109 killings that took place in the first six weeks of the uprising, only nine criminal cases were opened. Six of those were related to Sandinistas killed in the violence.Of the 109 dead, 95 were shot in the head, neck and thorax, which suggested extrajudicial executions. Mobs of men in civilian clothes clearly worked in concert with the police, the investigators said.At least 1,400 people were hurt, and the number is probably far higher because most people were too afraid to go to public hospitals, where doctors were fired for treating wounded protesters, investigators said.An analysis of videos posted on social media showed that the government went from using tear gas to rubber bullets, then real bullets and finally military firepower like assault rifles and grenade launchers.The country\u2019s prosecutor\u2019s office seemed uninterested in investigating and unaware that prosecutors should be independent of the president\u2019s office, said Claudia Paz y Paz, a former Guatemalan attorney general who was among the experts. \u201cWhere were the prosecutors?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhere were they?\u201dA group of former college students, now expelled and living in hiding, said that while they acknowledged that the government had succeeded in crushing the protests, the activists continue small activities like singing the national anthem in public, or setting a tire on fire and fleeing.One safe house visited in Managua was occupied by seven former college students, who passed the time playing Monopoly when they were not glued to their phones in search of updates about recent arrests of their fellow activists. Some have been there for months, without ever going outside.At a house of Nicaraguan refugees in Costa Rica, dozens of the activists slept on mats on the floor separated by curtains. The protesters vowed not to get too comfortable there: Their fight, they said, remains at home.\u201cWe are in a phase now where massive events cannot be done,\u201d said a student who goes by the name of \u201cJos\u00e9\u201d because he fears that his family will be targeted. \u201cPeople think it\u2019s over? It\u2019s not over. It\u2019s not going to end.\u201dHe pulled out his phone to read aloud some of the death threats against him on Facebook.

But the fact that he stood to gain any money at all exposes the preposterous way that corporate America has treated sexual harassment.It\u2019s worth noting what should be obvious: Sexual harassment is illegal. That has been the case ever since Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, a 1986 Supreme Court decision that said that sexual harassment violates laws prohibiting workplace sex discrimination. And yet companies that catch an executive engaging in this illegal act can\u2019t always fire him for cause. Even more typically, they turn a blind eye to such conduct. It bears repeating: This behavior violates the law.But if company policies treat sexual harassment lightly, running afoul of them may be tough to do. CBS\u2019s policies \u201chave a \u2018check-the-box\u2019 quality,\u201d the investigators found, noting that they even include a provision laying out that employees who lodge a complaint could experience a \u201cnegative employment action\u201d that would not constitute retaliation. If companies took sexual harassment seriously as an illegal act, they might change the way they prepare for and react to it. Would they make allowances for paying out contracts to executives accused of stealing TVs? Would they decide to blame the people their executive stole from rather than take action against him? If an executive thinks it\u2019s O.K. to steal TVs, what else might he do?Bryce Covert is a contributor at The Nation and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

Instagram keeps adding widgets and baubles nobody wants in an effort to make us spend more time staring into Kylie Jenner\u2019s vacant eyes. Most of Facebook\u2019s users are dead. News publishing start-ups are struggling, with companies like Mic being sold because they spent their funding on a gold foosball table that says WOKE on it that doesn\u2019t work because every player is a replica of Colin Kaepernick taking a knee. These days the desire to create shareable content is stronger than Stephen Miller\u2019s desire for hair that looks as real as it does on the outside of the can.So I can see how whenever there\u2019s an awkward moment that happens publicly \u2014 any awkward moment at all \u2014 people working at media companies would immediately rush to make it into a \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d meme, without putting any of the love into the content that made it such a beloved meme to begin with.So can you give me some examples?Sure, let\u2019s start with this one.We\u2019re recording a flat-screen and not even facing the TV at the correct angle; it\u2019s off to the side. This is so haphazard. We see someone\u2019s disgusting cupboard above the television. Now we\u2019re zooming in manually. This is pathetic.And also \u2026 this is funny on its own. One thing I make sure of is the person we\u2019re zeroing in on has some philosophical situational kinship to Larry David. This guy is trolling Trump. He\u2019s not in an uncomfortable situation; he holds the power here. I can\u2019t really think of an episode of \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d where Larry David emerges victorious and is getting his reward as the camera swoops in on him. It\u2019s a complete inversion of the \u201cCurb\u201d formula. It\u2019s just fundamentally wrong. This meme isn\u2019t about just identifying anything, isolating it and putting in the music.But is it just this one guy? Or are there lots of these bad uses?It\u2019s not just people working at media companies who are abusing the meme. Celebrities (or \u201ccelebs\u201d for short) are now exploiting it for their own viral success.Jaden Smith? I would expect this type of online self-indulgence from Will, Jada, Willow or even Trey, but I thought you had more integrity than this. I guess I was wrong.Why do so many of these include the president?The not-very-funny answer is that Trump is such a dominant figure across all media. And a lot of people on Twitter want to see him look like a loser.How can you get mad at people for ripping you off when the meme is taken from somewhere else?I\u2019ve sort of appointed myself the social media guardian of Larry David and HBO slash Warner Media\u2019s intellectual property. I justify that by being something of an originator, I might go as far to call myself a pioneer of this meme, much like Marie Curie or Alexander Graham Bell, spreading knowledge of a pre-existing truth.I suppose maybe the best way to say this is that within the territory of Twitter, I am the gatekeeper of this meme, this particular way of using this content. Larry David has no social presence. In a way, I\u2019m his unintentional surrogate and I like to think that he would absolutely agree. In fact, if you happen to reach out to Larry David for this article and he declines to comment or doesn\u2019t respond, that silence would qualify as absolute consent and complete agreement with me.Oh yeah Matt Furie \u2026 but I think that kind of worked in the long run!I am retiring the \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d meme on Jan. 1, 2019.Beginning next year, no one will be allowed to make a video where they zoom in on an uncomfortable moment and add the \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d theme song to it capped with an abrupt end credit.And you might say: @Seinfeld2000, how ever will you enforce this ban? As usual, I\u2019m already 100 steps ahead of you. I\u2019m working with disgraced Twitter C.E.O. Jack Dorsey to ensure that anyone who attempts to post one of these memes will be immediately exiled from the platform. Just to give you an update on this plan, so far, I have DM\u2019ed Jack with the proposal and I am awaiting a response. As soon as he reads my DM, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll make this initiative his top priority, over adding an edit button or banning Nazis, people who send death threats, and worse, people who link to their SoundCloud accounts the moment a tweet gets over 500 RTs.If this plan doesn\u2019t work for WHATEVER reason, here are three tips for when you\u2019re attempting to make your own Curb Your Enthusiasm meme, which will never be as good as mine, to seem less pathetic:Choose good moments. In today\u2019s always-on culture, cringe-worthy events happen all the time. Be a good editor and pick only the moments that will work best. Usually these will have to be drawn out and painful enough to accommodate the first 12 seconds of the \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d theme and have a character suffering in the center of it all. Have you found a moment where an athlete laughs awkwardly for a moment? That\u2019s not quite right. I know, but everyone on Twitter is laughing about it. Still, be strong. A better moment will come along soon. Let the hacks take this one on.Stay true to \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm.\" No juxtaposing credits over the video or cutting the shape of the video square. Is that what the show is like? No. Do you even watch the show?Lastly, I just want to leave you with a thought. One thing I\u2019ve always tried to promote on my Twitter account is the idea of imagination. I ask what \u201cSeinfeld\u201d would be like today and like to make my own suggestions, but there\u2019s really no wrong answer. The only real answer is: \u201cSeinfeld\u201d today is whatever you want it to be. Is it imaginative to just use the \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d meme anytime something slightly weird happens on TV or social media? That\u2019s a rhetorical question, and so I\u2019m not obligated to answer, and yet I will: It simply is not. And so that\u2019s why I am leaving this tired meme, which I am largely responsible for, in 2018, which is almost over.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Eat in 2019", "Date": "2018-12-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAlison Roman wants you to spend less time in the kitchen and more time at the table. I had always maintained that I\u2019d be the kind of person who makes time for cooking, regardless of how busy I became. It is, after all, my job, my hobby, my creative outlet and how I connect with people.Fast forward to 2018, and it became painfully clear that while that was a nice thought and all, it was also highly and incredibly unrealistic. The general idea that Life Is Overwhelming and There\u2019s No Time for Anything is hardly new, but my reaction to it has adjusted from resistance to acceptance. The way my friends and I spend our time has changed as families grow and careers take off and life gets more delightfully cluttered, and to me that has shown itself most obviously in the kitchen. Sure, I still enjoy the occasional elaborate, multihour cooking affair, but these days, there\u2019s a lot more \u201ccome over for cheese and crackers because it\u2019s all I have energy for\u201d than there used to be.Nearly every time, I\u2019d think, \u201cBut we all just got here!\u201d I mean, sure, I just got there, but everyone else had been there for hours.Several weeks ago, one of my dear friends invited another close friend and me over for lunch. Her husband was out of town, and she had a 1-year-old to take care of, so my other friend and I offered to bake or make, bring ingredients or shop \u2014 basically cater the entire affair \u2014 concerned about the burden of preparing a meal when you have a toddler learning to walk. She declined, assuring us that it really \u201cwasn\u2019t a big deal,\u201d and not to worry.It dawned on me that I could lessen that burden of feeling so busy and actually get more out of cooking for friends if I flipped the ratio of time spent working to time spent eating.I began making sure my kitchen has the ingredients that allow me to effortlessly \u2014 and at a moment\u2019s notice, if need be \u2014 put together a meal that feels like an actual meal, rather than unwrapped nubs of leftover cheese masquerading as one. I pick one very simply prepared star of the show, and dress it up with more than a few tiny bowls (I own close to a million tiny bowls) filled with low-cook or no-cook items.My spreads are mostly composed of whatever I\u2019m trying to use up in the refrigerator (any rogue vegetable that can be sliced and quickly pickled is a popular choice) and the freezer (a whole, cut up chicken), food from my pantry (tinned fish and hot pickled peppers are big in my house), and something that I actually purchased for the occasion \u2014 a nice piece of fish, a whole chicken or some good pasta or noodles I happened across.In the magical tiny bowls, there\u2019s something salty, something tangy, something spicy. Herbs, lettuces or both are nearly always present. There\u2019s probably a dish of something creamy, like seasoned sour cream, or maybe a tahini dressing. A crunchy element like bread crumbs or fried shallots is nonnegotiable. Nothing takes more than a minute or two to throw together.Essentially it\u2019s all the things I want to eat, sometimes served on their own, sometimes piled on top of one another, all on my table for a very casual and customizable eating experience.Below you\u2019ll find three ideas for relaxed meals that follow that basic template, rather than formal recipes for dinner: bowls of spicy, simply dressed cold noodles with citrusy cabbage and garlicky tahini; slow-roasted salt-and-pepper salmon with just-set eggs and salty salmon roe; and a six-ingredient chicken to be served over buttered toast and crunchy lettuces.Feel free to take just one cue from these ideas, improvising with what you have and what you like. Or replicate them fully. You won\u2019t be sorry, I promise.Through this combination of unfussy centerpieces and relaxed, snacky sides and condiments, you\u2019ll find yourself spending less time in the kitchen and more time at the table. Life may not actually get less busy. But for a few glorious hours, it can feel that way.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Flying While Blind", "Date": "2018-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bydisabilityI am not only an experienced traveler; I am an experienced blind person.Ms. Kleege teaches in the English department at the University of California, Berkeley.\u201cBut what about me?\u201dThose words were spoken by a man sitting next to me on an airplane. I was in the aisle seat and he was in the center. He was speaking to the flight attendant who was delivering the preflight safety briefing. Usually, I will get a private briefing during the preboarding process for people with disabilities. But this time, a flight attendant didn\u2019t get to me until the plane was fully boarded.Sometimes the flight attendant will realize I am an experienced traveler and abbreviate the briefing. Yes, I know how to buckle my seatbelt and that the nearest exit might be behind me. Sometimes they have a Braille version of the safety information card. This makes for interesting reading, because in describing the position to take in case of a crash landing, there\u2019s greater precision than in the image alone. Once in a while, they even let me handle the oxygen mask and life jacket, which allows me to retain a tactile memory of those objects that I hope will come back to me should the need arise.While all this is going on I strive to reassure the attendant that I won\u2019t be any extra work for her during the flight. I am not only an experienced traveler; I am an experienced blind person. I know how to find my way to the lavatory. In the unlikely event that food is served, I know how to feed myself.Part of the standard safety briefing is to tell me that in case of emergency, I should stay where I am and wait for a member of the crew to come back and rescue me. It does not take much imagination to predict that in the chaos of some disaster, this is unlikely to happen. How is the flight attendant going to get to me if the aisle is clogged with my fellow passengers rushing toward the exit?The man in the seat next to me, idly eavesdropping as she got to this part of her spiel, piped up, \u201cBut what about me?\u201d His tone was aggrieved, perhaps a little anxious. He went on to point out that if I remained seated in the event of this hypothetical emergency, he would have to climb over me, and those few extra seconds might be the difference between life and death.I had to think fast. The two of them were talking about and around me, and I was vanishing from the conversation. This is a familiar experience for many disabled people, and it can be risky to remain silent. It seemed urgent to reshape the image of myself as a barrier and burden, so I said, \u201cIf the lights go out, or there\u2019s smoke and no visibility, I can lead the way.\u201dI felt a bit guilty using this ploy, because I was ascribing value to myself that other passengers, particularly other disabled passengers, could not claim. I was thinking of a man who preboarded with me, now sitting a couple of rows ahead. He was in a wheelchair in the Jetway but walked onto the plane on his own. He explained to me somewhat sheepishly, that he was \u201cjust a little shaky on my pins.\u201d I suspect he worried that I, a legitimate disabled person, would denounce him as an impostor.Like many people I meet preboarding airplanes or waiting in what I think of as the disability holding pens, where we wait for assistants to move us around, he did not consider himself to be a person with a disability in his everyday life. I wanted to tell him that the problem was not his shaky pins; the problem was that airports are disabling spaces. The vast distances of long concourses can be daunting. Signage is often hard to decipher even for people with average vision. Announcements compete with each other in a garbled sonic mess.When people avail themselves of disability services at airports, riding wheelchairs and golf carts and boarding before everyone else, we also find ourselves subject to policies about emergency protocols, such as the requirement to remain in our seats and wait for help.Still thinking fast, I resisted the urge to list my academic and professional accomplishments as proof that I am a clear thinker, accustomed to directing others, good in a crisis. Fortunately, my fellow passenger only needed to consider for a second. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said, \u201cshe can get around in the dark. She could lead me to safety.\u201dI couldn\u2019t tell for sure, but I assessed that the man was young to middle-aged and physically fit. When I stood up to let him in the seat I observed that he was above average in height. He had flipped his suitcase into the overhead bin with ease. His broad shoulders extended beyond the width of his seat. I considered pointing out that in the hypothetical disaster, as I led him to the exit, we could also assist Mr. Shaky-on-my-pins. For all we knew, he might be a physician, or a former Boy Scout, ready to administer first aid. Who knew what valuable skills he might have in a disaster? Between the two of us, surely my seatmate and I could get him out as well.The flight attendant was a bit flummoxed. My fellow passenger was displaying a kind of defiance in his solidarity with me. Perhaps this is why they usually conduct these briefings before the nondisabled people board. She decided not to argue with us, and that was the end of it.As we taxied to take off, I became aware that my seatmate was gripping the armrest between us. I could feel the tension in his elbow pressing against my arm. I realized that I had misjudged him. His seeming physical fitness had distracted me from the possibility that he might be a fearful flyer. I wanted to say something reassuring, but I sensed that my presence and the disastrous scenario it had compelled him to imagine had triggered his anxiety. So I resorted to the tried-and-true small talk of travelers: Was this trip business or pleasure? Was he leaving home or on his way back? I am an experienced traveler; I know how people talk. Soon enough, he released his grip on the armrest, the wheels left the tarmac and we were on our way.Georgina Kleege teaches disability studies and creative writing in the English Department at the University of California, Berkeley.

The sun was blazing, and the water was cool. It was a perfect day to close your eyes and let the current carry you.I was enjoying myself, until we rounded the final bend and saw the parking lot. I leaned back to get my arms in the water and I started to kick and paddle. In a froth of churning water, I passed my mom, my sister, my boyfriend and my brothers, and as I reached the dock, I shouted out, \u201cI won!\u201dThat\u2019s me. All my life, I\u2019ve made lists and set deadlines, never content, or even able, to just glide.That kind of drive has served me well when aimed at challenges within my control, like writing a novel. It was less helpful in dictating things like how the novel was received. I learned that lesson with the publication of each new title. In retrospect, though, it never quite sank in. I never stopped hoping that if I worked hard enough, wanted it badly enough, I\u2019d finally get the acclaim that I craved.In 2016, after a dozen novels, I published a collection of essays. I had high hopes. This book would not have a pink cover, and it would tackle serious subjects, and in a froth of water and triumph, I would paddle my way, belatedly, to literary respectability.And so, after a 35-year hiatus, I started taking piano lessons again.I had been an indifferent piano student as a kid. When I began, music came easily to me. By junior high, I\u2019d gotten good enough to play things like Beethoven\u2019s \u201cMoonlight Sonata.\u201d Then it got harder. By high school, I had bumped up against the limits of my natural abilities. So I quit. I turned my attention toward activities at which I could excel and immediately forgot every single piece except \u201cHeart and Soul.\u201d\u201cTook lessons for six years. Can\u2019t remember anything\u201d was what I told the local branch of the Settlement Music School. Then, armed with a $50 keyboard that had only 66 of the standard 88 keys, I set off for my first lesson.My teacher was a genial man with white hair and an encyclopedic knowledge of all things musical, from the lives of composers to exactly how many versions of a Chopin nocturne were found in his desk after he died.\u201cHere,\u201d he said, setting a piece of sheet music on the stand. \u201cPlay just the right hand\u2019s part.\u201d I peered at the page, touching the keys of the grand piano hesitantly. My fingers felt twice as thick as usual; my hands, half as flexible. Even though I\u2019d spent hundreds of hours in exactly that position \u2014 eyes on the page, hands on the keys, right foot on the pedal, left foot on the floor \u2014 it felt brand new. The piece was a Burgmuller \u00e9tude in 4/4 time. I settled my hand on an A, then a G, then an F, then \u2026 \u201cIs that an E?\u201d\u201cIt is indeed!\u201d my teacher said, sounding as proud as if I\u2019d recognized an obscure mathematical formula, instead of just a note.Slowly, haltingly, I played the song through: right hand, then left hand, then both hands together. \u201cSee, that wasn\u2019t so bad!\u201d my teacher said.After six months, I purchased a keyboard with all 88 keys. After nine months, I found a free piano on Craigslist. Now, a year into my second stint as a piano student, I can proudly announce that I am \u2026 still pretty terrible. Except playing the piano has accomplished what all that yoga and meditation never could. I can quiet my mind and focus entirely on something: not my breath, but the music.\u201cRachmaninoff was said to have played this as if all the hounds of hell were chasing him,\u201d my teacher said. Right now, I play it as if all the hounds of hell are dozing in the sun as I stroll toward an idling bus that\u2019s going to take me to get a root canal. Instead of a delicate, rippling flow of notes, I produce a muddy tumble, a kicked sack of potatoes thudding discordantly down the stairs.I go note by note, bar by bar. Five times, 10 times, 15, 20, playing the piece a little faster and more cleanly each time. Still not perfect, still missing that G sharp nine out of 10 times. I screw up, go back, start the measure again.I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s that I\u2019m creating new neural pathways, or if engrossing myself in something new and difficult just makes it hard to think of anything else. But I have come to believe in the value of doing something where I know I will never be better than O.K.So I will persist. In the new year, I will embrace the joy of making music (loosely defined) only for myself. I will invite failure into my life and play without the expectation of being the best, or even mediocre, until failing isn\u2019t a terrifying unknown but just another possibility, and one I can survive.I open my book to Chopin\u2019s waltz in D flat major, the \u201cMinute Waltz,\u201d so called because you\u2019re meant to play it in under a minute. Right now, I\u2019m averaging around five. As I start the first trill my 15-year-old daughter, who these days speaks mostly in sarcasm, strolls by. Sometimes she\u2019ll do a mocking balletic leap as I play, or just emphatically shut her bedroom door. Tonight, she does neither. \u201cHey, Mom,\u201d she says, \u201cthat was really good!\u201dIt wasn\u2019t. It was just O.K. But that is good enough.Advertisement"}

It was distracting. Remember that even though it\u2019s fiction, it\u2019s meant to be believable. Give these characters names like Fred, Luke, Greg, etc.Then you introduce this \u201cmost famous reindeer of all\u201d character. Your protagonist needs to have something at stake. Give this character a developed backstory and clear motivations. Instead of \u201cRudolph,\u201d try calling him Dave Reindeer, a talented yet isolated writer who has been estranged from his family for the past 17 years.\u201cYou would even say it glows\u201d feels a little flat. Add a simile here, and make sure it\u2019s consistent with Dave\u2019s character. For example, \u201cGlows like the end of every cigarette he swore would be his last.\u201dYou also gloss over the psychological games the Reindeer family would play. I would love to learn more about how his parents would ignore Dave\u2019s artistic achievements but would proudly display all of his brother Fred\u2019s basketball trophies on the mantelpiece.Then suddenly we jump forward in time to Christmas Eve. There\u2019s a character called \u201cSanta,\u201d but I\u2019m thinking he would work better as Rob Reindeer, Dave\u2019s distant father who is finally coming to make amends. Here\u2019s an original idea: Rob can surprise his son by standing in line at one of his book signings!Not sure what \u201cguide my sleigh\u201d refers to, but you could make this scene more impactful by describing how Dave and Rob tearfully embrace as Rob apologizes for their long, bitter estrangement.Overall though, really great stuff.

{"Headline": "Where Are All the Female Architects?", "Date": "2018-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNearly half of architecture students are women. Why are so few sticking with the industry after graduation?Contributing Opinion WriterTo get a sense of the state of opportunity for women in architecture, consider that the firm getting the most high-profile architectural commissions in the world right now has just two female principals and this web address: big.dk.Yes, BIG (for Bjarke Ingels Group) is based in Denmark (hence the \u201cdk\u201d), but the firm\u2019s use of this cheeky address just about sums up the situation facing many women in the architectural profession today. Until 1972 and the advent of Title IX, which forbade gender discrimination in federally funded education programs, most American architecture schools refused to admit women. The last major survey of the field found that women account for half of graduates from architecture programs in this country, but they make up about 20 percent of licensed architects and 17 percent of partners or principals in architecture firms.There is no single \u2014 or simple \u2014 explanation for this. Nor is there an easy fix. The challenge, said Ila Berman, dean of the University of Virginia School of Architecture (and one of just a few female deans in the field), is to \u201cchange a culture that will only be changed through representation, when 50 percent of the people in the room are women.\u201dThe \u2014 tentative \u2014 good news is that it\u2019s happening.I was struck in particular by how many men versus women reported feeling strongly that their work made a difference; this perhaps connected to the finding that female architects felt recognized for working hard rather than for the work itself.Women are underrepresented in architecture not just at the top of the field but at all levels of practice. In 2015 and 2016, only 31 percent of full- or part-time faculty members in architecture were women. Even as women have been gradually increasing their numbers, they\u2019ve mostly done so at lower rungs of both academia and the profession. Not surprisingly, then, the percentage of women in architecture radically decreases as one moves up the ladder toward more senior positions and prestigious honors. Female mentors and role models are in scarce supply. (Apart from Zaha Hadid, how many female architects can you name?) And though women might be growing in numbers in the lecture hall, they\u2019re underrepresented on course syllabuses, which can send a message that women aren\u2019t valued participants.It would seem obvious: If you want more female architects, teach more women to be architects. Other fields where women are underrepresented speak of a pipeline problem, the belief that a lack of diversity stems from a scarcity of available talent. But nearly half of architecture students are women, so why are so few sticking with the industry after graduation?Even in 2018, assumptions that women would quit to marry, that they would be unable to command authority on job sites, or even that their creativity was not up to par, have persisted, resulting in unequal pay, recognition and access to opportunities. Every woman I spoke to on this topic has a story (or more likely, many stories) of men questioning their competency and qualifications, of not believing they were actually in charge of a project. Several women said clients often assume that a female architect in a room is there to take notes or serve coffee. One woman was asked in a meeting if she had PMS; another recounted the time when a group of male colleagues complained to the head of the firm that they could not take orders from a woman; still another describes losing a promotion after becoming pregnant.Several of the country\u2019s most prestigious architectural programs, including Yale, Princeton, Columbia, Cornell, the University of Virginia and the University of California, Berkeley, have in recent years appointed women as deans or directors. It would be unreasonable to put the onus of transformation on a handful of women \u2014 and it\u2019s insulting to all women to assume that these talented and capable architects were hired solely because of their gender. But those appointments do begin to change the balance of power.\u201cIt is meaningful both symbolically and substantially that I\u2019m a woman dean at Yale,\u201d said Deborah Berke, dean of architecture at Yale and principal of her own firm. \u201cWe won\u2019t see the culture change immediately. But we will see the results.\u201dIn architecture, peer review dominates. When tenure decisions are made by committees made up of men, consist of interviews with mostly male candidates, and are sent to male provosts for approval, the system perpetuates itself. Female architects make less than their male counterparts at every level of experience.To put it plainly, men are still the face of the profession. The architects most of us hear about \u2014 Gehry, Foster, Ingels \u2014 are often commissioned to design skyscrapers, museums and high-tech corporate campuses, and it is those buildings that are seen as the pinnacle of success, the projects to which others should aspire. There are women who want to design skyscrapers, too, but this represents an awfully limited view of what architecture could be. Part of what might account for the low numbers of female graduates continuing in their field may be their interest in forging a different path.As she explained to me in an email: \u201cIn many ways, architecture is a profession that has been the epitome of the dominant white patriarchy, from most of the celebrated starchitects to the all too frequent obsession with buildings that are better known for the beauty of the object than the quality of life that they enable. I\u2019m black and female; my existence is the exact opposite of that system. So perhaps it is no accident that as I\u2019ve built my own path in this field, I\u2019ve been committed to a design practice that is rooted in elevating the stories of those who have most often been neglected or silenced.\u201dThe problem discussed here is more a societal problem than an architectural one. Transformation won\u2019t come overnight, but there\u2019s one thing all firms could do right now: pay men and women the same.That\u2019s what the architect and MacArthur fellow Jeanne Gang did for her own firm, Studio Gang, which designs the sort of high-profile projects not typically given to firms led by women. It\u2019s an essential first step toward equality that will let the profession move forward, together, to address the more complex challenges that await.Allison Arieff is a contributing opinion writer focusing on design and architecture.An earlier version of this article included outdated information about the number of female principals at the Bjarke Ingels Group. It is two, not one.Advertisement"}

Then I get to my mother\u2019s house.Ms. Limperis is a comedian.I moved out of my parents\u2019 house when I was 18. I headed off to college and with each passing year, grew older, became more self-reliant and hit new adult milestones, just as my parents had before me. Sure, some people might compare my mid-to-late 20s with my parents\u2019 and say to me, \u201cAt your age, your parents had two children, a retirement fund and owned a house\u201d and \u201cYou live in a walk-in closet,\u201d but I think we all know the old saying: If you can\u2019t touch every wall of your room while lying down, you\u2019re spending too much on rent! Who needs a 401(k) when you have a Fitbit. Health is wealth. My Fitbit is still in the box but next year \u2026 next year is definitely the year I open it.Even if it has been a slow crawl toward adulthood, I can confidently say that for 364 days out of the year, I am an independent grown-up. However, there\u2019s an exception. One day a year, when I go home to visit my Greek family on Christmas. We said we weren\u2019t doing a lot of gifts. We do so many gifts. We\u2019re all adults and no one has children, so of course there\u2019s no \u2014 wait, yes, there\u2019s a note from Santa and it rhymes. My mom slides me a candle she got from her co-worker to \u201cgive to your aunt later, as a gift.\u201dFor dinner it\u2019s just my grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins. And for dessert? The neighbors, my ophthalmologist, the retired plumber, an exchange student from Sweden, \u201cinvite your dance friends!\u201d (I haven\u2019t danced in 13 years), two dog walkers, a woman named Carla who my mom swears I know, and the entire church parish. Our pastry spread has its own ZIP code. I dress myself every day, but it takes four rounds of outfit changes until we land on the same one I wore last year because it \u201cLooks nice for ya grandparents.\u201dMy mom panics that there isn\u2019t enough food. The casserole-to-guest ratio is 1:1. My mom puts another ham in the oven, \u201cfor good measure.\u201d Every meal for the next month will include ham. It\u2019s 12 p.m. so it\u2019s time to, for an unknown and unspoken reason, eat dinner. We all proclaim we are full. We bravely and mandatorily eat through it. Carla tells a story. I do not know Carla. After eating, the kids \u2014 all adults in their late 20s and 30s \u2014 go down to the basement to play Monopoly or Clue, depending on how much we want to fight. The parents stay upstairs and talk about the tree, the food we just had and why the neighbors didn\u2019t put lights up this year. \u201cMust be something going wrong in the family,\u201d someone helpfully says out loud. Everyone leaves at 9 and we eat more ham. How? Why? Because we are trained warriors.And just like that, I am back to adult life, where I am the person who has to make (O.K., fine, buy) a pan of lasagna to have on hand, just in case 14 people show up hungry for no reason.This year, for the first time in my life, I am not actually going home for Christmas \u2014 the most offensive phrase one could dare utter in my family.

Plus the outdoor malls in Los Angeles have fake snow and there\u2019s a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts downtown, so it\u2019s basically like being in Massachusetts.It will be hard, though, and I know it will be hard for my family, too. While I\u2019m sad, I do feel incredibly comforted knowing that if I can\u2019t be there, at least Carla will be.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Remote Villages, Surprising New Measures Save Children With Malaria", "Date": "2018-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGlobal healthMalaria quickly kills toddlers. But rapid diagnostic tests, a new suppository drug and bicycle ambulances can buy enough time to get stricken children to hospitals.Often parents do not realize quickly enough how close a toddler is to death. More than 90 percent of malaria deaths are in children under five years old.Now, after 13 years of effort, a set of stopgap measures to keep youngsters alive long enough to get them to a clinic has been developed. Initial testing suggests the measures can dramatically cut death rates; in one pilot project in Zambia, they dropped by 96 percent.The most important new element is artesunate delivered as a soft rectal suppository. Artesunate is the drug that hospitals inject into children in mortal danger from malaria infections of the brain. The new version comes in a form that can be given by a village health worker or even a parent.The test gives a diagnosis in minutes with only a finger-prick drop of blood.The ambulances are metal carts about six feet long and four feet wide that can be made in a local welding shop and attached to most bicycles. A mother and child can ride flat or sitting, and the cart can navigate dirt tracks too narrow for cars.An analysis released in August calculated that deaths were 96 percent lower than they would have been without the combination of suppositories, ambulances, test kits and extra training.(The comparison was imperfect, because the 2017-2018 season in the analysis appears to have been more severe than the previous season, and local clinics were well prepared in advance. Still, only three children died, which was far fewer than local health officials had seen before.)The pilot project was supported by the Medicines for Malaria Venture, a partnership founded in 1999 to pursue new malaria drugs, and Transaid, a British charity that works to improve transportation in poor countries.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The West at an Impasse", "Date": "2018-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHow meritocracy and populism reinforce each other's faults.Opinion Columnist\u201cMacron\u2019s poll numbers are breaking negative records,\u201d the interviewer dryly noted.While I read both of these exchanges, my Kindle was open to \u201cThe Rise of the Meritocracy,\u201d written in 1958 by the British civil servant Michael Young. The book coined the term in its title, and Young\u2019s neologism was soon adopted as a compliment, a term of praise for a system of elite formation that relied on SAT tests and resumes and promised rule by the most intelligent rather than the well-bred.But Young had something more dystopian in mind. His book, a work of fiction that purported to be a work of history and political analysis written in the middle of the 21st century, envisioned a world whose classes were increasingly segregated by talent and intelligence, in which the brainy, standardized-test-acing elite became an increasingly intolerable version of the old aristocracy, leading eventually to riots and populist revolutions in the then far-distant future of 2034.The book\u2019s fictional author is a pompous sociologist who believes absolutely in the meritocratic system, which has produced an elite \u201cmore brilliant\u201d than any in the past. He also believes in its essential stability, because the nature of meritocracy itself ensures that the populists threatening revolt simply aren\u2019t as smart or as capable as the new elite that rules them:Behind the shift and turn of current politics is the underlying fact with which I opened my essay. The last century has witnessed a far-reaching redistribution of ability between the classes in society, and the consequence is that the lower classes no longer have the power to make revolt effective. For a short moment they may prosper through an alliance with the odd and passing disillusion of a section of the upper classes. But such d\u00e9class\u00e9 people can never be more than an eccentric minority \u2014 the Populists have never been more than that as a serious political force \u2014 because the \u00e9lite is treated with all the wise distinction that any heart can desire. Without intelligence in their heads, the lower classes are never more menacing than a rabble, even if they are sometimes sullen, sometimes mercurial, not yet completely predictable. If the hopes of some earlier dissidents had been realized and the brilliant children from the lower classes remained there, to teach, to inspire, and to organize the masses, then I should have had a different story to tell. The few who now propose such a radical step are a hundred years too late.His point here, expressed with maximal elitism and arrogance, is that meritocracy essentially co-opts the talented people who in a different world would be leaders in their local communities, their regions, their social classes, pulling them all up into a national elite and weakening every rival power center in the process.Because Young is a satirist, this authorial pride gets its comeuppance: We learn in a postscript that the author of the book was killed in a populist riot, leaving his manuscript unfinished.But the book doesn\u2019t tell us if the populists are able to prove its writer wrong by making their revolt \u201ceffective\u201d \u2014 if they\u2019re able to take power as well as instigate violence, and if they can actually govern once they\u2019ve overthrown the pompous mandarins.The evidence of our own era suggests that they might not be so capable. It suggests, in fact, that when meritocracy loses credibility and legitimacy, the result is a political impasse. The official elite becomes too arrogant and self-deceiving and unpopular to govern effectively, but the populist alternative is much as Young\u2019s narrator describes \u2014 disorganized, ill-led, susceptible to snake-oil salesmen and vulnerable to manipulation by factions within the upper class.In this situation, which is ours, the meritocrats have no mandate and no sense of why the public hates them \u2014 believing, with Sikorski and the Macron apparatchik, that their governance was wise and just and there\u2019s nothing wrong with meritocracy that can\u2019t be fixed with more of it. But the populists have no competence and no coherent program, and so all their revolt can win is stalemate.Different versions of this impasse exist in Britain, France and the United States. In the British version the forces of populism won a stunning victory in the Brexit referendum but lacked real leaders (save hacks and opportunists) and a clear plan for pushing forward (save implausible promises). The result is Theresa May\u2019s shambolic attempt to deliver the impossible, a job she\u2019s graced with because nobody else wants it \u2014 save Jeremy Corbyn, whose left-populism seems entirely unready for power in its own way.In France the \u201cgilets jaunes\u201d protests have brought populist fury from France\u2019s peripheries into the heart of Paris and wrecked Macron\u2019s centrist-technocratic plans. But as a political force the protest movement remains essentially inchoate, now pulled toward the far left and now toward the far right, awaiting leadership and vision. Which, judging by the equally dismal approval ratings of Macron\u2019s rivals, is something that French politics is unlikely to supply.In the United States the populists theoretically hold the White House, under a president who promised to be a traitor to his class. Except that these promises were mostly just a con job, the Trump inner circle is a parliament of opportunists, and his administration\u2019s policy agenda has been steered by the Republican Party\u2019s business elite rather than by the voters who elected him.Each case is a variation on the same theme, a slightly different intimation of the meritocratic endgame that Michael Young foresaw 60 years ago. A governing class that has vaulting self-confidence and dwindling credibility, locked in stalemate with populist movements that are easily grifted upon and offer more grievances than plans.In theory the impasse can be overcome. That\u2019s what statesmanship is for \u2014 to bridge gaps between complacent winners and angry losers, to weld populism\u2019s motley grievances into a new agenda suited for the times, to manifest an elitism that is magnanimous instead of arrogant.But can the system we have really produce such a statesman? The next one we find will be the first. Advertisement"}

David Hochschild is a member of the California Energy Commission.Democrats and Republicans have clashed fiercely on many issues \u2014 the Mueller investigation, immigration, gun control \u2014 but can the two parties come together on climate change, the biggest issue of all?Should the United States require fossil fuel companies to pay a carbon tax and use the money to reduce other taxes (such as income tax) by an equal amount? Eighty-four percent of Democrats and 56 percent of Republicans said yes.Asked, \u201cWhen there\u2019s a conflict between environmental protection and economic growth, which do you think is more important?\u201d 85 percent of Democrats and 52 percent of Republicans said that environmental protection should come first.The survey also found that majorities in both parties think the government should fund research into solar and wind energy, offer tax rebates to those buying energy-efficient vehicles and solar panels, and encourage schools to teach children about the causes and consequences of global warming, and potential solutions. A majority of Democrats and Republicans believe the United States should participate in the Paris climate accord and reduce greenhouse gas emissions regardless of what other countries do.Climate change activists would do well to embrace Americans like Mike Schaff, even if they don\u2019t agree on everything.Many conservative Republicans feel that frightening news of climate change usually comes from alarmist liberals who belittle their religious faith, elitists who condescend to them and a federal government that, until Mr. Trump, had forgotten them. Curiously, Americans who live near extreme flooding and fires are no more likely to worry about climate change than those far from the threat of such disasters. But that doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t change their minds. Democrats should celebrate Republicans who are out front on climate change. The Republican mayor of San Diego, Kevin Faulconer, recently announced, as a \u201cnonpartisan issue,\u201d his city\u2019s commitment to achieve 100 percent renewable energy by 2035 \u2014 a goal that is 10 years sooner than the one that California\u2019s Democratic governor, Jerry Brown, set for the state. Twenty-nine states have renewable energy mandates in place; 13 were signed into law by Republican governors. So while Americans have been focusing on the split between Democrats and Republicans, the more important gap may now be between Republican voters and the leaders they elected.Unpredictable weather is not new, of course, but recent events are making climate change harder than ever to ignore, let alone deny. Over the past two years, wildfires have burned nearly three million acres in California, while hurricanes have battered the Southeast with increasing intensity.The smoking ruins of Paradise, Calif., and Houston\u2019s flooded homes, are as shocking and devastating, in their own ways, as the tragedy of Sept. 11. Climate change is a different kind of emergency. It does not occur on a single day, and no one person gave the order. But in the long run its impact will be greater. It\u2019s time for us to join hands across party lines to address it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "An Official Welcome", "Date": "2018-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning. Or as some of you reading this might say, \u201cmagandang umaga,\u201d or \u201cbuenos d\u00edas,\u201d or \u201cj\u00f3 reggelt.\u201dIt might not even be morning to you. Maybe you\u2019re stumbling across this as you end your shift or maybe you\u2019re traveling.Today, I\u2019m officially introducing myself.I\u2019m a California native \u2014 born at U.C.L.A. Medical Center. But when I was 2, my dad got a good job in Kansas City, so my parents packed up and left the place where they grew up for the Midwest.Now, I understand it for the smart career move that it was. For the 10 years we lived outside the Golden State, though, I only ever wanted to go back.Whenever we\u2019d fly into LAX to visit my grandparents and my cousins, it felt like coming home for reasons I couldn\u2019t really articulate.Part of it was that in Kansas, I never quite forgot that I looked different from my tawny-headed classmates, who sometimes asked if I was Chinese. That was hurtful only because it underscored that I\u2019d never be like them at an age when I just wanted to fit in.My mom is Japanese-American and my dad is of Russian Jewish descent. And in California, I felt like I could be just another face in the crowd \u2014 whether we were at an udon restaurant with my mom\u2019s parents in Gardena or the West Hollywood comedy club where my paternal grandmother worked.I share this because it captures the peculiar magic of California for me.We eventually moved back, to the Mission Viejo area. Then I went to college at U.C. Berkeley and worked in Bakersfield, Orange County and Los Angeles as a reporter. During that time, I learned California is a place that\u2019s impossible to explain, to encapsulate in any one way.But it\u2019s a place where almost anyone can feel at home.And that\u2019s what I want California Today to help you feel. I want you to look forward to opening the newsletter every morning, knowing that you\u2019ll start the day understanding your state a little better, even if it\u2019s boundless.To achieve this, we\u2019ll be rethinking the newsletter from greeting to kicker. You\u2019ll notice us trying different formats and features.I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is, \u201cWelcome.\u201d(A note: We often link to content on sites that limit access for nonsubscribers. We appreciate you reading Times stories, but we\u2019d also encourage you to support local news if you can.)Now, instead of rolling the dice when you head toward the ocean \u2014 not knowing whether that tiny beach your friend told you about has a bathroom or parking \u2014 you can now check an app.Of course, regulators were happy to tout the unique collaboration.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C. Berkeley.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Albany: Put New York\u2019s Needs Before Your Own", "Date": "2018-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLawmakers should move fast to make the state\u2019s politics fairer, more honest and more democratic.The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.After winning a $50,000 raise and becoming the highest-paid state legislators in the country, lawmakers in New York, one might think, would turn their focus to the people\u2019s work. Instead, the Assembly speaker, Carl Heastie, whined this week that the pay increase didn\u2019t keep up with the increase in the cost of living since the Legislature\u2019s last raise 20 years ago.Speaker Heastie has said he is on board with many of these improvements. With Democrats taking control of the State Senate in January, unifying the government under their control, they will have an opportunity to move forward with a liberal agenda blocked for years by Republicans, from ethics and voting reforms to legislation that strengthens abortion rights and tenant protections, and implements criminal justice reform. To be successful, New York State legislators will have to change the way they conduct business, putting New Yorkers\u2019 needs before their own. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Kernel of Human (or Rodent) Kindness ", "Date": "2018-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat we can learn from lab rats that don\u2019t show empathy for other rats. Mr. Garrett is an illustrator and a writer. People tend to empathize more readily with those who look, sound and behave like themselves. We feel the pain more acutely of those who resemble us. How then can empathy serve as a moral guide when it is morality\u2019s role to lead us away from cruelty toward people outside our own group?Scientists at the University of Chicago further explored the nature of empathy in rats. They found that a white rat raised among only white rats will do nothing to save a black rat from a trap. Rats, like humans, can be biased in how they act on, or don\u2019t act on, their empathy. In a variant of the experiment, a white rat raised among only black rats would save a black rat from a trap \u2014 but would fail to save other white rats. And a white rat raised among black and white rats rescued rats of both colors. The researchers found that it is not the rat\u2019s color that determines which type of rat it will show empathy for, but the social context in which it was raised.In short, rats do not show empathy because of an innate recognition of similarity in physical appearance. Likewise, when human empathy can be partial, it is because the experiences of people from some groups are hidden from our view, which limits our empathy toward them. It\u2019s vital to recognize that prejudice is not baked-in: It is the result of our ignorance. A failure to learn about people (or rats) of different kinds can mean that we fail to recognize their pain as genuine pain. Empathy can be switched off.Empathy by itself is not enough. It becomes an accurate guide for moral action only when combined with knowledge of people of all different backgrounds \u2014 knowledge that can be attained only if you are willing to actively listen to people whose voices have been silenced.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Mexican Border as Refugee Camp", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Trump administration plans to send asylum seekers back to Mexico. What will happen to them there?Contributing Opinion Writer The rain mixed with sewage that was leaking from broken toilets, forming putrid puddles that seeped into the tents and prompted a vain scramble for dry spaces. I saw one young mother squatting in filthy water, trying to comfort her sick baby. The city government eventually closed the park because of the unsanitary conditions. The men, women and children who have traveled north in a stream of caravans in recent months have grabbed attention because it is unusual for people to move through Mexico together in such large numbers. It\u2019s even more unusual for them to have to seek temporary shelter in such awful conditions. There are refugee camps in many places in the world, but that one existed right next to the American border, where its occupants could literally see California, is disturbing. I\u2019m worried that such scenes will come to seem normal. The Trump administration\u2019s announcement on Thursday that it will make some asylum seekers wait in Mexico while their court cases are resolved in the United States makes this very likely. Mexico has increasingly become a transit country for refugees and migrants \u2014 especially those fleeing gang violence and government crackdowns in Central America. This puts it in a similar position to Turkey and Italy, where the passage of refugees and migrants has caused enormous domestic problems.Cooperation on finding a regional solution to the causes of the exodus would be a big step forward. But Mexico should not agree to house United States asylum seekers as part of any bigger deal. This would leave refugees in a painful, drawn-out limbo. The growth of long-term refugee camps along the border could also cause resentment among Mexicans, who are already questioning their obligations toward the caravan members. And it could lead to more conflict between frustrated refugees and border guards that snarl border crossing points, hurting the millions of people who rely on cross-border commerce and travel.The scenes of border guards firing tear gas into Mexico and migrants in sewage-filled water next to the United States should not be something we become accustomed to seeing. This should not become our new normal. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "News Flash: No Major Damage Done at G-20!", "Date": "2018-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump refrained from publicly vilifying American institutions, assailing political adversaries, insulting allies or committing major gaffes.Ms. Rice was the national security adviser during President Barack Obama\u2019s second term.Rarely might one expect much drama at the annual gathering of the Group of 20 leaders, except perhaps during a major global crisis, such as the financial meltdown of 2008 and 2009. Still these are important meetings at which American leadership normally yields significant outcomes that benefit the country\u2019s economy and national security.However, with Donald Trump as president, one can be forgiven for worrying what chaos may ensue at yet another multilateral forum. I have learned to brace myself for blows to our national standing every time Mr. Trump travels abroad \u2014 the mental equivalent of a pre-emptive defensive crouch.Last week\u2019s meeting in Buenos Aires was no different. In fact, it appeared to be an even more inauspicious moment than usual for a high-stakes foreign trip. Ukraine and Russia remain on hair-trigger war footing, while President Trump resorted inexplicably to his classic \u201cboth sides-ism\u201d rather than clearly condemning Russian aggression.Against this backdrop, and grading on a curve (since every grade can\u2019t be an F lest it become meaningless), President Trump\u2019s trip to the G-20 could have been a lot worse. We can exhale, noting that no major damage was done.This time, Mr. Trump refrained from publicly vilifying core United States institutions like the courts, the F.B.I. and C.I.A. He neither assailed his political adversaries nor committed major gaffes. Without explanation, Mr. Trump downgraded to private pull-asides two previously planned full bilateral meetings with the Turkish and South Korean leaders, but, thankfully, he avoided insulting any treaty ally. He even flattered his usual nemesis, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.The president was not caught lavishing praise on dictatorial adversaries, having wisely (if likely for reasons other than those claimed) canceled a replay of the disastrous one-on-one meeting with Vladimir Putin of Russia in Helsinki. While we will never know what Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin discussed informally at the G-20 dinner, their exchange was comparatively abbreviated and perhaps less risky. In addition, Mr. Trump avoided a full-on, public embrace of the pariah crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, leaving it to Mr. Putin and the prince to mime how fellow thugs salute each other when America has taken leave of its moral leadership.No progress appears to have been made on addressing key global security challenges such as renewed Russian aggression against Ukraine, the Saudi-led war in Yemen, or the unabated North Korean nuclear threat. Rather than rally the Western world to impose additional sanctions on Russia or to punish the Saudis for murdering an American resident in cold blood and repeatedly lying about it, President Trump and his team again took a pass on exerting traditional American leadership. These were significant missed opportunities but not new sins of commission.Finally, President Trump chose to tap the brakes rather than drive the United States-China relationship over the cliff. By agreeing with President Xi Jinping of China to pause additional tariffs for 90 days to allow for continued trade negotiations in exchange for vague Chinese commitments to buy more American goods \u2014 plus a welcome commitment to restrict the availability of fentanyl \u2014 Mr. Trump has postponed escalation of his costly and risky trade war with Beijing. While perhaps only a temporary respite, this marks the most significant result of the G-20 gathering.With Mr. Trump back on American soil, we can safely conclude that, at least this time, we dodged another blow to our national honor, even as we have surrendered our global leadership and become mostly a global bystander. We can only hope that Mr. Trump and his top advisers will now discern that less is more when it comes to this president\u2019s travels abroad.Advertisement"}

I\u2019m Virginia, from Virginia.\u201d I still remember the sound of her voice, puffed as if meringue whisked in air. The Southern accent gave me a start in this crisp place, a boarding school in the small town of Concord, Mass.I did not understand what wealth was before I arrived at Middlesex, a campus replete with colonial red brick and its very own pond, woods and chapel. It was there that I first heard about yachts on the Mediterranean and personal cosmetics supplied from Paris while listening in on my classmates\u2019 easy chatter. They were rich, white and cultured. I was black and from Ohio. People I had never met had donated to the school, gifts that ultimately paid my tuition, room and board. My fellow students mostly did not see me: a brown girl in red plastic glasses on full scholarship. I was an alien on those beautiful grounds of rolling green. I did not know how to be.I did not know then that Virginia\u2019s family was staunchly Republican, or that she didn\u2019t invite me down South for a holiday for fear that her grandmother would make me enter through the back door. I could not conceive at the age of 16 that speaking in a Southern accent made Virginia feel alien on our New England campus, too. What I knew was that this friendship helped me to remain intact despite the assaults on my sense of self-worth that were rarely intentional but cut just as deeply.Because of Virginia\u2019s daring, I learned that it was not impossible to eat brownie mix straight from the box instead of following the directions. Today we remain friendly, decades after we graduated from high school. She told me that she sees herself as a fiscal Republican and a social Democrat, and teaches her kids that allies come in all kinds of packages. The philosopher Alexander Nehamas suggests, in a graceful book, \u201cOn Friendship,\u201d that this genre of relationship, though indescribably life transforming, is not readily adaptable to broader political goals. The sphere of friendship, he points out, is intimate and closed by nature, the opposite of what a movement for social change must be. But what if the power of friendship is a quiet movement unto itself, one heart at a time, shrinking the shadows between us?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Jerry Brown Has the Power to Save 740 Lives. He Should Use It.", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySix former governors call on California\u2019s governor to follow in their footsteps and grant clemency to death row prisoners. The authors granted clemency to death row prisoners in their states. Among a governor\u2019s many powers, none is more significant than signing a death warrant. It\u2019s a terrible responsibility, hard even to imagine until you\u2019re asked to carry it out, as we were. But we became convinced that it wasn\u2019t something a civilized society should ask of its leaders. That\u2019s why we halted executions in our states, and we call on Gov. Jerry Brown of California to do the same. Mr. Brown has done a remarkable job in his four terms. His overhaul of the state\u2019s criminal justice system has ensured his legacy as one of the most courageous and effective governors in California\u2019s history. Some of the changes include eliminating cash bail; prohibiting the incarceration of children under 12; no longer allowing children younger than 16 to be tried as adults; and prohibiting prosecutors from charging accomplices with first-degree murder.Even the most ardent proponents of capital punishment would shudder at composing a plan to execute 740 people. Would California\u2019s citizens allow mass executions? If the state were to execute a single person every day, people would still be waiting on death row after two years.Vicente Benavides might have been one of them. In April, the California Supreme Court released him from death row at San Quentin, where he spent 25 years after being convicted based on evidence that the court found was \u201cfalse, extensive, pervasive and impactful.\u201d We know a leader must then ask: \u201cAre there more people wrongly convicted among the 740 in my custody?\u201d Perhaps. The Death Penalty Information Center reports that 164 men and women have been found innocent and released from death rows around the country since 1973, five of them from California. Even more disturbing, the National Academy of Sciences found that at least 4 percent of people on death row were and are probably innocent. This is the horror every governor of a killing state has to live with.Since the death penalty was reinstated in the United States in 1976, 11 governors have granted clemency to death row prisoners in their states. They did not free them; they either reduced their sentences to life, declared a moratorium on executions or repealed their death penalty. We have all done one of these; so have Gov. George Ryan of Illinois in 2003; Gov. Jon Corzine of New Jersey in 2007; Gov. Dannel Malloy of Connecticut in 2012; Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington in 2014; and Gov. Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania in 2015.The achievement of high office demands that one be courageous in leadership. Mr. Brown now has the chance to do what others in our ranks have done after they became aware of the price paid for taking a human life. We were compelled to act because we have come to believe the death penalty is an expensive, error-prone and racist system, and also because our morality and our sense of decency demanded it. Richard Celeste was the governor of Ohio. John Kitzhaber was the governor of Oregon. Martin O\u2019Malley was the governor of Maryland. Bill Richardson was the governor of New Mexico. Pat Quinn was the governor of Illinois. Toney Anaya was the governor of New Mexico.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Coming Out to the Dead", "Date": "2018-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI didn\u2019t have the courage to tell my grandmother I was gay until it was too late.Ms. Spataro is writing a memoir.Coming out to loved ones is hard. It\u2019s even harder when they\u2019ve died before you gathered the courage to do it.I never came out to my grandmother, who died this year. Instead of planning an awkward announcement over a Thanksgiving turkey, I settled for making a posthumous declaration to her seafoam-green box of remains. I hadn\u2019t seen her alive in 20 years, the same year I started putting words to the warm, tingling feelings I had for girls. As 32-year-old me spoke to the box, I left a pause, leaving room for how she would have responded to the words, \u201cGrandma, I\u2019m gay.\u201dMy fianc\u00e9e, Lara, opened the brown package to reveal 10 copies of my grandmother\u2019s death certificate and a smooth container the color of my home office chair. She was in there, and I expected a rush of the appropriate feelings at the sight of a loved one\u2019s remains. Instead I felt numb. The container was heavier than I expected, but how heavy had I anticipated? This was my whole Grandma, bright blue house dress, brown-bobbed haircut and caked-on hot pink lipstick, now distilled into a fine sand.The Grandma I last remembered toddling out of the arrivals hall at Charlotte Douglas International Airport when I was 12 years old. She was visiting from the South Bronx, where her son, my dad, grew up. My parents didn\u2019t yet know I was gay; still, they sensed my hurt, and they were furious about Grandma dismissing me at the airport and on the trip in general. Her entire visit was clouded by the single, first encounter.Over the next 20 years, I began to come out to the world: first to my parents at age 16, then my select friends in my early 20s, and finally, at 28, on the cover of my local L.G.B.T. magazine. Grandma never found out. We had short phone conversations on holidays and birthdays. \u201cI just want you to know how much I love you and think about you all the time,\u201d she\u2019d say before handing the phone back to my aunt.My mom pointed it out over dinner. \u201cShe looks just like Olimpia!\u201d she\u2019d say, and my dad could barely look at me in that moment, pained to see the face of the woman who never gave him the love and support he needed. But the smaller details, the sort of things you feel but can\u2019t see, were what really got me. I love \u2014 love! \u2014 shopping at the mall; so did she. My aunt told me about how Grandma would ask her to open the front door because she \u201cneeded the air,\u201d sitting on a chair in the open doorway. Likewise, I found myself \u201cneeding the air\u201d when I was stressed, sitting on a kitchen chair looking onto my patio. We shared unusual eating habits: I\u2019d hold a cookie in my lips and devour it, hands free; that\u2019s how Grandma ate buttery Pepperidge Farm Milanos and Chessmen.Even with this, I knew our commonalities were a double-edged sword: She was someone who was intolerant of other people\u2019s decisions; when I was born, she insisted on calling me Joanna instead of Joanne. My mom, still lying in a hospital bed, had to duke it out with her about my true name. Even from the start, Grandma wanted it her way. I know how it feels; will I someday be as ornery as her?After her death, my dad emailed me a scan of a drawing I did of Grandma and me when I was 10. In the color-pencil sketch, we\u2019re holding hands in the Carolina Place mall. She\u2019s carrying a shopping bag in rainbow colors, which she never carried in real life. We\u2019re both smiling. That afternoon I rode the subway with Grandma\u2019s remains en route to a Barnes & Noble bookstore on the Upper West Side, where I was to hand them off to my aunt. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "5 Takeaways From Facebook\u2019s Leaked Moderation Documents", "Date": "2018-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySometimes an emoji is just an emoji. Sometimes it may be a threat.And with only a few seconds to spare, Facebook moderators have to make the call \u2014 even if the text that accompanies the laughing yellow face is in an unfamiliar language.To help with those decisions, Facebook has created a list of guidelines for what its two billion users should be allowed to say. The rules, which are regularly updated, are then given to its moderators.For Facebook, the goal is clarity. But for the thousands of moderators across the world, faced with navigating this byzantine maze of rules as they monitor billions of posts per day in over 100 languages, clarity is hard to come by.Facebook keeps its rulebooks and their existence largely secret. But The New York Times acquired 1,400 pages from these guidelines, and found problems not just in how the rules are drafted but in the way the moderation itself is done.Here are five takeaways from our story:The rules are discussed over breakfast every other Tuesday in a conference room in Menlo Park, Calif. \u2014 far from the social unrest that Facebook has been accused of accelerating.Though the company does consult outside groups, the rules are set largely by young lawyers and engineers, most of whom have no experience in the regions of the world they are making decisions about.The rules they create appear to be written for English speakers who at times rely on Google Translate. That suggests a lack of moderators with local language skills who might better understand local contexts.Facebook employees say they have not yet figured out, definitively, what sorts of posts can lead to violence or political turmoil. The rulebooks are best guesses.Some of the rules given to moderators are inaccurate, outdated or missing critical nuance.One presentation, for example, refers to the Bosnian war criminal Ratko Mladic as a fugitive, though he was arrested in 2011.Another appears to contain errors about Indian law, advising moderators that almost any criticism of religion should be flagged as probably illegal. In fact, criticizing religion is only illegal when it is intended to inflame violence, according to a legal scholar.In Myanmar, a paperwork error allowed a prominent extremist group, accused of fomenting genocide, to stay on the platform for months.Facebook outsources moderation to companies that hire the thousands of workers who enforce the rules. In some of these offices, moderators say they are expected to review many posts within eight to 10 seconds. The work can be so demanding that many moderators only last a few months.The moderators say they have little incentive to contact Facebook when they run across flaws in the process. For its part, Facebook largely allows the companies that hire the moderators to police themselves.Facebook is growing more assertive about barring groups and people, as well as types of speech, that it believes could lead to violence.In countries where the line between extremism and mainstream politics is blurry, the social network\u2019s power to ban some groups and not others means that it is, in essence, helping pick political winners and losers.Sometimes it removes political parties, like Golden Dawn in Greece, as well as mainstream religious movements in Asia and the Middle East. This can be akin to Facebook shutting down one side in national debates, one expert argues.Some interventions are more subtle. During elections in Pakistan, it told moderators to apply extra scrutiny to one party, but called another \u201cbenign.\u201dAnd its decisions often skew in favor of governments, which can fine or regulate Facebook.Even as Facebook tries to limit dangerous content on its platform, it is working to grow its audience in more countries.That tension can sometimes be seen in the guidelines.Moderators reviewing posts about Pakistan, for example, are warned against creating a \u201cPR fire\u201d by doing anything that might \u201chave a negative impact on Facebook\u2019s reputation or even put the company at legal risk.\u201dAnd by relying on outsourced workers to do most of the moderation, Facebook can keep costs down even as it sets rules for over two billion users.Advertisement"}

Even her daughter, now 11, watched the images of Ms. Hemphill passed out beside a guardrail in West Deptford, N.J., her stomach exposed as the medics rushed in. \u201cWhy bother saving her?\u201d asked one YouTube commenter. \u201cI would\u2019ve let her die,\u201d said another.\u201cWhen you type my name in, that\u2019s the first video that pops up \u2014 an overdose video,\u201d Ms. Hemphill said.Before the videos, Ms. Hemphill and other users shuffled unnoticed from the streets to rehab to jail and back in a cycle of use and arrests. Their anonymity disappeared afterward as news cameras showed up at their front doors and reporters attended their court dates on charges including drug possession and child endangerment.Angry Facebook messages arrived months, even years, later, when strangers stumbled across the videos.But for others, the viral attention also became their emergency flare. Rehab centers and drug counselors reached out, waived fees and helped them bypass waiting lists to get into treatment.In October 2016, Ron Hiers and his wife, Carla, feeling despondent after years of addiction, had made a suicide pact to get high until they were dead, and ended up passed out by a bus stop in Memphis. A bystander live-streamed footage of the couple, and the video of them being mocked and laughed at was viewed by hundreds of thousands of people.One of them was Mr. Hiers\u2019s estranged daughter. Mr. Hiers, 62, said they had not spoken in months or years, but his daughter told him that she had been in touch with a rehab facility that was willing to give him the treatment he needed.For some, the public shaming was a new way to hit bottom.\u201cIf that video never happened, I probably would have never went to treatment at all,\u201d Ms. Hemphill, 28, said.A Florida drug treatment center offered to pay her fees, and Ms. Hemphill flew down and stayed for a month. But she felt as if she was just playing a part in a news media narrative about addiction and recovery. As soon as she returned home to New Jersey, she got high again.\u201cI didn\u2019t want to be clean,\u201d she said. \u201cI was doing it for the news.\u201dShe enrolled in a long-term treatment center in Newark, and then moved to a halfway house, where people smoke crack and shoot up in a park across the street. She says she has no desire to join them, and has not used in nearly a year.Addiction experts say the videos are doing little else than publicly shaming drug users, and the blunt horror of the images may actually increase the stigma against them. Users themselves disagree on whether the humiliation helped them clean up their lives.\u201cWe\u2019re showing you this video of them at the worst, most humiliating moment of their life,\u201d said Daniel Raymond, deputy director of policy and planning at the Harm Reduction Coalition, an advocacy group. \u201cThe intent is not to help these people. The intent is to use them as an object lesson by scapegoating them.\u201dBut police departments say they are simply trying to reveal the brutal reality of what they see every day.In Lawrence, Mass., a former mill town at the heart of New England\u2019s opioid crisis, the police chief released a particularly gut-wrenching video. It showed a mother who had collapsed from a fentanyl overdose sprawled out in the toy aisle of a Family Dollar while her sobbing 2-year-old daughter tugged at her arm.\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking,\u201d James Fitzpatrick, who was the Lawrence police chief at the time, told reporters in September 2016. \u201cThis is definitely evidence that shows what addiction can do to someone.\u201dMandy McGowan, 38, knows that. She was the mother unconscious in that video, the woman who became known as the \u201cDollar Store Junkie.\u201d But she said the video showed only a few terrible frames of a complicated life.As a child, she said, she was sexually molested. She survived relationships with men who beat her. She barely graduated from high school.She said her addiction to opioids began after she had neck surgery in 2006 for a condition that causes spasms and intense pain. Her neurologist prescribed a menu of strong painkillers including OxyContin, Percocet and fentanyl patches.As a teenager, Ms. McGowan had smoked marijuana and taken mushrooms and ecstasy. But she always steered clear of heroin, she said, thinking it was for junkies, for people living in alleys. But her friends were using it, and over the last decade, she sometimes joined them.She tried to break her habit by buying Suboxone \u2014 a medication used to treat addiction \u2014 on the street. But the Suboxone often ran out, and she turned to heroin to tide her over.On Sept. 18, 2016, a friend came to Ms. McGowan\u2019s house in Salem, N.H., and offered her a hit of fentanyl, a deadly synthetic painkiller 50 times more potent than heroin. They sniffed a line and drove to the Family Dollar across the state line in Lawrence, where Ms. McGowan collapsed with her daughter beside her. At least two people in the store recorded the scene on their cellphones.Medics revived her and took her to the hospital, where child welfare officials took custody of her daughter, and the police charged Ms. McGowan with child neglect and endangerment. (She eventually pleaded guilty to both and was sentenced to probation.) Two days later, the video of her overdose was published by The Eagle-Tribune and was also released by the Lawrence police.The video played in a loop on the local news, and vaulted onto CNN and Fox News, ricocheting across the web.\u201cFor someone already dealing with her own demons, she now has to deal with public opinion, too,\u201d said Matt Ganem, the executive director of the Banyan Treatment Center, about 15 miles north of Boston, which gave Ms. McGowan six months of free treatment after being contacted by intermediaries. \u201cYou\u2019re a spectacle. Everyone is watching.\u201dMs. McGowan had only seen snippets of the video on the news. But two months later, she watched the whole thing. She felt sick with regret.\u201cI see it, and I\u2019m like, I was a piece of freaking [expletive],\u201d she said. \u201cThat was me in active use. It\u2019s not who I am today.\u201dBut she also wondered: Why didn\u2019t anyone help her daughter? She was furious that bystanders seemed to feel they had license to gawk and record instead of comforting her screaming child.\u201cI know what I did, and I can\u2019t change it,\u201d she said. \u201cI live with that guilt every single day. But it\u2019s also wrong to take video and not help.\u201dNobody recorded the chaos that unfolded next. After Ms. McGowan was released from treatment, the father of her daughter died of an overdose. Two months later, that man\u2019s 19-year-old son also died of an overdose.Reeling, Ms. McGowan had a night of relapse with alcohol. She checked herself into treatment the next day. But at the same time, she had stopped reporting to her probation officer, a violation of parole that led to 64 days in jail. She was kicked out of a halfway house and stayed briefly at a shelter. She said she was raped this year. She checked herself into a hospital psychiatric ward for five weeks.Ms. McGowan finally felt ready to start actively rebuilding her life. This spring, she moved to a halfway house in Boston, where her days were packed with appointments with counselors and clinicians, and meetings of Narcotics Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous. She had weighed just 90 pounds when she overdosed; now she was happily above 140.Just after Thanksgiving she moved in with relatives, and now hopes to find a place of her own. Her treatment continues. If she stays sober and shows progress, the charges against her will be dropped in April.She spends part of her day doing volunteer outreach along the open-air drug market in Boston known as Methadone Mile. One recent drizzly afternoon, as she made her way down the sidewalk, she hugged old friends, asked them whether they had eaten, if they were O.K. On her rounds, she picks up hundreds of used needles that carpet the streets.She writes letters to her two teenage sons, who live with her former husband in New Hampshire. Her daughter, now 4, lives with the girl\u2019s uncle. Ms. McGowan knows she will probably not regain custody, but hopes to develop a relationship with her and supplant the image embedded in her own mind of the sobbing girl in the pink pajamas.\u201cI know if I do the right thing, I can be involved in her life,\u201d Ms. McGowan said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long road for me. You don\u2019t just get clean and your life is suddenly all put back together.\u201dStill, the video lives on, popping up online almost constantly.Ms. McGowan is bracing herself for the day when her daughter sees it, when her daughter lashes out at her for it, when she throws it back in her mother\u2019s face when Ms. McGowan tries to warn her not to use drugs.\u201cThat video is PTSD for my children,\u201d she said. \u201cThe questions are going to come as my daughter gets older. And I have to be prepared for it. I did this. And it cost me my children.\u201dIn October 2017, June Schweinhart and a friend snorted lines of heroin in a S.U.V. in Boynton Beach, Fla., and then began to pass out. Their infant children were strapped in the back seat when the police and paramedics showed up in a bank parking lot, body cameras rolling.The women\u2019s children were placed with relatives, and Ms. Schweinhart and her friend were each charged with child neglect. An officer told Ms. Schweinhart that the video of their overdoses would be on the news. She decided to watch.\u201cIt looked like a whole different person,\u201d Ms. Schweinhart said. \u201cIt was a reality check. Some people have different rock bottoms in their life and they get to the point where they just can\u2019t do it anymore \u2014 that was it for me.\u201dShe had been hiding her heroin use from her family and friends \u2014 even from people at her addiction-support group, who believed she was only abusing prescription painkillers.Nobody had known. And suddenly, everybody knew.People on Facebook sent her messages calling her an abusive mother for jeopardizing the life of her month-old daughter. They told her to just die. They asked: How could you do something like that?Remembering the video, recalling the babies\u2019 cries and watching the responding officer slip a pacifier into one of their mouths, Ms. Schweinhart did not have an answer.\u201cIt made me sick to my stomach,\u201d she said. \u201cIt still does.\u201dShe said that every day was a battle with herself \u2014 the good June against the bad June \u2014 and she came to think of the video, with all its shame and humiliation, as a divine intervention to force her to get treatment and confront her addiction.It didn\u2019t proceed like a movie. She repeatedly struggled with the demands of drug court, failed a drug test and spent one night in jail. Last month, Ms. Schweinhart left the program.She said she had been making progress and believed she could beat the child-neglect charge if she could tell a jury the story about what happened after the one that millions had already seen. Or she could plead out.Either way, she felt she had nothing left to hide.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Jim Mattis Failed ", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHe may have been \u2018the adult in the room,\u2019 but he never offered much of a check on an errant president.Mr. Stevenson is a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies.Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, who submitted his resignation on Thursday, was the last \u201cadult in the room\u201d of the Trump administration \u2014 or so claim a small army of pundits, who now worry that the president, finally unchecked, will unleash an unvarnished, unpredictable America First foreign policy on the world. There\u2019s no arguing that Mr. Mattis is an admirable man who did his best to counter an erratic president. The question is whether he succeeded in his mission. Mr. Mattis\u2019s original plan may have been to subtly guide the ship of state through treacherous international waters for four years. The president\u2019s heedlessness and, especially, his disregard for the United States\u2019 strategic alliances, partnerships and reputation made that scenario infeasible. If Mr. Mattis had ever hoped that veteran military figures like himself could rein in the president, that illusion was shattered in April with the ignominious departure of Gen. H.R. McMaster as national security adviser.Mr. Mattis and the president occasionally agreed \u2014 for instance, on the United States\u2019 withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. Initially, he and General McMaster got Mr. Trump to denounce torture (grudgingly), walk back the spurning of NATO, recertify the Iran nuclear deal (twice) and, to some extent, stiffen his position on President Vladimir Putin of Russia and sporadically acknowledge Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election.But Mr. Trump did not consult Mr. Mattis before withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal or suspending joint United States-South Korea military exercises in June, at the Singapore summit \u2014 moves Mr. Mattis opposed. He ignored Mr. Mattis\u2019s request that the White House secure congressional authorization before launching airstrikes in 2017 in retaliation for Syrian chemical weapons attacks. Mr. Mattis\u2019s opposition to moving the United States Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem did not seem to register, for even a second, with the president.For a while, even as the failures mounted, Mr. Mattis seemed to be holding the line: He looked like a Spartan Marine helping rescue America from a willfully ignorant, libertine businessman. Then, by early 2018, Mr. Trump started to gain confidence on foreign affairs and perhaps detect in Mr. Mattis \u2014 whom he initially fetishized as \u201cMad Dog,\u201d the archetypal military tough guy, reportedly to Mr. Mattis\u2019s chagrin \u2014 a note of condescension. The president pushed out Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and General McMaster, Mr. Mattis\u2019s de facto allies, and replaced them with Mike Pompeo and John Bolton, two more simpatico hawks.As secretary of defense, Mr. Mattis still had bureaucratic control of the American military and its assets. But that afforded him only the power of delay and limited obstruction \u2014 not a practical veto or even, necessarily, a strong voice at the table in the White House Situation Room, especially with Mr. Pompeo and Mr. Bolton backing the president\u2019s every play.That much was on display when the president ordered thousands of troops to the Mexican border this fall to repel the \u201ccaravan\u201d of immigrants he said were mounting an \u201cinvasion\u201d \u2014 a flagrantly cynical ploy to rile up his political base ahead of the midterms. Mr. Mattis seemed to understand that the deployment would amount to a technical breach of the Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts the use of the military for internal law enforcement; he sought to minimize the number of troops involved and slow-rolled the deployment. Publicly, however, he defended the move as \u201chumanitarian,\u201d proclaiming that \u201cwe don\u2019t do stunts,\u201d and ultimately acquiesced.Nor was he much for cabinet infighting. Mr. Mattis could have tried to outmaneuver Mr. Bolton \u2014 who has wanted him gone for some time \u2014 and stay in his job, discreetly devising stratagems for eluding dangers posed by Mr. Trump\u2019s erratic behavior and blunting objectionable military initiatives. James Schlesinger, secretary of defense when President Richard Nixon was self-medicated and irrational in the later days of Watergate, supposedly short-circuited Mr. Nixon\u2019s major national security decision-making authority. But he had obliging senior colleagues, including Henry Kissinger, the secretary of state.Mr. Schlesinger was also a famously cocky civilian willing to circumvent the constitutional chain of command. Mr. Mattis is cut from more regimented cloth. As commanding officer of the United States Central Command in 2013, he was candid with President Barack Obama about his reservations concerning the administration\u2019s conciliatory approach to Iran and quietly left his post early. Even as prominent Republicans as well as Democrats criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s nationalistic, anti-Europe displays in Brussels and Helsinki, Mr. Mattis offered no more than deflective, anodyne remarks. Although he admirably dragged his feet on barring transgender troops, holding a military parade and starting a space force, more interference might only have nourished Trumpian delusions about a \u201cdeep state.\u201dThe turning point for Mr. Mattis came when he backed the administration\u2019s obdurate refusal to accept the C.I.A.\u2019s assessment that the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, had most likely ordered the murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Increasingly, when Mr. Mattis hasn\u2019t appeared marginalized, he has looked tamed and compromised. Even before the Syria drawdown was announced, it was time for him to go.Jonathan Stevenson, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, was director for political-military affairs, Middle East and North Africa at the National Security Council from 2011 to 2013.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "News Networks Fall Short on Climate Story as Dolphins Die on the Beach", "Date": "2018-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMediatorNAPLES, Fla. \u2014 Most people from the Northeast move to Florida to get out of the cold. Colleen Gill came to Naples because she heard the call of the wild.She had vacationed on this slice of coastal paradise for 20 years. She made regular jaunts to the Big Cypress National Preserve, home to cypress swamps and wild panthers. She kayaked in the Gulf. With each visit, she fell more in love.Ms. Gill, 38, coveted her regular long walks on the white-sand beaches. By last summer, the walks had turned gruesome. Increasingly, there would be eels, tarpon and sea turtles dead or dying along the tide line.On community Facebook pages, neighbors accused Ms. Gill and others of getting worked up over nothing. The algae bloom was nature running its course, they said.\u201cI started going around and filming more and more and more and more,\u201d she told me as we stood on the Naples pier.In the video, Ms. Gill zoomed in on a six-foot-long, stiff, glistening dolphin carcass, its mouth frozen into a toothy smile. The creature was one of more than 20 dead bottlenose dolphins that had washed up on local beaches in recent days.At roughly the same time, in Washington, President Trump told reporters outside the White House that he had doubts about the climate change report his administration had released the day after Thanksgiving.The report warned that unmitigated global warming would take a huge economic toll on the country while causing crop failures, more extreme fires, stronger storms and, potentially, more severe algae blooms.\u201cYeah,\u201d Mr. Trump said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201dAs Steven J. Milloy, a skeptic of human-caused climate change and a member of the Trump transition team, said, there had been no need \u201cto stop the deep state\u201d from releasing the report when \u201cthis is made-up hysteria, anyway.\u201dThankfully, cable news came to the rescue by making sure that those who commented on air about a report produced by scientists across 13 federal agencies were trained experts.No, wait. That\u2019s not what happened.On CNN, the former senator Rick Santorum disputed the findings with a canard: \u201cA lot of these scientists are driven by the money that they receive,\u201d he said. The network later came under fire when \u201cAC360\u201d had Mr. Santorum on again but canceled a planned interview with an author of the government report, the atmospheric scientist Katharine Hayhoe of Texas Tech University.My depressing Florida journey took me from the deadly beach in Naples to the other side of the state, where I met with Benjamin Kirtman, the director of the Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies at the University of Miami.He suggested that television news bookers change their approach if they want to accurately reflect the debate.\u201cYou have 97 percent of climate scientists who understand the science and know what the reality is, and then you find a podiatrist from Yahupitz who\u2019s going to tell you not to worry,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a false equivalence.\u201dWe were in his office on Virginia Key, in Miami. If human causes of climate change go unmitigated, he said, the Biscayne Bay will overcome the road here at high tide half the days of the year by 2100. Last year Miamians voted to spend some $200 million on sea walls and pumps and drains to mitigate the effects of the rising sea.Yet despite that literal, concrete evidence, Professor Kirtman told me that a third of those he talks to about the data behind human-influenced climate change just don\u2019t buy it. So he has stopped trying to persuade that part of the population.\u201cThey\u2019re going to have to find out for themselves,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen they can\u2019t sell their house.\u201dThat sort of conspiracy-mongering was part of why Ms. Gill said she had decided to post videos of the red tide carnage in Naples.She knew that in the \u201cfake news\u201d era doubters could accuse her of doctoring evidence, so she came up with a solution: \u201cI decided to do it on Facebook Live, so people couldn\u2019t be like, \u2018You made that up,\u2019\u201d she told me.Still, not everyone was convinced by her posts, which have at times been met by ridicule, vitriol and ugly name-calling.On the other hand, as the arrival of television news crews suggested, she seemed to be breaking through.\u201cI don\u2019t understand the denial when there is proof of something like this affecting the animals,\u201d Ms. Fitzgerald said. \u201cI mean, you can\u2019t keep denying it.\u201dAfter a pause, she added, \u201cI mean, obviously, you can. Because people are.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the given name of the director of the von Arx Wildlife Hospital of the Conservancy of Southwest Florida.

{"Headline": "Facing the Future in Laos and the Cambodian Coast ", "Date": "2018-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe 52 Places TravelerAt the final two places on our list of 52, our columnist contemplates the swift, irrevocable changes that tourism and development are bringing.A crowd had gathered on a boat dock in the village of Nong Khiaw, where I had come with my friend Jeff and our guide, Oun, for a countryside excursion from the splendid city of Luang Prabang in Laos. Europeans in hiking boots trundled nearby, beneath mountains covered in tropical greenery, but here on the dock, the chatter was in Lao, as passers-by jockeyed for position. They all wanted selfies with a newly anointed local celebrity: a young farmer named Sone Soukchaluam, and his shiny, brand-new, silver refrigerator.\u201cIt\u2019s a lucky refrigerator,\u201d Oun explained, and began translating.The only problem is that his village, Hadsa, an hour upstream from Nong Khiaw, doesn\u2019t have electricity. He was waiting for a boat to take it home anyway.\u201cMany people ask to buy it from him at a suitable price, but he doesn\u2019t want to sell,\u201d Oun translated for me. \u201cHe thinks maybe in a few more years there will be electricity, so he\u2019ll keep it. It\u2019s something lucky for his life.\u201cIt\u2019s funny,\u201d Oun went on. \u201cHundreds of thousands of people in big towns don\u2019t get this refrigerator where they have electricity, but he got it without electricity.\u201dTo visit Luang Prabang and the surrounding countryside is to wonder how long a place with such a languorous pace, such an assured identity, could possibly last. Every morning, I woke up in the Unesco-protected historical center overlooking the mocha-latte waters of the Mekong River to the sound of rickshaws making their delivery rounds. By 5 a.m., the city was abuzz with activity, preparing for the morning alms ceremony, in which monks from all 32 Luang Prabang temples, in their tangerine robes, walked along through the center of town, collecting offerings of sticky rice that would feed them throughout the day. (Monks get all their sustenance through donations.) Nearby, the morning market was coming to life with offerings, including grilled rats on skewers, live sparrows to release for good luck, and sweet rice cakes wrapped in to-go packets of banana leaf and string. You cannot, however, find grilled bats or squirrels anymore, because of a recent ban on selling wild animals.Progress isn\u2019t always bad.While on that excursion into the country, we visited Oun\u2019s childhood home in the village of Na Yang. He\u2019s from the Tai Lue tribe, part of the Lao Loum, or lowland, ethnic group. As we arrived, his mother and aunt were spending a rainy morning under their high-stilted house, weaving intricate cotton tapestries. (His village is known for being the finest manipulators of cotton in the country.) His father, a blacksmith, showed us his shop, where he once almost died heating scrap metal that contained gunpowder residue from the Vietnam War. He also grows white, juicy worms, which he sells at the market as snacks. They invited us upstairs where we all sat on the floor and enjoyed a delicious home-cooked meal featuring steamed pumpkin and garlicky eggplant. Oun\u2019s father showed us how to ball up sticky rice with our hands and use it as a sponge to sop up chili paste.Oun\u2019s uncle, Khamsouk, who also took me around, was the first from their family to leave the village. He was a 14-year-old second grader at a primary school that didn\u2019t go past second grade when he moved to Luang Prabang to join a monastery \u2014 which was the only path for a boy without money to get an education. He spent 10 years as a novice monk, teaching himself English by listening to the radio, before a French friend of his abbot offered him a job as a tour guide, and he quit the temple. When he\u2019d earned enough money, he bought a house big enough to hold all his nieces and nephews, and encouraged them, one by one, to leave the village and get an education. Oun was one of 14 children who had lived with him.On the boat ride home, after seeing Sone, we visited a different kind of village, belonging to the Khmu people from the Lao Theung ethnic minority, who are animists, worshiping animal spirits. Everyone was hard at work doing something: child-rearing, laundry, weaving baskets, cooking coconut rice in bamboo cylinders. Boys played soccer with a rattan ball. Some carried slingshots they\u2019d later use to hunt birds. I acquired a shadow in the form of a sweet young girl in an orange shawl, quiet, but curious. When I spoke to her, she just smiled back and Oun said that\u2019s because she\u2019s never spoken. The village believes it has something to do with evil spirits when she was born. Although Laos is Communist, medical care is expensive, so there was never a thought to take her to a doctor.No streetlights, no signs of human life were visible as my taxi inched in the dark toward Sihanoukville. This seaside city is one of the fastest-growing tourist destinations on the Cambodian coast, and I had braced myself for an onslaught of neon. Instead, at 9:30 p.m., all I could see was dust billowing behind us, on a highway where pavement was more of an idea than a reality. When morning broke, the nothingness revealed itself to be a landscape of construction sites. Three high-rises were going up next to, across from, and cater-corner to Naia. Piles of trash adorned those dusty roads. Eighteen months ago, I\u2019d heard, the area 10 minutes down the coast, where Sihanoukville\u2019s Otres 1 and Occheuteal Beaches now sit, had been all beach shacks and fishermen selling their catches from baskets on top of their heads. Now the place \u2014 called \u201cthe new Macau\u201d by its developers \u2014 is blanketed in Chinese-built casinos and high-rises. A Chinatown is being built between Otres 1 and Otres 2.Infrastructure, especially roads, hasn\u2019t kept pace with development. Growth is so rapid, one expat told me, that he went looking for a crab shack he\u2019d visited three months earlier and found a brand-new neighborhood in its place.This year, too, Six Senses and Alila Hotels were supposed to open new resorts on two private islands, Krabey and Koh Russey, with jetties 10 minutes from the Sihanoukville airport. Neither will fully open until 2019, but I visited them both and was impressed, not only by the facilities, but also by their commitment to hire Cambodians and keep their environmental footprint light.Sometimes you have to know when a place is not for you. That night, I opted to move on to Kep, a quiet coastal town far to the east of Sihanoukville, even if it wasn\u2019t technically on the 52 Places list and involved a four-hour, bumpy nighttime drive. As the sun set, I felt like I was seeing Cambodia for the first time, as I passed villagers carting bundles of hay on their motorbikes while chatting on cellphones.Standing in those shells of villas it was easy to imagine what might become of this place in a few years, should developers get hold of this forgotten land. Already modernism is clashing with the area\u2019s sleepy seaside life. A fishing village I visited during an island-hopping tour was covered in trash \u2014 and yet still full of life and joy as villagers practiced their impressive volleyball skills, or played cards in the shade. Some of the trash washes up on the shore from Vietnam, which is a 40-minute drive away and closer by boat. Much of the rest can be attributed to the way, in the not-so-distant past, fishermen ate off banana leaves that they could toss off the boat with impunity. Plastic doesn\u2019t behave the same way, but old habits are hard to break.At the end of that island-hopping tour, we walked cross Rabbit Island, which has the best beaches near Kep. My guide, Kim, pulled a long stalk of grass from the ground and lazily swiped it against the foliage that lined the trail. Plastic bottles poked out from the brush, but so did a flurry of butterflies and dragonflies. The wind gusted and tugged at my straw hat. I watched the butterflies dance against the afternoon sun and thought how lucky I was to have spent a year glimpsing the world like this, in all its complexity.Previous dispatches:Advertisement"}

The bed was firm and comfortable, with an upholstered wooden bench at its foot, but was missing a blanket, which I thought I might need on what was forecast to be a chilly December night. I called down to the front desk to have one sent up, and was told it would soon be on its way. But when I returned from dinner several hours later, it had still not arrived. (I decided just to crank up the heat and go to bed.) There was a minibar in the room, but it was empty.Small but efficiently designed, with a full bathtub in addition to the shower. The bath products were by Jonathan Adler, all in a fragrant combination of citrus and sandalwood. There was excellent water pressure from the shower head.The hotel has a 24-hour gym, accessible by room key, with two treadmills, an elliptical machine and free weights. Use of the gym is included in the $12.95 daily resort fee \u2014 which I noticed on my bill after I checked out \u2014 as was the \u201cfree\u201d Wi-Fi and those bottles of water in my room.Location. Location. Location. The Revival has some kinks to work out, particularly in service, but the surrounding Mount Vernon neighborhood is an alluring weekend destination and this elegant but slightly flawed hotel is ideally situated to explore it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "He Helped Build an Artists\u2019 Utopia. Now He Faces Trial for 36 Deaths There.", "Date": "2018-12-12", "News": "FeatureMax Harris did chores and collected rent at the artists\u2019 warehouse where he lived. Now he faces trial for the deaths at a concert there \u2014 including some of his close friends.Supported byOnce a week, Max Harris is allowed to leave his 6-by-12-foot cell to go outside. The first thing he does, before the other inmates arrive in the small cement yard in Santa Rita Jail, is run around and yell, \u201cSafari!\u201d as he picks up all the bugs \u2014 the furry moths with leopard spots, the grasshoppers in jade armor. He wants to move them out of harm\u2019s way before other men in red-and-white-striped jumpsuits start playing basketball. Sometimes he\u2019ll find a honey bee in distress, lost and spinning in a circle, and he\u2019ll give it a little water, or water mixed with apple jelly, if he can find a half-eaten packet. \u201cIt nourishes it,\u201d he says. Or, he\u2019ll see a moth with cobweb stuck on its antenna, and he\u2019ll calmly, lovingly remove it. Each life is precious. Each life is beautiful. Harris, a vegan since age 14, believes this to his core. To Harris, even a fruit fly pirouetting in his cell is a miracle. \u201cIt\u2019s like a dog,\u201d he told me. \u201cA little Labrador or something. It\u2019s different, but it\u2019s still this little shard of life. It\u2019s still this spark of divinity in this moving work of art.\u201dHarris has lived in this jail in Dublin, Calif., for 18 months now. Before his arrest, he lived in Oakland, in a 10,000-square-foot warehouse filled with artists. There, near his bed, in his live-work space, a spider built a nest. He named the spider Norbit, and when Norbit\u2019s eggs hatched he named the babies Hexbit, Drillbit, Babybit and so on, and he let them stay too. In the warehouse, Harris believed that he found, for the first time, a true home for his artistic dreams, a place that sanctified creativity as he felt it should be sanctified. And he did find beauty there. But he also found a darkness blacker than anything he could ever have imagined. When I met him, last spring, his long face looked drawn, the moon tattoo on his left cheek distorted under the gravity of his sadness. His limbs drooped off his 6-foot-3 frame like the branches of a willow tree. Plugs, made from the tops of hot-sauce bottles, filled the sagging, hollowed-out lobes of his ears. He is 29, but his hair, once blue, once mohawked, once dreadlocked, is streaked with gray.In the heavy months awaiting trial, Harris has been trying to hang on to his gentleness. He has been trying to grow his compassion, so that something, anything, positive might come of all this grief. He studies Zen Buddhism. He keeps the Jewish Sabbath. He prays to his Christian God. He switches the TV from Fox News or football to Animal Planet when the other inmates, who tell him he\u2019s like a butterfly, can tolerate it. Yet life can be cruel, and even a person striving toward right thought can set off cascades of events that go incomprehensibly awry. One day in September, Harris told me that a fellow inmate found a praying mantis in the yard. The inmate cupped it in his hands, this bright green marvel. Harris thought it was one of the most spectacular things he\u2019d ever seen. The inmate who found the insect wanted to take it to his cell to keep as a pet. Harris intervened. \u201cNo, man,\u201d he said, \u201chow could you bring someone else into incarceration?\u201dThe inmate returned the praying mantis to the ground. \u201cTwo days later we went out to the yard and the thing was completely flat,\u201d Harris said, shocked by the destruction. \u201cIt\u2019s like, How do you miss that? It\u2019s beautiful.\u201dHarris grew up in Enfield, Conn., an only child in a modest condo complex with few other children. He sneaked out as often as he could to play with the kids on a neighboring street where, he said, there were \u201cactually houses, and they had yards.\u201d Louise Harris, Max\u2019s mother, was employed, on and off, as a goldsmith or a salesperson in jewelry shops. Harris\u2019s father worked as a diesel mechanic, but he had a hard time holding down jobs because he struggled with reading, many basic tasks and his temper. Harris\u2019s relationship with both his parents was always upside down. When Harris was 5, his parents got into a heated fight, and his mother came to Harris to seek advice. She marveled at the brilliance of his counsel. \u201cI wasn\u2019t just born to make you happy,\u201d Harris, the kindergartner, said. \u201cI was born to give you wisdom.\u201d Five years later, Harris\u2019s mother lost a pregnancy at six months, and she leaned on Max for comfort. \u201cWith Max,\u201d Louise told me, \u201cit was more a matter of me following him than me leading him.\u201dAt 13, Harris started wearing his hair in a mohawk. At 14, his parents divorced, and his father became addicted to drugs and alcohol. At 16, a junior in high school, Harris took his first studio art class and, like a cure in epoxy, it transformed and gave solidity to his life. His art teacher soon told his mother that her son \u201chad greatness.\u201d At night, in his carpeted basement bedroom, alongside the cats\u2019 litter box and a TV he refused to watch, Harris painted until sunrise. He didn\u2019t view art as an interest or something he was good at. He defined it as \u201ca state of being.\u201dAt Massachusetts College of Art and Design, he studied everything: painting, photography, sculpture, metalsmithing, video art. Outside class, he played and composed music: industrial jazz, future classical and surreal glockenspiel. Along with technique, his professors taught him what would prove to be their most indelible lesson: the value of living in collaborative, creative spaces. In a contemporary-art-history class, he studied Andy Warhol\u2019s Factory, John Cage\u2019s early happenings. He seized on the importance of artists inspiring one another, cross-pollinating and fueling their ideas by living under one roof.In the summer of 2012, three \u201chippie-yoga-craftspeople friends\u201d told Harris that they could all get jobs in a cafe in Golden, Colo. Harris threw a couple of duffel bags in their van to join their road trip. But when they arrived in Colorado, the guy who was supposed to employ them was not even at the cafe, which itself didn\u2019t really exist. So they kept meandering west. Harris imagined the road trip would be easier; his co-travelers argued over things he thought should be peaceful, like arcana about the Grateful Dead. Finally, the next summer, they arrived in Humboldt County, Calif., and found work on a pot farm. After a few months, he took a bus to Oakland to visit a friend.Harris spent the next year living with his friend, sometimes sleeping on the floor. Housing in Oakland was cheaper than in San Francisco, which had grown preposterously expensive: The part of the city that had once housed techno raves and all the wondrous weirdness that spawned Burning Man itself was now home to tech titans like Dropbox, Reddit and Airbnb. The creative community remained important to Oakland\u2019s self-conception. In October 2014 the Oakland rental market was the 21st-most-expensive in the country. (By December 2015, it had leapt to fourth.) An average one-bedroom then cost $1,900 a month. One day, Harris was cruising for affordable housing when he saw a long craigslist post. A similar listing appeared on Facebook:\u201cSeeking all shamanic rattlesnake sexy jungle jazz hobo gunslingers looking for a space to house gear, use studio, develop next level Shaolin discipline after driving your taxi cab late at night, build fusion earth home bomb bunker spelunker shelters, and plant herbaceous colonies in the open sun & air.\u201dThe author was a 44-year-old artist named Derick Ion Almena, and the place for rent turned out to be a couple of blocks away from the Fruitvale BART station in Oakland, near the corner of 31st Avenue and International Boulevard, across from a Wendy\u2019s. Almena was the master tenant of a big unheated industrial warehouse, but the space he offered Harris was two doors down in the same building, a storage space subleased from Custom O\u2019s auto body shop. The rent was $750 a month. Harris took it. He hung a sign on the wall that read \u201cCall Mom ASAP\u201d and started cleaning out the stuff that Almena was storing there: sheet metal, an old dentist\u2019s chair, a sawed-in-half pickup truck filled with wood. Almena was a scrapper. He collected almost anything somebody else wasn\u2019t using: bongos, plywood, fence pickets, bulletin boards, mirrors, hubcaps, plastic carousel horses.Almena wore low-rider fedoras and spoke in a slow weed-smoker\u2019s bedroom voice. He was handsome, a dark mustache and goatee on his butterscotch skin, lithe, even leonine, sexy in a way that makes you worry about the human race and its cross-wiring of attractiveness and danger. He had worked as a concert promoter; he had traveled the world; and his photography had hung in San Francisco\u2019s prestigious Yerba Buena Center for the Arts.Almena took out the lease for the warehouse in 2013 for an artist collective called Satya Yuga. He saw the warehouse, he told me when I met him in November, as \u201ca pirate ship washed up on shore, and the pirates are all insane, like after they\u2019ve gotten drunk and eaten a bunch of mushrooms and killed the captain. I was like the new captain, the crazy captain.\u201d Almena subletted out spaces to artists. He intended to hold classes and art shows at the warehouse and rent it out for events.Almena lived by what he considered to be the wisdom of the ancients: a stew of religious iconography, trance music, free love, psychedelics, archery in the Oakland hills, plus operas staged at Burning Man, an event he loved until it became, as he posted in capital letters on Facebook, a \u201cvillage of hungry ghosts. The capitalistic driven over-ticketing, pompous catering of favors and privileges,\u201d a \u201ccrotchless dot com midlife crisis.\u201d He had a fondness for the Hindu goddess Kali, who wears a skirt of dismembered arms and wields a bloody sword in one hand, a severed head in the other.The warehouse, once part of a milk-bottling plant, was later named Ghost Ship, and those words were graffitied in huge pink block letters on the building\u2019s facade. Inside, Almena started building his dream world. He and the other artists subdivided the space with walls hodgepodged together out of amps, bits of bookcase, faded hanging rugs and carved Balinese wood panels. Almena lined a hallway on both sides with pianos facing each other, so people walking through could stretch out their arms and run their fingers over both sets of keys.Harris had taken a seasonal job color-correcting greeting cards. Each weekday morning he put on a dorky shirt and rode BART into San Francisco where, he told me, nobody talked about anything more interesting than which food truck they would go to for lunch.A week or so after Harris moved into his sublet, he was commuting home from work when his cellphone rang. \u201cYou need to get back right now,\u201d Almena said. \u201cI have something, a present for you.\u201dHarris said, \u201cO.K., great.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s going to cost you,\u201d Almena said.\u201cOh,\u201d Harris replied.\u201cBut you definitely want it. You need to cough up $500.\u201dHe had drained almost all of his savings to pay his initial rent and \u201cbuy-in\u201d fee to Almena, but he withdrew $500 from an A.T.M. and returned to 31st Avenue to find a giant pirate ship on a trailer, likely someone\u2019s creation for Burning Man.In December 2014, Harris left Custom O\u2019s and moved into Ghost Ship. By that point, the 10,000-square-foot space had become deliriously maximalist: drums everywhere, chandeliers everywhere, vintage typewriters, Indonesian antiques, Afghan rugs, early 20th-century shipping trunks, dozens of pianos and organs. Just inside the front door was a 10-foot-tall wooden Garuda statue surrounded by a sprawling montage of flea-market paintings, hand tools like you might find in a long-lost grandfather\u2019s workshop, parasols, fertility-goddess statues, plastic mannequins and nostalgic family photos of God knows who. The staircase leading to the second floor, set back 12 feet from the entrance on the right side of the building, was a campy surrealist take on a Louise Nevelson collage or a post-apocalyptic disaster, depending on your point of view. The bottom third of the staircase consisted of wooden palettes; the middle third was a section of a prefab staircase; the top third was a ramp, a single plank of wood, with small wooden slats nailed across it so your feet didn\u2019t slip as you made your way up. The building had no heat. There were no fire alarms, no sprinklers, no emergency or exit lighting.Almena, who considered himself to be the father of the space, lived upstairs with his family: his wife, Micah Allison, and three dreamy, free-range hippie kids: Bolonik, Shai and Surya, then ages 11, 5 and 3. Allison, trained in dance, was serenely beautiful: raven-haired, tawny-skinned, a true testament to fertility, pulling off the title she gave herself \u2014 Mother Superior \u2014 and tribal belly dancing to the drum beats the collective made. The family had a proper kitchen, a big family bed topped with a canopy of sequined wedding shawls and a bathtub ringed with plants. The kids rode bikes and scooters around their loftlike lounge, which doubled as an event space.Harris had a live-work studio on the first floor, as did most of 15 or 20 other residents \u2014 the number varied over time. Many of the artists teetered on the edge of homelessness; one moved into the warehouse after living in her car. Down the hall from Harris was Peter Wadsworth, who was 36, the resident genius, a Reed College graduate who built drones and replicas of ancient Egyptian sculptures and who one member of the collective referred to as \u201cour Dumbledore \u2014 our wise wizard.\u201d Farther down lived Carmen Brito, then 27, a substitute teacher, poet and ceramist, into archery, survival skills and primitive arts. Jos\u00e9 Avalos, then 36, worked outside the warehouse as a carpenter and then returned to make theatrical Latin-Kabuki style masks and Polynesian-inflected papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 figurines. Anthony Perrault, then 25, another resident, was a seamstress and fashion designer with dreads. He and Almena\u2019s wife, Allison, liked to watch the documentary \u201cParis Is Burning\u201d while he colored her hair. Several evenings a month, musicians from greater Oakland would show up to jam as well, bringing with them their marimbas and African clay drums. One man played a Rajasthani ravanhatta, a string instrument that was hung with sleigh bells.Andrew Ruiz, now 27, a musician who also lived at Ghost Ship, spent his afternoons teaching art in elementary-school aftercare programs. He described the Satya Yuga aesthetic as what would happen \u201cif the Brothers Grimm made a trailer park.\u201d Ruiz grew up a weird kid in San Diego. \u201cYou\u2019re just you,\u201d he wanted to tell the popular crowd that rejected him. \u201cYou have such a problem with me being me.\u201d Like Harris, he took a bildungsroman road trip before ending up in Oakland, and like Harris, he had a hard time affording somewhere to live. For a while, he crashed in a friend\u2019s parents\u2019 damp garage. He thought he finally found a place, only to be told that the landlord found another tenant who could pay six months in cash up front. On the night after Thanksgiving 2015, he tagged along with friends to a party at Ghost Ship. As soon as he walked in, he said, \u201cmy jaw dropped, my heart sang, my gut tingled.\u201dSix weeks later, Satya Yuga was his home. Ruiz didn\u2019t object to being awakened at 3 in the morning by warehouse mates drumming or thrashing about in their studios \u2014 creativity was more important than sleep. He fed off the shared spirit of artistic struggle, the sense that Satya Yuga was a surrogate family. \u201cYou could always cook for yourself, but rarely would you need to,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople would find food outside the bakeries or stores. It was perfectly great food, and they\u2019d be like, \u2018This is for my brothers and my sisters,\u2019 and we would be so happy because we had food to share.\u201dOne day not long after moving in, Harris was scanning the free section of craigslist when he saw a listing for trees \u2014 whole trees! Harris had a trunk cut into six-foot-long columns and delivered to the warehouse. He used them to build a large box with his bed inside and a platform above, for tattooing clients. To the box, he attached a huge redwood branch, and he and Almena\u2019s son, Surya, spent several mornings threading little plastic flowers to its smaller branches. \u201cWhen I showed Derick, I remember him being so happy that I involved his son in the project,\u201d Harris said. Almena often gave tours of Satya Yuga to friends and always took them to Harris\u2019s studio. \u201cMax,\u201d Almena told me, \u201cwas my showpiece.\u201dThe older and more stable Satya Yugans resisted Almena\u2019s mind games. Next door to Harris lived Nikki Kelber, now 46, who made luscious feather earrings and leather jewelry and whom Harris referred to as Martha Yuga, a riff on Martha Stewart, because her space was always so nice. She had a cabinet full of glassware. She hung her pots from the wall. She also had boundaries. \u201cI just tried to keep to myself and do my own thing,\u201d she said.Yet Harris was a willing acolyte. Soon Almena \u2014 who saw part of his job as inspiring others to create, with a firm hand if necessary \u2014 started making up elaborate projects with ludicrous deadlines and demanding that Harris work all night to get them done. Lay these bricks in the garden. Pick these bricks up. Take all the spindles off the backs of all these wooden chairs. According to several residents, Almena\u2019s dedication to building and rebuilding his ever-more-layered I Spy pastiche was increasingly fueled by drugs. \u201cDerick and I got into some unhealthy practices,\u201d Allison said. \u201cAt first it was like, \u2018Let\u2019s get this done,\u2019 and then it got out of control.\u201dIf Harris resisted Almena\u2019s commands to work through the night, Almena berated him, calling Harris degrading names. Occasionally, people who lived at Satya Yuga told me, Almena spoke to Harris in a sharp German accent, pretending that Harris, whose mother was Jewish, was his Jew, his slave. Harris insisted to me that Almena meant this as a joke. But others in the community, observing how Almena humiliated Harris, did not find it funny. \u201cIt got to the point,\u201d Harris said, \u201cwhere some people had even thrown around the words Stockholm syndrome.\u201dIn early 2015, Allison\u2019s mother called the Department of Children and Family Services at the Alameda County Social Services Agency. Several months earlier, she was contacted by Boudreaux, whose son attended school with Almena\u2019s children. Boudreaux had noticed that some days those children weren\u2019t being picked up from school; other days they didn\u2019t show up at all or they showed up hungry, their heads crawling with lice. That March, the agency removed Bolonik, Shai and Surya from the warehouse and sent them to live with Almena\u2019s mother and sister, who lived in Los Angeles.Harris first considered leaving the collective in the fall of 2015, when they attended a music festival called Symbiosis Gathering. That year, the event took place at a reservoir in the high-desert foothills of the Sierra Nevada. Shortly after the Satya Yugans arrived, Almena set them to work constructing an ornate Balinese templelike structure, from which they were to sell chai tea. His mood was horrible. Children and Family Services still had his children. In the desert, he erupted in violent outbursts over things no one could control, like the wind knocking over the temple walls. Harris said to himself, \u201cI\u2019m done with this guy.\u201dBut after Harris returned to Oakland, he became more enmeshed than ever as Harris and Almena agreed that Harris would live at Satya Yuga rent-free in exchange for helping out. From then on, at Ghost Ship, Harris was on call 24 hours a day unclogging toilets, mopping, mediating tenant disputes, collecting rent money (and then taking that rent to the bank so that Almena didn\u2019t blow it). He also communicated with the building\u2019s landlords, Chor and Kai Ng, who owned some 10 buildings in Oakland, including a Vietnamese restaurant, a bakery and a grocery. Still, Almena\u2019s verbal abuse continued and, Harris says, \u201cI would just kind of keep my mouth shut and take it.\u201dHe believed this was the path of deepest compassion. Anger, destruction and addiction came from pain \u2014 a dynamic Harris understood well from his own father, who turned up with no place to go at Harris\u2019s first college apartment. In the warehouse, if Almena was acting paranoid and fuming, Harris just dropped whatever he was doing to carry some ridiculous pile of junk from Almena\u2019s van to the yard or carry that same ridiculous pile of junk from the yard to the dumpster. He figured, if he just did what Almena said, maybe Almena would calm down, find his banjo, settle into one of the many threadbare couches upstairs and fall asleep for the first time in days. When Almena was really bad off, gnashing and foaming at the mouth, Harris told me, he would cook for him, bring him cigarettes and speak to him sweetly.The year 2016 appeared to be the start of a brighter future. Almena had his kids back. Harris says that Almena bestowed on him the title of \u201ccreative director,\u201d which Harris liked. Still, in mid-November, Harris flew to New York to explore \u201cdoing the bicoastal thing.\u201d Some part of him knew that he needed to leave. Yet while in Brooklyn, for the first time in his life, Harris felt homesick \u2014 homesick for Satya Yuga. \u201cI had a nest, a place to go back to,\u201d he said. \u201cAs far as stability goes, I hadn\u2019t really had that.\u201dAt the warehouse, on Thanksgiving, Almena roasted a couple of turkeys. Harris cooked vegan dumplings. Kelber contributed cranberry sauce. A handful of stragglers from the greater Oakland underground art scene showed up uninvited \u2014 they knew they would feel welcome there. In the big open room on the second floor, \u201cwe gathered as many chairs as we could,\u201d Harris said. A drum circle formed. Part of the hope on offer in the warehouse, as Swan Vega, an events bartender who lived at Ghost Ship, described it, was \u201cthat family love can unite people where you don\u2019t actually need to be punitive. Doesn\u2019t that sound like a pipe dream?\u201dThe next day Harris started cleaning. A few weeks earlier, a music promoter reached out to Harris to see if Ghost Ship was available to host a show on Dec. 2. The lineup would be a bunch of aggressively out-there electronic music acts, headlined by the pulsing, psychedelic synth sounds of Golden Donna. In preparation for the show, Harris scrubbed the overused bathrooms. He shoved the couches to the perimeter of Almena\u2019s living room. He placed the cowboy hat on the Garuda\u2019s head in the way he knew Almena liked. Then on the Friday night of the party, Harris showered, pulled on a black sweater, bought a burrito and sat on a stool inside the warehouse\u2019s front door.Admission was $10 before 11 p.m., $15 after, though given that this was an Oakland warehouse party, it was also Notaflof \u2014 no one turned away for lack of funds. Almena was not home. A condition of Almena\u2019s children returning to live with the family, according to Allison, was that they not be at the warehouse during parties, so Almena, Allison and the children had decamped to a hotel. (Children and Family Services declined to comment.) Most of Harris\u2019s fellow Satya Yugans did not attend the show, either. Many were out. Some were in their studios, making art. Others were trying to sleep or flirting with dates. By 11:15 p.m. about 100 guests had arrived and walked up the eclectic art project of a staircase. Harris\u2019s friend Micah Danemayer, 28, an electronic musician, was D.J.-ing images that night onto a large projection screen. Danemayer was another big, tender misfit who had found what he took to calling his \u201cmutant family\u201d in Oakland\u2019s underground art scene. Danemayer had a real family in Boston who loved him: a father who put money in his bank account when his son\u2019s funds ran low, a mother who sent starving-artist care packages consisting of brownies, a grocery-store gift card and a pack of socks. Just the day before, in love for the first time, Danemayer moved in with his girlfriend, Jennifer Mendiola, who was studying for her doctorate in health psychology. His stuff sat in his new home\u2019s hallway in plastic storage crates.On the second floor, a woman sat at a table offering $5 bang trims. Another woman was painting people\u2019s nails. One guest, Em B, 33, a poet who worked in a coffee shop and traded Kurt Vonnegut quotes with her father, texted her wife back home: \u201cOh my God, this place is a trip. I can\u2019t wait to tell you about it.\u201d Cash Askew, 22, a much-beloved trans femme guitarist, chatted with Feral Pines, 29, another trans musician who almost always dressed in a tank top, black leather shorts, boots and a Mercedes-Benz hood ornament necklace. Michela Gregory, 20, a San Francisco State University student, stayed close to her boyfriend, Alex Vega, then 22, who earlier that night parked his silver Mazda Miata at the San Bruno BART stop. On the way out of her parents\u2019 house that evening, Gregory told her father, \u201cDad, I\u2019m going to spend the night with Alex.\u201d \u201cI love you,\u201d her father called out as she stepped through the door. \u201cI love you, too,\u201d Gregory said.Around 11:20 p.m., Harris decided to leave his post at the door to go inside Ghost Ship to use the bathroom. As he entered the building, he noticed the light looked strange \u2014 a glow on the ceiling. He ran to his studio and grabbed a fire extinguisher. But by the time he returned, eight or 10 seconds later, the fire was out of control. At 11:23 p.m., Carmen Brito, the potter and substitute teacher, who lived in the back of the warehouse, woke up in a room filled with smoke and called 911. Upstairs, as fire rose through the baseboards, people started shrieking, pleading, streaming down the strange staircase.Oakland Fire Department Station 13 was only a block away. The first firefighters arrived at 11:25, but the flames were already out of control. Firefighters crawled into the building with breathing tanks and shot water up toward the inferno on the first-floor ceiling. They hoped to keep the fire contained near its origin in the rear of the warehouse, but as they crept deeper into the building, it jumped over them. The smoke consolidated into a sludge so thick it created a total blackout. After the low-air alarms sounded on the fire crew\u2019s tanks, the chief ordered them to evacuate. They had to follow their hoses, like cave divers with guide wires, to find their way out.One attendee, Aaron Marin, who\u2019d stayed at Ghost Ship as a guest, remembered that there was a window on the second floor not visible behind the projection screen. He decided to jump through it and tried to get others to follow him. But it was too loud, too dark, too hot, too terrifying. He used a power cord that was melting to slow his fall and landed uninjured, but no one else jumped out. Inside, a woman in a green dress and a red beanie sat on the first floor in a wicker chair, screaming for those above not to come down, chanting, \u201cThis is the will of the spirits of the forest.\u201dOnce that staircase caught fire \u2014 it\u2019s impossible to know the order of events with certainty, though one person who escaped reported that some who started down the stairs came back up, yelling \u201cnot good\u201d \u2014 people wrapped themselves in rugs. The air in the warehouse grew so hot that, one survivor reported, he felt his skin peeling. Harris held the front door open, yelling: \u201cFollow the sound of my voice! This way!\u201d Michela Gregory and Alex Vega embraced, his body on top of hers to shield her from the flames and heat.A final text from the building, according to The East Bay Times, which won a Pulitzer Prize for its Ghost Ship reporting, said: \u201cI love you. I\u2019m going to die, Mom.\u201dEyes immediately turned to Almena, who at first seemed not to understand the gravity of the situation. Hours after the tragedy, even before the fire was fully extinguished, Almena posted on Facebook: \u201cConfirmed. Everything I worked so hard for is gone.\u201dEarly Monday morning, he stood in the predawn darkness on the corner of 31st and International for a live interview with the \u201cToday\u201d show. His arty, charismatic guru aesthetic was still intact \u2014 his fedora a little too dashing on what should have been a deeply bowed head.Matt Lauer said good morning, then dispensed with the niceties.Lauer: \u201cMr. Almena, let me ask you a couple of questions. Thirty-six lives were lost in that building over the weekend. The family members of those who were lost want answers. ... Are you the man who should be held accountable?\u201dAlmena: \u201c... What am I going to say to that? Should I be held accountable? I can barely stand here right now.\u201dLauer: \u201cIt\u2019s a fair question, Mr. Almena. Obviously there were some conditions in that building that may have led to a dangerous situation and led to what happened there.\u201dAlmena: \u201cI laid my body down there every night. We laid our bodies down there. We put our children to bed there every night. We made music. We created art. ...\u201dLauer: \u201cAre you worried that you will be charged?\u201dAlmena: \u201cI would rather get on the floor and be trampled by the parents! I\u2019d rather let them tear at my flesh than answer these ridiculous questions.\u201dLauer: \u201cMr. Almena \u2014\u201dAlmena: \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m incredibly sorry. What do you want me to say? I\u2019m not going to answer these questions.\u201dLauer: \u201cThen we\u2019ll end the interview there, Mr. Almena.\u201dThe city of Oakland, too, found itself in the cross hairs within a matter of days and weeks. It turned out that city officials had known for well over a year that Ghost Ship was dangerous. More than half a dozen municipal employees had been inside the warehouse, including a fire captain named George Freelen, who claimed that in 2014 he sent a report to the fire marshal\u2019s office (which that office believes it never received), concerned about the \u201chigh fire load.\u201d The police knew as well. Body camera footage obtained by The East Bay Times shows two officers inside Ghost Ship on Sept. 8, 2015, in response to a property dispute. One says to the other, \u201cOne spark, one spark and it would all be bad. ... It\u2019s like a huge fireplace here. ... I would be so worried about all the electrical wires.\u201d Child and Family Services was concerned, too, and the police went to the building after being contacted by the agency. A neighbor on 31st Avenue called the police dozens of times, according to KQED, concerned about the noise and the endless flow of old junk that arrived at the building, some of which then sat on the sidewalk.As details began to emerge, the fire was not understood as an isolated, idiosyncratic catastrophe. It was understood as the product of civic and societal failings. In the years leading up to the fire, the Oakland Fire Department had been chronically underfunded, understaffed and mismanaged. Between 2011 and 2015, the department employed neither a fire marshal nor an assistant fire marshal \u2014 and it is the fire marshal\u2019s job to ensure that property owners and tenants follow the city\u2019s building code. To deal with the fallout after the tragedy, the fire chief retired. (The fire marshal hired in April 2015 eventually resigned.) The Oakland city attorney\u2019s office signed a $90,000 contract with a San Francisco public-relations firm \u201cfor the purpose of managing and minimizing the City of Oakland\u2019s potential exposure to liability for claims and litigation that may arise out of the Incident,\u201d the contract read. The firm\u2019s duties included conducting \u201cscrimmages as needed for the City Attorney and its clients\u201d \u2014 that is, coaching Oakland officials how to deflect blame away from themselves.The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms worked with the Oakland Fire Department and the Alameda County Arson Task Force on the investigation. The 50-page Origin and Cause Report, released on March 18, 2017, classified the cause of the fire as \u201cundetermined,\u201d although many important details surfaced after that official report, suggesting the fire was electrical. A refrigerator caught fire in the warehouse on the night before the tragedy. The warehouse\u2019s wiring was a known, protracted problem. In 2014, according to The East Bay Times, when the building\u2019s transformer blew, the Ng family replaced it without permits using an unlicensed electrician, who told them at the time that the wiring was \u201cgrossly unsafe\u201d and needed another $15,000 in upgrades, which were not performed. (The Ngs, through their lawyer, declined to comment.)The Pacific Gas and Electric company was named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed in 2017 by the victims\u2019 families for failing in its duty to inspect the warehouse when the utility installed two SmartMeters on the Ghost Ship\u2019s block. The utility \u201ceither knew or should have known,\u201d the suit claimed, that Ghost Ship\u2019s egregiously jury-rigged electrical system posed \u201can imminent threat.\u201d The City of Oakland was named as a defendant in the lawsuit as well. When the city moved to have itself dismissed from the case, a judge refused in November, stating that Oakland had a \u201cmandatory duty\u201d to address known safety concerns. (The civil trial is scheduled for next fall.)Beyond all this was the feeling that the runaway cost of living in the Bay Area \u2014 and its attendant housing crisis \u2014 was culpable as well. Artists lived and worked in unfinished, unpermitted, unmaintained warehouses because the traditional rental market had become hopelessly out of reach; squats, in one form or another, were the only places artists could afford. The Oakland mayor, Libby Schaaf, a day after the fire, proclaimed herself to be \u201cpassionate about preserving and lifting up the incredible creative community that makes this incredible city what it is.\u201d She also talked about safety at artists\u2019 warehouses. But when she spoke at a vigil in downtown Oakland a few days later, she was booed. The mayor then tried to mend her relationship with her more creative constituents by signing an executive order giving owners of illegally inhabited spaces up to 60 days to come up with plans to bring those properties into compliance with building regulations. But who would pay for all those upgrades: the sprinkler systems, the insulation, the fire doors? Without major subsidies or a housing-market crash, there was no math that made those underground art spaces both affordable and up to code.In his backpack, he carried all his possessions: a few T-shirts and a pair of too-big jeans he picked out of the piles of clothes people donated to the artists who lost everything in the fire. He had some money in the bank, too, as Harris, like everyone else who had lived at Ghost Ship, except Almena, received funds from charities to help them rebuild their lives. On the trip to Los Angeles, Harris also brought his laptop, a small battery-powered synthesizer and a book on Transcendental Meditation \u201cto put my mind, you know, in a place of holiness and reverence, a place beyond life and death.\u201dIn the Inglewood neighborhood of Los Angeles, Harris rented a loft in a former auto-body shop, across the street from an elementary school. The place had cement floors, a huge roll-up door and natural light, \u201cthe most honest\u201d light, in Harris\u2019s view. Harris tried to nest. He built a workbench and furniture out of scrap materials he found in the yard. He painted a couple of walls white and one sky blue. He bought an induction stovetop, which heated food with magnetic energy instead of a coil or open flame. He thought about holding workshops in his studio to teach people how to make their own engagement rings out of cuttlebone. But being awake was excruciating, and being asleep was excruciating.On the morning of June 5, 2017, he woke up to banging on the metal roll-up door. He slipped on his flip flops and opened his loft to about a dozen law-enforcement officers with guns drawn. He could hear the schoolchildren playing at recess across the street. At first he thought it must be a mistake, a big mistake. Maybe his neighbors had done something? The cops cuffed his tattooed wrists and took him down to the station. They handed him several sheets of green paper. The warrant read:People of the State of Californiav.Max Cardin HarrisDerick Ion Almena\u201cThe undersigned, being sworn says, on information and belief, that Derick Ion Almena, Max Cardin Harris did, in the County of Alameda, State of California, on or about December 2, 2016, commit a felony, to wit: Involuntary Manslaughter, a violation of section 192(b) of the penal code of California, in that said defendant(s) did unlawfully, and without malice, kill Jason Adrian McCarty and Jason Adrian McCarty, a human being. ...The document felt like a bludgeon, hammering home the loss, each victim\u2019s name stated twice.Cash Askew; Em B; Jonathan Bernbaum; Barrett Clark; David Cline; Micah Danemayer; Billy Dixon; Chelsea Dolan; Alex Ghassan; Nick Gomez-Hall; Michela Gregory; Sara Hoda; Travis Hough; Johnny Igaz; Ara Jo; Donna Kellogg; Amanda Kershaw; Edmond Lapine II; Griffin Madden; Joseph Matlock; Jason McCarty; Draven McGill; Jennifer Mendiola; Jennifer Morris; Feral Pines; Vanessa Plotkin; Wolfgang Renner; Hanna Ruax; Benjamin Runnels; Nicole Siegrist; Michele Sylvan; Jennifer Kiyomi Tanouye; Alex Vega; Peter Wadsworth; Nick Walrath; Brandon Wittenauer.There were 36.Harris was told he could make three calls. The only number he knew was his mother\u2019s. He didn\u2019t know if she could handle it. Still he dialed, bracing himself, unsure what he was going to say. But before he started speaking his mother said: \u201cI know, I know. The whole world knows.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Harris asked.\u201cIt\u2019s all over the news,\u201d his mother said. \u201cEveryone knows.\u201dThe same day, Almena, too, was arrested at his new home in Lake County, in Northern California. Both men were moved to Santa Rita Jail. Bail for each man was initially set at $1.08 million, $30,000 for every victim \u2014 far more than either could post. The landlord, the Ng family, was not charged.Harris spent eight months in solitary confinement \u2014 for his own protection, he says the guards told him. He tried to maintain his sanity by reading through thousands of pages of legal documents from the case, hoping to aid in his own defense. The state claimed that the warehouse was flagrantly, cavalierly dangerous. Almena was responsible as the master tenant. Harris shared culpability as second in command.On Dec. 6, 2017, a year and four days after the deadly fire, preliminary hearings began. Testimony lasted six days, the last of which was Harris\u2019s 28th birthday. Each morning, Almena and Harris arrived at Superior Court of Alameda County, in downtown Oakland, shackled in their striped prison jumpsuits. On the second day, a young man named Nicholas Bouchard took the stand. He testified that Almena persuaded him to co-sign the Ghost Ship lease. Bouchard said he built festival stages with Almena and lived with him on a pot farm in the Santa Cruz mountains \u2014 one of the many young men in Almena\u2019s orbit who \u201chad issues with our father figures or father,\u201d Bouchard recalled.A couple of weeks after signing the Ghost Ship lease, Bouchard arrived at the warehouse one day to find a huge hole had been cut in the second-story floor. Concerned, he told his mother, and together they prepared for a meeting with Almena to discuss how to make safe, legal changes to the space. Almena arrived on the appointed day, two hours late; he scoffed at Kathleen Bouchard\u2019s meticulous mind-set and ignored her. She then dedicated herself to maternal arm-twisting until her son cut ties with Almena. \u201cIt had a very, very dark side to it,\u201d she said in court about her son\u2019s relationship to Almena, \u201cand my primary concern was to make sure my child was O.K.\u201dOver the six days of hearings, the state compelled a series of Satya Yugans to testify. Many of them remained so committed to their counterculture ideals that they didn\u2019t really believe in the court system and its method of enacting justice. A gulf in understanding opened in the courtroom. Between the outr\u00e9 artists and the gray-suited custodians of law, there was almost no shared language. What was a family? What was music and what was noise (and was calling your music \u201cnoise\u201d an insult)? Was your real name the name your parents gave you or the one bestowed on you by your friends? What qualified as a home? What did it mean to say something was beautiful?On the stand, Jos\u00e9 Avalos tried to explain Ghost Ship\u2019s appeal. Most shared living spaces in Oakland, even if you could afford the rent, \u201cthey don\u2019t really want to see you,\u201d he said. They don\u2019t love you. They don\u2019t care. \u201cThey basically want you to be like an invisible being.\u201d At Satya Yuga, Avalos said, \u201cDerick just told me to just be me.\u201d\u201cSo is it safe to say that it felt like a place that you could be yourself?\u201d a defense lawyer asked on cross-examination.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cA place you could call home?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cA place where you could be an artist?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were, like, caring people.\u201dHe, and everyone else who took the stand, conceded that the warehouse seemed far from complying with Oakland\u2019s building code. But the feeling among people who lived there was that arresting Harris made no sense. They found the prosecution\u2019s idea that Harris held what the district attorney described as \u201ca leadership position in the warehouse\u201d manipulative, infuriating and absurd. About Almena, some testified that they were scared of him. Rodney Griffin, an electrician and former friend, called Almena a \u201cnarcissist.\u201d Nicholas Bouchard described him as \u201cin very subtle ways extremely emotionally manipulative.\u201dBut they were clear about Harris. \u201cYou\u2019re going to try to make him like he\u2019s a commander, and it\u2019s not real,\u201d said Swan Vega (in the transcript, she\u2019s identified by her given name, Leah). \u201cThis is just not correct.\u201d Yes, Harris helped get the rent money to the bank. Yes, Harris coordinated with the music promoter. Yes, Harris cleaned the warehouse for the party. But Harris had no power. Everyone who lived in Satya Yuga knew that.\u201cHe was like Cinderella,\u201d Vega said. \u201cMax was a servant\u2019s heart. That\u2019s what he was.\u201dFor a while, each time I visited, I found Harris behind the thick glass divider in his red-and-white jail jumpsuit. To talk to me in a visiting slot in his cell block, he had to lean his lanky body over to the side of the cubicle because the cord on the phone attached to the wall was humiliatingly short. He reminded me to clean the mouthpiece of the phone on my side of the glass each time I sat down.There was no way for Harris to process the situation, no way to assimilate the facts. He always thought that if he moved gently through the world, the world would move gently over him. He thought that if he helped others, good karma or Jesus or both would take care of him. Had he not done enough? Every time he entered the courtroom, he felt the vast weight of the community\u2019s grief and accusation. \u201cIt\u2019s just wrong,\u201d he said of the whole situation into the jailhouse phone. He lost friends in the fire. He had his own trauma to work through. How had his life taken him here, with all these bodies laid at his feet?One day in April when I visited Harris, he told me that the guards had woken him up in the middle of the night and searched his cell. They took his soap and deodorant and left another inmate standing in his boxers in the cold cement yard. The casual cruelty disoriented him. He had nightmares at night. He had nightmares during the day. He tried to get himself into a positive mind-set before calling his mother or anyone else, because he felt he shouldn\u2019t drag others down. She hadn\u2019t come to visit \u2014 she didn\u2019t have money to fly to California and, anyway, Harris didn\u2019t want to put her through seeing him in jail. Harris\u2019s father, who remarried and had another child, had not visited either.Almena, too, was in jail and not doing well. Shortly after his arrest, he was moved to the Glenn Dyer jail in downtown Oakland. He\u2019d gained 60 pounds. He spoke in person to a local TV news reporter at KTVU twice, once in November 2017 and again in June 2018. He cried during the second interview when he talked about his children, then he remembered all the children who had died and that it was cosmically unseemly for him to cry in public about his own; his face collapsed as he sunk into the quicksand of his own pain. When his children visited him in jail, he told them he was now on a spaceship. He would be leaving soon, and he didn\u2019t know when he was coming back. He hated for his children to see him locked up like this. He longed to touch their warm, soft skin. No one touched him anymore except to lock him in handcuffs.If he was lucky, he slept for 18 or 20 hours a day. In his dreams, he visited every studio in the warehouse. He saw Harris making jewelry, Nikki Kelber making feather headdresses, his wife upstairs belly dancing. It was all beautiful again. Then he woke up behind bars. When I visited him in November, he looked defeated, subdued. Up against the glass that divided us, he propped pictures he\u2019d drawn of eyes, wide and wildly searching, on pages he ripped out of \u201cI, Claudius.\u201dHarris never wavered in his belief in his own innocence, though he lost faith that he could get a fair trial. He saw himself as a convenient scapegoat, a way for Oakland to deflect blame and scrutiny from its own failings and keep the public\u2019s hunger for justice and punishment trained on Almena and him. In June 2018, after nearly a year in jail, Harris agreed to take a plea deal. He told me that he also hoped he could ease the families\u2019 suffering, to some small degree, by saving them from the horrid spectacle of a trial. Those proceedings, and their inevitably sensationalized news coverage, would \u201cpeel off a scab,\u201d he said, for families who had just started to heal. The deal, negotiated by Harris\u2019s and Almena\u2019s lawyers, included them both, as their cases had been joined since the outset, and the district attorney\u2019s office planned to present for each nearly the same set of facts. The deal stipulated that Harris would receive a six-year sentence, while Almena would receive nine. On July 3, 2018, in Oakland Superior Court, his hair pulled back in a respectable bun, Harris sat as the judge read each of the 36 counts of involuntary manslaughter. For each one, Harris replied, almost inaudibly, \u201cNo contest.\u201d\u201cIt took over 20 minutes to read the names,\u201d Harris said to me later at Santa Rita Jail. \u201cIt was horrible. Every time they read a name, another corner of the courtroom would break out wailing.\u201d Harris, in the courtroom, started weeping, too, and could barely talk. \u201cEvery name is like a blow,\u201d he said. \u201cHearing the names of some of my friends, like Peter, Micah. ...\u201dThe judge accepted each of Harris\u2019s no-contest pleas and found him guilty on all counts. \u201cTo have to take that and feel that judgment and have that even be uttered into the universe \u2014 that was just a hard, hard thing,\u201d Harris said.Late on the morning of Aug. 9, the benches of the courtroom filled up with families and friends of the victims, plus a few family and friends of the defendants. The space felt hopelessly small and wrong, but it was inevitably all going to feel small and wrong. This was a criminal-negligence case that was trying to perform the civic emotional work of a mass-murder trial. The community needed the proceedings to do much more than call two human defendants to account for negligence; the community needed catharsis. The trial needed to create monsters, then decree those monsters must be locked away so that the world could be made safe and right again.Harris, along with Almena, entered from a side door. Harris seemed to be trying to hold on to a bit of himself, the gentle hippie artist, by wearing an undershirt he tie-dyed with jailhouse juice packets and crushed colored pencils. In the gallery, Harris locked his gaze on his mother, whom he hadn\u2019t seen in 14 months, her long face dazed with the impossibility of her task. He mouthed, \u201cI love you,\u201d and he told me that he tried \u201cto transmit as much love as I possibly can with my eyes.\u201d She had come to California to support her son. Her presence, perhaps, would make Harris seem human to all the other parents in the courtroom, many of whom believed Harris was responsible for their children\u2019s deaths.The second family member to speak was Linda Regan, who lost her 34-year-old daughter, Amanda Kershaw, in the Ghost Ship fire. She had no mechanism to salve her rage. \u201cI am a Christian, and I try to live my life accordingly,\u201d Regan said to Harris and Almena. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to forgive and turn the other cheek.\u201d But she was ruined by her grief, by their warehouse. She could not forgive. \u201cI am not that good of a Christian, and I am not capable of doing that yet,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat you did was despicable, and you should both pay for that. You took 36 beautiful souls and erased them from all of their loved ones\u2019 lives.\u201dFamily after family wanted Harris and Almena to know that loss did not get easier to bear. The sorrow did not decrease, it radiated. A young woman named Lesley Moran took the stand to talk about her 6-year-old twin daughters whose father, Alex Ghassan, died in the fire. \u201cWhen they ask me if they can ask Santa to have Daddy come back from the spirit world for even one day, for Christmas, and I have to tell them that they can put it on the list, but it\u2019s not possible. And I have to just watch their faces fall. They talk about death all the time. And that\u2019s not normal.\u201dThe horror followed by sadness followed by horror followed by sadness flowed and overflowed and kept overflowing. There was no way to contain it, nor should it have been contained. Colleen Dolan, who lost her daughter, 33-year-old Chelsea Dolan, described standing out in front of Ghost Ship for hours on that awful night, breathing in the same awful fumes that killed her child, feeling the same awful heat. Sabrina Fox, Chelsea\u2019s sister, stood in front of the burning warehouse with her mother as well. \u201cDays later when we finally received her body, she was like smoked meat, her skin and hair charred from the intense temperatures,\u201d she said.A series of parents came forward:My child was \u201cright on the precipice of tumbling into her greatness as an adult human.\u201dMy child was \u201cplanning to come home over the weekend so she can study for her finals. She wanted to sleep at home in her comfortable bed.\u201d\u201cThe only positive thing to come out of Nick\u2019s death for me is that I\u2019m no longer afraid of dying. When I\u2019m dead, I will either be with Nick or no longer grieve for him.\u201d\u201cI used to be a nice person.\u201dAlmost all the parents who addressed the court disapproved of the plea deal. Harris and Almena would very likely be released in two and three and a half years, respectively, given the months off for good conduct and time served. It did not seem enough. \u201cThirty-six people who you greeted that night and collected money from \u2014 I don\u2019t know if you remember my daughter. ...\u201d\u201cYour Honor, unless you too have lost a child, it is impossible for you to conceive the desperation with which I implore you to reconsider this plea deal. ...\u201dThe presiding judge, James Cramer, who was standing in for Judge Morris Jacobson, who had approved the plea deal but was now on leave, interrupted. \u201cI\u2019m going to stop you,\u201d he said. \u201cI have.\u201dThe next day Harris took the stand and apologized. He knew words were inadequate and that he would have to use words anyway. \u201cI am so deeply sorry and regret all of my actions, my inactions, my lack of foresight, my lack of awareness that contributed and led to this tragedy,\u201d he said. \u201cI \u2014 I never would have begun to imagine that any of my actions over that time could have led to something like this. It\u2019s completely unfathomable. I don\u2019t even really know what words to offer, because words feel hollow; they don\u2019t come close, and I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He continued, \u201cI\u2019m deeply sorry. I don\u2019t expect forgiveness. I wouldn\u2019t ask for that. I know that nothing I can say comes close. It\u2019s incredibly difficult to address everyone, because I know nothing I can say will come close. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dAlmena, too, took the stand, and this went less well. Even now, here, he could not conjure a world that did not revolve around him. \u201cTo go back to the day before the fire to say, \u2018Derick, do you wish that you didn\u2019t embark on this hard journey, perilous?\u2019 I would have said: \u2018No, man, this is what we\u2019re doing. This is so beautiful,\u2019\u2009\u201d he told the court. \u201cIf I could tattoo flames and doves and crows on my body and the names of your children, I would \u2014 and I will.\u201d Then Almena read from a statement he prepared. \u201cIf I could give each of you my life, if I could give you my children\u2019s life, I would. That\u2019s not the way this is going to work out. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dAfter a two-hour recess, everyone returned to the courtroom. Over the two days of hearings, the families of the victims had made it very clear in court that in addition to being wrecked by loss, they felt legally aggrieved. They were angry that the landlord had not been charged. They were angry that the city of Oakland had not been charged. They were angry that P.G.&\u2009E. had not been charged. And then there was Almena\u2019s performance at the hearing \u2014 his apparent lack of contrition, his offer to sacrifice the lives of his own son and daughters and the thought that he would tattoo their dead children\u2019s names on his skin.To the great surprise of everybody present, the judge threw out the plea deal. \u201cI am expressly rejecting the plea bargain as to Mr. Almena,\u201d Cramer said. He added: \u201cMr. Harris has expressed from the outset, unconditional remorse. He was at the scene, he stayed at the scene, met with the officials, has done so from the outset.\u201d But Harris and Almena had a package deal; either both defendants pleas were granted or neither was. So Harris\u2019s plea, along with Almena\u2019s, was thrown out.\u201cI do not know that it will do any of these victims any good,\u201d Cramer said of forcing the case to go to trial. A trial was no guarantee of justice. A trial would certainly not bring justice with regard to the city of Oakland, P.G.&\u2009E. or the landlords. But the judge would let a jury decide the fates of Almena and Harris.Harris remains in Santa Rita Jail and most likely will until his trial, which is scheduled to begin next April. Some days it\u2019s hard, and he cannot tell the prison psychologists he\u2019s depressed or they will take away his socks \u2014 in theory so he doesn\u2019t use them to harm himself. (Officials at Santa Rita Jail declined to comment.) \u201cI mean, just the overwhelmingness of this whole experience,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like being a survivor of war and then someone telling you that the whole war was your fault.\u201dEach morning he reads the daily spiritual parable from \u201cThe Book of Awakening.\u201d He relaxes if the guards decide to handcuff him when they take him out of his cell \u2014 \u201cif it makes you feel more comfortable,\u201d is how he sees it. \u201cIf there\u2019s less of a chance that you\u2019ll be jumpy and Tase me for scratching my nose, then great.\u201d He has read the Bible three times since he entered Santa Rita. He studies Buddhism and looks for ways to model equanimity and grace. When a wildflower seed blows into the yard, he says, \u201cI have to take that as pure poetry.\u201d He tries to call his mother every day. He forgives his father for his absence and wishes he could be a better brother to his father\u2019s other son, who is now 8.It strains the human heart \u2014 and all the wisdom of the great books of the world \u2014 to hold all this suffering. Thirty-six families learned their children died. Each story is a complete universe of pain. In none of those stories does the child come back. Each of those children was loved.Harris tries to sit with it all, to let the unfathomable in, but a person can only absorb so much sadness at one time before the mind breaks down or deflects. So Harris takes in this swollen, shattered world in the ways he can. Recently, in his cell, Harris read a story in National Geographic about Alex, an African gray parrot who could count and identify colors like a small child. He cried when he told me about the bird. Alex had worked with the same trainer his whole life, Harris said, and his trainer cared deeply for him. The last thing Alex said to his trainer, on the night before he died, was: \u201cI love you.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the college that Peter Wadsworth attended.

Here are its best holiday safety tips.\u201cWe have a challenge at the C.P.S.C. to get what we consider extremely important information to the consumer. There\u2019s just so much noise out there, and so one of the avenues that we\u2019ve chosen is,\u201d Ms. Buerkle said with a laugh, \u201cI\u2019ll call it nontraditional.\u201dMr. Galbo is aware that he needs to walk a fine line with his messaging. \u201cThe mission of the agency is to protect consumers, and that\u2019s something we always have to be working toward,\u201d he said. \u201cSo even with the crazy names and the zany characters and the pictures of birds, it\u2019s important that people are learning.\u201dPerhaps most critically, check that there are working fire extinguishers and smoke detectors in your home. \u201cMany of these safety tips apply year round,\u201d Ms. Buerkle said, \u201cbut certainly during the holiday season, when people are cooking more, we see the number of incidents go up.\u201d As the commission\u2019s Twitter account will remind you, not all heroes are smoke alarms, but all smoke alarms are heroes.Fire hazards abound during the holiday season, and not just in the kitchen. Holiday d\u00e9cor like Christmas trees, candles and holiday lights can also take a quick turn for the dangerous.If you have a live Christmas tree in the home, make sure it has plenty of water, because dry trees are a major cause of home fires during the holidays \u2014 the commission estimates that there are 100 Christmas tree fires annually \u2014 as this video dramatically demonstrates.Artificial trees, too, can be fire hazards and so, when buying one, the C.P.S.C. advises looking for the \u201cfire resistant\u201d label. Christmas trees, whether real or artificial, should be placed well away from heat sources like fireplaces, vents and radiators.Keep lit candles away from flammable items, so when setting up a menorah or kinara, take note of its surroundings; all burning candles should be placed on a stable, heat-resistant surface where children and pets cannot reach them or knock them over. Burning candles should be kept within sight and extinguished before leaving the room, and wicks should be trimmed to a quarter of an inch.Holiday lights with broken or cracked sockets, frayed or bare wires or loose connections can also start fires, and each set of lights, new or old, should be checked before being hung.When shopping for holiday gifts for children, Ms. Buerkle stressed the importance of heeding age labels to buy age-appropriate toys. \u201cParents want to think their child is ahead of the curve and they\u2019re really smart,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the age determination, or grading, means something.\u201d Ms. Buerkle warns that buying a toy graded for an age older than its recipient could have small parts that make it unsafe.If you\u2019re looking for categories of toys to avoid entirely, look no more: The majority of toy-related deaths involving children under 15 are caused by riding toys, like nonmotorized scooters and tricycles; toys with small parts \u2014 including small balls \u2014 which are choking hazards; and perhaps surprisingly, balloons. (Uninflated balloons pose choking or suffocation risks to young children, and their strings are a strangulation risk.) If you do buy a riding toy, be sure also to buy protective gear, like helmets and pads.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Baked Pasta for Anytime (but Especially Now)", "Date": "2018-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Good AppetiteSpiced onions and plenty of melted Cheddar make for a cozy, flavorful pasta.The blustery, freezing December weather is bad for many things \u2014 my hair, my commute, my morning run. But it\u2019s awfully good for baking a cheesy pasta in a skillet.That\u2019s not to say that I wouldn\u2019t make this cozy, gooey Cheddar-rich casserole in nicer weather. But the colder, darker and gloomier the day, the more entitled I feel to plunge my spoon into the still-bubbling pan as soon as it comes out of the oven, devouring bite after bite.What makes this pasta casserole a little different from others of its cheese-laden, tomato-sauced ilk is the addition of onions and spices.The onions, saut\u00e9ed until golden all over and very tender, do double duty. After being cooked hot and fast in a deep-sided skillet until they brown and collapse, some are left in the pan to bolster the tomato sauce and form the foundation of the dish\u2019s flavor. The rest are combined with the Cheddar topping so that the sweet oniony strands can mingle with the melted cheese, adding silkiness to every forkful.The onions here aren\u2019t just jammy and sweet: They\u2019ve got spunk. They\u2019re spiced with both ground and whole cumin seeds for earthiness, coriander and allspice for depth, and cayenne and black pepper for a sharp bite. As the sauce simmers, a heady fragrance will waft from the pan and settle over your kitchen, brightening the dampest evenings even before you dig in.Mozzarella is usually the cheese of choice for baked pastas, but I use Cheddar here for its tanginess, which is better able to hold its own against the cumin-scented onions and zippy tomato sauce. Cheddar, especially the kind that\u2019s been aged for more than six months, also has a slightly lower moisture content than most mozzarella, so it is more likely to singe and blacken at the edges of the skillet you bake it in. These nearly burned spots are my favorite, and it takes all my willpower not to pick them off before bringing the pan to the table for everyone to share.But share them I do, because a golden-topped pan full of baked pasta studded with crisp shards of browned onion and cheese is a savory and satisfying delight, whether it\u2019s a bone-chilling December evening, or a temperate spring afternoon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Case for a Mixed Economy", "Date": "2018-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMaybe not everything should be privatized.Opinion ColumnistA mind is a terrible thing to lose, especially if the mind in question is president of the United States. But I feel like taking a break from that subject. So let\u2019s talk about something completely different, and probably irrelevant.I\u2019ve had several interviews lately in which I was asked whether capitalism had reached a dead end, and needed to be replaced with something else. I\u2019m never sure what the interviewers have in mind; neither, I suspect, do they. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re talking about central planning, which everyone considers discredited. And I haven\u2019t seen even an implausible proposal for a decentralized system that doesn\u2019t rely on price incentives and self-interest \u2013 i.e., a market economy with private property, which most people would consider capitalism.So maybe I\u2019m being dense or lacking in imagination, but it seems to be that the choice is still between markets and some kind of public ownership, maybe with some decentralization of control, but still more or less what we used to mean by socialism. And everyone either thinks of socialism as discredited, or pins the label on stuff \u2013 like social insurance programs \u2013 that isn\u2019t what we used to mean by the word.But I\u2019ve been wondering, exactly how discredited is socialism, really? True, nobody now imagines that what the world needs is the second coming of Gosplan. But have we really established that markets are the best way to do everything? Should everything be done by the private sector? I don\u2019t think so. In fact, there are some areas, like education, where the public sector clearly does better in most cases, and others, like health care, in which the case for private enterprise is very weak. Add such sectors up, and they\u2019re quite big.In other words, while Communism failed, there\u2019s still a pretty good case for a mixed economy \u2013 and public ownership/control could be a significant, although not majority, component of that mix. My back of the envelope says that given what we know about economic performance, you could imagine running a fairly efficient economy that is only 2/3 capitalist, 1/3 publicly owned \u2013 i.e., sort-of-kind-of socialist.Looking at private sector employment, we find that another 15 percent of the work force is employed in education, health, and social assistance. Now, a large part of that employment is paid for by public money \u2013 think Medicare dollars spent at private hospitals. Much of the rest is paid for by private insurers, which exist in their current role only thanks to large tax subsidies and regulation.And there\u2019s no reason to think the private sector does these things better than the public. Private insurers don\u2019t obviously provide a service that couldn\u2019t be provided, probably more cheaply, by national health insurance. Private hospitals aren\u2019t obviously either better or more efficient than public. For-profit education is actually a disaster area.So you could imagine an economy in which the bulk of education, health, and social assistance currently in the private sector became public, with most people at least as well off as they are now.Then there are other private activities that could plausibly be public. Utilities are heavily regulated, and in some cases are publicly owned already. Private health insurance directly employs hundreds of thousands of people, with doubtful social purpose. And I\u2019m sure I\u2019m missing a few others.Put all of this together, and as I said, you could see an economy working well with something like 1/3 public ownership.Now, this wouldn\u2019t satisfy people who hate capitalism. In fact, it wouldn\u2019t even live up to the old slogan about government controlling the economy\u2019s \u201ccommanding heights.\u201d This would be more like government running the boiler in the basement. Also, I see zero chance of any of this happening in my working lifetime.But I do think it\u2019s worth trying to think a bit beyond our current paradigm, which says that anything you could call socialist has been an utter failure. Maybe not so much?Advertisement"}

There were a lot of great essays about our brutal, angry transitional historic moment. And there were a lot of great essays about tigers. Don\u2019t ask me to explain that last one.When it was posted on YouTube, the clip got half a million hits in the first 48 hours. The wave of vitriol against Andrews built over time and got more vicious. Andrews couldn\u2019t find a job for 18 months.

It never goes away.\u201cThe more online shame cycles you observe,\u201d Andrews writes, \u201cthe more obvious the pattern becomes: Everyone comes up with a principled-sounding pretext that serves as a barrier against admitting to themselves that, in fact, all they have really done is joined a mob. Once that barrier is erected, all rules of decency go out the window.\u201dThey believe that both the European superstate and global capitalism undermine the cultural-religious foundations of European civilization. They are strongly environmentalist, feel that economic growth should be subordinated to social needs, believe in strong social support for the poor and limited immigration. As Lilla notes, they have a very coherent, communitarian worldview. I found the essay uplifting because it shows that in times of political transition, ideas get shuffled and reassembled in new and impressive ways.\u201cIf you fell asleep in 1945 and woke up in 2018 you would not recognize the world around you. The amount of growth that took place during that period is virtually unprecedented. If you learned that there have been no nuclear attacks since 1945, you\u2019d be shocked.

{"Headline": "Zanele Muholi: Paying Homage to the History of Black Women", "Date": "2018-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRace storiesThrough self-portraits, Zanele Muholi reimagines black identity and challenges the oppressive standards of beauty that often ignore people of color. Zanele Muholi\u2019s face is luminous \u2014 and framed by a headdress of inflated latex gloves. The image is typical of the Johannesburg-based photographer\u2019s theatrical self-portraits, where hairstyles, headgear and objects as diverse as a majestic necklace of cowrie shells or a wooden stool worn as a hat or crown suggest multiple personas and layers of historic, cultural and political meaning.As Muholi has said, you might look at the latex gloves, \u201cand think of balloons and play, rather than the constraints of work and domesticity or the need to breathe, to feel deflated.\u201d Characteristic of Muholi\u2019s work, that photograph is about all of these things, and much more.The image is one of more than 90 self-portraits in \u201cZanele Muholi: Somnyama Ngonyama, Hail the Dark Lioness\u201d (Aperture), a monograph accompanying a traveling exhibition organized by Ren\u00e9e Mussai for Autograph ABP in London and now at the Spelman College Museum of Fine Art in Atlanta through Dec. 8. In addition to photographs, the book contains essays, criticism and poems by more than 20 curators, art historians and writers.The self-portraits function on various levels and pay homage to the history of black women in Africa and beyond, the dark lionesses of the book\u2019s title. They reimagine black identity in ways that are largely personal but inevitably political. And they challenge the stereotypes and oppressive standards of beauty that often ignore people of color. \u201cAll this stereotyping inspires a deep-seated hatred of the black body, from head to toe: eyes, lips, everything, your features,\u201d said Muholi in a recent interview with Ms. Mussai\u201cI wanted to use my face so that people will always remember just how important our black faces are, when confronted by them,\u201d said Muholi, who prefers to be called a \u201cvisual activist\u201d rather than an artist. \u201cFor this black face to be recognized as belonging to a sensible, thinking being in their own right.\u201dMuholi\u2019s portraits inspire by example, self-discovery and resistance. They build on earlier series devoted to visual activism, such as \u201cFaces and Phases,\u201d \u201cInnovative Women\u201d and \u201cTransfigures,\u201d which documented black lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex South Africans, in response to the persecution, violence and invisibility they endured.\u201cToo often I find we are being mimicked, and distorted, by the privileged other,\u201d said Muholi. \u201cWe are here; we have our own voices; we have our own lives.\u201d In this regard, the photographer wants to \u201cteach people about our history, to rethink what history is all about, to reclaim it for ourselves, to encourage people to use artistic tools such as cameras as weapons to fight back.\u201d Those words echo Gordon Parks, who more than a half-century ago called the camera his \u201cweapon of choice\u201d against racism, poverty and injustice.Using richly symbolic poses, props and situations, Muholi\u2019s self-portraits represent African identity as nuanced and incongruous \u2014 from a stoic figure engulfed by a snakelike vacuum-cleaner hose to a series of pictures dedicated to Muholi\u2019s late sister, Basizeni, images that serve both as elegies and as \u201cconversations with the legion of \u2018ancestral selves,\u2019\u201d as Ms. Mussai wrote.Among the most poignant images in \u201cSomnyama Ngonyama\u201d are those honoring the photographer\u2019s late mother, Bester Muholi. In several pictures, Muholi wears headdresses composed of scouring pads or clothespins that allude to Bester\u2019s work as a domestic. These images push the envelope of traditional portraiture, serving as respectful homage, pointed satire and thoughtful commentary on a difficult life made worse by apartheid.\u201cBester\u2019s headdress appears like a costume that undermines the pretensions of portraiture,\u201d the art historian Tamar Garb wrote in the book. \u201cBut it also asserts the defining role that she played in an economy of subservience and spectacle. The figure is framed by her labor, haunted by pictorial precedents, captured by the gaze of her desiring daughter, for whom the love of mother was always shared, never enough, gone too soon.\u201dWhen posting images online, Muholi often uses the hashtag #blackbeauty, an affirmation of how the artist is taking control of an attribute too often defined and represented by outsiders. Muholi implores viewers, like the liberated lioness of \u201cSomnyama Ngonyama,\u201d to question and free themselves from oppressive aesthetics.Muholi hopes that \u201cSomnyama Ngonyama\u201d will motivate black people facing racism, sexism and homophobia in Africa and beyond to resist and transcend the cultural limitations imposed on them.\u201cThe series touches on beauty, relates to historical incidents, giving affirmation to those who are doubting \u2014 whenever they speak to themselves, when they look in the mirror \u2014 to say, \u2018You are worthy, you count, nobody has the right to undermine you: because of your being, because of your race, because of your gender expression, because of your sexuality, because of all that you are.\u2019\u201dRace Stories is a continuing exploration of the relationship between race and photographic depictions of race by Maurice Berger.

Opinion Columnist No matter what side of the debate one gravitates toward, stories like Ms. Serrano-Hernandez\u2019s highlight the moral quagmire that we\u2019ve created by treating the migration of desperately poor people as a problem that can best be addressed by border walls, tear gas, detention camps, militarized policing and mass deportation \u2014 except, of course, for the relative few, truly \u201cdeserving\u201d individuals who may be granted legal citizenship (typically after years of waiting and hundreds or thousands of dollars in attorney\u2019s fees) if they can win asylum.Questions abound: Does Ms. Serrano-Hernandez\u2019s baby son deserve citizenship because he was born here but not his 3-year-old sibling? Does everyone in the family deserve citizenship now that one member has been born here? Or does no one in the family deserve citizenship, even the baby, because the parents crossed the border illegally?Answering these questions may be easy legally, but they\u2019re more difficult morally. After all, none of us born here did anything to deserve our citizenship. On what moral grounds can we deny others rights, privileges and opportunities that we did not earn ourselves?Many people will sympathize with Mr. Vargas\u2019s story but recoil at his bold conclusion, as it seems to imply support for open borders \u2014 a position that no Republican or Democratic member of Congress supports or even takes seriously. This reaction seems misplaced. The deeper question raised isn\u2019t whether our borders should be open or closed (generally a false dichotomy) but rather how we ought to manage immigration in a manner that honors the dignity, humanity and legitimate interests of all concerned.Reaching for a radically more humane immigration system is not pie-in-the-sky, utopian dreaming. But it does require a certain measure of humility on the part of those of us who have benefited from birthright citizenship. Rather than viewing immigrants as seeking something that we, Americans, have a moral right to withhold from them, we ought to begin by acknowledging that none of us who were born here did anything to deserve our citizenship, and yet all of us \u2014 no matter where we were born \u2014 deserve compassion and basic human rights.Of course, it can be argued that virtually all modern nation-states were created through violence, exploitation and war.

He then listed proposals for how the president could protect his turf \u2014 in appointing officials, shielding information from lawmakers and conducting the nation\u2019s foreign affairs.That should give the Senate, in its confirmation hearings on Mr. Barr, pause. Having been confirmed before will likely smooth the process for the former attorney general. If the past two years have taught the nation anything, however, it\u2019s that the Trump administration needs an attorney general who welcomes more, not less, transparency and accountability for its actions \u2014 a legal officer who can provide assurances that the federal government works for the American public and not for any one person.To that end, Mr. Barr\u2019s writings and constitutional thinking are illustrative and can guide lawmakers as they vet his nomination and determine how he sees the relationship between the Justice Department and the White House, where he feels the department\u2019s priorities should rest, and how he now regards important moments during his last appointment to lead the agency. Of course, the attorney general\u2019s jurisdiction extends far beyond the Russia investigation. He also oversees civil rights enforcement, the immigration bureaucracy and the priorities of federal prosecutors across the country. In these and other fields, his predecessor, Mr. Sessions, did more damage than Mr. Trump ever gave him credit for. Joining with Edwin Meese III and Michael Mukasey, who served at the Justice Department under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, Mr. Barr said approvingly that Mr. Sessions toughened charging practices against drug dealers and cracked down on government leakers.Mr. Barr also endorsed Mr. Sessions\u2019s policies favoring vendors who did not want to \u201cparticipate in activities\u201d that violate their religious beliefs and businesses that did not want to provide insurance plans that included contraceptive coverage for employees.And he approved of Mr. Sessions's approach to immigration.

{"Headline": "In Praise of Wonder", "Date": "2018-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHE STONEChristmas is a reminder of the radical power of humility, amazement and embracing the Other. Mr. Simon is a staff writer for The Millions.For me, few images of Christ\u2019s nativity convey its strange, luminescent wonder as much as William Blake\u2019s \u201cThe Descent of Peace.\u201d Painted in the early 19th century as part of a series of illustrations for John Milton\u2019s \u201cOn the Morning of Christ\u2019s Nativity,\u201d Blake imagined the scene as bathed in an otherworldly light that holds the darkness at bay while an angel somersaults in the heavens. Within the manger, the infant Christ floats in the air with arms outstretched above an exhausted Virgin Mary. Blake\u2019s reality thrummed with a charged beauty \u2014 as a child he had visions of a \u201ctree full of angels,\u201d and when he was 4 he saw God put his head in through his family\u2019s kitchen window. Yet it is precisely that sense of the sacred and the profane being commingled, of our prosaic reality being a site for divine wonder, which makes Blake a prophet perfectly attuned to Advent.Christmas, according to the carol, is the \u201cmost wonderful time of the year.\u201d Certainly it\u2019s one of the most commercialized, where it\u2019s hard to sense much of the sacred import between Black Friday and the perennial culture-war scuffles over the meaning of the season. How much better, then, to see the holiday through Blake\u2019s eyes, where \u201cIf the doors of perception were cleansed, everything would appear to man as it is, Infinite.\u201d One need not be a conventional Christian \u2014 I\u2019m not \u2014 to see the significance of the nativity story. Because what the nativity story conveys is a narrative of wonder threaded through prosaic reality, where the birth of a child is an act of God\u2019s self-creation, where a manger can be the site of the universe\u2019s new genesis. Perhaps Blake\u2019s seeing angels in trees and God in his kitchen is the true nature of things, and everyday appearances are the real delusions.The power of the story of the nativity is its ability to transform our prosaic experience. One need not be a believer to see the value in this. What would appear to be a humble human birth is at the same time holy and miraculous, with animals laid down before the Lord, and the star of Bethlehem guiding the Magi to Christ\u2019s cradle. To wonder is to dwell in amazement, surprise and the miraculous. One can experience wonder when meditating upon the magnitude of the universe, or in contemplating Blake\u2019s poetry or art. Wonder is when we apprehend the sublime and the magnificent in what we encounter every day, with both humility and delight. The wonder in the Christmas story is that something as human as a baby could also be something as foreign as God.In thinking about the meaning of the nativity today, I find its most potent and radical message to be one not just of wonder, but of wonder as means of approaching difference, of experiencing and understanding the Other. As God, Christ is supposed to be radically foreign, but as Jesus he is intimately human. The theology of incarnation explains that union\u2019s tension, but the broader philosophical implications concern how love must be inculcated by wonder at this paradox. The philosopher Simon Critchley, describing the contours for a \u201cfaith of the faithless,\u201d writes that \u201cChrist is the incarnation of love as an act of imagination \u2026 the imaginative projection of love onto all creatures.\u201dWonder is the antidote to hatred, for wonder is fundamentally radical. Had Herod any sense of wonder for the exquisite singularity of all people, would the massacre of the innocents have commenced? If we had wonder at the individual universe that is each fellow human, at the cosmic complexity of other people, would we put refugees in cages?We do not have to look far into the current state of the world to realize that this time requires a return to wonder \u2014 what I would call a \u201cpolitics of wonder,\u201d predicated on both empathy and celebration of difference. Those of us, religious believers or not, who understand the profound meaning of the nativity must fight on behalf of wonder and in the service of a future society that places wonder at its very center. If a \u201cright to wonder\u201d sounds utopian or quixotic, if it implies radical reorientation and questioning, it is seems untenable or strange, then that\u2019s precisely the point. To put wonder at the center of our personal and political lives is not denialism, but a rebellion against the life-denying strictures of the present. To wonder is an act of resistance, and an act of love. We require this not just on Christmas, but on every day of the year, not just because it may save our lives, but also because it will remind us of why they need saving in the first place.Ed Simon is a staff writer for The Millions, an editor at Berfrois, and an adjunct assistant professor of English and media studies at Bentley University.

But in the time since, greenhouse gas emissions, the global temperature average and cost of climate-related heat, wildfires, droughts, flooding and hurricanes have continued to rise.To avoid this, greenhouse gas emissions would need to fall by nearly half from 2010 levels in the next 12 years and reach a net of zero by 2050. But in the United States, the world\u2019s second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, President Trump continues to question the science of climate change, and his administration is rolling back emissions limits on power plants and fuel economy standards on cars and light trucks, while pushing to accelerate the use of fossil fuels. Other major nations around the world aren\u2019t cutting emissions quickly enough, either.So what has happened over the last 30 years? Progress has been made in fits and starts, but not nearly enough has been done to confront the planet-altering magnitude of what we have unleashed.

A decade of political self-indulgence at home risks leaving us without a credible voice in Asia.At a time when China, our major trading partner, is ascendant and our traditional allies in the North Atlantic are in retreat, Australia should be stepping up as a champion of openness. But our politicians are turning inward, and now the beleaguered conservative government of Scott Morrison is threatening to reduce immigration, our main engine of growth.But our tawdry domestic politics undermines these natural advantages by corroding our global standing. Australia has changed prime ministers five times since 2010, four times in party back-room coups and only once at a general election.We are reminded of our ambiguous place in the Asia-Pacific each time we change leaders. Each new prime minister seems to blunder into a diplomatic spat with our nearest neighbor, Indonesia, the new rising economic star of Asia and the world\u2019s largest Muslim-majority country. Each unnecessary argument raises the risk of a more serious rupture between Canberra and Jakarta, as the politics of both countries are coarsened by their respective nationalist fringes.In previous disputes, Indonesians did not have the clout to harm Australia\u2019s interests. This time, however, the Indonesians are flexing their economic leverage \u2014 and Asia is watching.Mr. Joko has his own election to fight next year and cannot afford the perception at home that he has compromised the Palestinian cause. And so the history of these two Asian neighbors repeats in stalemate as short-term politics in both democracies prevents an easy resolution to the dispute.Australia has a direct stake in Indonesia\u2019s success. Our overriding interest is for Indonesia to remain an ally in the fight against regional terrorism, and to become an active partner in helping check the unilateral impulses of China.The key to this engagement is openness and mutual respect.Mr. Morrison displayed neither quality in his handling of the embassy dispute. At home, it might have been excused as a rookie error. But in the region, it reaffirmed a pattern of Australian insensitivity and unreliability.Five years earlier, it became public that Australia\u2019s intelligence agency had tapped the phone of the Indonesian president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, and his wife, Ani Yudhoyono. The prime minister at the time, Tony Abbott, refused to apologize.It took the better part of two years, and the replacement of the abrasive Mr. Abbott with the cosmopolitan Malcolm Turnbull as prime minister, to restore a full working relationship between the countries. That work was undone by Mr. Morrison.Australia\u2019s political class remains haunted by the sins of its founding fathers. When the nation was formed in 1901, the first significant piece of legislation was the White Australia Policy, which banned immigration from Asia. High tariffs were added to its cocktail of national self-harm, and it took decades to undo the economic and reputational damage. The last vestiges of racial selection in immigration were removed in 1973, and the tariff wall dismantled over the course of the 1990s.The present generation of members of Parliament has known only the open economic and social model. Only a handful have any experience of the last recession, which ended in 1991. Many believe that slashing immigration is an antidote to problems of congestion in the big cities. In New South Wales, for example, the conservative government is calling for a halving of immigration to the state.But any gratuitous cut in immigration threatens to cause a recession at home, and would be a reminder of that older Australia that thought it could have it both ways: as an exporter to the region who didn\u2019t want its people in return.George Megalogenis is an author and a commentator.

The seven-member appellate body hears appeals in disputes between W.T.O. members. But rather than fix the problems, Mr. Lighthizer appears to prefer blowing up the entire system.At a meeting of the W.T.O.\u2019s General Council in mid-December, the European Union and 11 nations, including China, Canada, Mexico and South Korea, proposed changes to the body\u2019s dispute settlement system in response to American complaints. They hoped the amendments would convince the United States to allow vacancies on the appellate panel to be filled.That creates the risk of turning every W.T.O. dispute into a mini-trade war. Rather than waiting for the impasse over the judges to be resolved, countries will take trade disputes into their own hands, engaging in retaliation and counter-retaliation that could escalate indefinitely. It also signals a desire by the Trump administration to return to an unsustainable might-makes-right system.This threat to the dispute settlement system comes just when the United States needs it most. Without it, America will have no mechanism to hold China accountable for its persistent theft of intellectual property, its rampant use of subsidies or its cybersecurity breaches. And the United States will have no forum in which to defend the interests of American businesses when China insists on transfers of critical technology as the price for approvals for joint venture licenses or other permits to do business in China.The United States is on the verge of major victories at the W.T.O. for American farmers in challenges to Chinese agriculture subsidies and to discriminatory restraints on American exports of wheat, corn and rice. All China needs to do to prevent those rulings from becoming binding obligations is to appeal them to the soon-to-be nonexistent appellate panel, potentially setting off another trade war.This belligerence toward the W.T.O. comes even though the United States has won more W.T.O. cases than any other country. America relies on the W.T.O. to protect the ability of American farmers, workers and intellectual property owners to export their goods and services without fear of being discriminated against simply because they are American.The intransigence of Mr. Lighthizer and other trade hard-liners in the Trump administration must be challenged. Members of Congress and their constituents \u2014 farmers, workers and corporations \u2014 need to fight for a system of trading rules and a mechanism to enforce them that benefits everyone. Leaders here and abroad should press the United States and China to bring their trade war into the W.T.O. And if all else fails, the members of the W.T.O. should band together to appoint appellate judges over the United States\u2019 unilateral objection.Trade and trade disputes should take place under predictable and clear rules that can be fairly enforced. The world has such a system with the W.T.O., and we should not allow it to be destroyed. History shows that the alternative is resolution of trade wars through much more destructive means.Jennifer Hillman is a professor at Georgetown Law Center, a former member of the World Trade Organization\u2019s appellate body and a former ambassador and general counsel in the Office of the United States Trade Representative.Advertisement"}

At least 13 metro stations were closed ahead of the protests last Saturday. Some cultural institutions near the demonstrations were closed pre-emptively on Saturday, including the Arc de Triomphe and the Grand Palais, while others, like the Mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Orangerie, closed some entrances.For now, the museums, shops and metros that were affected have all reopened, but protests, possibly violent ones, could continue on future Saturdays and force the shutdown of transportation, institutions and services.Known as S.T.E.P., the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program asks Americans to register their travel plans in the free program. In the case of emergency, including a natural disaster or civil unrest, the United States embassy in that country will get in touch directly with travel advice.I.M.G. advises avoiding large gatherings and overt signs of wealth, in stores, vehicles and upscale neighborhoods, as these have been targets of some protesters.However, travelers in France who have already purchased travel insurance or those considering it for a future trip may find that their policy includes covering missed connections or travel delays. So, if a traveler is unable to get to an airport as planned because of subway or road closures related to the protests, then the policy holder may be able to file a claim for reimbursement.Another option for nervous travelers is a travel insurance upgrade known as \u201ccancel for any reason.\u201d This allows travelers to cancel their trip up until about two or three days before departure without explaining why. Most policies have to be purchased within a few days or a few weeks of initially buying the trip.In a statement, Marriott International wrote, \u201cDue to demonstrations in the local area our hotels are open but operating with enhanced security.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "France\u2019s Yellow Vest Protests: The Movement That Has Put Paris on Edge", "Date": "2018-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was the third weekend of protests and confrontations with the police by the group, and by far the most damaging.The cost of repairing just the Arc de Triomphe \u2014 apart from the graffiti, there was damage to artifacts kept inside \u2014 could reach one million euros (about $1.15 million), according to the Center for National Monuments. On Monday, merchants and government officials were still assessing the total property damage.More than 260 people were wounded nationwide, and at least three died outside Paris on the margins of the protests over the last three weekends. More than 400 people were arrested in Paris.The government kept an aloof stance toward the protests until late last week, hoping the movement would peter out. Now the government is shifting its approach.The petition went mostly unnoticed until October, when \u00c9ric Drouet, a truck driver from the same area as Ms. Ludosky, ran across it and circulated it among his Facebook friends. Newspapers began writing about the petition, and the number of signatures skyrocketed from an initial 700 to 200,000. Today it has more than 1.15 million signatures and counting.When Mr. Drouet decided to hold a car rally cum protest on Nov. 17 to demand lower gas prices, word spread on social media. Soon, autonomous groups formed in many French departments \u2014 subdivisions of the country\u2019s 13 regions \u2014 and they decided to hold their own protests.Early on, people who agreed with the petition were encouraged to show their support by displaying the high-visibility yellow vest every driver in France must by law carry, in case of roadside trouble. Supporters were asked to place the vests on their dashboard or back shelf.Those who participated were predominantly men and women who rely on their cars to get to work and take care of their families. In the mix were small-business owners, independent contractors, farmers, home aides, nurses and truck drivers. They live and work primarily in rural towns and in the suburbs or exurbs of France\u2019s big cities, many earning just enough to get by.Many people who have not participated in the protests say they support them or are sympathetic to those on the street. That suggests the protests may again grow in size, or continue for a long time. Despite the damage over the weekend in Paris and elsewhere, overall support for the movement remains high, according to several polls.The median earner in 2016 in France took home about 1,700 euros ($1,930) a month, but that means that half of the French took home less. The income has to cover rent, food, utilities and clothing, as well as the cost of fuel.Some of the movement\u2019s supporters say that if they were poorer, the government would help them with subsidies. But like the working poor in other Western countries, they are just above the poverty line, and unable to take advantage of government support.The gas tax, which is slated to rise again in January by a few cents per liter, is often described by the French as \u201cthe drop of water that makes the vase overflow.\u201dSince public transportation is limited in rural France and the suburbs, most of the Yellow Vests have no choice but to use their cars \u2014 and are especially sensitive to fuel tax hikes. And that tax comes on top of already high payroll taxes that help the government pay for the health care system, social security and unemployment insurance, among other things.Their demands span a broad spectrum.The movement has so many participants with different circumstances and politics that it is hard to imagine everyone agreeing on a single list of demands.Self-described \u201cmoderate\u201d Yellow Vests who wrote an opinion piece on Sunday in a French newspaper, Le Journal du Dimanche, said a freeze on the planned gas tax increase was a precondition for negotiating with the government. Others have called for President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s resignation, and some say Parliament should dissolve itself and hold new elections.The government initially dug in its heels. Mr. Macron said there would be no modification of the planned tax increase nor of other policies designed to reduce France\u2019s carbon footprint and move to less polluting energy sources.But after three weekends of protests, each more violent than the last, the government seems to be taking stock of its options. Although neither Mr. Macron nor his prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, have suggested that they would consider a moratorium on the tax increases, many members of Parliament are calling for a suspension of the tax.Mr. Macron, who was away this past weekend at a G-20 economic summit in Argentina, has yet to speak publicly about the situation. Many politicians on the left and the right, and some in his own party, say he needs to respond.The president has postponed a trip to Serbia and canceled some meetings. And he asked the prime minister to meet with the leaders of French political parties and also with the Yellow Vests\u2019 representatives.The meetings with the Yellow Vests have not yet been scheduled, in part because it is unclear who represents them.Although several people have emerged and described themselves as representatives of the Yellow Vests, it appears they have little sway with others in the movement. On Sunday, the self-selected representatives said they could meet with Mr. Philippe, but on Monday they backed away after threats and protests from other Yellow Vests.No one knows, and the government itself appears unsure, vacillating between a more open approach and doubling down on the use of force to stop the unrest.If Mr. Macron stays the course and goes through with the tax increase, there are political hazards. The decision could prompt many more people to join the protests, likely resulting in more violence and property damage.But bowing to the protesters\u2019 demands and seeming to cave in to the French street has political downsides as well. If the government cedes on the moratorium on the gas tax, it might satisfy some protesters. But others may then just escalate their demands.Unless the government does much more to reach out to the working poor, small business owners, independent contractors and to all those who live outside the wealthy areas of Paris and other big cities, the unrest seems likely to spread.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Can the U.S. Stop China From Controlling the Next Internet Age?", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech executives worry China will turn to tit-for-tat arrests of Americans in response to the detention of Meng Wanzhou. And the worries don\u2019t stop there. Ms. Swisher covers technology and is a contributing opinion writer. Imagine, if you will (and you should), a big American tech executive being detained over unspecified charges while on a trip to Beijing.\u201cIt\u2019s worrisome, because it\u2019s an escalation we did not need,\u201d one executive said, referring to the already tense trade talks between the two countries. \u201cWhat China will do, given all the existing tensions, is anyone\u2019s guess.\u201dNo one I spoke to would talk on the record, out of fear of antagonizing either side and also because no one knows exactly what is happening. But many expressed worry about the possibility of tit-for-tat arrests. While everyone focuses on the drama of the arrest \u2014 Ms. Meng was grabbed while changing planes at the airport \u2014 and its effect on the trade talks and stock prices, to my mind there is a much more important fight brewing, and it is about tech hegemony. Specifically, who will control the next internet age, and by whose rules will it be run?Until recently, that answer was clearly the United States, from which the Internet sprang, wiring the world together and, in the process, resulting in the greatest creation of power and wealth in history. While China has always had a strong technology sector, in recent years it has significantly escalated its investment, expertise and innovation, with major support from the government.That hand-in-glove relationship creates obvious issues, and the Trump administration is right to stop pretending that China does not present a threat both from security and innovation perspectives.But the high-profile arrest of Ms. Meng underscored a new and disturbing spiraling in the already complex relationship the tech industry has with China and the Trump administration.The Justice Department had been investigating Huawei on suspicion of having violated sanctions against exporting American technologies to Iran, and the arrest of Ms. Meng appears to be part of that effort. Since Huawei has become a global powerhouse in smartphones and equipment for the mobile networks, it\u2019s no surprise that scrutiny about whose interests it is serving would increase. The company\u2019s founder, and Ms. Meng\u2019s father, Ren Zhengfei, was a former engineer in the People\u2019s Liberation Army, which had long set off warning bells among American intelligence officials about Huawei\u2019s ties with the Chinese government. All this makes the move against Ms. Meng look like a particularly bold one and a message to China that the United States has come to play. The government has a lot to be concerned about. As critical 5G \u2014 fifth generation \u2014 wireless networks roll out over the world, many are being deployed by Huawei. These are the networks that will usher in the next age of innovation, and the idea of China \u2014 which pretty much exemplifies the surveillance economy \u2014 dominating that age is troubling.But I am perplexed about why the Trump administration has been such an embarrassment when it comes to the kind of actual leadership and vision needed to keep the United States at the forefront of the tech race. Our government\u2019s commitment to investment in what\u2019s coming next is the best counterpart to vigilance against competitors like China. Instead, we are seeing a loud but decidedly empty effort to promote the idea that tech manufacturing should return to the United States (it won\u2019t) and a very weak commitment to bringing qualified tech and science minds into the centers of power (a good pick for the head of the Office of Science and Technology Policy has yet to be confirmed after being nominated this year).From where I sit, the sentiment in Silicon Valley seems to be: Good for the government for being tough on Chinese companies when they break the rules \u2014 that rule-breaking having been a longtime complaint of companies like Cisco and Apple. Vigilance is key, of course, but everyone would feel a lot more confident if the government was also focused on investing more in American innovation and if the crackdown looked less chaotic.Which is why you can imagine a big American tech executive being detained over unspecified charges while on a trip to Beijing. And our government should, too.Advertisement"}

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.Mr. Mattis did not specifically mention the president\u2019s seemingly impulsive decision on Syria, but he and other top aides were clearly caught by surprise. With Mr. Mattis\u2019s departure, the last of the original group of grounded professionals who have, with at least partial success, restrained Mr. Trump on foreign and defense policy are now gone.It was less than three months ago that John Bolton, the national security adviser, spelled out a broader mission for the American troops in Syria.At the time, it sounded like an authoritative statement of official policy. Only, as is so often the case with Donald Trump\u2019s chaotic presidency, it apparently wasn\u2019t.It appears to have been the final straw for Mr. Mattis, who has walked a tightrope for the past two years between his training and his conscience, and the whims of his president. He kept his concerns mainly to himself, while slow-walking a number of Mr. Trump\u2019s demands, like banning transgender troops and seeking a full-dress military parade down Pennsylvania Avenue. Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a tweet that Mr. Mattis\u2019s departure was \u201cscary.\u201d He called him \u201can island of stability amidst the chaos of the Trump administration.\u201dSoldiers have a duty to follow their leader and carry out lawful orders. But success depends on trusting that the leader knows what he\u2019s doing and where he\u2019s going.Sending conflicting orders to soldiers on the battlefield, as Mr. Trump and his administration are doing, not only hampers morale and undermines allied forces like the Syrian Kurds, it could also risk getting American soldiers killed or wounded for objectives their commanders had already abandoned. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who generally supports Mr. Trump, said he and others in the national security establishment were \u201cblindsided\u201d by the announcement. He called for congressional hearings on the decision.There was no attempt to use the leverage of an American withdrawal to achieve any specific political or military goal.No one wants American troops deployed in a war zone longer than necessary. But there is no indication that Mr. Trump has thought through the consequences of a precipitous withdrawal, including allowing ISIS forces to regroup and create another crisis that would draw the United States back into the region.Among the biggest losers are likely to be the Kurdish troops that the United States has equipped and relied on to fight the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, considers many of the Kurds to be terrorists bent on destroying his country. In recent days he has vowed to launch a new offensive against them in the Syrian border region. Mr. Trump discussed his withdrawal decision in a telephone call with Mr. Erdogan on Friday.Decisions of such consequence normally are thoroughly vetted by a president\u2019s national security advisers. But congressional lawmakers said there were no signs that any process was followed, and a senior White House official, refusing to discuss internal deliberations, said Wednesday, \u201cThe issue here is the president made a decision.\u201dJudging from the timing and tone of Mr. Mattis\u2019 letter of resignation, the president made that decision alone.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Willy Wonka and the Medical Software Factory", "Date": "2018-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe engineers at Epic Systems work on a campus full of childish whimsy but also sit in on open-heart surgery. Is this the indulgence of an oddball founder, or a better way to run an I.T. company?Epic Systems is a health care services provider with $2.7 billion in annual revenue. Its mathematician chief executive, Judy Faulkner, is a billionaire recluse who hosts P.T. Barnum-esque gatherings for clients. Those clients \u2014 big hospitals and health systems around the United States and more than a dozen overseas markets \u2014 are served by customer-service representatives known as BFFs. Every month, employees are compelled to gather in a subterranean chamber for two-and-a-half-hour staff meetings that have been likened to a megachurch experience. Workers are discouraged from ordering business materials on Amazon or living more than 45 minutes away from the office, in order to shorten commutes and keep Epic\u2019s wealth in the local economy.Epic\u2019s software is ubiquitous in doctors\u2019 offices and operating rooms, and companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet regularly hoover up its young engineers. Yet most people outside of the Madison environs, I\u2019d be confident to say, have never heard of the company.I certainly hadn\u2019t. I cover Wall Street, not health care or technology, and when I came across the privately held Epic this year I was consumed with questions. Who was this publicity-shy yet spectacle-loving C.E.O., and how did her theme-park sensibility coexist with the mundanity of health care billing protocols? Was Epic\u2019s odd culture a magnet for talent and clients, or was it an indulgence that kept the company from growing even bigger? In August, I traveled to Wisconsin to see what this 1,100-acre Midwestern behemoth might be hiding.When I arrived in Epic\u2019s hometown, Verona, two beaming receptionists at the Fairfield Inn tried to offer me something called the \u201cEpic discount.\u201d When I said I couldn\u2019t accept anything of value from the company, they clarified that the special rate was a gesture of gratefulness from the hotel, on account of the huge proportion of guests who come to do business with Epic. It is by far the dominant player in Verona, where the population of 10,600 is comparable to the company\u2019s head count of 9,800.Epic\u2019s headquarters were a short drive away, down a meandering road through countryside dotted with Queen Anne\u2019s lace and farm equipment. I drove past a giant Tin Man, the first indication of the campus\u2019s fairy-tale aesthetic, and into guest parking, in one of the campus\u2019s few aboveground lots.The design theme was childish even by the standards of technology start-ups, where ball pits and scooters are common. I paused at the Cavey Den, a hollowed-out treehouse with stumps for seats and children\u2019s books, then rocked on a rocking horse and ate a cookie from a jar, wondering what time was set aside for naps. There was a long series of clay slabs with handprint impressions from longtime employees, and walls and walls of art sourced from Wisconsin-area artists: a dragon perched in an iron bird cage; expanses of blue and purple stained glass; a clock featuring manicured poodles and Cupid; an old-timey circus ad painted on canvas.The diversions went beyond art. At the Black Dragon cafe, which was next to an informal band-practice area, a sandwich board advertised oatmeal for 75 cents and bacon for $1. Along the Indiana Jones tunnel, decorated with vines and a golden idol, the sound of dripping water and roaring animals played in a constant loop. A conference room named after a Star Wars planet was reached via a rickety swinging bridge. All around me, young workers in shorts and band T-shirts hurried past. (The company\u2019s dress code is that when visitors are on campus, wear clothes.)The next morning, I woke up feeling off: a throat infection I\u2019d been treating with antibiotics seemed to be getting worse. Verona, while long on breweries, day cares, artisanal pizza and jumbo mortgages, lacks an urgent-care clinic, so I drove into nearby west Madison for some attention.The clinic I found was, naturally, running on an Epic system that logged me in, took my information and tracked my health statistics. The nurse\u2019s assistant who saw me had visited Epic during her training, as do many medical professionals who work with its technology as part of their jobs.Once you know what Epic does in health care, you see it everywhere. When I left the urgent-care center, diagnosed with a gnarly case of strep, the summary printout I was given was branded on one corner with Epic\u2019s insignia.The next day, back at company headquarters, I sat in one of the less Montessori-style conference rooms with Steve Dickmann, 72, the chief administrative officer. He became animated when explaining some of the more functional, less fantastical features of the space. \u201cThe whole campus is designed to promote productivity, creativity, comfort,\u201d he said.There was a philosophy behind everything. All employees have offices, because studies show that workers in open floor plans get interrupted frequently. Stairs promote socialization, but buildings can\u2019t be more than three stories, because workers are reluctant to climb more than a flight or two. Every conference room must have windows so that visitors don\u2019t feel hemmed in during days and days of training.The overriding mission, Mr. Dickmann said, was to ensure the safety of patients at facilities that use Epic software. If health care programmers make mistakes, he said, \u201cbad things can happen.\u201dEpic\u2019s coders often leave campus to embed in operating and recovery rooms, where they watch nurses ripping the tops off blood bags and surgeons opening up people\u2019s chest cavities. It\u2019s an experience that young engineers are unlikely to get at, say, Facebook or Snap, working on algorithms that tailor ads to demographic groups or insert rainbow vomit into photographs.Programmers regularly faint at the sight of beating hearts, scalpels and bodily fluids. \u201cThere were people that would pass out in the hallway\u201d of hospitals, said Aaron Webb, who worked at Epic for 10 years as a software developer. He watched \u201chundreds\u201d of surgeries, often with his team in tow, before moving to Seattle, where he now works for a business that matches companies with storage space. \u201cBut if you can\u2019t understand what your users are going through, you\u2019re not going to design a good system.\u201dEpic works its more than 5,000 programmers hard. Middle-of-the-night technical crises, stress-related illness and employees weeping from exhaustion in airport lounges are not uncommon, say former employees. Long hours are expected. One piece of company lore has it that during a construction project, Ms. Faulkner questioned a plan to install motion-activated light switches, noting that employees might be sitting still at their desks for such long stretches that they\u2019d frequently find themselves in the dark. (The sensors were installed, and she was proved correct.)This combination of chaotic, stressful client visits and isolating, mundane office work might explain the company\u2019s Disney dimension. Epic is a place where wedding music plays on a campuswide public-announcement system when new clients are signed. Dry-cleaning services are found at the \u201cNew York Sock Exchange.\u201d Employees can hurtle down an \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d slide into a room with miniature furniture. They are encouraged to visit a conference room encased by waterfalls and a shark pond when in need of inspiration. (The shark is fake.) Internal awards for outstanding work are named after Jack Bauer and MacGyver.A few hours after my sit-down with Mr. Dickmann, I was granted an audience with Ms. Faulkner herself. We met in her personal conference room, a place of warm earth tones, steaming hot tea and personal memorabilia, including a copy of the prayer \u201cDesiderata\u201d with faux-burned margins mounted on a wall. \u201cI think we save many, many, many lives a year,\u201d she told me.Born in 1943, Ms. Faulkner said she taught herself to code in a week, using a Fortran textbook, during her undergraduate years at Dickinson College. As a graduate student in computer science at the University of Wisconsin, she conceived a prototype for Epic while sitting in her living room one day in the mid-1970s.\u201cThe sun was shining, I was disattentive, I was just sitting there and suddenly it all came to me: Here\u2019s how you build it,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I remember running into the kitchen, grabbing a pad of paper and just writing code, code, code, code,\u201d she said. While she went on to teach computer science for a period, she kept coming back to the idea, and in 1979, in a Madison basement, she founded what would become Epic: a start-up called Human Services Computing. Today, some of Epic\u2019s foundational programming still bears Ms. Faulkner\u2019s initials.Ms. Faulkner is now 75, and over the last four years, the company she built has grown an average of 14 percent a year, according to revenue figures it shared with The Times. She has instructed her heirs (she has three children) and stock-holding employees, who together constitute a majority of the company\u2019s equity holders, that they must always vote their shares in favor of keeping Epic private. They must also ensure that Epic is run by an executive who already works for the company, and that that person is a software developer.That decision-making may not occur for a while. It\u2019s \u201cmore likely that I\u2019d die than that I\u2019d retire,\u201d she said.\u201cI look at our financial information maybe for a minute a month,\u201d she said.One criticism that has dogged Epic is that its software sometimes won\u2019t connect with that of competitors, meaning that patient information can\u2019t move around as seamlessly as it should. The company has chipped away at the problem in recent years, but much remains to be done.\u201cThe problem isn\u2019t the lack of effort, it\u2019s the lack of standards,\u201d said Jim Turnbull, the chief information officer for the University of Utah system and a longtime Epic client. \u201cUntil the federal government and all the vendors recognize that we have too many standards, I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be possible to completely interoperate,\u201d he said, using the industry term for connectivity.The day after meeting with Ms. Faulkner, I took a final tour of Epic with its head of media relations, Meghan Roh, who was hired in 2017 as the first person ever to occupy that position. We went down a slide connecting the ground floor of a building called Heaven, with a white interior, to a lower level with an elevator whose floors were marked Devil, Satan, Lucifer, Beelzebub and Mephistopheles. (When you press a button, you hear audio of an imaginary demon saying, \u201cPlease come in. It\u2019s nice and toasty in here.\u201d)Underground is also where you\u2019ll find Epic\u2019s auditorium. Built partly to preserve the sightlines on campus and minimize water and waste runoff, the gathering place hosts the Verona high school\u2019s annual graduation ceremony as well as Epic\u2019s monthly staff meetings, at which attendance is required. On the way in, employees are served popcorn and coffee, an homage to an earlier point when the company used movie theaters for large meetings, and shown a reel of pictures of recent staff weddings, newborn babies and beloved pets. Then they hear presentations on new products and priorities, matters of company philosophy, and new \u201carmies\u201d being formed for employees to brainstorm software-based solutions to epidemics like the opioid crisis and maternal morbidity.Workers who fully commit to Epic \u2014 who survive the long hours and grisly sights \u2014 are treated to a remarkable perk. After five years, they get a sabbatical, including round-trip airfare for two to travel somewhere they\u2019ve never been for a month, plus a per diem for meals and lodging. (They get another sabbatical after 10 years, 15, and so on.)Epic is constantly scanning the undergraduate ranks for new hires. Rather than sticking to engineer incubator schools like M.I.T. or Stanford, it scouts institutions like Carleton College in Minnesota and Clemson University in South Carolina. Candidates take online tests to gauge their problem-solving skills and, if they pass muster, are whisked to Madison for an on-campus interview and tour of the area.Once on board, employees take a multiweek training course that includes basic business etiquette as well as Epic-specific skill building. Officials preach a flat structure in which it\u2019s never O.K. to turn down colleagues for help. They also teach a tactic called \u201cbadgering\u201d \u2014 remember, it\u2019s Wisconsin \u2014 or the art of being persistent but not maddening.Epic\u2019s broad recruiting strategy and perks help draw people in, but over time, it\u2019s the cultures of both Wisconsin and Epic that help keep people there.\u201cThe only reason I left Epic was so that my family could move out West,\u201d said Mr. Webb, the former Epic programmer. \u201cEvery day was different. And it was fun. And just being able to go see the impact you were having, that was really, really cool.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated how patients' medical records are handled. They are accessed by software that runs on Epic servers; they are not stored on Epic servers.Advertisement"}

It can affect politics in ways that have nothing to do with him. And it cares about ideals larger than the electoral fortunes of the Democratic Party.Two, the country still needs a federal law to restrict gerrymandering. Today, politicians of both parties engage in the practice \u2014 and effectively disempower voters in the process. The Republicans have done more gerrymandering than Democrats lately. But Democrats have done it too, notably in Maryland and Illinois.Once in a while, though, there are signs of progress.Over the past two years at the colleges in the initiative reporting data, the number of students receiving federal Pell Grants has risen to almost 218,000 from 210,000.

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.Federal, state and local governments have gotten into the habit of providing corporations with incentives to move, incentives to stay, bailouts to stave off failure and tax benefits to build on success and create more jobs. All are based on promises about job creation and economic development that more often than not prove hollow. By paying incentives, governors, mayors and other politicians feel they\u2019re \u201cwinning\u201d jobs from competitors.

{"Headline": "Why We Cover High Fashion", "Date": "2018-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnderstanding The TimesThe Times\u2019s fashion director and chief fashion critic reflects on what makes haute couture relevant.When people ask me why I like covering fashion, one of my answers is that clothes are one of the very few universal subjects: Everyone has to think about food, shelter and what they put on their bodies. Even nudists think about what they wear \u2014 they just reject the idea of wearing anything.But there are parts of the clothes conversation that are less accessible than others. Most notably, the haute couture. The what?Exactly.Quick crib sheet: Haute couture is a twice-yearly five-day show fiesta in Paris where a select handful of brands produce handmade-to-order garments that cost approximately $10,000 to $100,000 a piece. Yes, you read that right.To qualify as a couture house, which is an official designation like champagne, a brand must maintain an atelier of a certain number of artisans full time and produce a specific number of garments twice a year for a show. There are only a very few that can fulfill the requirements, including Chanel, Dior and Valentino. A lot have dropped out over the years (Balmain, Versace, Saint Laurent), and the governing organization that adjudicates this has relaxed some of its rules to admit younger, less resourced and guest designers, like Iris van Herpen and Guo Pei, who made Rihanna\u2019s Met Gala sunny-side-up egg cape.Sounds like the ultimate let-them-eat-cake event, right? In a world struggling with income inequality, riven by tides of immigration and deep social divisions, where streetwear is on the rise, why cover it at all?For me, it\u2019s never been about imagining myself in the clothes, or even being able to buy the clothes, any more than watching great sports is about being able to play soccer like Lionel Messi.It\u2019s about using this particular craft form as a wormhole into what\u2019s going on in the world. The gowns themselves may not seem that relevant. But the issues they raise are.Like, for example, the fact that to a certain extent any women\u2019s wear collection, at any level, is a treatise on female identity at that particular moment in time. At least if it\u2019s any good. That\u2019s why Karl Lagerfeld made his Chanel bride wear the pants last January, not the corseted meringue; why at Dior, Maria Grazia Chiuri paid homage to Leonor Fini, an early 20th-century Surrealist (I don\u2019t think anyone would dispute the surreal nature of our current era); why at Givenchy, Clare Waight Keller protected gowns dripping in silver fringe with military greatcoats.Like the fact that the mostly French gatekeepers of couture, the most rigid of fashion sectors, have increasingly lowered barriers to entry to woo and admit designers from China, Lebanon and Russia. Fashion is acknowledging the value of porous borders, even as its Western European home grows more skittish about them.Like the fact that this is as good a way as any to talk about the current tension between the handmade and human (and historical) and the technological. It\u2019s the fashion equivalent of reading books versus watching YouTube.After all, these are all garments created mostly by hand as part of a long tradition. Last season at Valentino, the designer Pierpaolo Piccioli named each dress after the person who made it, practically fetishizing the artisan in the face of \u2026 well, Facebook.Sound familiar? If you\u2019re still wondering what this has to do with you, I\u2019ll leave you with two words: Melania Trump.She wore Chanel couture to the French state dinner last April. And all those gilded pigeons suddenly came home to roost.Advertisement"}

What do you think of his argument?4. Following in the footsteps of his father, Gerald tries out for the high school football team, makes it to varsity, and then sees intimately the injuries and sacrifice the game requires. He writes that it\u2019s no wonder that football is America\u2019s favorite pastime, and that he learned \u201chow far you can make it in America if you have enough disregard for your personal welfare.\u201d Do you agree with this statement?5. Gerald describes growing up in the blighted South Oak Cliff neighborhood of Dallas, in a childhood characterized by absent parents, drug use and disability checks. But while many believe that people are defined by their circumstances, he says we are actually defined by running from them. How is this true for him? Is it true for you?7.

When Gerald leaves his Dallas youth behind to go play football at Yale, he writes that he quickly learned that the word \u201cnetwork\u201d is the defining word of today. Relatedly, he writes that the real American dream is not about finding success through working hard, but about knowing the right people. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?10.

Professor Gluck specializes in health policy at Yale Law School, where Ms. Turret is a student.Yes, the Democrats reclaimed the House. But you should not assume that your health care coverage is now safe. The biggest threat is President Trump himself: His administration has been relentlessly assaulting the Affordable Care Act for two years, and that threat has not abated. Democrats may have made significant electoral gains by running on the protection of the pre-existing-conditions guarantee to insurance, but Republicans apparently aren\u2019t listening. The president and his party remain focused on taking health care away.Let\u2019s start with the insurance markets. Combining healthy and sick people into a single insurance pool as the A.C.A. requires drives down the cost of insurance. The administration is destroying this pool to isolate less healthy people in their own market with skyrocketing premiums so the public and the insurance industry will turn against the law.And then there is the meritless lawsuit in Texas. Mr. Trump\u2019s Justice Department has chosen not to defend the suit and to let the A.C.A. benefits die, including the guarantee of insurance even if you have a pre-existing condition \u2014 despite President Trump and Republican candidates across the country swearing to defend them only weeks ago. The A.C.A. has been the most resilient statute in modern American history. It has survived two major Supreme Court challenges, more than 50 attempts to repeal it, state reluctance to obey it, and relentless administrative sabotage. But every day the assault continues, real people are hurt and our health care system is put in jeopardy. When the Democrats take back the House in January, we can expect them to step in and defend the A.C.A. in court; hold hearings to investigate the consequences of the administration\u2019s illegal rules; and use their oversight authority to make the Department of Health and Human Services account for its decisions. The House may well pass other bills to strengthen the A.C.A.\u2019s protections. But with just one chamber, there is only so much it can do. Just because the election is over, we should not let Mr. Trump and his party escape accountability.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What We Now Know About Russian Disinformation", "Date": "2018-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Senate gave my research team data from social media companies. The picture that emerges is grim.The Senate committee asked two research teams, one of which I led, to investigate the full scope of the recent multiyear Russian operation to influence American opinion executed by a company called the Internet Research Agency. The Senate provided us with data attributed to the agency\u2019s operations given to the Senate by Facebook, Twitter and Alphabet (Google\u2019s parent company), companies whose platforms were manipulated for that purpose.Our report, announced by the committee on Monday, concludes that Russia was able to masquerade successfully as a collection of American media entities, managing fake personas and developing communities of hundreds of thousands, building influence over a period of years and using it to manipulate and exploit existing political and societal divisions. While Russia is hardly the only geopolitical actor with a well-thumbed disinformation playbook, a look at the data \u2014 which concerned the Internet Research Agency\u2019s operation over the last three years \u2014 reveals its enthusiasm for and commitment to modern information warfare.Regardless of what any tech executives may have said, the data indicate that this was not a small-scale problem fixable by tweaking a platform\u2019s advertising purchase policy. Rather, it was a cross-platform attack that made use of numerous features on each social network and that spanned the entire social ecosystem.Tech executives have also stressed that Russian disinformation efforts were a small percentage of the total content on any individual platform during the years in question. That is correct. But it obscures the more important point: For subgroups of targeted Americans, such as African-Americans, the messaging was perhaps ubiquitous. And disinformation does not stay within a subgroup. \u201cVirality,\u201d a term beloved by internet marketers, is apropos here: A vulnerable few contract an initial \u201cinfection\u201d that then spreads exponentially through the broader population, ultimately enabling the infection to \u201cjump\u201d into entirely different populations (including offline populations, in this case).In official statements to Congress, tech executives have said that they found it beyond their capabilities to assess whether Russia created content intended to discourage anyone from voting. We have determined that Russia did create such content. It propagated lies about voting rules and processes, attempted to steer voters toward third-party candidates and created stories that advocated not voting.Our analysis underscores the fact that such influence operations are not specific to one platform, one malign actor or one targeted group. This is a global problem. The consolidation of the online social ecosystem into a few major platforms means that propagandists have ready audiences; they need only blanket a handful of services to reach hundreds of millions of people. And precision targeting, made possible by a decade of gathering detailed user behavior data (in the service of selling ads), means that it is easy and inexpensive to reach any targeted group.Ultimately, the biggest lesson from the Senate committee\u2019s request for our investigation of Russian interference is the troubling absence of adequate structures for collaboration among multiple stakeholders, private and public alike, to establish solutions and appropriate oversight.The hard truth is that the problem of disinformation campaigns will never be fixed; it\u2019s a constantly evolving arms race. But it can \u2014 and must \u2014 be managed. This will require that social media platforms, independent researchers and the government work together as partners in the fight. We cannot rely on \u2014 nor should we place the full burden on \u2014 the social media platforms themselves.The landscape of disinformation is, frankly, a grim one. Russia has already signaled its intention to continue information operations. Terrorists strategically counter attempts to kick them off popular platforms. Domestic ideologues adopt the manipulative distribution tactics used by foreign propagandists. But there is some cause for hope. With our report (and that of others) on the Internet Research Agency data, we now have a far more complete picture of what happened with Russian disinformation efforts from 2014 to 2017. There is heightened public interest in the topic, the social platforms are actively participating in trying to find solutions and the government\u2019s investigation is fueling a conversation about regulation. Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, has even proposed a comprehensive new cyberdoctrine.With discipline, rigor and broad collaboration, we can meet this challenge, establishing standards, protocols and governance that will defend the integrity of our information.Ren\u00e9e DiResta is the director of research at New Knowledge, a cybersecurity company that monitors disinformation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bill Barr Just Argued Himself Out of a Job", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHis recent memo to President Trump seriously damages his credibility and raises questions about his fitness for the Justice Department\u2019s top position. Mr. Hemel and Mr. Posner are professors of law at the University of Chicago Law School.At the outset, Mr. Barr acknowledges that he is \u201cin the dark about many facts\u201d that bear on the special counsel\u2019s inquiry. He also claims that Mr. Mueller \u2014 who has never said whether he believes that the president obstructed justice \u2014 \u201cis proposing an unprecedented expansion of obstruction laws.\u201d He then says that \u201cMueller\u2019s theory should be rejected,\u201d again without knowing what Mr. Mueller\u2019s theory is.Instead, Mr. Barr offers a more narrow theory that the president can obstruct justice only by \u201cevidence impairment,\u201d which seems to mean shredding documents or threatening witnesses and the like. Firing the F.B.I. director for failing to act on the same evidence is apparently O.K. But this argument does not bear scrutiny.Mr. Barr also says that the obstruction statutes do not apply to \u201cfacially lawful\u201d acts by the president such as the firing of an F.B.I. director, because presidents are constitutionally authorized to fire their subordinates. But the obstruction statutes do apply to actions that would be \u201cfacially lawful\u201d under other circumstances. For example, there is no law against tearing up pieces of paper; there is a law against tearing up documents so that they cannot be subpoenaed by federal prosecutors. Firing the F.B.I. director is not a crime; firing the F.B.I. director in order to block an investigation into the president\u2019s own actions very well might be.Finally, Mr. Barr says that the president\u2019s motive in removing James Comey as F.B.I. director \u201ccould not have been \u2018corrupt\u2019 unless the President and his campaign were actually guilty of illegal collusion.\u201d Nonsense. Obstruction is a crime in itself, and for an obvious reason. If a criminal suspect successfully obstructs an investigation, the underlying crime is never discovered.The memo, which Mr. Barr shared with the White House as well as the Justice Department, shows that Mr. Barr has already made up his mind about the investigation and wanted to make sure that President Trump knew it. But now the Senate \u2014 which will soon vote on Mr. Barr\u2019s confirmation \u2014 knows it, too. If the senators want the next attorney general to do the president\u2019s bidding, then Mr. Barr\u2019s memo makes the case that he is their man.

{"Headline": "Facebook Closes 5 Accounts Tied to Russia-Like Tactics in Alabama Senate Race", "Date": "2018-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn an unusual move against Russian-style election deception inside the United States, Facebook said on Saturday it had removed five accounts of Americans who used its platform improperly in the hard-fought Alabama Senate election last year.Among those whose accounts were removed was a prominent social media researcher who worked on the Alabama operation, Jonathon Morgan, according to a person briefed on the company\u2019s action. Facebook did not name those whose accounts were closed, and it was not immediately possible to identify the others.Mr. Morgan has said the operation was an experiment to learn more about the kinds of methods Russia had used, and not to influence the outcome of the race. But the episode has sparked fears that the fraudulent Russian operations on social media could be imitated widely by American political operatives and further undermine voters\u2019 ability to sort truth from fakery as they choose candidates.The group that carried out the Alabama operation, composed of tech specialists who leaned Democratic, created a Facebook page on which they posed as conservative Alabamians. That page was shut down in 2017. They also used Twitter accounts that looked Russian \u2014 described as a \u201cfalse flag\u201d scheme in an internal report on the project \u2014 to create the impression that Russian accounts were following Mr. Moore.Elections experts have said there was little chance that the $100,000 project could have had a significant impact on a race in which more than $50 million was spent, including in the primaries.In a statement on Saturday, Facebook said it had shut down \u201cfive accounts run by multiple individuals for engaging in coordinated inauthentic behavior on Facebook around the Alabama special election, and our investigation is ongoing. We take a strong stand against people or organizations that create networks of accounts to mislead others about who they are or what they\u2019re doing.\u201dFacebook said it shuts down more than 1 million accounts each month worldwide for violating its rules. But for a researcher like Mr. Morgan, the chief executive of a cyber security firm based in Austin, Tex., called New Knowledge, the move is bound to be a stinging embarrassment. He did not reply to a request for comment on Saturday.In interviews with The Times this week, Mr. Morgan acknowledged his role in the secret Alabama operation on Facebook and Twitter but described it as a small experiment designed to understand such techniques.The internal report on the project\u2019s results, evidently prepared for those who financed it, stated in strong language that it was in fact intended to help Mr. Jones and hurt Mr. Moore and that its operators believed it had succeeded in doing so. The project was funded by Reid Hoffman, the billionaire co-founder of LinkedIn and a supporter of Democratic candidates, though a colleague of his said he did not approve of the use of deception on social media.A Twitter spokeswoman citing users\u2019 privacy, declined to say whether it had taken any action in response to the reports on the Alabama project.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Change Your Life,\u2019 the Poet Says, and a Rural Idyll Offers a Tantalizing Choice", "Date": "2018-12-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEssayA Brooklyn novelist\u2019s annual trip to the Chilean countryside fuels daydreams of permanently moving. But peace and quiet can be so, well, exasperating.Part of the pleasure, I suspect, of extended stays with relatives in another country is being able to slip into the rhythm of their days. Every year, plucking Mirabelle plums off the trees with my nieces, I wonder if perhaps I\u2019m no longer the inherently urban person I\u2019ve long considered myself to be \u2014 a possibility I mention to my spouse, and every year he agrees he may be ready for a life more like his sister\u2019s in Limache, too.Why neither of us ever recalls that we cycle through this same sequence of conversations each year I don\u2019t know. It is our shared desire, perhaps, to be immersed in the alluring fantasy of being closer to a life-altering change than we actually are.Under the current administration in the United States, I am acutely and continually aware of how fortunate we are to have the necessary papers and the means to visit my in-laws. And what Chile symbolizes in my life is certainly not \u201chome\u201d in the way it is for my husband, and it is not anything like the connection Mr. Aciman describes when he speaks of the emotional \u201cshelter\u201d he found in recalling his childhood in Alexandria, Egypt, while living as a refugee with his mother and siblings in Rome.By day 10, during yet another two-hour meal with a dozen relatives, my children raced from the table without finishing anything on their plates and I didn\u2019t stop them. In fact, I wanted to join them, or \u2014 better yet \u2014 take off alone up the dirt road beyond the parcela and keep on running until I reached the nearest bookstore many miles away and could collapse there behind a novel.When I confessed my increasing restlessness with my husband, he admitted he, too, had already begun churning up plans for when we returned to the work-filled, frenzied days in New York City that we had been so eager to flee. Why can we never recall this cycle of hypothetical plans and daydreams until we re-enact it yet again? \u201cOne merely speculates,\u201d Mr. Aciman writes of imagined other lives, \u201cand seldom does any of it have anything to do with the real world.\u201dMy tendency for mere speculation about living in Chile may be partly fueled by how few visitors from abroad we come across during our weeks in Limache. Unlike in other parts of Chile, it is an area without much of an established tourist culture. An hour\u2019s drive to the coast, in the port city of Valpara\u00edso, clots of foreign visitors form along every colorful wall mural and picturesque overlook of the ocean below.But the lush quiet of the Aconcagua Valley isn\u2019t a draw for international tourists. In the town square of what\u2019s considered \u201cnew\u201d Limache, families rent pedal cars for children to circle the sidewalks under the trees. During our afternoons escaping the heat, we often come across families from Santiago visiting relatives in the area, or former Santiaguinos who have moved there for more room and a reprieve from the traffic and air pollution in the capital. At an hour and a half\u2019s distance from Santiago, Limache occupies a similar option as a commute from Hudson, N.Y., might to someone with a job in New York City. As in upstate New York where people with city salaries move in and drive up costs, the rising number of Santiaguinos buying up land in Limache has created tensions. Soon enough, I start to fixate on these larger questions \u2014 how our half-Chilean, Brooklyn-raised children might be received at a local school. At what age would the insidious role their mother\u2019s country played in the Pinochet dictatorship begin to come up with their friends? What if we went through with the move and weren\u2019t able to find jobs, or found ones, but they didn\u2019t last?By the second Sunday, with the vapor of our daydreams beginning its inevitable fade, the complexity of the move is increasingly plain. It becomes obvious how doggedly our inner conflicts would accompany us here, as inner conflicts accompany a person anywhere. While we pack for our return to our one-bathroom apartment and the whirl of the spring semester about to begin, I remind myself that Rainer Maria Rilke\u2019s injunction \u201cyou must change your life\u201d is really about a shift in mind \u2014 not geography.And yet, on the hectic January mornings in Brooklyn, bundling up in hats and scarves, my throat tightening at whatever news spewing from the White House I managed to read before getting my children out the door, what prevails in my thoughts of our weeks in Chile is never my increasing sense of restlessness there. It is the little stream in La Campana National Park in nearby Olmu\u00e9 where my spouse and I hiked in our early 20s when I was teaching in Valpara\u00edso and he was finishing his master\u2019s degree. To see our kids playing on the same rocks we crossed two decades ago takes my breath away though we return to the stream every year.By February, shivering on the subway platform, I go back to imagining what job might make it possible to live near that stream again. This past March, when I came across an article about an organic farm in Limache and how it got started, I forwarded it to my husband who replied in seconds that he\u2019d already read it.Idra Novey is the author of the novel \u201cThose Who Knew.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Happens When Facebook Goes the Way of Myspace?", "Date": "2018-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn TechnologyFacebook earned more than $5 billion in profit last quarter, and yet it has spent much of 2018 trapped in a defensive crouch. This year was defined by brutal press coverage, internal strife, executive departures and unwanted attention from authorities. The company stands accused of various offenses: degrading politics; empowering despots; leaving users vulnerable to abuse; abusing its users\u2019 data for profit. It is in a constant state of crisis such that its executives\u2019 responses to scandals end up becoming scandals themselves.But the single event most pertinent to Facebook\u2019s future, and with the most explanatory power regarding its recent past, came in January, when the company admitted its flagship site had found a worrying limit. In late 2017, 185 million people a day were using Facebook in the United States and Canada. Despite strenuous efforts \u2014 you may have noticed more notifications lately \u2014 that number hasn\u2019t been exceeded since.The sheer scope and depth of a typical user\u2019s relationship with Facebook are unique to the site, as is its reach. Should the company ever collapse \u2014 or become so clearly moribund it might as well have died \u2014 more than a billion people worldwide would need to unwind their relationship with the platform. Of course, we\u2019ve lost plenty of networks before. One day, we\u2019ll be done with Facebook, at least as we know it. Will it be done with us?Myspace was always a mess. It encouraged users to tweak HTML on their profile pages, generating whole categories of expression and interaction beyond what was laid out for users. In hindsight, Myspace\u2019s amateurish sensibility made it difficult to understand and easy to dismiss: inscrutable user names, odd forms of interaction, millions of attempts at self-expression blending into a wall of aesthetic noise. But it bridged a dying web of personal sites with budding ideas about social networking \u2014 it\u2019s easy to forget just how sterile and organized Facebook looked in comparison when it first showed up. After years of relaunches, redesigns, data breaches and general neglect, many Myspace users have lost the ability to contact their former selves. If they\u2019re lucky (and can remember or recover their passwords), they might get access to some old photos and a list of friends \u2014 at best, shreds of evidence of something far greater, now lost.Where did everything else go? After it peaked, Myspace underwent its series of reinventions. News Corp., which acquired Myspace in 2005 for $580 million, sold it six years later for $35 million. The buyer, Specific Media, was an internet advertising company. Myspace was shrinking, but it still had lots of users, and lots of user data, as well as enough traffic to make money from ads. It had been popular with musicians, many of whom used it as a sort of home page, so Specific Media brought in Justin Timberlake to be the face of an entertainment-oriented relaunch. This version of the site, which you can still sign up for today, didn\u2019t catch on, but that didn\u2019t mean the Myspace purchase was a failure. While users had gradually lost access to their own data, Myspace\u2019s new owners had plenty of use for it. Specific Media\u2019s parent company, Viant, was a growing player in online advertising. Over the course of its life, Myspace had collected over a billion \u201cregistrations\u201d \u2014 profiles \u2014 many of which could still be matched against other, more recently updated sources of data. Viant used this data to build a \u201ccross-channel marketing initiative\u201d that the company called \u201cthe Advertising Cloud.\u201d When Time, Inc. purchased Viant in 2016, for $87 million, the company bragged that its \u201cvast pool\u201d of data, derived largely from Myspace, would help its new parent company build a \u201cdata set that rivals industry leaders Facebook and Google.\u201dAs presented, this material runs the gamut of comprehensibility. Old photos are old photos, while old chat transcripts, or a collection of \u201clikes,\u201d verge on absurdity. Facebook, it turns out, encourages you to engage in a lot of behaviors that only make sense when parsed by Facebook. At the time you might have felt you were interacting with an old friend, or your aunt \u2014 which you were \u2014 but you were also feeding data into a gigantic piece of machinery.Facebook has lived a full life \u2014 should death come, the cause will be the social media equivalent of \u201cold age.\u201d If 2018 does indeed represent some sort of apex for Facebook the site, Facebook the company won\u2019t be surprised. Unlike peak Myspace, with its impatient and half-interested owner, Facebook, still helmed by its founder and flush with cash, has the time and the freedom to begin planning for the future on its own terms. The company recently installed the executive who oversaw the growth of Facebook\u2019s News Feed to run Instagram, which has already grown from 30 million users when Facebook acquired it in 2012 to more than one billion. The founders of WhatsApp are gone, too, its 1.5 billion users now more freely and fully available to Facebook. And while Facebook is still the parent company\u2019s main moneymaker, the transfer of assets \u2014 and of data \u2014 has already begun. Instagram users have long been asked to link their accounts to Facebook; WhatsApp account information is already used, by default, to \u201cimprove\u201d a user\u2019s \u201cFacebook ads and products experiences.\u201d Advertisers buy ads for Instagram and Facebook using the same tool.The advertising data exposed in a user\u2019s personal Facebook archive is, of course, just a sliver of what is available to the company. Facebook\u2019s real profile of who you are \u2014 the one that it uses to fill your feeds and show you ads \u2014 is far more comprehensive. The company\u2019s relentless accumulation of user data isn\u2019t just a grab for power or a default behavior. It\u2019s a long-term investment. You may forget Facebook; it could happen sooner than you expect. But it\u2019s not likely to forget you.Advertisement"}

I do not understand how people have creative careers without napping. Every day at about 1 p.m., everyone faces the same choice: sleep until 2 p.m. and then work until 5, or daydream and drift around social media and take pointless meetings until 7 p.m. The friends I have who still work in offices inform me that their bosses insist they take the second option, that napping is equated with laziness. I genuinely find it bizarre. One piece of nap research demonstrated that if you nap properly, it\u2019s like waking up from a full night\u2019s sleep. You can double your day\u2019s worth of concentration. The only problem with the $25 nap is the pressure the money puts on you. The clock is running, and naps are best when the clocks stop running, when the weight of slumber falls on you of its own accord. Still, the rest was delicious. What I purchased was the ability to concentrate for the afternoon. Under hypercapitalism, the most beautiful things are the surest signs of impending crisis. The nap seems like a luxury, or even a sign of weakness, a regression into infantlike torpor. Nothing could be further from the truth. In a gig economy, the ability to take a nap is a huge advantage. The availability of a proper nap for a reasonable fee is yet another example of how inequality works. People with enough money will be able to afford the naps that allow them to have enough intellectual energy to make the money to afford the naps.

I would achieve tenure, master the Russian language and visit the world\u2019s largest statue of Paul Bunyan and his majestic blue ox, Babe, in Bemidji, Minn. My family can testify that I come by this brand of pragmatic determinism honestly. My grandfather Gerald Bowler lived in a small town in western Canada near the intersection of Bowler Place and Bowler Avenue. According to family lore, he had stared with a determined expression at an empty field for a long time with his hands on his hips and the subdivision simply materialized.I was confident that hope had its uses, but I began to think of it as a kind of arsenic that needed to be carefully administered. As far as I was concerned, it poisoned the sacred work of living in the present: taking my medication, asking about a friend\u2019s terrible boyfriend and counting my son\u2019s eyelashes as he slept in my arms. I wanted to be alive until I was not.I tried to explain this to my friend Warren, an esteemed reverend-doctor who wears his clerical collar even on Tuesdays. I teach at a divinity school that trains pastors, so these are the conversations we have in the hallways, and I told him that I had given up on the future.After a long pause he asked, \u201cWould you agree that true happiness is to enjoy the present without anxious dependence on the future?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m really hoping you are going to tell me that Jesus said that,\u201d I said. \u201cThis is a trap, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cThat was Lucius Seneca, the ancient philosopher of Stoicism,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cLook, it takes great courage to live as if each day counts. That was a fundamental insight of Stoicism. But we Christians are a people who must live into the future.\u201d I had no idea what he meant. The future was a cliff.Worried I would not have a future, I tried to live without one. I sowed myself into the moment with its needles and white blood cell counts, diaper changes and grocery pickups. But even as I resolved to keep myself in the present, the future kept interrupting. I was scrambling to find my son, Zach, a larger onesie or discovering that Christmas had now become the season of \u201cPlease don\u2019t pull that off the tree.\u201d I finished the book I never thought I would see published, and I drove my 70-year-old father to a re-creation of Noah\u2019s ark in Kentucky simply to amuse him. The heavens wheeled and the seasons turned as we were pulled beyond the everlasting moment.The Stoics considered time to be cyclical, an eternal recurrence of motion from fire through the creation of elements back to fire again; the Enlightenment saw time as the arena of progress, a moral motion toward improvement and perfectibility. Much of Christian theology rests on the image of God as the ultimate reality beyond time and space, the creator of a past, present and future where all exists simultaneously in the Divine Mind. But where does that leave the bewildered believer who cannot see the future and whose lantern casts light only backward, onto the path she has already taken?The terrible gift of a terrible illness is that it has in fact taught me to live in the moment.

He is at best a kind of amusing buffoon; at worst, an annoyance.It seems to me this is one helpful way to think about a case like Mr. Manafort\u2019s. The notorious $15,000 ostrich jacket, the desperate living beyond his means, the ostentatiousness \u2014 these all very predictably go with the pretense of the boaster. Why would Mr. Manafort lie, even to Robert Mueller, the special prosecutor? At least one reason would be that he\u2019s showing off.There is something of the flatterer, too, in Mr. Manafort. The flatterer does to another what the boaster does to himself. With his lies, he tries to convince the one he flatters that the flattered is better than he is in reality. The flatterer affects this simulation, of course, because he seeks to gain some advantage for himself by pleasing the flattered. For this reason I suspect that Mr. Mueller and his team have heard as much praise from Paul Manafort as Donald Trump must have, back when they were still palling around.Even if Mr. Manafort is consciously, deliberately lying, he\u2019s foolish to do it and he\u2019s doing a bad job of it. Of course, he may well have a Machiavellian rationale in his head. \u201cThose best at playing the fox have done better than the others,\u201d Machiavelli wrote, speaking of the powerful. \u201cBut you have to know how to disguise your slyness, how to pretend one thing and cover up another.\u201dThere are many more such arguments in defense of the necessity of lying for people who want to control the rest of us, and indeed this view agrees with what most of us believe about politicians in particular and power player types in general. Even Machiavelli, however, insisted that one must avoid lying too much, because people will stop believing you, and your lies will no longer work.Before we get carried away feeling superior to Mr. Manafort, we should admit we are all experts in deception. Politeness and other forms of social expediency prevent us from telling the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth every day. Evolutionary psychologists teach us that lies, self-deception and hypocrisy are essential to ordinary psychological well-being and the survival of the human species. We bluff our way through a lot of life. So we might do well to think of Mr. Manafort as a kind of outlier or cautionary tale, an extreme example of a weakness we all share, rather than as a case of exceptional vice in the midst of our more ordinary virtue.Although many of us would like to think of Mr. Manafort as a scheming, calculating, coldblooded Prince of Lies, it\u2019s probably the case that he has told so many different stories over the course of a long career as a liar that at this point he longer quite knows what the truth is. As Nietzsche taught us, we tend to deceive ourselves about when, how and why we lie, and even about the act of lying itself. Why? At least in part because lies are more effective when we don\u2019t know that we are lying. \u201cThere must be self-deception in order to produce a great effect,\u201d Nietzsche wrote. If this is true, unfortunately for Mr. Manafort \u2014 and, one worries, for our president \u2014 one can become so confused about the distinction between truth and falsity that one can no longer really tell the difference.We might actually prefer that Mr. Manafort be a straightforward liar, because the unmindful liar is more dangerous, both to himself and to others. As Mr. Dryden admonishes T.E. Lawrence in \u201cLawrence of Arabia\u201d: \u201cIf we\u2019ve been telling lies, you\u2019ve been telling half-lies. A man who tells lies, like me, merely hides the truth. But a man who tells half-lies has forgotten where he put it.\u201dI think, in short, that we can learn from the pitiable case of Paul Manafort. The truth requires courage rather than cowardice. For us ordinary human beings, the right thing to do is most often the difficult thing to do, and this is especially so when it comes to knowing and speaking the truth. It\u2019s almost always easier, lazier, more convenient to boast, to flatter, to lie, to fail to interrogate yourself about why you believe what you do. But we\u2019ve seen where these habits led Mr. Manafort, over the course of his life, and none of us want to join him there.And what about Mr. Manafort? Like most liars, he\u2019s probably feeling lonely, with only his secrets to comfort him. But if I\u2019m right, and he no longer really knows the difference between truth and lie, he\u2019s lost even his secrets.Clancy Martin is a professor of philosophy at the University of Missouri-Kansas City and the author of \u201cLove and Lies: An Essay on Truthfulness, Deceit, and the Growth and Care of Erotic Love.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Prigozhin, who is a close ally of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.

{"Headline": "Stocks Bounce Back From Edge of Bear Market", "Date": "2018-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThroughout Wall Street\u2019s December meltdown, analysts have been saying that markets were plunging despite plenty of evidence that the United States economy remains strong and corporate profit growth is healthy.A substantial rise in crude oil prices added to the lighter mood, as did efforts from the White House to ease up on criticism of the Federal Reserve.The rally continued in Asia, led by Japan, where stocks on Thursday opened 3.7 percent higher.The rebound in the United States offered investors a much-needed reprieve from a decline that had picked up speed in December. Stocks had fallen for four consecutive days through Monday, and the drop had pushed the S&P 500 to within just a few points of a bear market \u2014 defined as a 20 percent retreat from its high.Still, the S&P 500 is on pace for its worst annual performance since the financial crisis a decade ago and is only back to where it stood on Dec. 20. Plus, the move in prices Wednesday was most likely heightened by lighter-than-average trading volume during a holiday week.But to some traders, the move upward finally made sense.\u201cFundamentally you\u2019ve got good growth here in the States, you have reasonable growth overseas, you\u2019re going to have record earnings in 2019 and possibly in 2020 as well, you\u2019ve got low inflation,\u201d said Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute. Before Wednesday\u2019s steep rise, the market had fallen too far, Mr. Wren said, and it was ready to climb thanks to the underlying strength of the American economy.The rally was broad-based. Only one stock in the S&P 500, Newmont Mining, fell.Oil prices, too, were on the move after Russia\u2019s energy minister, Alexander Novak, told a Russian newspaper that the country would benefit from continuing to cooperate with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries on regulating production. American crude, the benchmark for oil prices, rose almost 9 percent to over $46 a barrel, and shares of large energy producers also climbed.After leading Wall Street\u2019s recent slide, technology stocks rebounded as well. Tech investors have had plenty of causes for concern. A slowing global economy could hurt sales, tensions are rising with China on manufacturing of devices, and privacy concerns are bringing the potential for regulation. Apple shares rose 7 percent, while stock in the semiconductor maker Advanced Micro Devices gained 7.5 percent and Facebook added more than 8 percent.Bank stocks, which have taken the brunt of recent selling as worries grew that the United States economy was weakening, rose significantly.The rally doesn\u2019t mean that this year\u2019s precipitous decline in stock prices is over. Signs of economic health that encouraged the buying are doing little to address one of stock investors\u2019 primary concerns. They\u2019re worried that the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to continue raising interest rates, even if at a slightly slower pace, will hurt the economy and corporate profits. Higher interest rates on bonds or even savings accounts make stock investments less appealing as an alternative.The Fed announced an interest-rate increase last week and said it would continue to withdraw the support it had offered the economy in the wake of the financial crisis.\u201cThe Fed is making a monumental mistake,\u201d said Barry Bannister, the head of institutional equity strategy at the broker Stifel. \u201cThey do not realize how long and by how much they\u2019ve tightened already, and until they back off the market\u2019s going to have a very weak floor under it.\u201dAdding to volatility has been the possibility that President Trump would consider firing the central bank\u2019s chairman, Jerome H. Powell, because he disagreed with Fed policy. Mr. Trump, who previously sought to hitch his political success to a rising stock market, has blamed interest-rate increases for the downturn on Wall Street.White House officials insisted again that the president had no plans to fire Mr. Powell, news that reassured investors.Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, told reporters Wednesday morning that Mr. Powell\u2019s job was \u201c100 percent\u201d safe. He echoed remarks by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Trump\u2019s incoming chief of staff, both of whom spent the weekend trying to persuade investors that the president did not plan to fire Mr. Powell. Those efforts had mostly backfired, in part because Mr. Trump continued to criticize his handpicked Fed chairman.It also helped matters on Wednesday that Mr. Trump refrained from offering new criticism of the Fed, a marked difference from the days leading up to the Christmas holiday, when he railed against the central bank on Twitter and vowed to keep the government shut down for an extended period. In fact, for the first trading session in many days, Mr. Trump posted just one tweet: It was about his trip to Iraq.Matthew Goldstein and Alexandra Stevenson contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hard-Money Men, Suddenly Going Soft", "Date": "2018-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrumpism trumps everything, even Ayn Rand.Opinion ColumnistI have a confession to make: I have been insufficiently cynical about modern conservative economics.But while I yield to nobody in my appreciation of the right\u2019s fiscal fraudulence, I took its monetary hawkishness seriously. I thought that all those dire warnings about the inflationary consequences of the Federal Reserve\u2019s efforts to fight high unemployment, the constant harping on the evils of printing money, were grounded in genuine \u2014 stupid, but genuine \u2014 concern.Silly me.It\u2019s no surprise that Individual-1, who lambasted the Fed for keeping interest rates low while Barack Obama was president, is demanding that it keep rates low now that he\u2019s in the White House. After all, nobody has ever accused Donald Trump of having consistent, principled views about monetary policy (or anything else).Now, you might say that the explanation for the right\u2019s about-face on monetary policy is the same as the explanation of its about-face on deficits. That is, Republicans want pain and suffering when there\u2019s a Democratic president, but a nonstop party when one of their own sits in the White House. And that is indeed how it looks now. But I used to think there was something more to the story.You see, as a pundit who, well, gets a lot of hate mail, I\u2019ve learned that the issue of whether it sometimes makes sense to print money stirs more visceral emotions on the right than anything else. Declare that Trump is a corrupt Russian puppet, and you get a fair bit of blowback, but nothing like what you get if you say that returning to the gold standard would be a bad idea, or that monetary easing isn\u2019t necessarily inflationary. A lot of people on the right just go crazy at any suggestion that money is something to be managed, not treated as a sacred trust with which mortals must not meddle.The only thing I know that brings comparable blowback is criticism of Bitcoin, a topic that combines some of the same libertarian derp with a hefty infusion of technobabble.Furthermore, the view that printing money is always a terrible thing seemed extremely durable, despite an uninterrupted track record of predictive failure. People who warned about looming inflation in 2009 continued to warn about it year after year, even as it kept not happening.There is, by the way, a reasonable case (which I accept) that the Fed should, indeed, pause its campaign of raising rates, and even that this week\u2019s hike was a mistake. But this case should be made on the basis of fundamental economic principles, not in pursuit of short-term political advantage, and least of all because it\u2019s what Donald Trump wants.Yet that\u2019s how it\u2019s going. These days the G.O.P. is all about power; there are no principles it will adhere to if they involve any political cost. And it\u2019s a party that belongs to Trump: What he says is the party line, on any and every issue.Trumpism, it turns out, trumps everything else \u2014 even Ayn Rand.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Glee in Russia Over Trump\u2019s Foreign Policy Largess", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 A note of glee crept into Russian commentary and news coverage on Friday about the current turmoil in Washington around national security, with President Vladimir V. Putin seemingly checking off one item after another that he might have written on his wish list for Santa.First, President Trump blindsided his aides and the rest of the world by deciding to pull the full contingent of some 2,000 American troops out of Syria, helping the Kremlin to confirm Mr. Putin\u2019s gamble that intervening in Syria would revive Russian influence in the Middle East.All that followed Mr. Trump\u2019s already substantial effort to undermine NATO and the European Union by weakening the American commitment to its traditional alliances.\u201cTrump is God\u2019s gift that keeps on giving,\u201d said Vladimir Frolov, a Russian columnist and foreign affairs analyst. \u201cTrump implements Russia\u2019s negative agenda by default, undermining the U.S.\u2013led world order, U.S. alliances, U.S. credibility as a partner and an ally. All of this on his own. Russia can just relax and watch and root for Trump, which Putin does at every TV appearance.\u201dOne headline in a regional Russian newspaper trumpeted, \u201cTrump Leaves the Dog Out in the Cold,\u201d referring to Mr. Mattis\u2019s nickname, Mad Dog, from his days in the Marines. Konstantin Kosachev, the leader of the international affairs committee in the upper house of Russia\u2019s Parliament, wrote on Facebook that the differences in Washington were \u201can interesting signal, and moreover, rather a positive one.\u201dIf the perception in some quarters in the United States and on Twitter is that the Kremlin was blackmailing Mr. Trump into doing its bidding, that theory did not gain immediate traction in Russia. Instead, analysts and news articles were more likely to suggest that Mr. Trump was fulfilling his campaign pledges.\u201cI am not of the idea that he is being blackmailed,\u201d said Nina L. Khrushcheva, a professor of international affairs at the New School in New York, currently in Moscow. \u201cUndermining NATO and undermining Europe is something that Putin would like to do, but Trump is doing it for different reasons.\u201dStill, even if convinced that Mr. Trump is not being blackmailed, analysts are still puzzled over why his actions so closely coincided with Russia\u2019s foreign policy goals.\u201cOnce again we see a president who appears to be acting impulsively and erratically \u2014 except when it comes to Russia,\u201d said Leslie Vinjamuri, professor of international relations at SOAS University of London. \u201cHere, Trump has been eerily consistent in his willingness to adopt policies that enable Russia\u2019s strategy while undermining ours.\u201dNevertheless, not everything is flowing in Moscow\u2019s favor.\u201cTrump\u2019s announcement that they are leaving Syria is a gift, of course,\u201d said Valery D. Solovei, a political-science professor at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations. The Kremlin may use its success in Syria to forge on into Libya for similar reasons, he said.Afghanistan was more complicated, however.\u201cOn the one hand, the Russians are gleeful about the American withdrawal; there is this \u2018We told you so\u2019 feeling,\u201d he said, referring to the Soviet Union\u2019s disastrous invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. But \u201cthe Kremlin has always feared that destabilization in Afghanistan could increase the flow of drugs and extremists to Russia.\u201dIn Syria, the American presence had proved to be a convenient excuse for Mr. Putin about why the Russian intervention was not bringing the conflict to as rapid a close as he had promised. In addition, fighting the remnants of the Islamic State will now become Russia\u2019s problem, with any upsurge in violence likely to undermine the Kremlin position that Syria is stable enough for a postwar political process and reconstruction funds.On the sanctions front, although the United States lifted penalties on Rusal, that came at the cost of diminishing Mr. Deripaska\u2019s role with the company. And Mr. Deripaska himself remains under sanctions for his business practices.In addition, the Russian argument all along has been that sanctions had nothing to do with its actions, like invading Georgia and Ukraine and annexing Crimea, but were a way for the West to keep Russia down. So negotiating to escape them undermined that argument.The Russian government also continued to harbor reservations that what Mr. Trump says and what he does are not always the same thing \u2014 and are subject to reversal at the drop of a tweet. So senior Russian officials reacted cautiously to the withdrawal announcements, starting with Syria.\u201cWe need to figure out how, when, to where and in which manner the Americans are leaving,\u201d Dmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin\u2019s spokesman, told reporters on Friday. \u201cAt this point, this is not clear.\u201dMr. Putin, at a news conference on Thursday, again praised Mr. Trump, suggesting that the change to a Democratic majority in the House would further undermine the American president\u2019s attempts to improve relations with Russia.Despite such praise, however, the Trump administration has taken positions \u2014 on issues like withdrawing from arms-control treaties and especially on Ukraine \u2014 that the Kremlin dislikes. Washington has not acquiesced to Russia\u2019s efforts to exert control over Ukraine, with Moscow\u2019s attempts to maintain influence throughout the former Soviet Union one of its main foreign policy goals.Moscow conveniently accuses Washington of being the source of its tensions with Kiev, including the naval clash in the Kerch Strait late last month and the moves by the Orthodox Church in Ukraine to establish its independence from Moscow.Over all, there is also concern that Mr. Trump is a little too erratic. For now, his decisions are tilting in Mr. Putin\u2019s favor, but there is also concern that they also could move in the other direction with equal speed.\u201cToo unstable a world is something that Putin does not really want,\u201d said Ms. Khrushcheva, pointing out that Russia did not have the same financial or other resources as the United States to address problems all over the globe. \u201cIf there is way too much chaos, Russia would have to act in too many directions.\u201dFor the moment, however, Moscow is on board for some instability. Mr. Trump\u2019s curbs on the United States\u2019 international role and focus on domestic matters give room for countries like China and Russia to expand their influence, analysts said.\u201cWe can tolerate some degree of unpredictability and mercurial policies on the tactical level \u2014 it\u2019s worth it,\u201d Mr. Frolov, the Russian foreign affairs analyst, wrote in response to written questions. \u201cIn Trump we trust \u2026 to do the right thing.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a professor of international relations at SOAS University of London.

{"Headline": "How to Be More Resilient", "Date": "2018-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome people are just genetically tougher. But you can train your brain to better handle stress. Dr. Friedman is a psychiatrist and a contributing opinion writer. As a psychiatrist, I\u2019ve long wondered why some people get ill in the face of stress and adversity \u2014 either mentally or physically \u2014 while others rarely succumb.What Dr. Miller and his colleagues discovered was that when neighborhood homicide rates went up, the young people\u2019s cardiometabolic risk \u2014 as measured by obesity, blood-pressure and insulin levels, among other variables \u2014 also increased, but only in youths who showed lower activity in this brain network. This was true even when the researchers controlled for other factors, like psychological distress, economic status, race or ethnicity. No link was found between brain connectivity and cardiometabolic health for youths in neighborhoods with low levels of violence. One plausible explanation is that greater activity in this network increases self-control, which most likely reduces some unhealthy behaviors people often use to cope with stress, like eating junk food or smoking.What\u2019s curious is that the more medically hardy young people were no less anxious or depressed than their less fortunate peers, which suggests that while being more resilient makes you less vulnerable to adversity, it doesn\u2019t guarantee happiness \u2014 or even an awareness of being resilient.Of course, this is an observational study, so it cannot prove that the correlation between brain connectivity and health is causal. (It is possible, for example, that baseline cardiometabolic status affected brain connectivity, but it would be hard to understand why this would be observed only in high-violence areas.)Clearly self-control is one critical component of resilience that can be easily fostered. But there are others.Huda Akil, a neuroscientist at the University of Michigan who studies the biology of stress and resilience, said in a recent speech: \u201cActive resilience happens when people who are vulnerable find resources to cope with stress and bounce back, and do so in a way that leaves them stronger, ready to handle additional stress, in more adaptive ways.\u201d\u201cWe came to realize that depressed people have lost their power to remodel their brains. And that is in fact devastating because brain remodeling is something we need to do all the time \u2014 we are constantly rewiring our brains based on past experience and the expectation of how we need to use them in the future,\u201d Dr. Akil said.Once again, it seems resilience is related to brain connectivity. There is much still to learn about the science of resilience. Perhaps someday we might be able to protect young people exposed to violence and adversity by supplementing them with neuroprotective growth factors. We know enough now to help them by fortifying their brains through exercise, mindfulness training and support systems. And of course we should do all we can to makes these stressful environments less harmful. Some people have won the genetic sweepstakes and are naturally tough. But there is plenty the rest of us can do to be more resilient and healthier.Advertisement"}

Many people \u201ccan\u2019t be bothered to open and drain the cans, or fetch utensils and dishes to eat the tuna,\u201d The Journal reported.But the rationale that cut hardest, it seems, was a quotation from a vice president for marketing and innovation for StarKist, one of the big three tuna purveyors.\u201cA lot of millennials don\u2019t even own can openers,\u201d he said.This explanation did not smell right to many on Twitter.Some cried ageism.So who or what is really to blame for the decline in this canned classic, which has been a staple inside American lunchboxes and cupboards since the early 1900s?Tuna disappeared from lunch menus, movies and comic strips after schoolchildren and others staged letter-writing campaigns.Joseph R. Biden Jr., then a senator from Delaware, introduced a bill requiring tuna labels to show whether dolphins were killed after his 8-year-old daughter badgered him about the slaughter.More recently, the decline in interest among consumers aged 18 to 34 can be attributed to a preference for frozen or fresh fish, according to a report by Mintel, a market-research firm cited in the Journal article.That explanation did not hold water for some, either:Established tuna brands like Bumble Bee, StarKist and Chicken of the Sea, which control most of the market, are facing increased competition from smaller brands that are offering twice-cooked tuna and tuna caught with more sustainable practices, The Journal said.In order to cater to utensil-challenged consumers, Big Tuna brands are introducing new types of packaging, like easy-open pouches, kits that include crackers and a fork, as well as resealable packages designed to fit into car cupholders.StarKist is hoping to lure in consumers with spicy flavors like hot buffalo and sriracha. It barely tastes like fish anymore.You may even see tuna in the impulse-buy aisle near the checkout.While consumers may be rebelling against the edibility of tuna, cost may also be a factor.\u201cThe conspiracy to fix prices on these household staples had direct effects on the pocketbooks of American consumers,\u201d said a lawyer from the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division.Are millennials really to blame for Big Tuna\u2019s woes?An informal survey conducted by editors and writers at New York Magazine\u2019s \u201cThe Cut\u201d on Monday revealed a more complex answer.\u201cWhat does owning a can opener have to do with it?\u201d asked one user, McHale Ann. \u201cMost of us still live with mom and dad and they still have can openers.\u201dAnother user, Olivia Curran Webster, concurred that tools were irrelevant: \u201cIt\u2019s because we\u2019re all vegan micro farmers who forage for mushrooms in the wilderness on Sundays.\u201dFor a third user, Andrew Barker, the reason was earnest. \u201cI own three can openers. I was born in 81. I am by definition a Xennial or Millennial. I don\u2019t buy tuna because it\u2019s ruining the oceans and because its too bloody expensive on the wages I earn at my job.\u201dThe seas may part for tuna lovers squabbling over oil- or water-packed products. But for others, tuna is a nonstarter. Slate\u2019s chief political correspondent, Jamelle Bouie, a millennial, summarized his feelings.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Decorate a Sugar Cookie Like a Pro ", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwelve steps to a better decorated sugar cookie, including flooding techniques and the fluffiest royal icing recipe.Don\u2019t buy a lot of equipment right away. Too many cookie cutters and pastry bags can be overwhelming. One set of holiday cutters supplemented by a heart, a star and a circle cutter or two will do. For piping icing, fill a zipper-top bag or a thin, disposable decorating bag with icing, and cut a very small piece off a corner to make the tip.Use a good cookie recipe, and make sure the butter is dentable but not completely soft. Cream the butter with the sugar just long enough to incorporate the two. Always bake cookies on a silicone mat or parchment.Practice piping straight lines and curves and corners on a piece of paper before you outline your first cookie. Have a design in mind before you begin.Start with the tip of the decorating bag on a straight edge of the cookie. (Beginning at a corner or an angle will make it harder to achieve good line.) Squeeze the bag very gently and then pull the tip up about an inch, imagining that you are laying a piece of yarn around the cookie.When you get to a corner or an angle, drop the tip back down to the surface of the cookie to make the turn, then bring it back up again about an inch to continue piping.Once the cookie is outlined, squeeze the bag with a little more pressure to begin flooding the cookie. The idea is push pillows of icing out in front of the tip. Fill the cookie without stopping.

{"Headline": "Facebook Says Bug Opened Access to Private Photos", "Date": "2018-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Facebook announced on Friday that it had discovered a bug that allowed outsiders access to private photos, potentially affecting some 6.8 million people who use the service.This most recent incident is somewhat less severe than previous ones. Around 1,500 third-party apps had access to users\u2019 uploaded photos \u2014 even if they had not posted them publicly to Facebook \u2014 from Sept. 13 to Sept. 25.Facebook said the number of people affected was probably smaller than 6.8 million, because it doubted that all 1,500 apps gained access to the social network during those 12 days. The company said it was contacting the 876 developers who had built the apps and asking them to check and delete any photos they may have retrieved improperly.\u201cWe\u2019re sorry this happened,\u201d Mr. Bar added.But the bug reported on Friday prompted more scrutiny in the United States and Europe of whether it was following through on those promises.The announcement is likely to raise questions among federal regulators about whether Facebook violated a consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission in 2011. Under the agreement, Facebook is prohibited from misrepresenting its privacy and security practices. It also requires the company to obtain users\u2019 consent before overriding their privacy choices, and to institute a comprehensive program to protect the privacy and security of users\u2019 data.David C. Vladeck, a former director of the commission\u2019s bureau of consumer protection, said it was possible that Facebook\u2019s failure to anticipate and address the latest data privacy problem violated the agreement. Mr. Vladeck oversaw the investigation that led to the consent decree.\u201cIf Facebook can\u2019t control access by third-party apps, they are going to be in constant trouble with the Federal Trade Commission \u2014 and the public at some point is just going to revolt,\u201d Mr. Vladeck said. \u201cThis is just not acceptable.\u201dBut Chris Hoofnagle, an adjunct professor of law who is the faculty director of the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology at the University of California, Berkeley, said it wasn\u2019t clear the incident violated the consent decree.\u201cWe don\u2019t know yet whether this security hole was a product of negligence or an accident that could happen even if you have good security,\u201d Professor Hoofnagle said.The Federal Trade Commission declined to comment.European regulators have signaled a strong displeasure with Facebook\u2019s privacy policies. The company\u2019s main data-protection regulator in the European Union, the Irish Data Protection Commission, said on Friday that the mounting number of problems required a deeper investigation. Ireland is Facebook\u2019s lead privacy watchdog in the European Union because the company\u2019s European headquarters are in Dublin.The company found the bug on Sept. 25, the same day Facebook discovered a data breach that affected 30 million users. But executives did not notify government officials in Europe until November.The Irish Data Protection Commission said it started an inquiry this week after receiving \u201ca number of breach notifications from Facebook\u201d over the past six months. The investigation could lead to a fine of up to 4 percent of Facebook\u2019s global revenue, or about $1.63 billion. The regulator can also require Facebook to change how it processes data in the region.\u201cWe have this week commenced a statutory inquiry examining Facebook\u2019s compliance with the relevant provision of the G.D.P.R.,\u201d the Irish Data Protection Commission said in a statement.The regulator started another investigation after Facebook disclosed the data breach in September.Mike Isaac reported from San Francisco, and Natasha Singer from New York.

{"Headline": "Honduran Migrant Seen Fleeing Tear Gas With Her Toddlers Is Now in U.S.", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe woman, Maria Meza, was allowed in to the border crossing at Otay Mesa, Calif., with her five children late Monday after several hours of waiting with lawyers and two members of Congress who had personally escorted them to the entry station.Eight other unaccompanied children and a man were also part of the group.If authorities at the border allow her case to proceed, Ms. Meza could either be sent to a detention center or released on bond with an ankle monitor.\u201cIt could be a yearslong process, that\u2019s what it\u2019s most likely to be,\u201d said Kara Lynum, an immigration lawyer volunteering with Al Otro Lado, a Mexico-based group that has been assisting migrants there. \u201cShe has an attorney waiting for her, but it\u2019s hard to say what happens next because our asylum grant rates are inconsistent.\u201dMs. Meza had traveled to the border with the migrant caravan and was captured on camera last month, when a group of migrants tried to force their way into the United States at Tijuana, south of San Diego. Officials with Customs and Border Protection said that the officers fired tear gas on hundreds of migrants because the migrants were mounting an assault.The image by Kim Kyung-Hoon, a Reuters photojournalist, showed Ms. Meza, wearing a shirt with characters from Disney\u2019s \u201cFrozen\u201d on it, fearfully clutching her children, both of them in diapers and one of them barefoot. It provoked a huge response, with many, including a number of Democratic lawmakers, criticizing the use of tear gas. Opponents of the Trump administration\u2019s hard-line policies on immigration said Ms. Meza\u2019s case countered the administration\u2019s claim that the caravan of migrants, most fleeing violence and deep poverty in their homelands, was a threat to Americans.Lawyers working with Al Otro Lado said that after the photograph spread across social media, Ms. Meza became a target of Paloma Zuniga, a right-wing media personality known as \u201cPaloma for Trump,\u201d as her Facebook page is called. Commenters on Ms. Zuniga\u2019s page said taking care of the family should be the responsibility of the children\u2019s father, and suggested she would be unable to both work and care for her children.Ms. Zuniga tried to visit Ms. Meza in the shelter where she had been staying in Tijuana and posted several images of her, prompting Ms. Meza to move to another location, said Anna Joseph, another lawyer who accompanied Ms. Meza on Monday. Even there, she said, Ms. Meza received multiple calls and texts to her mobile phone.While most migrants are now waiting weeks for processing at the United States border, which officials say has limited capacity, Ms. Joseph said the attention had made it impossible for Ms. Meza to continue waiting.\u201cIt made it unsafe for her and she could not wait out this metering system of asylum,\u201d she said.Border officials initially told the group Monday that the facility was too full to process any additional claims and suggested they turn back. Two members of Congress from California had traveled with the group and demanded evidence.\u201cThey are asking for the right to be taken into detention, they\u2019re asking to get arrested, they are begging for it and they still haven\u2019t been able to do it,\u201d said Sarah Owings, another lawyer who has worked with the migrants. Lawyers said they were unlikely to know more about Ms. Meza\u2019s case until later this week.The group seeking stepped-up processing first arrived at the Otay Mesa port just before 3 p.m., when officials told them that the facility was at capacity and could not process their claims. After several hours and pressure from the members of Congress, the unaccompanied children were allowed to proceed. It was nearly 10 p.m. when border officials came out with white plastic handcuffs and called for the Meza family to enter, lawyers said. The family gave brief goodbyes and were led into the processing center.The immigrant advocates and lawyers then spent the night with another family from Honduras, which had shown up separately to request asylum. Ms. Lynum said a Border Patrol agent instructed that family to join the first group.Around 8 a.m. Tuesday, the rest of the group was admitted for processing.An earlier version of this article misattributed a quote on the requests of migrants at the border. It was Sarah Owings, another lawyer, speaking, not Kara Lynum.Advertisement"}

As a tacit compromise, we are bringing up our daughter with such godlessness that when visiting my in-laws\u2019 home, she mistook the crosses hanging in each room for light switches. Nonetheless, come December, there is but one figure who reigns supreme among her set: he of the ho ho hos.I know it sounds Grinchian, but the Santa thing irritated me immediately. In theological terms, there is little love lost between me and Judaism. But culturally \u2014 with my unwavering devotion to Stern on the radio, Roth on the page, Dylan on the stereo and kugel in the oven \u2014 I am a Hasid. So, when we were about to make our holiday debut as parents, I informed my wife that we would be celebrating the season not only with Santa Claus but also with Hanukkah Harry.\u201cHe\u2019s the Jewish version of Santa,\u201d I explained, a touch of sanctimony creeping into my voice.My wife, who grew up in Italy, seemed skeptical. \u201cDid you learn about Harry at Hebrew school?\u201d she asked.\u201cI don\u2019t recall,\u201d I said, truthfully. \u201cIt was a Reform temple, so they mostly just talked about the Holocaust. But I definitely remember him from when I was a kid. At some point, there was even a \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 skit parodying the Harry phenomenon.\u201dAccordingly, without so much as a single internet search, Hanukkah Harry entered our household\u2019s holiday rite. During her first few Decembers, my daughter learned that while some presents came from Santa, other gifts \u2014 invariably the better ones \u2014 were from her beloved Harry. Naturally, she quickly grew to cherish both mythical figures, awaiting their bounty every season. Last year, I swelled with pride upon hearing her explain to a pre-K classmate that while a sock puppet was bequeathed to her by Santa Claus, the huge dollhouse came courtesy of Hanukkah Harry. Her playmate seemed impressed, if perplexed.That night, my daughter inquired about Harry: Why was Santa so prevalent yet Harry so scarce? Why didn\u2019t her friends \u2014 even those who celebrated Hanukkah \u2014 recognize him? Could she see pictures of Harry?The sketch was hilarious \u2014 funnier than what I had hazily remembered. As it begins, we meet a bedridden Santa (Phil Hartman), chagrined that a stomach virus is preventing him from carrying out his holiday duties. In desperation, he calls on the one other figure with unlimited powers of gift distribution: Hanukkah Harry, embodied by the incomparable Jon Lovitz. As Harry fills in for his gentile counterpart, we follow him to the Christmas tree of two surprised children, played by Victoria Jackson and Mike Myers, whose hint of a mullet betrays the late \u201980s air date.Mr. Lovitz portrays Harry as a menschy Yiddish grotesque, garbed in Borough Park finery and commanding a trio of airborne donkeys with names from the old country. As with much great ethnic humor, the heartiest laughs are drawn from observations finely tuned and oddly gentle. Harry spots a glass of milk awaiting Santa and becomes alarmed that it will spoil. He brings a coffee ring to Santa\u2019s sickbed and repeatedly sings the praises of cottage cheese as a remedy. Informed by Santa that a boy has landed on the naughty list for speaking out of turn, Harry wails: \u201cWhat, is that a crime? He\u2019s a kid. Kids talk! I\u2019ll bring him a little something.\u201d I could not pinpoint whether this parodied a known stereotype. It simply reminded me of my Aunt Belle, so I laughed.My daughter laughed, too. Prime Jon Lovitz \u2014 his jowly face a Gary Shteyngart protagonist, his voice a pocket protector come to life \u2014 tends to draw that response, particularly among the unjaded. We still, however, needed to explore the roots of Hanukkah Harry, so I veered away from the video to continue our internet search.\u201cHanukkah Harry is a fictional character on \u2018Saturday Night Live,\u2019\u201d Wikipedia\u2019s entry read. \u201cTypically sloppy,\u201d I scoffed.\u201cHanukkah Harry made his \u2018S.N.L.\u2019 debut \u2026\u201d the AV Club wrote. \u201cThat\u2019s weird,\u201d I muttered.In my haste to enrich my daughter\u2019s cultural life, I had entered that sad realm of imbeciles who confuse satire for fact. What other horrible parenting did I have up my sleeve? Might I teach my daughter about the scriptures through Church Chat? Perhaps the wonders of ancient Egypt via King Tut, Funky Tut?Yet my daughter was thrilled. Repeat viewings of the sketch were requested; a Lovitz doll was called for. The character\u2019s provenance was not her concern. Hanukkah Harry existed \u2014 and he was funny.And so, this Hanukkah, I intend to fry latkes using my mother\u2019s recipe (carrots are the key). I will present my daughter with her nightly loot. And as my fellow Jews the world over light menorahs, the eternal flames twisting through centuries to connect them to their woebegone forebears, my family will gather to pay our respects to Hanukkah Harry, the Not Ready for Prime Time Player who delivers toys to Jewish girls and Jewish boys.Jay Ruttenberg is the editor of the comedy journal The Lowbrow Reader.Advertisement"}

On Instagram, Mr. Perry said the offer would apply to items placed on layaway before 9:30 a.m. Thursday. \u201cI was trying to do this anonymously but oh well!!!\u201d he wrote.Zena Williams, manager of Walmart on Tchoupitoulas Street in New Orleans, where Ms. Benson paid off debts, said one customer was so moved that \u201cshe thanked Jesus right there, giving praise at the cash register.\u201d Others walked away in shock. \u201cWe have so many customers on a fixed income,\u201d Ms. Williams said. \u201cLayaways are key.\u201dMrs. Benson declined through a spokesman to be interviewed. Hers, along with Mr. Perry\u2019s, is one of a number of charitable gifts earmarked for layaway purchases at Walmart in recent weeks.Ms. Gates told WCAX-TV, the local CBS affiliate, that she was picking up a package when she overheard the man asking if he could pay for another person\u2019s items. He turned to her and offered the same. When she asked him who could afford to do this, she said he replied, \u201cSanta Claus can.\u201dMs. Jenkins said the company has not seen an unusual surge in such donations this year, but social media has afforded gift-giving more prominence. \u201cUsually donors like to remain anonymous,\u201d she said.Layaway programs started during the Great Depression in the 1930s, when some families didn\u2019t have enough money to pay for needed items. They fell out of favor in the 1980s, with the rise of easy credit, and became popular again in the 2010s when Americans suffered job losses and saw their home values plummet after the recession. Unlike credit cards, most layaway plans don\u2019t charge interest on purchases.Mrs. Benson, 71, became the sole owner of the New Orleans Saints after her husband, Tom, died in March. Mr. Benson, who owned car dealerships and invested in banks, bought the Saints in 1985.Ms. Williams said she got a call on Nov. 29 saying that Mrs. Benson wanted to cover the cost of customers\u2019 layaway accounts. On Tuesday a check was delivered and shoppers were informed that their debts were forgiven.\u201cMost people called to see if it was real,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "There\u2019s a Wave of New Prosecutors. And They Mean Justice.", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThese district attorneys should make jail the exception and eliminate cash bail.Ms. Bazelon is a staff writer at The New York Times Magazine. Ms. Krinsky is the executive director of Fair and Just Prosecution.In the past two years, a wave of prosecutors promising less incarceration and more fairness have been elected across the country. Republicans and Democrats are among the reformers, and they\u2019re taking over district attorney offices in red and blue states. Five progressive D.A.s have been elected in major cities in Texas, of all surprising places, most recently in Dallas and San Antonio. In Houston, Kim Ogg was elected D.A. two years ago, and in the face of opposition from more than a dozen local judges, she has supported a lawsuit challenging the cash bail system for misdemeanor cases.Local prosecutors, who handle 95 percent of the criminal cases brought in this country, are well positioned to take reform into their own hands because of their broad discretion over whether and how to prosecute cases and what bail they decide to seek against defendants. And they\u2019re exercising that discretion in new ways.Our recommendations begin with the premise that the level of punishment in the United States is neither necessary for public safety nor a pragmatic use of resources. Prosecutors can address this first by routing some low-level offenses out of the criminal justice system at the start. For the cases that remain, they can help make incarceration the exception and diverting people from prison the rule, a principle advanced by the district attorney in Brooklyn, N.Y., Eric Gonzalez. Finally, prosecutors should recognize that lengthy mandatory sentences can be wasteful, since most people age out of the period when they\u2019re likely to reoffend, and also don\u2019t allow for the human capacity to change.As prosecutors know, locking people up makes them more prone to committing offenses in the future. They can lose their earning capacity and housing, leaving them worse off, often to the point of desperation. And so the community is often better served by interventions like drug or mental-health treatment, or by restorative justice approaches, in which a person who has caused harm makes amends to the victim. In some cases, the best response is to do nothing.To keep people out of jail who don\u2019t need to be there, prosecutors have to rethink whether and how they charge defendants in criminal cases. Too often, they bring the maximum charges or stack charges to gain leverage: The bigger the threatened sentence, the more reason defendants have to plead guilty rather than risk everything at trial. A fair process begins with screening cases rigorously as early as possible, so cases supported by only weak evidence can be declined or dismissed. When charges are brought, they should reflect the facts and circumstances of each case, so that they\u2019re designed to achieve a just result, not the heaviest possible penalty.Prosecutors should work to end the devastating impact the justice system has on people because they\u2019re poor, by pushing for the elimination of cash bail and fines and fees that people cannot reasonably afford to pay. D.A.s should also push to shrink the number of people \u2014 currently about five million \u2014 who are under some form of probation or parole. Excessive supervision increases the likelihood that people who are otherwise at low risk of reoffending will end up incarcerated for technical violations like breaking curfew. Some states have shortened supervision periods with no increase in reoffending.Too often, D.A. offices operate like a black box, with crucial decisions about charging and pleas hidden from public view. District attorneys should collect and share data so that the public can hold the system accountable. They should track the outcome of cases by race to flag disparities, findings of prosecutorial and police misconduct, and the number of people who go to jail because they can\u2019t pay bail. They should also post data on diversion programs, incarceration rates and what all this costs taxpayers.In a democracy, people tend to value and uphold the law when they perceive it as fair. As these new D.A.s reimagine the American model of prosecution, they should be pragmatists, focused on the well-being of the communities that elected them. Fairness and safety aren\u2019t a trade-off. They complement each other. This new corps of prosecutors can lead the way toward doing more justice with more mercy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Mystery of the Holiday Fruitcake, Solved!", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveMy father resembled a fruitcake. He also sent fruitcakes. Mine never arrived.He wanted me to have a particular brand of fruitcake. Made in Texas, it was famous among fruitcake lovers \u2014 or, at least, among people who gave fruitcakes to those who were assumed to love them.\u201cIt reminds me of my mother\u2019s,\u201d he told me in a phone call. \u201cHers was really moist, with lots of raisins.\u201dI later figured out that my grandmother\u2019s version, which I never had the chance to taste, was probably a Depression cake, made without milk, sugar, butter or eggs, scarce commodities when he was a child.Born in 1932, he grew up during the Great Depression in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. On most Christmases, he received two gifts: a pair of homemade socks and a small sack of oranges.\u201cMy mother knitted the socks,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd those oranges tasted so good.\u201dOrdering the fruitcake was his way of trying to take care of me from afar, in an era that, in his mind, may at any moment turn economically perilous. Regardless of my middle-aged status, I was still his son.\u201cIt should arrive the first week of December,\u201d he said. \u201cAs soon as you get it, let me know what you think.\u201dI would be going to California for Christmas, as I do every year, and I was looking forward to his gift and to sampling the flavors that transported him to his childhood.The first week of December passed with no sign of his fruitcake. Delayed by holiday mail, I assumed, or a backlog of orders.I knew there would be plenty to eat in California. In addition to my mother\u2019s cookies, fudge and other treats, my father always gave my sister and me each a large bag of assorted foods he called, rather plainly, the \u201cFood Bag.\u201d He produced these from some secret spot only after all the other presents had been opened.One year I listed the contents of my Food Bag in a notebook. I wanted to remember the details to tell my friends, and I suppose as a record for myself, for the day when I might not get a Food Bag for Christmas.That year my bag contained a can of deluxe mixed nuts, a box of whole-wheat crackers, a Belgian chocolate bar, a stick of hickory-cured turkey sausage, a half-pound sack of California red pistachios, some English breakfast tea and many other items, including an \u201cOh Deer Super Dooper Reindeer Pooper Jellybean Dispenser\u201d filled with jelly beans.I was 44 when my father gave me that Food Bag, and he was 72.His selections had no coherent theme, though the bags did have an uncanny but undeniable kinship with fruitcakes, featuring a little of this and that thrown together with intriguing results.The bags were so overstuffed that I often had to put most of the food in a box and mail it home. One year I assembled a few of the healthier items \u2014 sardines, rye crisps, dried apricots \u2014 and on the way to the airport made a special delivery of my own to the donation center of a local church.Fruitcake is a polarizing concept, a triggering word. People love it or hate it and like to debate whether it\u2019s cake at all. In some ways, my father\u2019s character resembled a fruitcake: whimsy and a little nuttiness mixed with a sweet foundation. When we were children and went to the local shopping mall, he liked to spritz on women\u2019s perfume \u2014 all of them.This was before men\u2019s cologne counters were common. Once they were, he would transform himself into pansexual bouquet of exotic fragrances. On our drives home, my mother would say, \u201cYou stink! What did you put on this time?\u201dWhile working as a meat cutter in grocery stores, he was called Crazy Charlie by his co-workers and was known for workplace pranks, like pretending to lock someone in the walk-in meat freezer. But he also gave out instructions to customers who didn\u2019t know how to roast lamb or make stuffing. When he came home from late shifts, he left candy bars under our pillow, thinking we might wake up wanting a snack.My father believed everyone was always hungry and needed to eat even if they weren\u2019t. When we visited him in the hospital during a three-month stay \u2014 he was battling a vicious infection after heart surgery \u2014 he would ask if we had eaten and never fail to remind us the cafeteria would be closing soon.\u201cAt least get a cup of coffee,\u201d he\u2019d say. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me.\u201dA fruitcake, in his mind, was a perfect Christmas gift. The culinary jumble of jeweled fruits suggested an extravagance that belied its practicality: Fruitcake can fill your belly and has a long shelf life. In 2017, a fruitcake thought to have been brought on Robert Scott\u2019s Antarctica expedition more than 100 years ago was discovered to be in \u201cexcellent condition.\u201dOn the day before my flight, the fruitcake still had not arrived. When my father called to wish me a safe trip, he said, \u201cDid you receive it?\u201d\u201cNot yet,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably delayed in the holiday mail.\u201d\u201cMaybe it\u2019ll be there today.\u201d He fretted deeply about that lost fruitcake.When I arrived at my parents\u2019 house, he said, \u201cDid you get the fruitcake?\u201d\u201cNo, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be there when I go home.\u201dAs soon as the word left my lips, I realized that \u201chome,\u201d for them, was also a kind of triggering word. Because wasn\u2019t this home? Wasn\u2019t I home now, with my parents greeting me, asking if I was hungry after the long flight? Wasn\u2019t New York only a stimulating adventure with an unscheduled end date? In my parents\u2019 living room, a Christmas tree stood above piles of presents in glittery paper, and in the spare bedroom, my father, I knew, had hidden our Food Bags, concealed under large towels.He remained hopeful the fruitcake would come by New Year\u2019s Eve, when I\u2019d be back in Midtown Manhattan, humanity roaring from Times Square.January, February and March came and went with no fruitcake. Though my father continued to ask about it, I never once considered lying and telling him yes, the fruitcake finally arrived and was delicious. Instead I said, \u201cThat cake is orbiting earth, and sooner or later it will land.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a good one!\u201d he said.His sense of humor never wavered, and as time went on he would bring up the perpetual journey of his fruitcake.\u201cI wonder where it is now,\u201d he\u2019d say.\u201cIt\u2019s taken a detour to Pluto.\u201dHe liked that one, too.\u201cDo you want me to order another, in case it never comes?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s O.K., Dad,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll wait for this one. It\u2019ll taste even better after touring the cosmos.\u201dEarly last December, nearly a year after my father died from a failing heart, I got a call from a staffer at the front desk of my apartment building.\u201cYou have a package,\u201d he said.I went downstairs to pick it up. The brown box had a FedEx label with a return address in Texas.Riding the elevator back upstairs, I held the box with both hands. Though small, it was heavy and solid, as if its contents were indestructible. I shook the package but nothing moved. In my kitchen, I opened the box with a bread knife, and there it was: a decorative tin holding the fruitcake my father had wanted me to taste several years earlier.I lifted the tin cover and punctured the airtight plastic seal. The fruitcake before me was crowned with candied cherries, caramelized pecans and chunks of pineapple that had been dyed emerald green. I sliced into it, placing a big wedge on a plate. I made a cup of tea, as my father and his mother might have done.I sat down and ate the slice slowly, the only way one can eat fruitcake, really. It was as moist as my father had promised, and not too sweet.After finishing every speck, I wondered about the fruitcake my father had ordered so long ago. Was it still lapping the heavens? Had it hitched a ride on the rings of Saturn?Wherever it was, who on earth had sent me this one?I had ordered it for myself, of course. After my father\u2019s death, I found myself grasping for every memory of him, every cologne-scented hint of his being. The confection of known and mysterious morsels embodied his desire for me to enjoy a simple and not-so-simple piece of cake \u2014 and to never go hungry.Advertisement"}

Some Christians must have missed that part.

I eventually learned it\u2019s a ritual commemorating the Last Supper. At the monthly Masses that were part of the curriculum, that meant grape juice and stale wafers were offered to pimpled, dorky teenagers as the blood and body of Christ.During my time there, I also read the King James Bible and stories about Jesus, learned about Christian morality, debated the Trinity with Jesuit priests and received an A every semester in religious studies class. Twenty years later, I can still recite the \u201cOur Father\u201d prayer from memory.Even though I don\u2019t personally celebrate Christmas, the season always makes me think of his legacy of radical love. This year, it\u2019s especially hard to understand how Trump-supporting Christians have turned their back on that unconditional love and exchanged it for nativism, fear and fealty to a reality TV show host turned president.Our school\u2019s motto was \u201cMen for others,\u201d a reminder that the Christian faith should be lived through active selfless service.

I volunteered at the senior center and the local homeless shelter, where my friends and I cleaned the kitchen and packed peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for struggling men and women, most of them eager for employment. This Christmas, I hope Trump-supporting Christians try to find compassion for people who are similarly suffering. I hope they open their Bible and reflect on James 2:14: \u201cWhat good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save them?\u201dThese are the kinds of Christians who I believe are following the lessons and footsteps of Jesus, the prophet I met and loved as a Muslim at a Catholic high school. This Christmas, I hope some of the Christians who support President Trump can meet him too.Wajahat Ali is a playwright, lawyer and contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "This Type of Illiteracy Could Hurt You", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bythe new old ageMore than half of older Americans lack the skills to gather and understand medical information. Providers must simplify, researchers say. Every time her parents pick up a new prescription at a Walgreens in Houston, they follow Duyen Pham-Madden\u2019s standing instructions: Use the iPad she bought for them, log onto FaceTime, hold up the pill bottles for her examination.Her mother, 79, and father, 77, need numerous medications, but have trouble grasping when and how to take them.The label may say to take one pill three times a day, but \u201cmy dad might take one a day,\u201d said Ms. Pham-Madden, 56, an insurance purchasing agent in Blue Springs, Mo. \u201cOr take three at a time.\u201dSo she interprets the directions for them, also reminding her mother to take the prescribed megadose of vitamin D, for osteoporosis, only weekly, not daily.Part of their struggle, Ms. Pham-Madden believes, stems from language barriers. The family emigrated from Vietnam in 1975, and while her parents speak and read English, they lack the fluency of native speakers.But recently, Ms. Pham-Madden said, her father posed a question that anyone grappling with Medicare drug coverage might ask: \u201cWhat\u2019s the doughnut hole?\u201dCan someone read a pamphlet and then determine how often to undergo a particular medical test? Look at a graph and recognize a normal weight range for her height? Ascertain whether her insurance will cover a certain procedure?Just 12 percent rank as \u201cproficient,\u201d the highest category. About a fifth have \u201cbasic\u201d health literacy that could cause problems, and 14 percent score \u201cbelow basic.\u201d Health literacy differs by education level, race, poverty and other factors.And it varies dramatically by age. While the proportion of adults with intermediate literacy ranges from 53 to 58 percent in other age groups, it falls to 38 percent among those 65 and older. The percentage of older adults with basic or below basic literacy is higher than in any other age group; only 3 percent qualify as proficient.Moreover, \u201cas adults age, they\u2019re more likely to experience cognitive impairment,\u201d she pointed out, as well as hearing and vision loss that can affect their comprehension.But a neurologist diagnosed mild cognitive impairment last summer and prescribed a drug intended to ameliorate its symptoms. It caused a frightening reaction \u2014 personality changes, lethargy, dizziness, sky-high blood pressure.Ms. Johnson thinks her mother might have overdosed. \u201cShe told me she thought, \u2018This is going to fix me, and I\u2019ll be O.K. So if I take more pills, I\u2019ll be O.K. faster.\u2019\u201dYet health literacy can be particularly crucial for seniors. They\u2019re usually coping with more complicated medical problems, including multiple chronic diseases, an array of drugs, a host of specialists. They have more instructions to decipher, more tests to schedule, more decisions to ponder.It may not help much that future cohorts of older adults will be better educated. \u201cThe demands of interacting with the health care system are increasing,\u201d Dr. Wolff said. \u201cAsk any adult child of a parent who\u2019s been hospitalized. The system has gotten increasingly complex.\u201d\u201cWe give people findings and tell them about risk and expect people to make decisions based on those concepts, but we don\u2019t explain them very well,\u201d she said. \u201cAre our forms readable? Are the directions after surgery written coherently? If it\u2019s written in jargon, with confusing words and numbers, you won\u2019t get the gist of it and you won\u2019t get important information.\u201dA few years ago, Steven Rosen, 64, had spent more than two months at a Chicago hospital after several surgeries. Then a social worker came into his room and told his wife Dorothy, \u201cYou have to move him tomorrow to an L.T.A.C.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Ms. Rosen recalled saying. \u201cWhat\u2019s an L.T.A.C.?\u201d Question: Was she demonstrating inadequate health literacy, or should the social worker have clarified that L.T.A.C.s \u2014 long-term acute care hospitals \u2014 provide more care than nursing homes for very ill patients? Aware of such issues, health care organizations are scrambling to try to make information more accessible and intelligible, and to help patients of all ages understand an often bewildering environment.They\u2019re turning to technology, like secure websites where both patients and family members can see test results or ask questions. For now, though, often the primary health literacy navigators for older people are their adult children, most commonly daughters and daughters-in-law.\u201cIn the best of all worlds, she\u2019d just be the daughter,\u201d Dr. Chesser said. \u201cBut we need her to serve other roles \u2014 being an advocate, asking a lot of questions of the provider, asking where to go for information, talking about second opinions.\u201dDuyen Pham-Madden plays the co-managerial role from hundreds of miles away, keeping spreadsheets of her parents\u2019 drugs, compiling lists of questions for doctors\u2019 appointments, texting photos to pharmacists when the pills in a refilled prescription look different from the last batch.She\u2019d probably score well in health literacy, but \u201csometimes even I get mixed up,\u201d she said.What\u2019s the Medicare doughnut hole? \u201cI had to look it up,\u201d she said.

{"Headline": "Can Netflix Take Turkey\u2019s TV Dramas to the World?", "Date": "2018-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 On a recent evening, Nahid Akhtar, 47, sat on a sofa in London shouting at a TV. She was watching \u201cThe Protector,\u201d Netflix\u2019s first original series in Turkish.The show, released that day, is about a young antiques dealer, Hakan Demir (Cagatay Ulusoy), who discovers he belongs to an ancient line of superheroes who have to save Istanbul from evil \u2014 and find love at the same time.\u201cOh, please, don\u2019t kill his baba!\u201d Akhtar, a Turkish drama superfan, called out at one point before Demir\u2019s father was, indeed, murdered. \u201cTurkish dramas have so many orphans,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery single series I\u2019ve watched the hero never has both parents.\u201dOn screen, Hakan was in tears. \u201cThis is another thing I do like about Turkish TV,\u201d Akhtar added. \u201cThey show a lot of emotion.\u201dTen minutes later, the character was still distraught. \u201cOh, for crying out loud,\u201d Akhtar said. \u201cSort yourself out!\u201dNow the shows are spreading across Europe. This year, a dubbed version of \u201cFatmagul,\u201d an acclaimed drama about the aftermath of a gang rape, attracted almost a million viewers per episode in Spain, despite being on Nova, a minor channel that specializes in Latin American telenovelas. Other series have found similar success in countries from Bulgaria to Sweden.Only France, Germany, Britain and the United States are resistant, said Fredrik af Malmborg, the managing director of the TV distributor Ecchorights, in a telephone interview. \u201cTurkish TV is about family and moral issues,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s slightly conservative, slightly old-fashioned, but it\u2019s not cynical.\u201dNetflix has shown Turkish dramas since 2016, but its move into making its own shows their growing appeal, af Malmborg said.There\u2019s already a strong community of enthusiasts across Europe and America for Netflix to target. Akhtar got into Turkish dramas in January 2017 while stuck in bed. \u201cI had chronic, really bad flu,\u201d she said. Bored, she opened Netflix and it suggested an episode of \u201cKurt Seyit ve Sura,\u201d a wartime romance.\u201cI thought I\u2019d just give it a go \u2014 it was only 45 minutes \u2014 and I was absolutely enthralled,\u201d she said.It was the chivalry and romance \u2014 the old-fashioned values \u2014 that grabbed her, she said. But also the dialogue: \u201cIt\u2019s very elegant and poetic. It calls to your soul.\u201dAkhtar soon became obsessed. She once took an emergency two days off work as an information technology consultant to finish another series. She has traveled to Turkey several times, once just to try and bump into her favorite actor. She also joined some 20 Facebook groups, and wrote to the director of a show, begging him to make two characters kiss.\u201cIf characters kiss, the shows can get hugely fined,\u201d Akhtar said. (Turkey\u2019s Radio and Television Supreme Council can punish broadcasters that show anything it considers contrary to the national and moral values of the society.) \u201cSo all the fans put together some money, then contacted the director and said, \u2018Let them kiss. We\u2019ll pay the fine for you.\u2019 \u201dBottles of alcohol are usually blurred to avoid trouble with the censors, she added. Murder is fine, though.Yasemin Y. Celikkol, a doctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania who studies Turkish dramas, said some series had proved to have particular resonances in some other countries. A show called \u201cFalling Leaves\u201d was a hit in Bulgaria, she said, because its plot is \u201cabout the terrible things that happen to families when they move to cities.\u201d There\u2019s been a lot of internal migration in Bulgaria, and people could see themselves in it, she added.Dramas have overhauled Turkey\u2019s image in Russia too, Celikkol said, leading many Russians to travel there for vacations, to find husbands or to seek medical treatment. But that seemed to have produced a backlash, she added. In 2016, a Russian television company made a series, \u201cEast/West,\u201d about a Russian couple visiting a Turkish fertility clinic, only for the Russian woman to end up as the Turkish doctor\u2019s unhappy second wife.\u201cIt almost seemed like the show was saying to Russian women, \u2018Don\u2019t go there, you\u2019ll lose your freedom and have no access to your children,\u2019 \u201d Celikkol said. A second season of \u201cEast/West\u201d was broadcast this year.Back in London, Akhtar raced through the first two episodes of \u201cThe Protector,\u201d pointing out all the differences between the Netflix show and other Turkish productions. A scene featuring a woman in her underwear would definitely not appear on television in Turkey, she said. And there was more swearing than normal. The lead actor also looked more unkempt.But she liked it. \u201cI will keep watching,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of it is overacted, when they\u2019re normally more subtle. But I want to know what happens next and the main thing is it\u2019s got subtitles.\u201dThat\u2019s normally a problem, she said. Akhtar speaks only some Turkish, and often has to search online for streams of shows that fans have subtitled themselves.\u201cI just love seeing Istanbul again,\u201d she added. \u201cThere\u2019s something in me that wants to go live there for a year and learn Turkish. Or just sit in an apartment and watch these shows.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified one of the actors in the series \u201cFatmagul.\u201d He is Engin Akyurek, not Kerim Ilgaz, which is the name of the character he plays in the program.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Checking In? No Thanks. I\u2019m Just Here to Use the Wi-Fi.", "Date": "2018-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHotels have begun to turn their lobbies and common areas into WeWork-like gathering places, attracting both guests and locals.Walk into a hotel lobby and you may notice something unexpected: People.Not people checking in, or waiting for someone to arrive or hustling to the elevator. No, people sitting, working and socializing.\u201cThe trend emerged organically and accidentally,\u201d he said. \u201cThe lobby seemed to be perpetually full with people talking, drinking and working. The Ace Hotel didn\u2019t set out to create a co-working space \u2014 the term didn\u2019t really exist at that point.\u201dInstead of discouraging Wi-Fi moochers and freelance nomads in its lobbies, the Ace Hotels took another step to actively encourage them and signal their welcome. It put outlets everywhere and catered to the creative crowd.The midtown Manhattan crowds came quickly for the trendy design, unlocked Wi-Fi \u2014 and equally unlocked restrooms.\u201cWhat we wanted was for our lobbies to act as community gathering spaces and designed them with that in mind,\u201d Kelly Sawdon, partner and chief creative officer at Ace Hotels, said. \u201cOur hotels are borne from our love for cities and people, and that means providing space for everyone, regardless of whether they\u2019re guests or our neighbors.\u201dMoxy hotels do not have a front desk, and guests check in at a bar where they get their room key and a drink.Marriott decided to create the brand in response to the rise of co-working and consumer insights collected by travelers, Toni Stoeckl, global brand leader and vice president for distinctive select brand at Marriott, said. \u201cIn many cases, solo travel would mean working in a guest room, maybe hanging in the bar,\u201d Mr. Stoeckl said. \u201cBut even if you\u2019re alone, you want to be alone together, ideally making connections with locals that are actually hanging out in that public space.\u201dThe Moxy brand now has over 80 hotels in the pipeline across the U.S., Europe and Asia. Marriott International brands that are focusing on revamped common spaces are expected to more than double in size by 2022, growing at a rate that is four times as high as that as the growth for the rest of the Marriott International portfolio.Sheraton hotels will also be revamping some 450 existing lobbies, requiring each lobby to have something called the \u201cproductivity table.\u201d The tables will have outlets, USB ports, and drawers that users can rent and lock. Lobbies will also have a private phone booth in the lobby, and meeting room spaces available for rent.\u201cIt\u2019s a new category in the hotel industry,\u201d said Hans Meyer, co-founder of Zoku. \u201cIt\u2019s a hybrid between a home and office with hotel services.\u201d Almost a mix between Airbnb and WeWork, with a daily coffee and cake break in the afternoon and communal dinners once a week.The benefit for hotels is both in the immediate and longterm, Mr. Litwin said. \u201cThe more locals you attract to your lobby, the more genuine everything feels. And that is what travelers today are increasingly attracted by truly authentic experiences,\u201d he said.So what does this mean for the future of hotels? For freelancers and digital nomads, it may mean larger, trendier selection of free co-working spaces. For travelers, it may mean that instead of coming back to a quiet hotel room to finish the day\u2019s work, you may find yourself in a vibrant lobby filled with locals and business travelers alike.But as much as ethos and trends are discussed, a new kind of lobby will also create a new revenue stream for hotels.All those artisanal coffee drinks and organic salad bowls do add up.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Uncommon Power of Grace", "Date": "2018-12-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA revolutionary idea lies at its core: radical equality.Contributing Opinion WriterIn his book \u201cWhat\u2019s So Amazing About Grace?\u201d Philip Yancey describes a conference on comparative religions where experts from around the world debated which belief, if any, was unique to the Christian faith. C.S. Lewis happened to enter the room during the discussion. When he was told the topic was Christianity\u2019s unique contribution among world religions, Lewis responded: \u201cOh, that\u2019s easy. It\u2019s grace.\u201dLewis was right. No other religion places grace at its theological center. It was a revolutionary idea; as Mr. Yancey puts it, grace \u201cseems to go against every instinct of humanity.\u201d We are naturally drawn to covenants and karma, to cause and effect, to earning what we receive.There\u2019s a radical equality at the core of grace. None of us are deserving of God\u2019s grace, so it\u2019s not dependent on social status, wealth or intelligence. There is equality between kings and peasants, the prominent and the unheralded, rule followers and rule breakers.If you find yourself in the company of people whose hearts have been captured by grace, count yourself lucky. They love us despite our messy lives, stay connected to us through our struggles, always holding out the hope of redemption. When relationships are broken, my wife Cindy told me, it\u2019s grace that causes people not to give up, to extend the invitation to reconnect, to work through misunderstandings with sensitivity and transparency.You don\u2019t sense hard edges, dogmatism or self-righteous judgment from gracious people. There\u2019s a tenderness about them that opens doors that had previously been bolted shut. People who have been transformed by grace have a special place in their hearts for those living in the shadows of society. They\u2019re easily moved by stories of suffering and step into the breach to heal. And grace properly understood always produces gratitude.Of course, grace can easily be exploited by people who don\u2019t want to be held accountable for their misdeeds; the theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer referred to this as \u201ccheap grace.\u201d Nor is it easy to balance grace with the requirements of justice. We obviously can\u2019t organize society entirely around the concept of grace. Yet the problem today is more the absence of grace than its presence.It\u2019s easy to understand why. Living a grace-filled life is hard. Most of us, when we feel wronged, want payback. Our first impulse, when hurt or offended, is to strike out, justifying our anger in the name of fairness. We forget the words of Edward Herbert (the poet George\u2019s brother), \u201cHe that cannot forgive others breaks the bridge over which he must pass himself,\u201d and we forget that only grace can break the cycle of ancient hatreds among peoples. (It is notable that while I have regretted not granting grace to others, I\u2019ve never once regretted extending it.)When Mr. Yancey was young, he rejected the church for a time because he found so little grace there. There is a tendency among many people of faith to come across as holier than thou, more eager to judge than to forgive. Jesus encountered this throughout his ministry, which helps explain why he was more comfortable in the company of the unclean and reviled, the lowly and the outcast, than religious authorities. The odds are that you know people who have had scars of ungrace inflicted upon them by the Christian church. Yet when we see grace in action \u2014 whether in acts of extravagant, indiscriminate love, in radical self-giving, or in showing equanimity in the face of death \u2014 it can move us unlike anything else.In 2014, Steve Hayner, my spiritual confidant, was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Upon learning it had spread, Steve wrote, \u201cIn all probability, the remainder of my life on this earth is now to be counted in weeks and months.\u201d (He died in January 2015.) Steve acknowledged that pain and death are reminders of the nature of our broken world. Yet he went on to say: \u201cThere is a much bigger story of which this is only a tiny part. And it is God\u2019s story of love, hope, forgiveness, reconciliation, and joy. We went into this journey choosing to trust God and to offer our fears to God. We\u2019ve been so grateful for the freedom from fear and the abundance of peace that we have experienced.\u201d He added, \u201cThere are, of course, times of discouragement, grief, pain, and wonder. After all, there are a lot of unknowns ahead of us.\u201dI sent Steve\u2019s reflections to my friend Jonathan Rauch, who responded, \u201cIt\u2019s letters like this \u2014 the wisdom, the grace \u2014 that make me wish I weren\u2019t an atheist.\u201dWhen I recently asked Jonathan how, as a nonbeliever, he understood grace and why it inspires us when we see it in others, he told me that grace is \u201csome combination of generosity and magnanimity, kindness and forgiveness, and empathy \u2014 all above the ordinary call of duty, and bestowed even (or especially?) when not particularly earned.\u201d We see it demonstrated in heroic ways and in small, everyday contexts, he said. \u201cBut I guess, regardless of the context, it\u2019s always at least a little unexpected and out of the ordinary.\u201dA lot like if the incarnate deity, veiled in flesh, were born in a manger in Bethlehem.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Anti-Zionism Tunnels Under Your House", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor the people of northern Israel, anti-Zionism isn\u2019t some feckless sally in the world of ideas.Opinion ColumnistSometimes anti-Zionists are \u2014 surprise! \u2014 homicidal anti-Semites, too. That\u2019s a thought that can\u2019t be far from the mind of anyone living in northern Israel, where in recent days the Israeli Army has discovered at least three tunnels dug by Hezbollah and intended to infiltrate commandos under the border in the (increasingly likely) event of war. Given the breadth of Hezbollah\u2019s capabilities, the depth of its fanaticism, and the experience of Hamas\u2019s excavation projects in Gaza, it\u2019s fair to assume other tunnels will be found.What would Hezbollah do if it got its fighters across? In 1974, three Palestinian terrorists crossed the border from Lebanon and took 115 hostages at an elementary school in the town of Ma\u2019alot. They murdered 25 of them, including 22 children.All this is to say that Israelis experience anti-Zionism in a different way than, say, readers of The New York Review of Books: not as a bold sally in the world of ideas, but as a looming menace to their earthly existence, held at bay only through force of arms. It\u2019s somewhat like the difference between discussing the effects of Marxism-Leninism in an undergraduate seminar at Reed College, circa 2018 \u2014 and experiencing them at closer range in West Berlin, circa 1961.Note the distinction: Anti-Zionists are not advocating the reform of a state, as Japan was reformed after 1945. Nor are they calling for the adjustment of a state\u2019s borders, as Canada\u2019s border with the United States was periodically adjusted in the 19th century. They\u2019re not talking about the birth of a separate state, either, as South Sudan was born out of Sudan in 2011. And they\u2019re certainly not championing the partition of a multiethnic state into ethnically homogenous components, as Yugoslavia was partitioned after 1991.Does this make someone with Hill\u2019s views an anti-Semite? It\u2019s like asking whether a person who believes in separate-but-equal must necessarily be a racist. In theory, no. In reality, another story. The typical aim of the anti-Semite is legal or social discrimination against some set of Jews. The explicit aim of the anti-Zionist is political or physical dispossession.What\u2019s worse: To be denied membership in a country club because you\u2019re Jewish, or driven from your ancestral homeland and sovereign state for the same reason? If anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism are meaningfully distinct (I think they are not), the human consequences of the latter are direr.The good news is that the conversation about anti-Zionism remains mostly academic because Israelis haven\u2019t succumbed to the fatal illusion that, if only they behaved better, their enemies would hate them less. To the extent that Israeli parents ever sleep soundly, it\u2019s because they know what they are up against. And, to borrow Kipling\u2019s line, they never make mock of uniforms that guard them while they sleep.The same can\u2019t be said for that class of scolds who excel in making excuses for the wicked and finding fault with the good. When you find yourself on the same side as Hassan Nasrallah, Louis Farrakhan and David Duke on the question of a country\u2019s right to exist, it\u2019s time to re-examine every opinion you hold.Advertisement"}

But last week was a watershed moment for me, and I think for many Americans, including some Republicans.It was the moment when you had to ask whether we really can survive two more years of Trump as president, whether this man and his demented behavior \u2014 which will get only worse as the Mueller investigation concludes \u2014 are going to destabilize our country, our markets, our key institutions and, by extension, the world. And therefore his removal from office now has to be on the table.I believe that the only responsible choice for the Republican Party today is an intervention with the president that makes clear that if there is not a radical change in how he conducts himself \u2014 and I think that is unlikely \u2014 the party\u2019s leadership will have no choice but to press for his resignation or join calls for his impeachment.It has to start with Republicans, given both the numbers needed in the Senate and political reality. Removing this president has to be an act of national unity as much as possible \u2014 otherwise it will tear the country apart even more. I know that such an action is very difficult for today\u2019s G.O.P., but the time is long past for it to rise to confront this crisis of American leadership.Trump\u2019s behavior has become so erratic, his lying so persistent, his willingness to fulfill the basic functions of the presidency \u2014 like reading briefing books, consulting government experts before making major changes and appointing a competent staff \u2014 so absent, his readiness to accommodate Russia and spurn allies so disturbing and his obsession with himself and his ego over all other considerations so consistent, two more years of him in office could pose a real threat to our nation. Vice President Mike Pence could not possibly be worse.The damage an out-of-control Trump can do goes well beyond our borders. America is the keystone of global stability. Our world is the way it is today \u2014 a place that, despite all its problems, still enjoys more peace and prosperity than at any time in history \u2014 because America is the way it is (or at least was). And that is a nation that at its best has always stood up for the universal values of freedom and human rights, has always paid extra to stabilize the global system from which we were the biggest beneficiary and has always nurtured and protected alliances with like-minded nations.Donald Trump has proved time and again that he knows nothing of the history or importance of this America. That was made starkly clear in Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis\u2019s resignation letter.Trump is in the grip of a mad notion that the entire web of global institutions and alliances built after World War II \u2014 which, with all their imperfections, have provided the connective tissues that have created this unprecedented era of peace and prosperity \u2014 threatens American sovereignty and prosperity and that we are better off without them.So Trump gloats at the troubles facing the European Union, urges Britain to exit and leaks that he\u2019d consider quitting NATO. These are institutions that all need to be improved, but not scrapped. If America becomes a predator on all the treaties, multilateral institutions and alliances holding the world together; if America goes from being the world\u2019s anchor of stability to an engine of instability; if America goes from a democracy built on the twin pillars of truth and trust to a country where it is acceptable for the president to attack truth and trust on a daily basis, watch out: Your kids won\u2019t just grow up in a different America. They will grow up in a different world.The last time America disengaged from the world remotely in this manner was in the 1930s, and you remember what followed: World War II.You have no idea how quickly institutions like NATO and the E.U. and the World Trade Organization and just basic global norms \u2014 like thou shalt not kill and dismember a journalist in your own consulate \u2014 can unravel when America goes AWOL or haywire under a shameless isolated president.But this is not just about the world, it\u2019s about the minimum decorum and stability we expect from our president. If the C.E.O. of any public company in America behaved like Trump has over the past two years \u2014 constantly lying, tossing out aides like they were Kleenex, tweeting endlessly like a teenager, ignoring the advice of experts \u2014 he or she would have been fired by the board of directors long ago. Should we expect less for our president?That\u2019s what the financial markets are now asking. For the first two years of the Trump presidency the markets treated his dishonesty and craziness as background noise to all the soaring corporate profits and stocks. But that is no longer the case. Trump has markets worried.The instability Trump is generating \u2014 including his attacks on the chairman of the Federal Reserve \u2014 is causing investors to wonder where the economic and geopolitical management will come from as the economy slows down. What if we\u2019re plunged into an economic crisis and we have a president whose first instinct is always to blame others and who\u2019s already purged from his side the most sober adults willing to tell him that his vaunted \u201cgut instincts\u201d have no grounding in economics or in law or in common sense. Mattis was the last one.We are now left with the B team \u2014 all the people who were ready to take the jobs that Trump\u2019s first team either resigned from \u2014 because they could not countenance his lying, chaos and ignorance \u2014 or were fired from for the same reasons.But too often Trump has given us disruption without any plan for what comes next. He has worked to destroy Obamacare with no plan for the morning after. He announced a pullout from Syria and Afghanistan without even consulting the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, or the State Department\u2019s top expert, let alone our allies.And while, yes, we need disruption in some areas, we also desperately need innovation in others. How do we manage these giant social networks? How do we integrate artificial intelligence into every aspect of our society, as China is doing? How do we make lifelong learning available to every American? At a time when we need to be building bridges to the 21st century, all Trump can talk about is building a wall with Mexico \u2014 a political stunt to energize his base rather than the comprehensive immigration reform that we really need.Indeed, Trump\u2019s biggest disruption has been to undermine the norms and values we associate with a U.S. president and U.S. leadership. And now that Trump has freed himself of all restraints from within his White House staff, his cabinet and his party \u2014 so that \u201cTrump can be Trump,\u201d we are told \u2014 he is freer than ever to remake America in his image.We cannot afford to find out.An earlier version of this article misstated the frequency of false or misleading claims told by President Trump. It was an average of almost 11 a day during his first 700 days in office, not five a day.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Unrest in France Hinders Macron\u2019s Push to Revive Economy", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The need to accelerate growth has long been visible in almost every corner of the French economy, from dreary unemployment offices packed with job seekers to businesses whose financially stretched customers struggle to make do.President Emmanuel Macron came into office pledging to change all that by improving the country\u2019s long-term prospects. But his halting response to a month of violent demonstrations by the so-called Yellow Vest movement over social inequality has clouded his efforts for a revival.The same day, the country\u2019s central bank trimmed its growth forecast for the fourth quarter to 0.2 percent from 0.4 percent, well off the sluggish pace expected for the year. Businesses have sustained more than 10 billion euros, about $11.4 billion, in damage and lost sales, a figure that will probably grow.\u201cIt\u2019s a catastrophe for business,\u201d Bruno Le Maire, the finance minister, said Sunday as he toured Paris businesses smashed up by rioters. \u201cIt\u2019s a catastrophe for our economy,\u201d he added, a point he pressed again on Tuesday in a briefing with a small group of reporters.He pledged tax cuts and financial support for those having trouble getting by, urged businesses to give employees year-end bonuses and said the government would help minimum-wage earners with a \u20ac100 monthly supplement starting next year.Mr. Macron\u2019s speech, a recorded message just 13 minutes long, was also notable for what he left out.\u201cWe know how important it is for us to be as attractive as possible for foreign investors,\u201d Mr. Le Maire told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cThe key point is to make clear that we will remain strong on structural reforms.\u201dWhile foreign investment in France has risen since Mr. Macron came to office, \u201cthere will be a mark left by this episode,\u201d said Olivier Marchal, the chairman of Bain & Company France. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not a given that this will succeed in calming the dissatisfaction of a part of the population.\u201dMany of those protesting understand that improving the economy is a long-term project, but their concerns are focused on their monthly efforts to make ends meet. On social networks, some protesters said Mr. Macron\u2019s offer fell short.Mr. Macron has lectured leaders of other eurozone countries \u2014 especially Italy \u2014 about the need to balance their books. Now he must follow his own advice. French ministries have been ordered to find cuts in their budgets, and the government could delay some tax cuts for companies that had been scheduled to kick in next year, Mr. Le Maire said.Mr. Macron also refuses to end a tax break for wealthy citizens that he granted upon taking office. He says the measure was intended to lure money into France, where it can be invested in French companies. The move has drained more than \u20ac3 billion from France\u2019s coffers this year, but Mr. Le Maire said Tuesday that there was no data yet to show whether it was having the promised stimulus effect.Mr. Le Maire has suggested another way to make up the shortfall: pursuing the taxes that he said Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google had avoided paying in France for years. The European Union is considering a plan to impose such taxes. If the union does not reach an accord on doing so by March, Mr. Le Maire said Tuesday, France will move to collect $500 million in back taxes from the tech giants.Patrick Artus, chief economist at Natixis Bank, which is based in Paris, said that even if the tax cuts and spending increases Mr. Macron had proposed increased France\u2019s budget deficit, \u201cmarkets will accept that\u201d as a price for restoring social stability.Still, the slowdown in growth caused by a month of disruption will make it harder for Mr. Macron to address several major problems.Retailers, including supermarkets and sellers of luxury goods, have collectively lost more than \u20ac1 billion, while small and medium-size companies have lost at least \u20ac10 billion, according to France\u2019s main retail and business associations.The agriculture sector is facing over \u20ac13 billion in losses, said ANIA, the main industry group, citing four weekends of protests that blocked roads, causing delivery delays and often preventing groceries from reaching stores.Tourism has also been affected, with hotels recording cancellation rates as high as 25 percent since the protests started last month. American and Japanese tour operators have been advising customers not to travel to France, according to the National Federation of Tourist Offices.Some companies have paused hiring plans. Auchan, a large supermarket chain, said it might not hire 4,000 temporary workers it had planned to employ across France for the holiday season.Stores that need to make up for lost revenue will be allowed to open on Sundays, something that has been prohibited in most of France by decades-old laws requiring that Sunday be a day of rest.In the end, the main issue for France is not the short-term cost from the demonstrations, said Mr. Artus, the economist.\u201cIt\u2019s whether Macron will keep the reforms going,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is to maintain the attractiveness of France.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the name of the bank where Patrick Artus is the chief economist. It is Natixis Bank, not Natexis.Advertisement"}

Furnished with a hand-me-down stage for its bar and performance venue, and 90 seats purchased for a single Czech koruna (about four cents) for its lecture hall, Campus Hybernska is just getting started. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to build something, a space for things to happen,\u201d Mr. Bicovsky said, noting that at one point, the place \u201cbecame the property of the Ministry of Interior, so actually the secret police and other organizations were here.\u201d Although the first artists started moving in about seven years ago, it is only recently that its two main art galleries, featuring both local and emerging European artists, have opened, along with a new cafe.A five-minute walk from the Kolbenova metro station, the main, E-shaped building now hosts more than 120 artists, designers, filmmakers and other creative types. Studios still bear signs identifying chemical laboratories and warnings about the dangers of smoking around flammable gasses. Above a run-down loading dock, a bone-white sculpture of an immense male nude reclines.In warmer months and at special events during the winter, an outdoor beer garden serves Czech craft brews. Old Pragovka trucks, painted white, ghost the parking lot, while billboards on the eastern edge of the property feature work from resident artists, including the former street and graffiti artist known as Pasta Oner.Halfway across town, another creative space has opened in an old military barracks near the western edge of the trendy Karlin district. \u201cThis is a cultural heritage site,\u201d Mr. Velek said. \u201cIt can\u2019t be demolished. It can only be reconstructed to its original state. \u201dThe old barracks are massive; Mr. Velek and his partners only have the use of one wing of the D-shaped building, as well as the large courtyard that it surrounds. Events take place inside and out, year-round. In winter, the beach volleyball court turns into a public ice-skating rink. The movie theater upstairs is also home to break-dancing classes. The complex includes a contemporary art gallery, a bar and a music venue, called Garaze.\u201cWe have an indoor cinema, and we have an outdoor cinema in the summer,\u201d Mr. Velek said. \u201cThe old swimming pool is an experimental place that works for author readings and some performances.\u201dThe charitable organizations inside the House at the Golden Horn might not hold too much interest for tourists. But the Scout Institute here hosts poetry readings, concerts and other cultural events every week, including some in English, and the cafe on the second floor is one of the least commercial places to stop for a cup of coffee in the heart of Prague\u2019s hyper-commercialized tourist zone. Just by sticking your head in you\u2019ll get a glimpse of a Prague Renaissance building.Advertisement"}

What they\u2019ve found turns what we know about the world literally upside down.So science fiction fans, rejoice. The real journey to the center of the Earth has begun.Just as vegetation varies between deserts, rain forests and Arctic tundras, microbial communities vary between habitats \u2014 whether buried beneath sediments or sulfuric crust in the seafloor, or encased within granite, basalt, sandstone or clay beneath continents. There are even some fungi and multicellular organisms, like insects and worms, living deep below ground.There are basically two kinds of feeders in the deep subsurface. Some scavengers survive on leftovers of photosynthesis from the surface that have been buried for up to hundreds of millions of years. Chemolithoautotrophs, on the other hand, do a kind of sunless photosynthesis and breathe whatever\u2019s around.Other microbes even breathe uranium and expel the waste as teeny crystals.Subsurface microbes might only reproduce every thirty years, or take even longer. If nutrients run low, the microbes enter a dormant stage and focus the little energy they have on maintenance. They\u2019ll reproduce when some other energy source comes along \u2014 and that takes time, perhaps geological time. It can take tens to thousands of years for a new population to replace an old one.By modeling the deep subsurface biosphere and how the right chemical reactions could give rise to organic matter, researchers are hoping to get closer to an answer about whether life emerged at the surface or in the deep.Other scientists wonder if understanding life in the subsurface could point toward life elsewhere in the solar system, like Mars or Europa.Until that gets worked out, this new-old world is \u201cproviding us with a vivid new way of thinking about \u2018what is life?\u2019\u201d said Dr. Hazen.Scientists have discovered microbes thriving three miles below the continental surface, and methane-producing bacteria, like the one pictured here, six miles below the seafloor.\u201cIf you snubbed out the sun tomorrow, these guys wouldn\u2019t even care,\u201d said Dr. Lloyd.We still don\u2019t know how much deeper life may go.\u201cThey haven\u2019t gone that far yet, but we\u2019ve all got our fingers crossed,\u201d said Dr. Lloyd. \u201cWe have yet to say that we\u2019ve truly drilled past the point where life exists.\u201dIt\u2019s hard to know for certain if conditions will be too severe in the mantle to sustain life. These microbes, which can subsist on the tiniest drop of water (many don\u2019t even need oxygen) are constantly testing life\u2019s known limits.\u201cWe find cells in places where we thought there wouldn\u2019t be any cells,\u201d said Dr. Daniel.Heat rises nearer the core, and too much may destroy the proteins and fats that make up cells, as happens in the lab.\u201cHow far does this extend?\u201d Dr. Daniel asked.

She was constantly praised for her good looks; I was not. My parents were more interested in my education. After graduating, I went on to build a solid career, but she still drifts professionally. Over Thanksgiving, I noticed that she got weirdly defensive about Stormy Daniels when the Trump saga came up. Sure enough, after checking around, I learned that she works as an \u201cexotic dancer\u201d at a club where she lives. I would like to tell her mother (in a very gentle way) when I see her at Christmas. Her parents may be able to help. Thoughts?ANONYMOUSIt sounds to me as if you want to detonate a bomb around the Christmas tree (albeit \u201cin a very gentle way\u201d). And forgive me for speculating, but I think your odd sleuthing and your desire to spill the beans reveal a yen to \u201cwin,\u201d proving once and for all that your hard work has triumphed over your cousin\u2019s natural beauty.But my job is not to hand out blue ribbons. It is, in part, to stop good people from doing mean things like revealing possibly embarrassing information about cousins at family gatherings. Don\u2019t say a word to her mother (or anyone else). What is she supposed to do about her daughter\u2019s career? And why do you assume she doesn\u2019t know?If you really want to help, be kind to your cousin, even if she received an annoying amount of attention in your youth. It\u2019s possible that she likes her work. It\u2019s also possible that she has fewer job options than you do and made the best choice available to her. (Who are we to judge?) Needlessly drawing attention to her perceived misfortune, even in the guise of concern, doesn\u2019t help her and only makes you look bitter and small.Greetings from Canada! My adult children will be visiting us for Christmas at our new home in the Laurentian Mountains. All of them use cannabis extensively. I\u2019m fine with it, but my husband (their stepfather) objects. He doesn\u2019t approve of any smoking in the house. So, should they be allowed to vape indoors, only in their bedrooms or just outside? And what about edibles?JENNYCongratulations to you on your new home, Jenny, and to your stoner children on Canada\u2019s recent legalization of the recreational use of pot. If your husband is sincere, and his objection to cannabis is limited to smoke, then surely he won\u2019t object to edibles, correct? (No smoke in pot-laced gummy worms!)But in some bad news for your kids, vaping, while considered safer than smoking, also produces some toxins in the aerosol that is exhaled, though at much lower levels than conventional smoking. Your husband wouldn\u2019t be totally out of line to limit vaping to ventilated bedrooms or outdoors. Still, I\u2019m picturing lovely views and everyone happy (and chill) at your first holiday in the mountains.My dog walker will be taking care of my dog and staying at my apartment while I\u2019m away after the holidays. She has done this before, and I am grateful for her service. She takes excellent care of my dog. The issue: the mess she leaves behind (dishes in the sink, etc.). I pay her, and I would like her to leave the place cleaner. How can I raise this without offending her?ANONYMOUSLet me be the first to agree that asking your dog sitter to run the dishwasher or leave the living room looking as if a cyclone had not torn through it is totally reasonable. Let me also remind you that finding someone you trust enough to stay in your home and care for your dog is no mean feat.Don\u2019t ruin future vacations for yourself by mistaking your dog sitter for a housekeeper. They both work in your home, but you wouldn\u2019t ask your mechanic to drive you on errands, right? Feel free to say, \u201cCan you make sure the food is stowed and the dishes are clean? And please empty the trash.\u201d But don\u2019t expect her to clean the place (unless you hired her as a dog sitter-slash-downstairs maid). Hire someone else for that.Every year, I host a holiday party for my extended family. One of my cousins does not speak to his mother. I invite them both. My aunt comes, and my cousin bows out. If I had to choose, I would prefer my cousin to attend. But the only way to ensure this result is not to invite my aunt. I wish I weren\u2019t in this awkward position. But may I leave her off the guest list?ANONYMOUSStop right there! You will not wade into these treacherous waters on my watch. As hosts, we invite people we like (or feel obliged to include). But they decide whether to attend. Do not embroil yourself in this mother-son feud or exclude your aunt from a family party. (Who knows if your cousin would come even if his mother weren\u2019t invited?) If you want to see him, invite him to dinner.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Robots Have Descended on Trump Country", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey are leaving many \u2018casualties of history\u2019 in their wake.Mr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.The growing use of work robots and the deployment of artificial intelligence have been most disruptive in just those areas of the country that provided President Trump with crucial margins of support in 2016.These job losses are concentratedin blue collar occupations such as machinists, assemblers, material handlers and welders. Workers in these occupations engage in tasks that are being automated by industrial robots, so it is natural for them to experience the bulk of the displacement effect created by this technology.The adverse effects of automation fall disproportionately on the voters who cast most of their ballots for Trump in 2016: White men, much more than women, and whites without college degrees.The Trump tax bill permits \u201cU.S. corporations to expense their capital investment, through 2022. So, if a U.S. corporation buys a robot for $100 thousand, it can deduct the $100 thousand immediately to calculate its U.S. taxable income, rather than recover the $100 thousand over the life of the robot, as under prior law,\u201d Steven M. Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute and a specialist in tax policy, wrote me by email.In an email, David Autor, who is also an economist at M.I.T., explained the situation:We find that automation displaces employment and reduces labor\u2019s share of value-added in the industries in which it originates. In the case of employment, these own-industry losses are reversed by indirect gains in customer industries and induced increases in aggregate demand.Overall, according to Autor,employment is growing steadily, and its growth in terms of number of jobs has not been discernibly dented by technological progress. But the sum of wage payments to workers is growing more slowly than economic value-added, so labor\u2019s share of the pie of net earnings is falling. This doesn\u2019t mean that wages are falling. It means that they are not growing in lock step with value-added.Automation and productivity improvements, Autor wrote, tend to grow the economic pie in aggregate while simultaneously considerably diminishing some slices and yet expanding others\u2019 dramatically. Most new workplace technologies displace some worker tasks and entire jobs, devalue certain skills, and disrupt livelihoods. This is individually and socially costly and politically disruptive.The experience of immiseration came upon them in a hundred different forms; for the field laborer, the loss of his common rights and the vestiges of village democracy; for the artisan, the loss of his craftsman\u2019s status; for the weaver, the loss of livelihood and of independence; for the child, the loss of work and play in the home; for many groups of workers whose real earnings improved, the loss of security, leisure and the deterioration of the urban environment.While there are parallels between conditions of workers during industrialization in England and during the deindustrialization of regions of this country now, one big difference stands out from a political vantage point: In England, workers turned sharply to the left while here they have moved sharply to the right.Autor identified a contemporary source of discontent. He noted that even if automation creates \u201can opportunity for every citizen to gain in theory,\u201d thatwill almost never happen without forceful social policy and tax policy that spreads the gains and buffers the individual losses. Absent those policies (which the U.S. has little of in general, and even less so today than in earlier decades), losses will tend to be highly concentrated among displaced workers and in communities in which legacy employers are located.The major concern for the labor market in the United States, Autor wrote, is not the number of jobs per se, but the decline in labor\u2019s share of value-added and, even more urgently, the steep falls in earnings among less-educated workers, which certainly have a technological origin.Last but not least, the development and adoption of productivity-enhancing AI technologies cannot be taken for granted. If we do not find a way of creating shared prosperity from the productivity gains generated by AI, there is a danger that the political reaction to these new technologies may slow down or even completely stop their adoption and development. This underscores the importance of studying the distributional implications of AI, the political economy reactions to it, and the design of new and improved institutions for creating more broadly shared gains from these new technologies.Acemoglu and Restrepo agree with Autor thatgreater use of robots in a commuting zone is likely to generate benefits for the rest of the U.S. economy by reducing the prices of tradable goods now produced using robots and by creating shared capital gains.But Acemoglu and Restrepo contend that even after calculating \u201cthese positive spillovers across commuting zones,\u201d there are still \u201cuniformly negative aggregate effects.\u201dTheir calculations suggest that one more robot per thousand workers reduces aggregate employment-to-population ratio by about 0.2 percentage points or, equivalently, one new robot reduces employment by about 3.3 workers and wages by about 0.37 percent (as opposed to 0.37 percentage points and 0.71 percent, respectively, without trade).I asked Acemoglu whether these findings challenge the economic argument that technological advance is almost always beneficial. He replied:It does challenge the conventional wisdom to some degree. But this conventional wisdom is really up for challenge. The view that technological change always and everywhere benefits most groups is completely devoid of historical context. This isn\u2019t what has happened in history, this isn\u2019t what has happened in the early 20th century.He cited key developments in the late 1890s and early 1990s:During mechanization of agriculture, we have also experienced rapid creation of new jobs and tasks in industry, both for production workers and for clerical workers. If it weren\u2019t for these other changes, many of them technological and social in nature, mechanization of agriculture would have created much more hardship (and today we tend to forget how much hardship it did create in the first place).Acemoglu, Restrepo and Autor are not alone in exploring the economic and political consequences of robotics and artificial intelligence.Until now, automation (robotics, machines more generally, smart systems) has mostly replaced activities that require brawn (agriculture, mining, lifting, warehousing) repetitive physical activity (assembly line, cutting/sowing), basic data management (ledgers, various logistics), while being complementary with complex management, human judgment, highly contextual activities.The demographic group most hindered by the rise of automation, Sachs wrote, \u201chas been the proverbial white male with less than a college degree and living in rural and semirural areas.\u201dSachs believes thatthe next wave of job losses will be in basic business services (wholesale and retail trade, warehousing and transport) which will mean another hit for workers with relatively lower educational attainment.In terms of incomes, according to Sachs, \u201cautomation (including AI) will raise overall output but lower the earnings of some or even all workers, while raising the returns to many forms of capital.\u201dWithout the adoption of redistributive tax and spending policies, he argued,the old, the skilled, and the rich (who will make intergenerational transfers within families to their own children) will benefit at the expense of the young, the less skilled, and the poor. All of this seems to be underway.Jason Furman, a professor of economics at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School who served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Obama administration, writing with Robert Seamans, a professor of management at N.Y.U., has a broader view of the positive and negative effects of automation and artificial intelligence.Both the upside and the downside of artificial intelligence, Furman and Seamans point out, have \u201cthe potential to dramatically change the economy,\u201d adding thatOn the one hand, the potential for increased productivity growth is welcome given the decades-long slowing in productivity growth in the United States and other advanced economies. On the other hand, the potential for AI-induced labor disruptions could potentially exacerbate existing problems in the labor force, including the decades-long decline in male labor force participation rate.Andrew K. Shotwell, a local attorney, told the County Board that opioid use is increasing and that \u201cOntonagon in the top 10 for that in the state of Michigan.\u201d The Gazette reported that prescriptions \u201crose from 65.6 per 100 people in the county in 2009 to 113 in 2016, more than the number of people.\u201dE.P. Thompson, looking at 19th century England, put the plight of similarly technologically displaced people best:Their crafts and traditions may have been dying. Their hostility to the new industrialism may have been backward looking. Their communitarian ideals may have been fantasies. Their insurrectionary conspiracies may have been foolhardy. But they lived through these times of acute social disturbance, and we did not. Their aspirations were valid in terms of their own experience.Ontonagon County is at an extreme, but at the extreme, it illuminates the bleak dislocation much of Trump country has suffered.Per capita retail sales, a measure of economic vitality, were $7,550 last year in the county, according to the census, compared with $13,443 nationally.These are men and women, to quote E.P. Thompson again, who \u201clived through these times of acute social disturbance.\u201d If, Thompson continued, \u201cthey were casualties of history, they remain, condemned in their own lives, as casualties.\u201dis clearly bad. The median American household earns less than it did fifteen years ago, labor\u2019s share of national income peaked in the early 1980s and has been falling pretty steadily since then, long-term unemployment has emerged as a vexing problem, and start-ups are creating many fewer jobs than they used to.high-skilled workers have moved down the occupational ladder, taking on jobs traditionally performed by low-skilled workers, pushing low-skilled workers even further down the occupational ladder and, to some extent, even out of the labor force.I would argue that we have been warned \u2014 the situation that obtains in the country today has to be grasped with the head as much as with the gut.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Married Couple Arrested Over Drone Incursions at Gatwick Airport", "Date": "2018-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHenry Smith, a member of Parliament whose constituency includes Gatwick Airport, said that law enforcement officials identified the two as Paul Gait, 47, and his wife Elaine Kirk, 54. Local police officials said they had detained a man and a woman of the same ages on Friday night, but they did not name them. They are from Crawley, a town just south of the airport.The incident exposed the vulnerabilities of the airport to outside interference and drew attention to the limitations of security officials responding to such a threat at a peak travel time. Gatwick is Britain\u2019s second-largest air travel hub.On Thursday, Assistant Chief Constable Steve Barry of the Sussex police where the airport is located, said the drones appeared to be a \u201cdeliberate act to endanger the airfield and aircraft.\u201d But the police said this did not appear to be linked to terrorism.The drone sightings had forced the cancellation or diversion of more than 1,000 flights over three days, affecting some 140,000 people, officials said. On Saturday, Gatwick warned passengers to expect still more delays and cancellations and to check their flight status before going to the airport.Posts on Mr. Gait\u2019s Facebook page suggest he is a drone hobbyist, and they include several photos of remote controlled helicopters. Mr. Smith, the member of Parliament, said that information raised the prospect that someone who flew drones for fun was able to breach the airport\u2019s security and ground flights for more than 24 hours. But he cautioned that Mr. Gait and Ms. Kirk were still only suspects at this point.\u201cThe fact that with only a limited degree of sophistication, with what seems to be a relatively amateur attack, someone was able to take out a major piece of national infrastructure is a major concern,\u201d Mr. Smith said.\u201cWhat it increasingly appears to be is hobbyists who for whatever reason decided it would be a smart thing to do to disrupt a major piece of transport,\u201d Mr. Smith said.He said he had raised concerns in Parliament as far back as 18 months ago about drone security at Gatwick. Mr. Smith said the airport had an electronic fence, but that it could easily be circumvented by a drone operator.\u201cWhile some measures have come,\u201d he said, \u201cI would argue not enough, and not swiftly enough either.\u201dThe chaos also drew scrutiny of Britain\u2019s policy on the growing number of drone users in the country, which has been slow to adopt a drone registry, analysts say. The United States Federal Aviation Administration has required drone operators to register since 2015. In Britain, the authorities will begin similar registrations in November of next year.British elected leaders said the government could also do more to restrict drones near airports, widening the no-fly zone, which is now one kilometer, or three-fifths of a mile.The first drone sighting was around 9 p.m. on Wednesday and within 48 hours, the runway had been buzzed more than 40 times, forcing officials to shut down and reopen the airport several times. It was unclear whether more than one drone was involved.Officials scrambled to find solutions and even considered using police sharpshooters to bring down the devices, but that was deemed too dangerous. By Thursday night, the British armed forces were called in to secure the airspace.After the arrests, the police said they would \u201ccontinue to build resilience to detect and mitigate further incursions from drones,\u201d but did not specify what those measures might be.The disruption at Gatwick rippled around the world, with passengers forced to find accommodation or wait in long lines to know if they would be able to fly home for the holidays.Britain\u2019s transport secretary, Chris Grayling, acknowledged that the government needed to speed up its response.\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to learn very quickly from what\u2019s happened,\u201d he said in an interview with the BBC on Friday.Still, the government\u2019s handling of the episode has drawn intense criticism.Richard Dannatt, a member of the House of Lords and a former head of the British Army, called it a \u201cnational embarrassment\u201d in a Saturday morning interview with the London radio station LBC.\u201cWe have a range of capabilities that can go a long way to observing, detecting, jamming the frequency,\u201d Lord Dannatt said, before noting that the military could also have shot down the device. \u201cThere really isn\u2019t a reason why we should not have identified and shot these down a few days ago.\u201dMegan Specia contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

Not a \u201crubbish heap of history,\u201d or a precious junkyard of antiquities, but an actual garbage dump. Supported byStepping outside Termini station, the gateway to Rome for many visitors, my tour guide asked me what I saw.\u201cGraffiti?\u201d I said. \u201cTrash?\u201d\u201cExactly,\u201d he said. \u201cA Roman would not see this. The Roman is so beaten down by the filth in which he lives that he can no longer recognize or see the sad state of the city.\u201dWe went up to the Giardinetto del Monte Oppio, a small garden offering one of the most breathtaking views in the Western world, smack in front of the Colosseum. A Brazilian couple used the backdrop for pictures, but out of frame, and off their Instagram feed, was the Rome that tourists often choose not to see: Empty beer bottles, cigarette packs, stained paper towels, soiled clothes and littered food were spread around like some grotesque picnic. Illegal souvenir sellers stashed their blue plastic bags full of tchotchkes in the tree limbs before ducking into bushes that they used as toilets. In the neighborhoods around us, sidewalks were cluttered with soaked mattresses, refrigerators and armchairs. Garbage trucks covered in graffiti moved past walls scrawled with the city\u2019s lament: \u201cRoma Guasta\u201d or \u201cBroken Rome.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s so much worse because the city is so stunning,\u201d said Mr. Tonelli, who added, with resignation, \u201cfrom three meters up, it is still the most beautiful city in the world.\u201dRome is in danger of becoming a dump. I don\u2019t mean the rubbish heap of history, which is how the poet Petrarch envisioned the city in the 14th century. I don\u2019t mean a precious junkyard of alfresco antiquities, Renaissance gems and Baroque treasures. I mean a dump.None of this is a secret. Il Messaggero, the Roman daily, may as well be called the Garbage Gazette, dedicating itself to documenting the city\u2019s decline. (\u201cNo Heat in the Schools;\u201d \u201cFew and Broken Benches: Everyone Standing in the Park.\u201d) All of which would lead some students of history to ask, \u2018So, what else is new?\u2019 Exempting its glorious high points, Rome is no stranger to languishing in backwardness. Pope Gregory XVI once rejected streetlights as the devil\u2019s work and centuries of papal, noble or politically corrupt misrule kept the city in the dark. Trash is not a new problem either. A 1752 order by the \u201cIllustrious and Reverend Monsignor\u201d overseeing roads is still inscribed in the wall by Piazza Farnese, prohibiting dumping \u201cin this site and place, garbage of any kind, or of creating a garbage dump, under penalty of 25 scudi for every offense.\u201dRight about here seems like a good place, in the interests of fairness, accuracy and self-preservation (I can see the furious Rome romantics reaching for their Dolce Vita-brand pitchforks) to issue the requisite \u201cRome is Spectacular\u201d caveat. And it is.Often the target of their ire, and not without reason, is the embattled mayor, Virginia Raggi. La Raggi, they call her. They say it like Seinfeld said Newman. Like bad guys say Bond. As in a comic book\u2019s premise, Mr. Tonelli, 40, attended middle and high school with Ms. Raggi. I asked if they were friends. He told me she is suing him for defamation, in a class-action lawsuit joined by more than 25 members of her Five Star Movement party.When I sat with Ms. Raggi before she took office in 2016, she talked a lot about recycling and finding a way to wrap Roman babies in more ecological diapers. Instead she has faced the mother of all garbage emergencies. Her administration blames the \u201cunderworld\u201d for hampering its attempts to clean the streets, and said it suspects more foul play behind the burning this month of a garbage treatment center that handles a fifth of Rome\u2019s trash. The acrid air choked the city and an ominous black cloud spread over the mayor\u2019s new hope: plastic garbage bins. Introduced for door-to-door pickup, they line city streets like stout sentries. The other day, the owner of a stationery store on my block inspected one as if it were the monolith in \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey.\u201dThe idea of Romanization, or the civilization of barbarians, dates back to ancient times. Romans impressed their customs and laws on the conquered territories and on the foreigners who came to the Caput Mundi. Italian politicians still whisper that they hope that the wild populists governing the country will be Romanized by the conformist establishment.It didn\u2019t take long for my wife, who was largely raised in Rome, to go native again. Once proudly parking the car between a dumpster and the curb, she looked at my disapproving expression and answered, as she does every time, \u201cOf course it\u2019s a spot. It\u2019s not my fault they have no spaces.\u201d (Last Christmas day, when there were no parking spots in front of her aunt\u2019s apartment, her father rolled onto the sidewalk \u2014 under a sign for a bus stop.)The disregard for public space is infectious. I feel the etiquette fall off me as I merge into traffic or skip the line. Rome exalts the furbo, or clever, and pities the fesso, or fool. Your house better be clean, your clothes ironed, but only a sucker would sweep the sidewalk.When not behind the wheel, my wife is part of the solution. She has volunteered with our kids to pick up trash at Villa Sciarra, the park by our house. Once venerated for its strutting peacocks and elegant statues and corridors lined with palm trees, Villa Sciarra has fallen into ruin. Bugs and abandonment have reduced the palms to rows of stumps. Vandals have broken the heads and limbs off the statues. Vagrants bed down amid taped-off branches at night.On a recent afternoon, we celebrated the inauguration of a new padded mat under the playground, installed, after more than a year of delays, with private funds and donations.\u201cThis villa was marvelous, but it has fallen into the gravest disrepair,\u201d Federico Morolla, 60, a leader of the Friends of Villa Sciarra said, paraphrasing every Roman resident everywhere. \u201cWe citizens cannot stand by and accept this.\u201dHe said he began to think the unthinkable: civic engagement. He persevered over the official bureaucracy, which he said discourages volunteers. \u201cWith a lot of commitment you can do something,\u201d he said.To celebrate, his group had arranged entertainment for the children. Despite brisk winds, they hired a fire eater. With a Bic lighter, he ignited one end of what looked like an enormous Q-tip. But he struggled with the other, and as he did, the burning end dripped embers onto the new padding and sent volunteers scrambling to stamp out the flames.\u201cWhy is he ruining the playground?\u201d my daughter asked.Rome, it appears, won\u2019t be rebuilt in a day.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Comes After the Merkel Era?", "Date": "2018-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA new leader for Germany\u2019s conservatives also brings a new era in German politics.Contributing Opinion WriterBERLIN \u2014 On Friday Germany\u2019s Christian Democratic Union, meeting in Hamburg, elected Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer to succeed Angela Merkel as the center-right party\u2019s leader. Given the party\u2019s dominant \u2014 if recently weakened \u2014 position in German politics, Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer will also succeed Ms. Merkel as chancellor by 2021 at the latest.Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer \u2014 or AKK, as she is often called, because even German tongues stumble over that name \u2014 won in a tight race against two other candidates: Friedrich Merz, who returned to the political stage after a decade of absence, and the youthful conservative minister of health, Jens Spahn. Neither of AKK\u2019s contenders would have radically changed Germany\u2019s role in Europe or the world; nor will she. She won\u2019t change the face of German conservatism, either. And yet, Friday felt like a new beginning, for the party and for the country. The past weeks of intense campaigning by the three conservatives demonstrated both the possibilities and limits of creating a new identity for a big-tent conservative party in a world haunted by right-wing populism and fractured political systems. \u201cWe are the last unicorn in Europe,\u201d Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer said in a speech on Friday before her election, by which she meant: The Christian Democratic Union is one of the world\u2019s last big-tent parties that can still live up to the name. How true.Often, especially on foreign policy, the three candidates sounded similar notes. Against the backdrop of renewed tensions between Russia and Ukraine, all three expressed a resigned antipathy toward Nord Stream 2, a gas pipeline in the making that will transport Russian gas through the Baltic Sea (not a good idea, but probably no longer stoppable). All three pledged to strengthen the European Union and to work on a good trans-Atlantic relationship. But much of the talk on the campaign trail focused inward. For weeks, the candidates toured the country, speaking with the party\u2019s base. All three tried to distinguish themselves from one another, but they also sought, collectively, to distinguish the Christian Democrats from the Green Party and the center-left Social Democratic Party, and to find a way to counter the right-wing populist Alternative for Germany party.In 2018, Germany\u2019s conservatives learned the hard way that copying the populists doesn\u2019t work. Their Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, tried all year to look tougher on migration than the populists, a strategy that resulted in major losses in the Bavarian state elections in October. The party needed something new. The buzzword of the past weeks was \u201cconservative renewal,\u201d a version of which became the closing theme of all three candidates. They each meant, in their own way, a return to the conservative values that once unified the party and spoke to a large swath of the German public.But what is conservative in 2018? It is ironic that under the leadership of Germany\u2019s most powerful post-reunification conservative, the country has become deeply, irreversibly progressive. And so even as the three candidates spouted \u201cconservative renewal,\u201d they made telling concessions. Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer, for example, still touted her personal opposition to marriage equality \u2014 a reality in Germany \u2014 but admitted it could not be reversed. They all spoke to the need for a stronger army, a message that resonated at regional party conventions; but what that means in practice is unclear, since it has been seven years since Ms. Merkel suspended mandatory military service. At one point, Mr. Merz challenged the viability of Germany\u2019s generous asylum laws in a borderless Europe \u2014 a common refrain that means little in the face of a set of European and international rules that will keep those laws on the books.Germany\u2019s conservatives, no matter how renewed they become, won\u2019t be able to escape liberalism, secularization and globalization. The great conservative narrative of preserving traditional values and institutions is no longer tenable. They will have to work on conveying distinctive nuances instead: Marriage for all, yes, but no to adoptions by same-sex-couples. No return to mandatory military service, but mandatory Civil Service for all. Yes to migration and asylum in general, but harder rules for migrants who commit crimes.Given the weakness of the Social Democrats, currently the junior partners in a grand coalition with the Christian Democrats, it seems unlikely that the country will wait until 2021 to hold new elections. Such elections, though, are unlikely to change the political landscape significantly \u2014 perhaps a few more seats for the Greens, who are on a polling upswing, and the Christian Democrats, who might steal back some seats from the Alternative for Germany party, which would no longer have Ms. Merkel and her open-border record as a boogeyman. But the reality will remain: Instead of two dominant political parties in the Bundestag, charting two sides of the political spectrum, Germany will likely have six, some bigger than others, but all staking out their own corners in a much more complicated landscape. Such landscapes don\u2019t offer much room for big tents.So why does this feel like a new day? After several weeks of failed attempts at creating a new narrative, this is a chance for Germany\u2019s conservatives, and the country as a whole, to come to terms with this new reality. If Ms. Merkel was the last chancellor of the mass-party era, Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer could be the first to lead a government defined by the complexities of true coalition politics. The previous era was brought to an end by polarization; the new one will require good leadership to bring enough parties together to lead a government \u2014 leaders like Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer.Advertisement"}

The median age is 43, seven years older than city dwellers. Its productivity, defined as output per worker, is lower than urban America\u2019s. Its families have lower incomes. And its share of the population is shrinking: the United States has grown by 75 million people since 1990, but this has mostly occurred in cities and suburbs. Rural areas have lost some 3 million people. Since the 1990s, problems such as crime and opioid abuse, once associated with urban areas, are increasingly rural phenomena.These days, economic growth bypasses rural economies. In the first four years of the recovery after the 2008 recession, counties with fewer than 100,000 people lost 17,500 businesses, according to the Economic Innovation Group. By contrast, counties with more than 1 million residents added, altogether, 99,000 firms. By 2017, the largest metropolitan areas had almost 10 percent more jobs than they did at the start of the financial crisis. Rural areas still had fewer.I\u2019ve lived most of my life in big cities. I don\u2019t pretend to understand what it\u2019s like to live in a small town or on a family farm, or how it feels when all the jobs in a community seem to be fading away. I do spend a lot of time thinking about how the economic changes of the last several decades have undercut many American workers. One thing seems clear to me: nobody \u2014 not experts or policymakers or people in these communities \u2014 seems to know quite how to pick rural America up.There are 1,888 counties in America in which more than half the population is rural, according to the Census Bureau, and they stretch from coast to coast.New York County, N.Y.73,475 people per square milePopulation density by countySan Francisco County, Calif.Urban countiesRural counties18,871 people per square mileLexington City, Va.2,843 people per square mileSource: Brookings analysis of Census Bureau dataPopulation density by countyUrban countiesRural countiesNew York County, N.Y.73,475 people per square mileSan Francisco County, Calif.18,871 people per square mileLexington City, Va.2,843 people per square mileSource: Brookings analysis of Census Bureau dataPopulation density by countyUrban countiesRural countiesNew York County, N.Y.73,475 people per square mileSan Francisco County, Calif.18,871 people per square mileLexington City, Va.2,843 people per square mileSource: Brookings analysis of Census Bureau dataIn Comanche County, a land of cattle, farming, oil and gas on the plains of southwestern Kansas, 1,790 people live in a sparsely settled area of nearly 800 square miles. In Perry County \u2014 home to some 26,500 people in the Appalachian Mountains of Eastern Kentucky \u2014 so far no other industry has replaced once-mighty coal. Essex County in New York\u2019s Adirondacks is three-quarters rural, by the census definition. So is Calaveras County in California.After World War II, small town prosperity relied on its contribution to the industrial economy. The census considers Price County, Wis., to be 100 percent rural. Still, over a third of the jobs there are in manufacturing, from building industrial machines to assembling trucks. Auto parts manufacturers in West Point, Ga., draw workers from all over Troup County. Overall, manufacturing employs about one in eight workers in the country\u2019s 704 entirely rural counties. That\u2019s more than agriculture, forestry, fishing and mining combined and second only to education, health care and social assistance, which includes teachers, doctors, nurses and social service counselors. Most of those jobs are government funded.But factory jobs can no longer keep small-town America afloat. Even after a robust eight-year growth spell, there are fewer than 13 million workers in manufacturing across the entire economy. Robots and workers in China put together most of the manufactured goods that Americans buy, and the high-tech industries powering the economy today don\u2019t have much need for the cheap labor that rural communities contributed to America\u2019s industrial past. They mostly need highly educated workers. They find those most easily in big cities, not in small towns.Consider Lake County, in Tennessee. Some 7,500 people live there, about 500 fewer than in 2000. Lake County is betting on a new industrial park on Cates Landing on the Mississippi River. But it will be tough to reverse years of declining employment. Between 2013 and 2017, the county averaged fewer than 250 manufacturing jobs, according to the Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey. That\u2019s half as many as it had in 2000.Wisely, they suggest that any federal government effort must choose its targets carefully. Better to focus on middle-sized places that are near big tech hubs and have some critical infrastructure, rather than scatter assistance all over the landscape.Share of digital and technology jobs by countyUrban countiesRural counties1 million+ people<50K people not adjacent to metro areaKing County, Wash.15%Fairfax County, Va.27%Osceola County, Mich.10%Source: Brookings analysis of Emsi dataShare of digital and technology jobs by countyUrban countiesRural counties1 million+ people<50K people not adjacent to metro areaOsceola County, Mich.10%Fairfax County, Va.27%King County, Wash.15%Source: Brookings analysis of Emsi dataShare of digital and technology jobs by countyUrban countiesRural counties1 million+ people<50K people not adjacent to metro areaFairfax County, King County, Source: Brookings analysis of Emsi dataSound as these ideas may be, however, even the authors concede that they may not be up to the task. \u201cI don\u2019t know if these ideas are going to work,\u201d Mr. Galston acknowledged when I pressed him on the issue. \u201cBut it is worth making the effort.\u201dThis is the inescapable reality of agglomeration, one of the most powerful forces shaping the American economy over the last three decades. Innovative companies choose to locate where other successful, innovative companies are. That\u2019s where they can find lots of highly skilled workers. The more densely packed these pools of talent are, the more workers can learn from each other and the more productive they become. This dynamic feeds on itself, drawing more high-tech firms and highly skilled workers to where they already are.\u201cWe have a spatial reorganization of the economy,\u201d said Mr. Muro. \u201cWe have an archipelago of superstars in an ocean of low-productivity sectors.\u201dAfter examining a range of potential policy interventions, they conclude that a targeted employment subsidy, such as the earned-income tax credit, is probably the most powerful tool available to revive employment. But they, too, are not sure it will work. \u201cOur call for a wage subsidy is us saying, \u2018We can\u2019t figure this out, and we hope the private sector will,\u2019\u2009\u201d Mr. Glaeser told me.There are, to be sure, some rural communities with productivity as high as some big cities. But they rely on heavily mechanized and automated industries that support few jobs: oil extraction or large-scale agriculture, in which tractors talk to satellites and no drivers are involved. The livestock business on the vast pastures of Sioux County, Neb., for example, supports an economy worth $306,000 per worker, according to data from Mr. Muro and Jacob Whiton of Brookings. But only 1,200 people live there.In the Southeast Fairbanks area of Alaska, it is all about oil and gas. Output per worker is $203,000. But its population doesn\u2019t quite reach 7,000.Excluding these places, the United States is still left with 50 to 55 million people living in rural communities that no longer have much to offer them economically.What if nothing really works? Is there really no option but to do nothing and, as some have suggested, return depopulated parts of rural America to the bison?Instead of so-called place-based policies to revitalize small towns, why not help their residents take advantage of opportunities where the opportunities are? Geographic mobility hit a historical low in 2017, when only 11 percent of Americans picked up shop and moved \u2014 half the rate of 1951. One of the key reasons is that housing in the prosperous cities that offer the most opportunities has become too expensive.The most helpful policy for people in small towns could be to relax zoning rules in dense cities like New York and San Francisco, so that more affordable housing could be built to receive newcomers from rural Wisconsin or Kentucky, and they wouldn\u2019t need the income of an investment banker or a computer scientist to afford to live there.Still, there are compelling reasons to try to help rural economies rebound. Even if moving people might prove more efficient on paper than restoring places, many people \u2014 especially older people and the family members who care for them \u2014 may choose to remain in rural areas. What\u2019s more, the costs of rural poverty are looming over American society. Think of the opioid addiction taking over rural America, of the spike in crime, of the wasted human resources in places where only a third of adults hold a job.And if today\u2019s polarized politics are noxious, what might they look like in a country perpetually divided between diverse, prosperous liberal cities and a largely white rural America in decline? As Mr. Galston warned: \u201cThink through the political consequences of saying to a substantial portion of Americans, which is even more substantial in political terms, \u2018We think you\u2019re toast.\u2019\u2009\u201dThe distress of 50 million Americans should concern everyone. Powerful economic forces are arrayed against rural America and, so far, efforts to turn it around have failed. Not every small town can be a tech hub, nor should it be. But that can\u2019t be the only answer.An earlier version of a map showing population density by county omitted New York County, which covers Manhattan.Advertisement"}

As our mother steered us out of the parking garage, the lot attendant waved her payment away. He was from Ethiopia and assumed she was too. He complimented her on what a great mother she must be \u2014 our windows had been rolled up, so he hadn\u2019t heard the yelling.I don\u2019t look like my mother. When I was younger and people asked, \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d they usually wanted confirmation of my West Indian heritage. \u201cMy dad is from Barbados,\u201d is how I usually answered the question of why I had the face I had.\u201cWhere are you from?\u201d is a question we sometimes think we can find an answer to with DNA. One of my first jobs out of college was coordinating a community African-American genealogical class in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. It was run by a married couple from New Jersey, a former police officer and a former private investigator who dedicated their retirement to black genealogy. They had said in the class that DNA testing was a tricky thing for black people trying to trace their past. If you have African ancestry, it becomes even trickier. The African slave trade to the United States ended, with some exceptions, more than 170 years ago. If you are matching your DNA to a database of African populations you are usually comparing yourself with present-day population samples, not the DNA of someone who may have lived in that area 170 or even 200 or 400 years before. Also, there is more genetic variation among African people than among Europeans, yet much of the information in the most popular commercial DNA databases contains only a fraction of the full African DNA spectrum. A DNA test would not reveal any of this history. It would not tell me anything about one of the enduring stories in my family, that my great-grandfather helped to found schools for his people at the turn of the last century and was forced to leave North Carolina when his entire town was burned to the ground, presumably by people who disliked the town\u2019s organizing.He came north. He went to Dartmouth College. He studied there in the early 1900s, amid the rise of eugenics movements. He was with a handful of other black students. One of them, lighter-skinned, remembered him only as \u201cthat little black man.\u201d His skin was the darkest of all of them. When he graduated from Dartmouth, he was still listed in the New Hampshire census as a popcorn seller.Many northern white universities would not hire a black English professor in 1910. He left his family to travel the South for decades, teaching at black colleges. He created my grandmother, one of the strongest, most-loving, smartest women I ever knew. I was terrified of her for most of my life.She moved to an all-white suburb of Boston at the start of the 1950s to make sure that her children had access to a good education. She worked for years as an administrative assistant at Harvard University and opened her doors to international students in the Boston area every Thanksgiving. She, too, had a school \u2014 an informal one she ran for my mother and her siblings during the summer so that they could be twice as good as everyone else once they got to school in the fall.If I were to have a child now, its DNA would not contain any trace of any of this story and would certainly not act as evidence to support it. I would, perhaps, look to see whether it loved books and education as much as its maternal ancestors did. But DNA would not reveal whether a child I had now would have the fortitude to survive the world it would be born into.The morning after the 2016 election, overwhelmed with what felt like the inescapable pull of history and biology, I told my mother: \u201cI guess this means I\u2019m never having children. I can\u2019t imagine giving birth to a child under Trump, and in four years it will be too late for me.\u201dShe wrote me back to tell me she loved me with all her heart and to assure me that she never regretted having any of us. She reminded me that black and biracial babies will always be born, no matter who is president. \u201cMaybe the child would grow into someone who carries on this legacy of finding a way to make a difference in the world,\u201d she wrote.My mother understood what I was grappling with, and said: \u201cI do not wish you had been born in another skin or body, as painful as being a person of color can be. There is also great pride, great joy and an inner strength that can feel the pain and rise through it.\u201d She continued: \u201cWe will survive this through our strength as a family and as a people. We each have to reconcile it for ourselves, but we will.\u201dI think about what people are looking for when they talk about ancestry. When they take a DNA test, is it this history they are hoping to find, or an alternative to what we know of the past?Isn\u2019t that an echo of what we are looking for when we try to determine which tribe in West Africa we may have come from, which kin group we might claim? Sometimes we\u2019re looking in our blood for a map from our ancestors, when it has always been here, in how we talk to and love one another.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Blocks Netanyahu\u2019s Son, Saying His Posts \u2018Included Hate Speech\u2019", "Date": "2018-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 In a Facebook post a few days ago, one of the Israeli prime minister\u2019s sons said he hoped the deaths of two Israeli soldiers killed by a Palestinian gunman in the West Bank would be \u201cavenged\u201d and said, \u201cThere will never be peace with the monsters in human form known since 1964 as \u2018Palestinians.\u2019\u201dIn other posts, Yair Netanyahu, the older son of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said he would prefer an Israel without any Muslims and mused that no attacks occurred \u201cin Iceland and Japan where coincidentally there are no Muslims.\u201dSo he took to Twitter.There he reposted a diatribe he had written against Facebook, describing it as \u201cthought police\u201d and protesting that it hosted \u201cendless pages that call for the destruction of Israel and the murder of Jews.\u201dIsrael\u2019s first son, often in the headlines, is hardly new to controversy or vitriol and has long espoused hard-right views on social media. But his blunt online presence is increasingly raising questions in Israel about the blurred lines between the public and private personas of what some cynics refer to as Israel\u2019s royal family, which has reigned over Israel continually for almost a decade.\u201cOf course he\u2019s not a private person; he is being paid for by the Israeli taxpayers,\u201d Tal Schneider, the political and diplomatic correspondent for Globes, an Israeli financial newspaper, said in an interview.Ms. Schneider noted that at age 27, Yair Netanyahu still lives with his parents, in the prime minister\u2019s official residence in Jerusalem, and is provided with a state-funded car and a secret service escort wherever he goes.\u201cHe\u2019s an adult,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like he\u2019s a child.\u201dSome Netanyahu critics have been waiting for the father to disavow his son\u2019s latest posts, something that has occasionally happened in the past. But there has been mounting speculation in the news media over whether the younger Netanyahu\u2019s posts may actually reflect his father\u2019s own sentiments. Some wonder what kind of values the son has soaked up at home and what sort of conversation might take place at the family\u2019s Friday night dinner table.\u201cThis is, I think, one of closest people to the prime minister,\u201d Ms. Schneider said. Whatever Yair Netanyahu says, she argued, may indicate what he\u2019s hearing at home, or conversely, what he\u2019s bringing home. \u201cIt goes in two directions,\u201d she said.One member of the panel, Nissim Douek, a strategic consultant, said many Israelis were \u201cdisgusted\u201d by Yair Netanyahu\u2019s extremist, divisive rhetoric.Aviv Bushinsky, a former media adviser to the prime minister, defended the Netanyahu family, pointing to wayward children of other veteran politicians. Mr. Bushinsky accused the prime minister\u2019s opponents of using Yair Netanyahu as a tool to batter his father. What \u201cthe child\u201d had to say, Mr. Bushinsky contended, was \u201cnot interesting and not relevant.\u201dThe Netanyahu family\u2019s spokesman declined to comment publicly on Yair Netanyahu\u2019s status or his spat with Facebook.Facebook said in a statement that it had removed his three posts as it would \u201cfor anyone posting similar content about any protected characteristic.\u201d Reposting the screenshot, the company said, \u201cis the same as writing the hate speech all over again. Facebook does not allow hate speech on the platform and will continue to enforce its policy.\u201dThe company rejected Yair Netanyahu\u2019s assertions that it was censoring his criticism of it.After a period of unemployment, the prime minister\u2019s son began working in recent months as the social media manager of Shurat HaDin, a law center that describes itself as \u201cutilizing court systems around the world to go on the legal offensive against Israel\u2019s enemies.\u201dThe latest controversy seems to have begun on Dec. 10, when Yair Netanyahu appeared in court to testify in a libel case he filed against a social activist who he says wrote false information about him on Facebook, and was heckled by protesters. Later that day, he wrote another provocative post on Facebook, calling all left-wing nonprofits \u201cfunded by foreign and hostile governments,\u201d politicians on the left and the liberal media \u201ctraitors.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hiring People With Disabilities Is Good Business", "Date": "2018-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bydisabilityMicrosoft, Bank of America and CVS are just a few big companies that profit from their proactive employment practices. Mr. Kennedy is a disability rights lawyer and a state senator in Connecticut. For years, companies have maintained low expectations about hiring people with disabilities. Most of these companies believed that employees with disabilities could not perform well in the workplace and that actively hiring them would drag company performance and profits down. Thankfully, over time, many employers have come to understand that these perceptions are untrue. And new research strongly suggests that the opposite \u2014 that hiring people with disabilities is good for business. A recent study has shown, for the first time, that companies that championed people with disabilities actually outperformed others \u2014 driving profitability and shareholder returns. Revenues were 28 percent higher, net income 200 percent higher, and profit margins 30 percent higher. Companies that improved internal practices for disability inclusion were also four times more likely to see higher total shareholder returns.What exactly are these exemplary companies doing?Well, Bank of America brought together 300 people with intellectual disabilities to create a support services team to manage fulfillment services and external client engagement. Microsoft built a successful disability hiring program specifically for people on the autism spectrum. The program, designed to attract talent, is a multiday, hands-on academy that gives candidates an opportunity to meet hiring managers and learn about the company as an employer of choice. And CVS Health refocused its training programs to capitalize on characteristics \u2014 creativity, problem-solving ability and loyalty \u2014 that people with disabilities often demonstrate.The new research identifies five common denominators among such organizations. First, they hire people with disabilities, ensuring that they\u2019re represented in the workplace. Second, they carry out practices that encourage and advance those employees. Third, they provide accessible tools and technologies, paired with a formal accommodations program. Fourth, they generate awareness through recruitment efforts, disability education programs and grass-roots-led initiatives. Fifth, they create empowering environments through mentoring and coaching initiatives.I lost my leg to bone cancer at age 12. Since then, I have fought, as a citizen, attorney and legislator, for the civil rights of people with disabilities. All of us deserve to be valued equally and provided the opportunity to participate fully in our society.I was brought up in the disability rights movement. My uncle, President John F. Kennedy, left an important legacy on this front. Influenced by his experiences with his sister, Rosemary, President Kennedy witnessed firsthand how differently she was treated \u2014 how often she was ignored and excluded. He became the first president to make equality and social justice for people with disabilities a priority for his administration.The last law that he signed before he died was the Community Mental Health Act, which called for an end to \u201ccustodial isolation\u201d and created America\u2019s network of community mental health centers. Congress has since passed more than 120 laws expanding disability rights, forever changing public attitudes.But it was only when I went to college in the 1970s that I came of age politically and really thought about the issue of disability rights. It happened after I heard Judith Heumann, a disability rights advocate who contracted polio as an infant, give a speech and call disability a civil rights issue. I\u2019d never heard that comparison before. I realized that millions of disabled people were unjustly being left out of daily life. Ms. Heumann inspired me to become an advocate myself.I committed myself to this cause because of people like Joseph Pabin. He graduated from college with a degree in computer science and a 3.5 grade point average, an impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that easily got him in the door for job interviews. But once he showed up, interviewers noticed his speech impediment and told him they doubted he could successfully interact with customers. Mr. Pabin looked for a full-time job for three years without finding one, and his self-esteem plummeted. Ultimately, he contacted Bender Consulting Services, a career placement company that recruits, screens and hires people with disabilities for professional positions with private sector and government employers. Highmark offered him a full-time position in information technology. He has thrived at the company, working directly with customers, for four years now.As we head into the new year, it\u2019s important to recognize how far we\u2019ve come. Twenty-eight years ago, the Americans With Disabilities Act was passed, prohibiting discrimination against individuals with disabilities. I still remember standing alongside my father in the Rose Garden watching President George H.W. Bush sign the bill into law, forever engraving it into his legacy.But when it comes to employment, a cornerstone of the American dream, we have failed to live up to the promise of this historic law. Many employers have yet to recognize that people with disabilities can contribute economically if sought out and accommodated. Americans with disabilities \u2014 a population of 50 million people, more than one in every five \u2014 still face numerous challenges in entering and participating in the work force.The United States labor market is at its strongest in decades, and possibly ever. But all too many people with disabilities remain without jobs. The Accenture analysis reveals this inspiring statistic: Hiring only 1 percent of the 10.7 million people with disabilities has the potential to boost the G.D.P. by an estimated $25 billion.As a New Year\u2019s resolution for corporate America, it\u2019s hard to do better than to pledge to hire people with disabilities. Yes, we can do it because it always feels good to do what\u2019s right. But now it turns out that reaching this next frontier for corporate social responsibility is also good business.Advertisement"}

In imposing tariffs, the United States has accused China of walling off markets, requiring American companies to share their advanced technology, stealing intellectual property through joint ventures, counterfeiting goods and outright theft in the form of cyberespionage.

But as he found out with Mexico, Canada and now China, trade is more than the sum of goods and services exchanged between nations. Instead, the clock is now ticking on the 90-day truce.

But he had an obligation to track how his money was spent, he said, and he promised to exercise more care in the future.The New York Times and The Washington Post reported last week that $100,000 from Mr. Hoffman was spent on a deceptive social media campaign to aid Doug Jones, the Democratic candidate, who barely defeated the Republican, Roy Moore.The money went to a small group of social media experts that included Jonathon Morgan, the chief executive of New Knowledge, a cybersecurity firm.They created a Facebook page intended to look like the work of conservative Alabamians, and used it to try to split Republicans and promote a conservative write-in candidate to take votes from Mr. Moore.They also used thousands of Twitter accounts to make it appear as if automated Russian bot accounts were following and supporting Mr. Moore, according to an internal report on the project. The apparent Russian support for Mr. Moore drew broad news media coverage.Democratic political strategists say the small Alabama operation \u2014 which accounts for a minuscule share of the $51 million spent in the contest \u2014 was carried out as a debate about tactics intensified within the party.Democrats had been shocked to learn of Russia\u2019s stealth influence campaign to damage Hillary Clinton and promote Donald J. Trump in the 2016 presidential race. But at least a few Democrats thought their party could not shun such tactics entirely if others were going to continue to use them.The Alabama operation is among the first examples to come to light of such underhanded methods on social media in American politics. But because such efforts are generally very easy to hide and very difficult to trace, it is possible that other instances have gone undetected.In 2017, through a fund called Investing in Us, Mr. Hoffman gave money to a small company, American Engagement Technologies. The company\u2019s leader, Mikey Dickerson, is a former Google employee who founded the United States Digital Service during the Obama administration to try to upgrade the federal government\u2019s use of technology. An associate of Mr. Hoffman\u2019s said that his total grant to American Engagement was $750,000, which also went toward other political races and social media research. Mr. Dickerson has declined to comment.American Engagement then passed $100,000 to Mr. Morgan and other researchers. Mr. Hoffman\u2019s statement says the money went to Mr. Morgan\u2019s company, New Knowledge, but Mr. Morgan said the Alabama project was carried out separately from the company.The revelations of and fallout from the operation are being closely watched. Some American political experts fear that the Russian influence campaign of 2016 could become a dangerous model for stateside politics, with dirty tricks on social media becoming common. Laws and regulations have not been updated to cope with such a threat.\u201cWe cannot permit dishonest campaign tactics to go unchecked in our democracy \u2014 no matter which side they purportedly help,\u201d Mr. Hoffman said in his statement.He has made no secret of his opposition to President Trump, and in 2016 he offered to donate $5 million to veterans\u2019 groups if Mr. Trump released his tax returns.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "New York City Can Protect Tenants Now ", "Date": "2018-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA package of bills would allow the city to fight harassment by landlords. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.Across New York City, landlords in fast-gentrifying neighborhoods, eager to bring in higher-paying renters, have driven out tenants by harassing them with dangerous and annoying renovations. Renters, tenant advocates, city officials and The Times have all documented the forced exodus of tenants from rent-stabilized apartments. That helps landlords glide through loopholes to get their buildings out of the rent-regulation system and onto the open market.Abusive landlords get away with this because of lax enforcement of weak laws. A package of bills before the City Council could change that by invigorating those regulations. The most crucial protection of the vanishing stock of affordable housing could come in January, when Democrats take over the State Senate. But these Council bills address what New York City can do on its own.Yet another bill would increase penalties for submitting false information to the city about planned construction in buildings, as some owners do to hide the extent of construction and disruption, avoiding restrictions and scrutiny from city agencies. To give this bill teeth, the mayor needs to direct his agencies to be more aggressive in recovering uncollected fines. There\u2019s also a bill to require landlords to grant access to city inspectors, which would make it easier for enforcement agencies to conduct oversight of building owners undertaking renovations.Some bills could be streamlined. But overall, they are necessary and deserve the support of Mayor Bill de Blasio and the Council. De Blasio administration officials have said they are broadly supportive of some of the bills, but not all. \u201cI don\u2019t think Rebny has been forceful enough in saying this, but to the extent there are bad actors out there, we should be throwing the book at them,\u201d Reggie Thomas, the group\u2019s senior vice president for government affairs, said in a phone interview this week.The group says a small number of lousy landlords give the rest a bad name. But if it\u2019s serious about holding bad actors accountable, there\u2019s no reason it shouldn\u2019t support the bulk of this legislation.Enacting the legislation before the City Council would be a good way to start helping tenants like Mr. Kelly stay in their homes.

{"Headline": "When Fiction Most Becomes Trump", "Date": "2018-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA character to challenge the best writers.Opinion ColumnistIf history\u2019s greatest novelists and playwrights were to come back from the dead so they could tell the improbable tale of Donald J. Trump, how would they do it? How might they capture the man and his presidency in all of its hallucinatory, absurd and terrifying detail when we journalists usually seem to come up short?Let\u2019s begin with Shakespeare. Would the Bard write \u201cTrump\u201d as a comedy or a tragedy?Back in 2015, when Trump announced his candidacy, it would surely have been a comedy. The Donald would have been Falstaff, that \u201chuge hill of flesh,\u201d as Prince Hal calls him, whose lies are \u201cgross as a mountain, open, palpable.\u201d Here we would have a character who always plays for the cheap seats \u2014 ribald and ridiculous; magnetic but pathetic \u2014 and who, fortunately, would be destined for nothing more.Except that in our real-life, present-day drama, this Falstaff has somehow managed to usurp Henry and seize his crown. Thus we move from comedy to tragedy: Trump as Macbeth.Admittedly, it\u2019s hard to picture Melania as a model for Lady Macbeth. But Roger Stone, Steve Bannon and Ann Coulter are perfect as the three witches. Banquo? That\u2019s easy: Michael Cohen, both as living accomplice and ghostly reproach. Macduff, of course, is Bob Mueller.Another possibility: Richard III. The political novelist Richard North Patterson wrote me with an idea of how it might work.\u201cIn Richard\u2019s stead,\u201d Patterson suggests, \u201ca morally deformed Trump ruthlessly dispatches the pitiful aspirants to the throne \u2014 Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz \u2014 in order to win the hand of a surrogate for Lady Anne: the G.O.P. in the guise of Reince Priebus.\u201cAs the bodies pile up one upon the other \u2014 Rex Tillerson, John Kelly \u2014 Trump/Richard is gripped by lethal paranoia. Tragedy looms over the realm until, at last, the insane tyrant is unhorsed by America\u2019s savior, the Earl of Richmond in the form of . . . Mike Pence?\u201dLet\u2019s hope it doesn\u2019t quite come to that. What about something in a more satirical vein?Just as Trump\u2019s presidency is a saga of epic political disruption, Mikhail Bulgakov\u2019s \u201cThe Master and Margarita\u201d tells a story of what happens when the devil and his retinue arrive in a capital city that is so full of its own moral certitudes that it thinks it can deny the possibility of his existence.Even a resurrected Bulgakov, however, would have trouble recasting his professorial Satan as a cheap and heedless reality-show star. As an alternative, Nina Khrushcheva of The New School suggests I take a close look at Nikolai Gogol, particularly his 1836 play \u201cThe Government Inspector.\u201dIt\u2019s the story of an out-of-towner named Ivan Khlestakov \u2014 a civil servant of no great means or talent but with spendthrift habits and unlimited chutzpah \u2014 who is mistakenly taken by the corrupt local mayor as a secret government inspector. Khlestakov takes advantage of the mistake to extract big loans from the locals, bully the mayor, and run off with his daughter. His imposture is revealed only after he\u2019s left town.Can nothing be done? The clich\u00e9 about Russian literature is that it has a tendency toward fatalism, whereas what we really need is literature that supplies remedies. That\u2019s especially so when it comes to Trump\u2019s codependent relationship with the news media. The more he drives us nuts, the more attention we give him. The more we give him, the more he\u2019s inclined to drive us nuts \u2014 a classic vicious cycle.Aristophanes would know how to break it. The father of comedy understood that the only sure way to tame the beast is to starve it. In \u201cLysistrata,\u201d the women of Greece decide to put an end to the Peloponnesian War by barricading themselves in the Acropolis and withholding sexual favors until the men of Athens and Sparta put down their spears. It\u2019s extremely effective, spear-wise.Isn\u2019t it time the news media try something analogous with Trump, by denying him what he craves most? Put an absolute ban on quoting his tweets unless they contain substantive policy announcements. Stop sending reporters to his press conferences, which long ago became theaters of no information. Write more about what the administration does, less about what Trump says. Report news that has nothing to do with the administration at all. Award journalism prizes to stories that don\u2019t contain the word \u201cTrump\u201d at all.O.K., that\u2019s not likely to happen.All the same, in an era in which the president is constantly trying to impose his fictions on reality, it\u2019s incumbent on the rest of us to keep the two separate. Understanding what fiction is, and all the ways Trump seems to spring from it, is a good place to start.Advertisement"}

The records, generated in 2017 by the company\u2019s internal system for tracking partnerships, provide the most complete picture yet of the social network\u2019s data-sharing practices. They also underscore how personal data has become the most prized commodity of the digital age, traded on a vast scale by some of the most powerful companies in Silicon Valley and beyond.The exchange was intended to benefit everyone. Pushing for explosive growth, Facebook got more users, lifting its advertising revenue. Partner companies acquired features to make their products more attractive. Facebook users connected with friends across different devices and websites. But Facebook also assumed extraordinary power over the personal information of its 2.2 billion users \u2014 control it has wielded with little transparency or outside oversight.Facebook allowed Microsoft\u2019s Bing search engine to see the names of virtually all Facebook users\u2019 friends without consent, the records show, and gave Netflix and Spotify the ability to read Facebook users\u2019 private messages.The social network permitted Amazon to obtain users\u2019 names and contact information through their friends, and it let Yahoo view streams of friends\u2019 posts as recently as this summer, despite public statements that it had stopped that type of sharing years earlier.But the documents, as well as interviews with about 50 former employees of Facebook and its corporate partners, reveal that Facebook allowed certain companies access to data despite those protections. They also raise questions about whether Facebook ran afoul of a 2011 consent agreement with the Federal Trade Commission that barred the social network from sharing user data without explicit permission.In all, the deals described in the documents benefited more than 150 companies \u2014 most of them tech businesses, including online retailers and entertainment sites, but also automakers and media organizations. Their applications sought the data of hundreds of millions of people a month, the records show. The deals, the oldest of which date to 2010, were all active in 2017. Some were still in effect this year.In an interview, Steve Satterfield, Facebook\u2019s director of privacy and public policy, said none of the partnerships violated users\u2019 privacy or the F.T.C. agreement. Contracts required the companies to abide by Facebook policies, he added.Still, Facebook executives have acknowledged missteps over the past year. \u201cWe know we\u2019ve got work to do to regain people\u2019s trust,\u201d Mr. Satterfield said. \u201cProtecting people\u2019s information requires stronger teams, better technology and clearer policies, and that\u2019s where we\u2019ve been focused for most of 2018.\u201d He said that the partnerships were \u201cone area of focus\u201d and that Facebook was in the process of winding many of them down.Facebook has found no evidence of abuse by its partners, a spokeswoman said. Some of the largest partners, including Amazon, Microsoft and Yahoo, said they had used the data appropriately, but declined to discuss the sharing deals in detail. Facebook did say that it had mismanaged some of its partnerships, allowing certain companies\u2019 access to continue long after they had shut down the features that required the data.Data privacy experts disputed Facebook\u2019s assertion that most partnerships were exempted from the regulatory requirements, expressing skepticism that businesses as varied as device makers, retailers and search companies would be viewed alike by the agency. \u201cThe only common theme is that they are partnerships that would benefit the company in terms of development or growth into an area that they otherwise could not get access to,\u201d said Ashkan Soltani, former chief technologist at the F.T.C.Mr. Soltani and three former employees of the F.T.C.\u2019s consumer protection division, which brought the case that led to the consent decree, said in interviews that its data-sharing deals had probably violated the agreement.\u201cThis is just giving third parties permission to harvest data without you being informed of it or giving consent to it,\u201d said David Vladeck, who formerly ran the F.T.C.\u2019s consumer protection bureau. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how this unconsented-to data harvesting can at all be justified under the consent decree.\u201dFacebook\u2019s stock price has fallen, and a group of shareholders has called for Mr. Zuckerberg to step aside as chairman. Shareholders also have filed a lawsuit alleging that executives failed to impose effective privacy safeguards. Angry users started a #DeleteFacebook movement.\u201cI don\u2019t believe it is legitimate to enter into data-sharing partnerships where there is not prior informed consent from the user,\u201d said Roger McNamee, an early investor in Facebook. \u201cNo one should trust Facebook until they change their business model.\u201dPersonal data is the oil of the 21st century, a resource worth billions to those who can most effectively extract and refine it. American companies alone are expected to spend close to $20 billion by the end of 2018 to acquire and process consumer data, according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau.Few companies have better data than Facebook and its rival, Google, whose popular products give them an intimate view into the daily lives of billions of people \u2014 and allow them to dominate the digital advertising market.Facebook has never sold its user data, fearful of user backlash and wary of handing would-be competitors a way to duplicate its most prized asset. Instead, internal documents show, it did the next best thing: granting other companies access to parts of the social network in ways that advanced its own interests.Facebook began forming data partnerships when it was still a relatively young company. Mr. Zuckerberg was determined to weave Facebook\u2019s services into other sites and platforms, believing it would stave off obsolescence and insulate Facebook from competition. Every corporate partner that integrated Facebook data into its online products helped drive the platform\u2019s expansion, bringing in new users, spurring them to spend more time on Facebook and driving up advertising revenue. At the same time, Facebook got critical data back from its partners.The partnerships were so important that decisions about forming them were vetted at high levels, sometimes by Mr. Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer, Facebook officials said. While many of the partnerships were announced publicly, the details of the sharing arrangements typically were confidential.By 2013, Facebook had entered into more such partnerships than its midlevel employees could easily track, according to interviews with two former employees. (Like the more than 30 other former employees interviewed for this article, they spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements or still maintained relationships with top Facebook officials.)So they built a tool that did the technical work of turning special access on and off and also kept records on what are known internally as \u201ccapabilities\u201d \u2014 the special privileges enabling companies to obtain data, in some cases without asking permission.The Times reviewed more than 270 pages of reports generated by the system \u2014 records that reflect just a portion of Facebook\u2019s wide-ranging deals. Among the revelations was that Facebook obtained data from multiple partners for a controversial friend-suggestion tool called \u201cPeople You May Know.\u201dFacebook, in turn, used contact lists from the partners, including Amazon, Yahoo and the Chinese company Huawei \u2014 which has been flagged as a security threat by American intelligence officials \u2014 to gain deeper insight into people\u2019s relationships and suggest more connections, the records show.Some of the access deals described in the documents were limited to sharing non-identifying information with research firms or enabling game makers to accommodate huge numbers of players. These raised no privacy concerns. But agreements with about a dozen companies did. Some enabled partners to see users\u2019 contact information through their friends \u2014 even after the social network, responding to complaints, said in 2014 that it was stripping all applications of that power.As of 2017, Sony, Microsoft, Amazon and others could obtain users\u2019 email addresses through their friends.Facebook also allowed Spotify, Netflix and the Royal Bank of Canada to read, write and delete users\u2019 private messages, and to see all participants on a thread \u2014 privileges that appeared to go beyond what the companies needed to integrate Facebook into their systems, the records show. Facebook acknowledged that it did not consider any of those three companies to be service providers. Spokespeople for Spotify and Netflix said those companies were unaware of the broad powers Facebook had granted them. A spokesman for Netflix said Wednesday that it had used the access only to enable customers to recommend TV shows and movies to their friends.\u201cBeyond these recommendations, we never accessed anyone\u2019s personal messages and would never do that,\u201d he said.Spotify, which could view messages of more than 70 million users a month, still offers the option to share music through Facebook Messenger. But Netflix and the Canadian bank no longer needed access to messages because they had deactivated features that incorporated it.These were not the only companies that had special access longer than they needed it. Yahoo, The Times and others could still get Facebook users\u2019 personal information in 2017.Yahoo could view real-time feeds of friends\u2019 posts for a feature that the company had ended in 2012. A Yahoo spokesman declined to discuss the partnership in detail but said the company did not use the information for advertising. The Times \u2014 one of nine media companies named in the documents \u2014 had access to users\u2019 friend lists for an article-sharing application it had discontinued in 2011. A spokeswoman for the news organization said it was not obtaining any data.Facebook empowered Apple to hide from Facebook users all indicators that its devices were asking for data. Apple devices also had access to the contact numbers and calendar entries of people who had changed their account settings to disable all sharing, the records show.Apple officials said they were not aware that Facebook had granted its devices any special access. They added that any shared data remained on the devices and was not available to anyone other than the users.Facebook officials said the company had disclosed its sharing deals in its privacy policy since 2010. But the language in the policy about its service providers does not specify what data Facebook shares, and with which companies. Mr. Satterfield, Facebook\u2019s privacy director, also said its partners were subject to \u201crigorous controls.\u201dPam Dixon, executive director of the World Privacy Forum, a nonprofit privacy research group, said that Facebook would have little power over what happens to users\u2019 information after sharing it broadly. \u201cIt travels,\u201d Ms. Dixon said. \u201cIt could be customized. It could be fed into an algorithm and decisions could be made about you based on that data.\u201dBesides Facebook, the F.T.C. has consent agreements with Google and Twitter stemming from alleged privacy violations.Facebook\u2019s agreement with regulators is a result of the company\u2019s early experiments with data sharing. In late 2009, it changed the privacy settings of the 400 million people then using the service, making some of their information accessible to all of the internet. Then it shared that information, including users\u2019 locations and religious and political leanings, with Microsoft and other partners.Facebook called this \u201cinstant personalization\u201d and promoted it as a step toward a better internet, where other companies would use the information to customize what people saw on sites like Bing. But the feature drew complaints from privacy advocates and many Facebook users that the social network had shared the information without permission.The F.T.C. investigated and in 2011 cited the privacy changes as a deceptive practice. Caught off guard, Facebook officials stopped mentioning instant personalization in public and entered into the consent agreement.Under the decree, the social network introduced a \u201ccomprehensive privacy program\u201d charged with reviewing new products and features. It was initially overseen by two chief privacy officers, their lofty title an apparent sign of Facebook\u2019s commitment. The company also hired PricewaterhouseCoopers to assess its privacy practices every two years.But the privacy program faced some internal resistance from the start, according to four former Facebook employees with direct knowledge of the company\u2019s efforts. Some engineers and executives, they said, considered the privacy reviews an impediment to quick innovation and growth. And the core team responsible for coordinating the reviews \u2014 numbering about a dozen people by 2016 \u2014 was moved around within Facebook\u2019s sprawling organization, sending mixed signals about how seriously the company took it, the ex-employees said.Critically, many of Facebook\u2019s special sharing partnerships were not subject to extensive privacy program reviews, two of the former employees said. Executives believed that because the partnerships were governed by business contracts requiring them to follow Facebook data policies, they did not require the same level of scrutiny. The privacy team had limited ability to review or suggest changes to some of those data-sharing agreements, which had been negotiated by more senior officials at the company.Facebook officials said that members of the privacy team had been consulted on the sharing agreements, but that the level of review \u201cdepended on the specific partnership and the time it was created.\u201dIn 2014, Facebook ended instant personalization and walled off access to friends\u2019 information. But in a previously unreported agreement, the social network\u2019s engineers continued allowing Bing; Pandora, the music streaming service; and Rotten Tomatoes, the movie and television review site, access to much of the data they had gotten for the discontinued feature. Bing had access to the information through last year, the records show, and the two other companies did as of late summer, according to tests by The Times.Facebook officials said the data sharing did not violate users\u2019 privacy because it allowed access only to public data \u2014 though that included data that the social network had made public in 2009. They added that the social network made a mistake in allowing the access to continue for the three companies, but declined to elaborate. Spokeswomen for Pandora and Rotten Tomatoes said the businesses were not aware of any special access.Facebook also declined to discuss the other capabilities Bing was given, including the ability to see all users\u2019 friends.Microsoft officials said that Bing was using the data to build profiles of Facebook users on Microsoft servers. They declined to provide details, other than to say the information was used in \u201cfeature development\u201d and not for advertising. Microsoft has since deleted the data, the officials said.For some advocates, the torrent of user data flowing out of Facebook has called into question not only Facebook\u2019s compliance with the F.T.C. agreement, but also the agency\u2019s approach to privacy regulation.\u201cThere has been an endless barrage of how Facebook has ignored users\u2019 privacy settings, and we truly believed that in 2011 we had solved this problem,\u201d said Marc Rotenberg, head of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, an online privacy group that filed one of the first complaints about Facebook with federal regulators. \u201cWe brought Facebook under the regulatory authority of the F.T.C. after a tremendous amount of work. The F.T.C. has failed to act.\u201dAccording to Facebook, most of its data partnerships fall under an exemption to the F.T.C. agreement. The company argues that the partner companies are service providers \u2014 companies that use the data only \u201cfor and at the direction of\u201d Facebook and function as an extension of the social network.But Mr. Vladeck and other former F.T.C. officials said that Facebook was interpreting the exemption too broadly. They said the provision was intended to allow Facebook to perform the same everyday functions as other companies, such as sending and receiving information over the internet or processing credit card transactions, without violating the consent decree.When The Times reported last summer on the partnerships with device makers, Facebook used the term \u201cintegration partners\u201d to describe BlackBerry, Huawei and other manufacturers that pulled Facebook data to provide social-media-style features on smartphones. All such integration partners, Facebook asserted, were covered by the service provider exemption.Since then, as the social network has disclosed its data sharing deals with other kinds of businesses \u2014 including internet companies such as Yahoo \u2014 Facebook has labeled them integration partners, too.Facebook even recategorized one company, the Russian search giant Yandex, as an integration partner.Facebook records show Yandex had access in 2017 to Facebook\u2019s unique user IDs even after the social network stopped sharing them with other applications, citing privacy risks. A spokeswoman for Yandex, which was accused last year by Ukraine\u2019s security service of funneling its user data to the Kremlin, said the company was unaware of the access and did not know why Facebook had allowed it to continue. She added that the Ukrainian allegations \u201chave no merit.\u201dIn October, Facebook said Yandex was not an integration partner. But in early December, as The Times was preparing to publish this article, Facebook told congressional lawmakers that it was.An F.T.C. spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the commission agreed with Facebook\u2019s interpretation of the service provider exception, which is likely to figure in the F.T.C.\u2019s ongoing Facebook investigation. She also declined to say whether the commission had ever received a complete list of partners that Facebook considered service providers.The first assessment, sent to the F.T.C. in 2013, found only \u201climited\u201d evidence that Facebook had monitored those partners\u2019 use of data. The finding was redacted from a public copy of the assessment, which gave Facebook\u2019s privacy program a passing grade over all.Mr. Wyden and other critics have questioned whether the assessments \u2014 in which the F.T.C. essentially outsources much of its day-to-day oversight to companies like PricewaterhouseCoopers \u2014 are effective. As with other businesses under consent agreements with the F.T.C., Facebook pays for and largely dictated the scope of its assessments, which are limited mostly to documenting that Facebook has conducted the internal privacy reviews it claims it had.How closely Facebook monitored its data partners is uncertain. Most of Facebook\u2019s partners declined to discuss what kind of reviews or audits Facebook subjected them to. Two former Facebook partners, whose deals with the social network dated to 2010, said they could find no evidence that Facebook had ever audited them. One was BlackBerry. The other was Yandex.Facebook officials said that while the social network audited partners only rarely, it managed them closely.\u201cThese were high-touch relationships,\u201d Mr. Satterfield said.An earlier version of this article misstated the year that Yahoo ended a feature on its website that incorporated Facebook user data.

{"Headline": "California Today: Will a Desert Town Test Marijuana\u2019s Saturation Point?", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.One factor that has been limiting the growth of the industry so far is that federal laws make it illegal to transport the plant across state lines, even to other places where it\u2019s legal. If it becomes legal to transport joints and vape pens across state lines, it\u2019s easy to imagine California becoming the pot basket of the country, with all the jobs that entails.On the other hand, as commercial operations spring up, the price of pot is falling fast, challenging a lot of the early players.I was fascinated to learn that Needles aims to be a center of pot production even though it does not allow growing the plants outside.I figured this would make it hard to compete with places like Santa Barbara County, where pot producers are allowed to grow outside. But even though growing marijuana indoors is more expensive on a day-to-day basis, it can be much more efficient because the lights can stay on all night, with growing continuing through the year. Indoor facilities can also make it easier to turn out a uniform product.All that means that there is room in the industry for towns that have cheap land and electricity, alongside the areas that have plentiful farmland.Needles is in the desert, which has become a kind of Instagrammer\u2019s paradise. Is it trying to attract tourists, too?That\u2019s what I was expecting. Needles has all these old hotels from the days when Route 66 was a major source of travelers. I figured somebody would be fixing one of them up to be a Weed Inn, with a library of psychedelic movies and lots of Doritos and Cheetos at the front desk.But given the conservative politics of the town, I doubt it will look to become a destination for stoners.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Charley Parkhurst wasn\u2019t a miner.

{"Headline": "When #MeToo Investigations Go Wrong", "Date": "2018-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt isn\u2019t just Les Moonves and CBS. Workplace investigators face many obstacles when trying to get to the facts of sexual misconduct allegations.Ms. Antilla is the author of \u201cTales From the Boom-Boom Room: Women vs. Wall Street.\u201d Part of the problem is the nature of these investigations. They are not civil or criminal proceedings subject to public scrutiny; and even when the investigator concludes that harassment took place, there\u2019s no guarantee the company will do the right thing and protect the victim.Bad investigations still happen. A former product manager at a Silicon Valley artificial intelligence start-up said in a lawsuit in August that she was assured that the investigator hired to look into her sexual harassment allegations would be neutral. But when the manager offered to share messages that corroborated her claims, the investigator wasn\u2019t interested. When the report was complete, the manager asked for a copy but was told she couldn\u2019t see it.Yet employees typically have no choice but to participate in workplace investigations. Companies often insist on it, stipulating in employee handbooks or employment contracts that workers must cooperate when called to testify or risk getting fired.Investigators who strive to be fair sometimes face challenges. Allison West, an investigator in Pacifica, Calif., told me that one client\u2019s general counsel demanded that she delete information from her report that reflected badly on the company. (She declined to follow those orders). Another investigator told me that a client told her not to write a report at all if the findings turned out to be bad for the company.Even companies looking to do the right thing face hurdles. They might punish a harasser with a salary cut or docked bonus but then be forced to keep that information under wraps because of privacy considerations. Men and women in the harasser\u2019s department, in the meantime, are left with the impression that either the report was a whitewash or the company chose to do nothing.Pilar Morin, a lawyer in Los Angeles, described an incident that happened when she was looking into accusations that a college president had sexually harassed a student. During her interview with the president and his lawyer, in the president\u2019s office, she excused herself to use the rest room. She returned to a locked door and realized she had left her handwritten notes and computer in the room. \u201cI started pounding on the door,\u201d she said, but it was another 15 minutes before they let her back in.The worst frustration I heard at the conference was from an investigator who learned, in the course of her research, that there had been previous confidential settlements of sexual harassment complaints against the man she was investigating. The advice she got from her peers was that she could not include those previous settlements in her report.Policymakers need to begin talking about how to make investigations more transparent. They could demand that employees receive disclosures about who is being hired to investigate their companies, what they are paid and whether they have done previous work for the firm. If the disclosures reveal concerns about impartiality or conflicts of interest, employees should be able to decline to testify without penalty.Policymakers should also work on legal solutions to make sealed settlements accessible to victims of repeat offenders. How do you stop a predator who can bury the evidence against him? As women increasingly speak up in the #MeToo era, there will be more of these inquiries, and not all of them will make headlines. We need to do more to hold every investigation, and every investigator, accountable.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Would Indicting Trump Be Constitutional?", "Date": "2018-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYes, it would be. But that question is a distraction from the principal objective of the Russia investigation.Mr. Lederman has twice served in the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel.Although it\u2019s unlikely Mr. Trump will be the first president ever to be criminally charged, I think the Constitution wouldn\u2019t forbid an indictment, even during his presidency. Nevertheless, the constitutional debate is an unfortunate distraction from a more important question. Although the fixation on Mr. Trump\u2019s possible criminal culpability is understandable, it obscures the principal objective of the Russia investigation led by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, which is less to punish past wrongdoing than to identify continuing threats to our electoral system.What the nation most needs to know \u2014 and ideally what Mr. Mueller might explain \u2014 is why the president appears unwilling or unable to deal seriously with those threats, regardless of whether he also happens to have violated the law before he took office.The office nevertheless concluded that an indictment would be unconstitutional in light of a powerful functional consideration: Because a trial during the president\u2019s term would be precluded, an indictment would subject the president to the \u201cstigma and opprobrium\u201d of being branded an accused criminal without a timely opportunity to respond to his accusers in a court of law \u2014 a sword of Damocles that could undermine the president\u2019s \u201crespect and stature both here and abroad\u201d and thus impact his ability \u201cto act as the nation\u2019s leader in both the domestic and foreign spheres.\u201dThe Office of Legal Counsel was right that this is a serious concern, but it doesn\u2019t follow that an indictment would be unconstitutional. The Justice Department has never disputed, for instance, that a grand jury could name a president as an unindicted co-conspirator \u2014 as it did with Richard Nixon in 1974 \u2014 even though the opprobrium of such a designation shouldn\u2019t be materially more damaging than the stigma of a pending indictment.Moreover, as Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for eight members of the Supreme Court in the Paula Jones case in 1997, which permitted a sexual harassment suit against President Bill Clinton to go forward while he was in office, the possibility that federal judicial proceedings \u201cmay significantly burden the time and attention of the chief executive\u201d isn\u2019t sufficient to establish a constitutional violation. If that\u2019s the case in the context of an embarrassing civil suit, it\u2019s hard to see why the looming shadow of criminal charges \u2014 especially for conduct that occurred before the president assumed office \u2014 would have a more acute functional impact that crosses some constitutional line.Therefore, if there ever were an extraordinary case in which immediate charges were essential \u2014 in particular, if a president committed a heinous crime that demanded justice and he refused to waive what might otherwise be an effective statute-of-limitations defense \u2014 the attorney general should overrule the Office of Legal Counsel\u2019s conclusion that the Constitution categorically prohibits an indictment during a president\u2019s term. (Although I worked at the Office of Legal Counsel in 2000, I had no involvement in that opinion.)Even so, an indictment during Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency remains extremely unlikely, at least in a case where a trial remains viable after he leaves office. Mr. Mueller and the attorney general overseeing him would almost surely calculate that the costs to the nation would exceed the benefits of bringing charges during the president\u2019s term, and therefore urge the grand jury to hold off on taking the final step until Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential tenure has ended.Most important, we should keep in mind that Mr. Mueller was hired to lead a counterintelligence investigation. His primary charge is to ascertain the nature and extent of the threat to the United States election system and any \u201clinks and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump,\u201d including, but not limited to, Mr. Trump himself. His principal function, in other words, is forward-looking and preventive, not punitive.As president, Mr. Trump has repeatedly demonstrated that he won\u2019t, or can\u2019t, deal forcefully with what Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, has described as Russia\u2019s \u201congoing, pervasive efforts to undermine our democracy.\u201d Is Mr. Trump beholden to Russian officials in some way? Or is there another explanation?It\u2019s far more important for Mr. Mueller to get to the bottom of these questions \u2014 about the president\u2019s capacity to perform his solemn constitutional duties on behalf of the nation \u2014 than to assess whether Mr. Trump did or did not satisfy the elements of any particular criminal offense back in 2016.Perhaps Mr. Trump will become the first president to face criminal charges. Perhaps not. But that\u2019s the least of it. We\u2019d be wise to shift our attention from the unlikely possibility of a trial to the much more important matter of what the Mueller investigation might tell us about Mr. Trump\u2019s relationships with Russia and whether they compromise his ability to protect and defend the nation.Marty Lederman teaches constitutional law at the Georgetown University Law Center and has twice served in the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel.Advertisement"}

Stand your ground. \u201cNo,\u201d you must insist. \u201cMaratea.\u201dMaratea, a small, coastal town, is perched just above the Tyrrhenian Sea \u2014 mountainous and lush, with dramatic black sand beaches. You almost feel like you could be in Hawaii, but the town itself is pure Mediterranean. When we arrived, we ditched the car and walked the shopping area \u2014 the pedestrian-only streets made of white stones that are somehow more blinding than the sun. Maratea is for strolling, stopping for an aperitivo, taking in a view. The next morning, we headed to the beach \u2014 an impressive landscape of imposing cliffs, black sand, and a curious juxtaposition of cedar trees next to electric blue Mediterranean waters. It was a chilly morning and the sea was churning up white caps. We had no plans to swim but in case we had, the name had already talked us out of it: Spiaggia Acquafredda. The Beach of Cold Water.\u201cThe real Lucani are poor, na\u00efve maybe, but they are kind,\u201d said Ms. De Filippo, using the region\u2019s alternate name. \u201cFarmers, shepherds, they are not people that the mafia is interested in. They are simple, but incredibly generous.\u201dThey were prescient words.By evening, torrential rain had turned biblical, as Mr. Kihlgren drove his motorcycle to meet us for dinner. Rivers of rainwater coursed down the steps and streets of Matera, power-washing the city, cleansing it of anything that wasn\u2019t millennia-old.There are meals so gluttonous, so meaningful, so caloric, that they imprint themselves on your personal history. Dinner at La Talpa was such a meal.There were fried artichokes, bread salads with bright vegetables and salty, local cheese; there was a covered pizza, skinny and gooey with smoked mozzarella and spinach; crostini con cicoria e pur\u00e8 di fave, crostini with chicory and fava bean pur\u00e9e (a local specialty); there were breaded meatballs; there were sage leaves the size of a child\u2019s shovel, fried, salty and crispy. There was more, so much more, but the plates came out of the kitchen faster than I could eat what was on them.\u201cTourism screws up the identity of a place,\u201d said Mr. Kihlgren, stroking his goatee. \u201cThe only way to solve this contradiction is to make sure you are obsessive about the identity of the place.\u201dPeople in the hospitality industry reliably talk about the importance of authenticity. For Mr. Kihlgren, it is religion.\u201cOnce you clean it too much, you lose the character. You lose the soul of the house, the souls of the people who lived there,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are ancient historical nests \u2014 they should provoke an emotion. They are not supposed to be beautiful.\u201dWe paused. The verdure pastellate, battered and fried vegetables, arrived along with still more delicious, if unidentifiable, crostini.He sampled the antipasti. Then he added, \u201cFifty years ago, people here were dying of malaria, and now we are at 80 percent occupancy,\u201d he shook his head. \u201cI feel ashamed of this.\u201dIt was now close to midnight, there was nothing left to eat. It was time to go to the hotel.I have toured the stalactites in Quintana Roo with my children. I have sampled blue cheese aging next to bats in natural underground vaults in rural Spain.

The deep black, the cool air \u2014 \u2018sleep\u2019 is a mild word for the slumber you fall into. I woke up 11 (11!) hours later, candles still flickering, dutifully standing watch from their stony nooks, only the tiniest splinters of sunlight poking in from under the door.\u201cI will be brutal: We do not want tourists,\u201d said Mr. Adduce, an avuncular gentleman in a crisp shirt and thickly knotted tie. \u201cIt should not be, \u2018Let\u2019s see a church and eat pasta and try those crunchy red peppers and leave a few pieces of plastic behind.\u2019\u201dI sank in shame. I disposed of my recycling properly, but the truth is, I had grown quite fond of the crunchy red peppers.\u201cI want people to have an experience that will change their lives, change the world,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the exhibitions next year, Matera will sell passes \u2014 19 euros, good for one year. The visitors will be temporary cultural inhabitants, and they will be asked to leave a personal item behind. At the end of the year, these items will become their own exhibition.\u201dThis is the only region of Italy that has an alter ego, the only one that goes by two names. Depending on your age and generation, it is either Lucania or Basilicata, with a painful past and a glittering future as the European capital of culture.\u201cYou have to remember, I ran away to Rome when I was 18, and I didn\u2019t come back for five years,\u201d Francesco said. \u201cI told people I was from Basilicata, and they didn\u2019t know what it was. Actual Italians didn\u2019t know Basilicata. They would say, \u2018That\u2019s in Sicily, right?\u2019\u201dFran has dark, Mediterranean skin, a joyful, handsome face that belies his years, and wears small silver hoops in his ears. He\u2019s one of those people who can\u2019t stop smiling for long. We met at one of his favorite spots, not far from the Conservatorio di Matera where he studied piano for five years.A waiter arrived at the table, placing a bowl right in the middle. It was a soupy dip of warm fava beans, chickpeas, olive oil and onions.\u201cThis is the food of my childhood,\u201d Fran said. \u201cThe beans have to soak for days, you keep cleaning the water and adding herbs. I remember people would think, \u2018Lucani are so poor they can\u2019t afford meat.\u2019 But I loved this food. It\u2019s simple, like the Lucani.\u201dAround us, there was construction for exhibitions going up in 2019, platforms that would become a world stage.\u201cBasilicata is a hard but beautiful life,\u201d Fran said, taking on an uncharacteristically serious tone. \u201cOne side of me thinks it\u2019s important for the world to discover it. The other side knows the Lucani don\u2019t want a connection with the rest of the world.\u201dIt was unlike him, this somber reverence.

I was reeling. To me this wasn\u2019t just the man who wrote the music for \u201cHair.\u201d This was the underappreciated Grammy Award-winning wizard whose other soulful melodies and unabashed lyricism first spoke to me in my youth and became the choirmaster of my life.He leaned in and banged out a perfect tune to go with some lyrics I had written and sent him weeks earlier with a script about what it\u2019s like to be childless and watching the pageant of parenting in New York. I had found his address in the phone book. I still don\u2019t know why he had bothered, but that is the occasional magic of life in creative New York, I guess, and he had generously offered to come to collaborate on a cold winter day. His hair was whiter than the piano keys but his face was bright and the way he attacked the song with vigor, hair flopping, hands bouncing, made me feel in the presence of someone younger, not decades older than me.I\u2019d been working on an ill-fated revue with an actress friend. Various composers had contributed melodies for our lyrics. None were of MacDermot\u2019s stature, at least in my mind.I had fallen in love with his music 30 years prior, in 1971 when I went as a junior high school kid to see the Broadway production of \u201cTwo Gentleman of Verona,\u201d a bawdy romp full of sexual innuendo, mocking self-regard and anti-war jabs. I remember the diverse cast, funky choreography, John Guare lyrics and motley funkadelic costumes. But what hit me hardest about the show that beat out \u201cFollies\u201d and \u201cGrease\u201d for a best musical Tony Award were those melodies. Uplifting, many with a Latin inflection, they weaponized joy and sounded as much like soul and mambo as show tunes, and were at least as good as the songs from \u201cGodspell\u201d and \u201cPippin\u201d that were contemporizing Broadway theater around that time. I bought the album and sheet music with the sexy cartoon graphic, and played the songs over and over. At a time when so much music could be so harsh, there was a humane harmony to that score, suggesting, like in \u201cHair,\u201d a diverse but melded community of searchers that appealed to an isolated kid in white-bread suburbia. I sang the songs in the shower and while I walked to school, worried about bullies and gym class. As a lonely college transfer student in 1980, I bonded with a fellow student who sang from \u201cTwo Gentleman\u201d with me: \u201cYou can\u2019t love another without loving yourself,\u201d we\u2019d belt. He later became a psychoanalyst.A few years after that, MacDermot had another show up at the Public Theater, where \u201cHair\u201d had premiered decades before. \u201cThe Human Comedy,\u201d an adaptation by William Dumaresq of the bittersweet William Saroyan novella about a California family during World War II, brought me to tears. It wasn\u2019t from sadness, although it was a sad tale about the nicest people. It was rapture, really. Somehow those surging melodies conjured the lives and souls of a more innocent America \u2014 with children waving to hobos on passing trains and telegraph poles rising into the horizon, full of \u201cmessages from places afar,\u201d many of them devastating ones from the War Department.\u201cBeautiful music is in the air,\u201d a gospel chorus sang with dark hope. I hear it to this day.That show went on to Broadway. It was well reviewed, but didn\u2019t last long. A revival more recently didn\u2019t take off, either. \u201cTwo Gentleman of Verona,\u201d revived in Central Park in 2005, didn\u2019t catch on, even with its gorgeously diverse cast. And there were many other forgotten shows with penetrating music that MacDermot wrote, along with soundtracks, albums and a lilting lullaby, \u201cCover Up My Head,\u201d sung by the McGarrigle Sisters, soulful Canadians like him. It\u2019s another of his songs that cracks open my heart. It also makes me feel, I dare say, grateful to be alive, although it would be safe to add that you would be grateful not to hear me singing it.Words, it is said, make you think, but music makes you feel, and because MacDermot always makes me feel so much, I\u2019m a hopeless and sentimental admirer. But then, when prolific artists are so talented but not so well-known, our devotion to them is even stronger, isn\u2019t it? The author Nick Hornby once put obsessing over music this way: \u201cAnd mostly all I have to say about these songs is that I love them, and want to sing along to them, and force other people to listen to them, and get cross when these other people don\u2019t like them as much as I do.\u201dI don\u2019t know that the death of this musical magician will draw more attention to his work. I hope so. I see some of it available digitally. Meanwhile, I\u2019m glad to know I still have a CD player in my car and that when driving I can wrap myself in the tunes of a man so humble and hardworking that, as if from the ether, he appeared to set music to my lyrics one day all those years ago and several before he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2009.I think about the open-minded generosity he showed by throwing himself into a project with an unknown. He had come to my piano from his home on Staten Island, not an easy trip for a man in his 70s. For no reason other than the spirit of process and collaboration, he\u2019d written the perfect tune to go with my imperfect song. That spirit of willingness, the wanting to try, the urge to keep composing one joyful tune after another, that was his private gift. But it\u2019s also a communal one because you can hear it in his melodies, each one unassuming and inspired.His is the music of hope. He didn\u2019t just let the sunshine in. He created it.Mr. Morris is the author of \u201cBobby Wonderful\u201d and \u201cAssisted Loving.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the author of the novella \u201cThe Human Comedy.\u201d He is William Saroyan, not his son, Aram Saroyan.Advertisement"}

Ms. Weiss is a writer and editor for the Opinion section. Ms. Peyser writes about politics and culture for Vice.I didn\u2019t delete my account \u2014 yet! I know! I am full of shame! \u2014 but I did change the way I use it (no looking at my mentions; far less tweeting; aiming to highlight the work of people I like rather than criticize the work of those I don\u2019t). It also made me think about how I saw other Twitter users, like Vice\u2019s Eve Peyser. She was clever and often funny \u2014 and I disagreed with her about just about everything. Sometimes she jabbed at me. I watched her posts with a suspicious side-eye. \u2014 Bari WeissThis is the story of how we went from being enemies to friends.Hating you was the natural position for me to adopt. After all, I\u2019m a social democrat who eagerly voted for Bernie Sanders in the 2016 primaries and has contemplated purchasing a \u201cFree Palestine\u201d T-shirt.So I proceeded as one does these days: tsk-tsking various columns of yours, occasionally snarking about you on Twitter, and ascribing to the belief that The New York Times\u2019s decision to hire you was most likely bad for America and the future of liberal democracy.But I always had this nagging feeling that the Bari Weiss cyber outrage was overblown. Then, we became friends, and every tender thought I\u2019d had about you was confirmed.You had actually heard about it from the guy involved, who was bragging to you about bullying me, thinking he had come upon someone like-minded. In a way, this was perfect timing for me to meet you because I allowed myself to be vulnerable and to talk about it with you.\u2014 Eve Peyser For a long time, I giddily partook in the feud culture platforms like Twitter engender. During the 2016 election, multiple people I was friendly with in real life blocked me for being too salty about Hillary Clinton\u2019s shortcomings, even though I ended up voting for her. I loved making fun of bad tweets, and my followers loved to retweet my most vicious messages.But slowly, something changed in me, and I needed to opt out of the cruelty of online discourse. It was partly because, as my following increased, I began to receive annoying backlash for any quasi-controversial tweet, but also because I\u2019m in my 20s, and every day I\u2019m re-examining who I am and growing into a more mature version of myself.When we decided to work on an article together, I told you I wanted to write about baking sourdough bread. Because making a tangible, edible, distinctly uncontroversial object by hand felt like the opposite of the online hellspace you and I first encountered each other in. Even though our views differ in so many ways, we managed to connect over feeling utterly exhausted by the hyperpoliticized world we live in.I definitely don\u2019t hate you, but it seems I got my wish.Of course, we have to acknowledge that we are privileged enough to be able to have this sort of discourse, to be friends despite our differing beliefs. Not everyone has that option.The people who get under my skin the most on social media are not the neo-Nazis \u2014 they are so transparently evil that there doesn\u2019t seem to be a way to engage \u2014 but people who are closer to me and to my orbit. They\u2019re the ones I may be able to persuade \u2014 I have hope for you, Eve! \u2014 or be persuaded by. \u2014 Bari WeissI do wonder, though, what are the limits of friendship for you and have they changed under Trump?The longer I write about politics, the more open I am to being friends with people of all ideologies. My favorite part of my job is having the opportunity to interview people I don\u2019t see eye-to-eye with, and trying to understand how and why their worldview is the way it is. I reject the idea that by virtue of being friends with you, I am somehow condoning the beliefs you have that I disagree with. This isn\u2019t to say you should befriend raging bigots or violent abusers, but having an ideologically diverse group of friends helps you better understand your own convictions. I\u2019m also open to being friends with all sorts of people because my leftism is informed by a sense of radical empathy. We should live in a country where the military doesn\u2019t wage needless war on other nations and where everyone has equal rights and access to free health care and other social services because, fundamentally, everyone deserves to be treated kindly.The disciplined among us \u2014 and I\u2019m hoping to get there \u2014 might get off these platforms entirely. One thing we all can do is make the effort to engage in real life.Maybe you have a political nemesis whom you subtweet. Perhaps you have a Facebook foe. Or maybe your enemy is sitting across the campus library or in the cubicle next to you. If so, we\u2019ve got a challenge for you: Invite that person to have a beer or coffee, or join you in a FaceTime chat. Tell us how it went.Or maybe you\u2019re a step ahead of us and you\u2019ve already found a way to bridge the gap.

The genesis of this latest attack on Obamacare. Disenchanted that a Republican-controlled federal government wouldn\u2019t repeal every word of the law, Texas and a coalition of states tried a sleight of hand: They leaned on President Trump\u2019s 2017 tax bill, known officially as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act \u2014 which zeroed out the tax penalty of the health care law\u2019s individual mandate \u2014 and argued that the mandate itself was unconstitutional.This all-out assault on health care is one reason Democrats did so well in the midterm elections, as voters rejected anti-Obamacare candidates at the polls. They included several lawmakers who had gleefully voted for Mr. Trump\u2019s tax bill less than a year earlier.Except the tax bill did not invalidate the Affordable Care Act \u2014 it did away only with the penalty for not being insured. Congress left the rest of the law intact.This partisan, activist ruling cannot stand. If it\u2019s not reversed by the conservative United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, then it\u2019s off to the Supreme Court, where all five justices who, in 2012, already determined that the Affordable Care Act was constitutional will still be there.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Electric Vehicles Are Gathering Speed in Latin America", "Date": "2018-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTo fight global warming and air pollution, cities across the region are taking advantage of innovations in urban transportation. Ms. Viscidi and Mr. Edwards are specialist in energy and climate change.But several factors are impeding the progress of EVs in Latin America, including upfront costs that are hefty for developing countries, subsidized fossil fuels, a lack of vehicle fuel efficiency standards, insufficient charging infrastructure, and bidding processes to procure new buses, which prioritize least cost options disqualifying cleaner technologies with higher upfront costs. To overcome these barriers, governments need to strengthen financial incentives and standards favoring clean technologies, expand programs for electrifying high-use vehicles, develop electric mobility strategies and goals, and create public-private partnerships.Governments have attempted to counter high price tags with both financial and nonfinancial incentives. In 2017, the Colombian government eliminated import tariffs for up to 1,500 E.V.s per year through 2019. By 2023, the annual quota will increase to 3,000. In July, Colombia\u2019s stock of E.V.s surpassed 1000 units \u2014 in 2012, just 33 were sold.Local and national governments should also incorporate electric mobility into long-term energy and transportation planning. Electric mobility strategies can provide clarity to markets and direction for public policy. Building on the region\u2019s first law to incentivize E.V.s in Costa Rica, which entered into force in January, President Carlos Alvarado has announced that by 2021 his administration will launch a plan to establish a fossil fuel-free transportation system.Finally, partnerships involving city governments and private utilities, automakers, bus companies and local businesses have also accelerated the adoption of E.V.s across Latin America and should serve as models. Last year, Mexico had some 1,500 publicly accessible chargers, most of which were installed by Tesla through deals with shopping centers and hotels. Low-interest loans from multilateral development banks are also enabling cities to make the large upfront payments for electric buses.E.V.s alone are not a silver bullet. Addressing urban transportation challenges requires a multifaceted approach that should include improvements to public transportation, stricter fuel efficiency and fuel quality standards for all vehicles, and the expansion of nonmotorized transport including walking and biking. But as the only zero-emissions vehicles, E.V.s will play a vital role in meeting the Paris Agreement\u2019s goal of keeping global warming below 2 degrees Celsius.After decades in which the world\u2019s transportation system has scarcely changed, urban mobility appears on the cusp of rapid transformation. As the world embraces this transition, Latin America is also getting on board.Lisa Viscidi is director of the Energy, Climate Change and Extractive Industries Program at the Inter-American Dialogue.

Although we\u2019d all like to pay less, relative to most developed nations our tax burden is a pretty good deal.These uncollected billions could pay for any number of things: better care of wounded veterans, infrastructure improvements such as a desperately needed new tunnel between New York and New Jersey. You could even build an expensive wall.The Trump/G.O.P. tax policy is now operating at peak failure. The tax cuts have failed to increase gross domestic product beyond the \u201csugar high\u201d stimulus they gave to an economy already heading toward record low unemployment. The economy seems to be slowing, making a mockery of the promise of strong growth that was used to peddle the tax cuts. To pay for the millionaire tax cuts, sacrifices had to be made. So Congress limited deductions for state and local taxes to $10,000 annually. While that generally applies to well-to-do people who can itemize their tax returns, it was also a clear shot against blue states such as California and New York that have relatively high state and local taxes. But reducing these deductions, along with higher interest rates, punished the housing market, which is stagnant nationally and in a free fall in the Northeast.Our ability to keep the $1 trillion deficit created by the Trump tax cuts from deepening depends in part on collecting taxes to which the government is legally entitled. Think of it this way: To protect our nation, we have the most powerful army in the world. To protect our tax base, we have an army on the order of Liechtenstein\u2019s.

Once he saw this tendency on climate change, he saw it everywhere and on all sides: People with single all-explaining ideologies have a tendency to let their philosophic blinders distort how they view empirical reality.Taylor didn\u2019t abandon his faith in markets and individual rights, but he decided to abandon the belief that a single ideology can be applied to all problems. There are a lot of different goods in society: liberty, social justice, equity, community, virtue, prosperity. It\u2019s crazy, Taylor argued, to prioritize one of those goods in nearly every single policy context. And yet that\u2019s what ideologues do.Since at least 1964, American politics has pitted conservatives who believe in a small government and a free market against liberals who believe in a bigger government.But Niskanen thinkers like Ed Dolan, Samuel Hammond and Will Wilkinson made a simple and empirically verifiable observation. The nations that have the freest markets also generally have the most generous welfare states. The two are not in opposition. In the real world they go together.The key distinction you have to make, Will Wilkinson writes, is between the redistributive state and the regulatory state. Nations like Denmark, Sweden and Canada built elaborate redistributive states to give their citizens a foundation of economic security. Then they realized they were going to have to liberalize their economies if they were going to be able to afford their welfare states.Today, those nations have many fewer regulations governing zoning and economic activity. They score very high on the rankings of economic freedom that are put together by conservative outfits like the Heritage Foundation and the Fraser Institute.They want government to protect citizens against the disruptions of global capitalism: \u201cWithout strong income supports that put a floor beneath displaced workers and systems that smooth the transition to new employment, political actors and the public tend to turn against the process of creative destruction itself.\u201dAt the same time, they want an open, dynamic society. They want to reduce restrictive zoning and land use regulations that favor the rich and entrenched. They see immigration as crucial to America\u2019s long-term prosperity. They want charter schools and wider choice, but within strong government structures to ensure quality. (It turns out that bad charter schools continue to attract students; the education market doesn\u2019t work totally unregulated.)The Niskanen authors are making a compelling case for moderation; for understanding that politics is striking a rough but workable balance between competing goods; for understanding that the world is complex and our knowledge is limited, and so it\u2019s best to proceed constantly, but skeptically.As I was reading the Niskanen report I experienced two strange sensations: I felt liberated to see the world in fresh new ways, and not only in the ways I\u2019ve always seen them or the way people with my label are supposed to see them. I began to feel at home.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Maria Butina, Russian Accused of Spying, Enters Plea Deal; Court Papers Backpedal on Sex Claims", "Date": "2018-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byProsecutors even appear to have backed off the accusation that Ms. Butina used a graduate program at American University in Washington merely as a cover to enter the United States. \u201cAll available evidence indicates that Butina had interest in a graduate school education,\u201d prosecutors say in a footnote.The deal, which now must be approved by a judge, stipulates that Ms. Butina must cooperate with federal, state and local authorities in exchange for what could be a short prison term, or possibly a release after having already spent five months in jail. As a felon, she will most likely be deported after her release, as was made clear in court filings laying out the deal that were obtained by The New York Times.Her arrest in July stemmed from what officials described as a broader counterintelligence investigation by the Justice Department and the F.B.I. that predated the 2016 election and is separate from the work being done by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. The investigation that ensnared Ms. Butina has focused on a Russian government official, Aleksandr P. Torshin, who worked closely with Ms. Butina for years. Mr. Torshin, a former senator close to Christian conservatives in Russia, has been attending N.R.A. conventions in the United States since 2011.Investigators probably want to hear what Ms. Butina could tell them about Mr. Torshin\u2019s efforts to influence American policy. They also most likely want to hear anything she knows about links between Russians and her boyfriend, Paul Erickson, a Republican operative who ran Patrick J. Buchanan\u2019s 1992 presidential campaign and who moves in rarefied conservative circles despite accusations of fraud in three states.The plea deal also makes reference to George O\u2019Neill Jr., a Rockefeller relative and conservative writer who helped pay Ms. Butina\u2019s bills in the United States. Mr. O\u2019Neill, who is not accused of wrongdoing, is described in the court papers as \u201ca wealthy and well-connected U.S. person\u201d who hosted large \u201cfriendship dinners\u201d that were focused on improving relations between Russia and the United States.The dinners, prosecutors said, afforded Ms. Butina the chances \u201cto meet individuals with political capital, learn their thoughts and inclinations toward Russia, gauge their responses to her, and adjust her pitch accordingly.\u201dYet for all of the talk of Ms. Butina looking to make connections with influential Americans, she hardly comes off as a character out of \u201cRed Sparrow,\u201d a spy thriller about a Russian femme fatale. If anything, what stands out in the court papers is the absence of the most headline-grabbing accusations that were made against Ms. Butina after her arrest.There is the prosecution\u2019s acknowledgment in the court papers that she genuinely wanted a graduate degree, and was not simply posing as a student. There is no mention of her having connections to Russian intelligence services. And nowhere is it suggested that she was only using Mr. Erickson to gain access to other influential Americans, or that she used sex at all in her efforts to promote pro-Russian views in the United States.Her lawyers had also pointed to Ms. Butina\u2019s open life in the United States \u2014 she was a frequent poster on social media \u2014 as evidence to counter the government\u2019s claims. For an alleged Russian agent funded by an oligarch, they say, Ms. Butina hardly lived a life of fake identities, secret communications and hidden allegiances.Ms. Butina even managed to get a photo with Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s eldest son, whom she met at a 2016 dinner hosted by the N.R.A. in Louisville, Ky. She also tried to help broker a secret meeting with President Trump himself and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia during the 2016 campaign.The court in Washington that is handling Ms. Butina\u2019s case set a hearing for Wednesday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Placenta, an Afterthought No Longer", "Date": "2018-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAn ephemeral organ, long dismissed merely as afterbirth, increasingly is viewed as critical to understanding the health and course of pregnancy.The placenta may be dismissed as \u201cafterbirth,\u201d deemed an afterthought in discussions about pregnancy and even relegated, literally, to the trash bin. But at long last it is beginning to get its due.Early in gestation, the fertilized egg implants itself in the mother\u2019s uterine lining and sends out a few cells to breach it. These foot soldiers produce proteins that disarm the mother\u2019s defenses, destroy the smooth muscles that line her blood vessels and dilate and redirect the vessels to feed the embryo. As the placental beachhead grows, its cells specialize to do the work of heart, lungs, liver and kidneys until the fetus can fend for itself. Groups of cells exchange oxygen for carbon dioxide; provide nutrients and hormones; protect the fetus from harmful stress, germs and chemicals; and remove waste.This incursion fails as often as 20 percent of the time, and when it does, it can cause severe complications for the fetus, at birth and afterward. It may also forecast trouble for the mother\u2019s health later in life: pre-eclampsia can portend heart disease and stroke, and gestational diabetes can signal later obesity and metabolic disease.Not all placentas develop equally. In the last few years Tracy Bale, director of the University of Maryland\u2019s Center for Epigenetic Research in Child Health and Brain Development, has found that the placenta of a male fetus is more vulnerable to external stress than the placenta of a female fetus. This vulnerability, in turn, may transfer to the embryo, Dr. Bale said. Male fetuses typically are larger than females throughout gestation, but they also have higher rates of spontaneous abortions, stillbirth, premature birth and neurodevelopmental conditions.\u201cWe suggested that placentas of male fetuses seem to be more susceptible at a genetic level,\u201d Dr. Weinberger said. \u201cI\u2019m very confident the same story is going to be there for autism, A.D.H.D. and other developmental behavioral problems.\u201dTechnological limitations have obscured the central role that the placenta plays in the health of both baby and mother. The placenta is a dynamic organ, but it usually has been studied by dissecting it after delivery.\u201cThat\u2019s too late,\u201d said Dr. Saade of the University of Texas. \u201cIt\u2019s like studying cardiac disease or any other medical condition just by doing an autopsy.\u201dProblems with the placenta often begin in the spiral arteries of the mother \u2014 the arteries that the fetus commandeers to feed itself. If they are blocked or too narrow, the fetus may not get enough oxygen and nutrients, and the mother\u2019s blood pressure may spike toward pre-eclampsia. This can begin as early as the first trimester, but few tools are available to diagnose it at that stage.\u201cThe tests that are available today are all designed for the third trimester, and that\u2019s way too late,\u201d said Dr. Alfred Z. Abuhamad, chair of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Eastern Virginia Medical School in Norfolk, Va. In 2014, the child-health division of the National Institutes of Health set out to find noninvasive methods to identify complications earlier. An infusion of $80 million into placenta research prompted Dr. Abuhamad and others to adapt technologies used in other fields, and has already provided valuable insights into early pregnancy.Some scientists are betting on magnetic resonance imaging scans, or M.R.I.s, as the most sensitive detectors of placental problems. They are using a method that measures oxygen levels in the blood; it is quick and, so far, seems to catch problems as early as the second trimester. Several teams worldwide are evaluating the technique, each in hundreds of women.Dr. Abuhamad\u2019s team is using these advances in ultrasound to chart placental health in about 500 pregnant women, including 300 at high risk of complications. They are collecting ultrasound data and blood samples from the women at eight time points during pregnancy to see which early features track with problems later on.Other teams are trying to identify particles the placenta may release into the bloodstream because that could lead to a simple blood test for diagnosing problems. And one group of researchers is developing an oximeter, a device that quantifies the light reflected back through layers of fat as a measure of blood oxygen.It will be at least five years before any of these tests makes their way to doctors\u2019 offices. But when they are ready, they are likely to have a huge impact on obstetric practice, said Dr. Diana W. Bianchi, director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.\u201cThe way that prenatal care is currently structured, you hardly see your obstetrician in the first trimester,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd by the time you get to the third trimester, you\u2019re seeing the obstetrician weekly.\u201d Instead, when placental screening identified a problem, women might be encouraged to see their doctors frequently through the first trimester. \u201cKnowing that this starts early in the first trimester,\u201d said Dr. Abuhamad, \u201ccould we then intervene in the first trimester \u2014 identify early, intervene early and prevent the complications?\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the location of a recent meeting of the Human Placenta Project. It was Bethesda, Md., not Baltimore.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Planet Has Seen Sudden Warming Before. It Wiped Out Almost Everything.", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bymatterIn some ways, the planet's worst mass extinction \u2014 250 million years ago, at the end of the Permian Period \u2014 may parallel climate change today. Some 252 million years ago, Earth almost died.In the oceans, 96 percent of all species became extinct. It\u2019s harder to determine how many terrestrial species vanished, but the loss was comparable. And we may be repeating the process, the scientists warn. If so, then climate change is \u201csolidly in the category of a catastrophic extinction event,\u201d said Curtis Deutsch, an earth scientist at the University of Washington and co-author of the new study, published in the journal Science.Researchers have long known the general outlines of Permian-Triassic cataclysm. Just before the extinctions, volcanoes in what is now Siberia erupted on a tremendous scale. The magma and lava that they belched forth produced huge amounts of carbon dioxide. Once in the atmosphere, the gas trapped heat. Researchers estimate that the surface of the ocean warmed by about 18 degrees Fahrenheit. Some researchers argue that the heat alone killed off many species. Others believe that the warmth reduced oxygen in the ocean, asphyxiating the species living there. Rocks from the mass extinction appear to have formed when at least some of the ocean was lacking oxygen.In previous research, Dr. Deutsch has explored how living animals adapt to temperature and oxygen levels in the seas. Animals with a fast metabolism need a lot of oxygen, for example, and so they can\u2019t live in parts of the ocean where oxygen falls below a certain threshold. Warm water makes the challenge even more difficult. Warmer water can\u2019t hold as much dissolved oxygen as cold water. Even worse, warm water can also increase an animal\u2019s metabolism, meaning it requires more oxygen just to stay alive.Cod, for example, are not found below a latitude running roughly from New England to Spain. South of that line, warmth and low oxygen are just too great for the species.Dr. Deutsch and Justin Penn, a graduate student, recreated the world at the end of the Permian Period with a large-scale computer simulation, complete with a heat-trapping atmosphere and a circulating ocean.As the Siberian volcanoes flooded the virtual atmosphere with carbon dioxide, the atmosphere warmed. The ocean warmed, too \u2014 and according to the model, it began losing oxygen.Some parts lost more than others. On the surface, for example, fresh oxygen was produced by photosynthetic algae. But as the ocean warmed, its circulatory currents also slowed, the model demonstrated. Oxygen-poor water settled to the bottom of the oceans, and before long, the deep was gasping. Rising temperatures and plunging oxygen must have made huge swaths of the oceans uninhabitable. Some species survived here and there. But most disappeared completely. \u201cEverything was losing a lot of habitat, creating the risk of extinction,\u201d said Dr. Deutsch. \u201cBut the risk was actually higher in places that were cold. That was a bit surprising.\u201dYou might expect that animals near the Equator would be at a greater risk, because the water was warm to begin with. But Dr. Deutsch\u2019s model suggested a very different kind of apocalypse. Animals in oxygen-rich cold water could not handle the sudden drop, while those in tropical waters were already adapted to poor oxygen. And the cold-water species could not find refuge elsewhere. To test their simulation, the researchers teamed up with Jonathan Payne and Erik Sperling, paleontologists at Stanford University. They dug into a huge online database of fossils to chart the risks of extinction at different latitudes during the catastrophe. When they were done with their analysis, they sent their graph to Seattle. Dr. Deutsch and Mr. Penn compared it to the prediction from their computer model. They matched. \u201cThis was the most exciting moment of my scientific life,\u201d said Dr. Deutsch.Michael Benton, a paleontologist at the University of Bristol in England, who was not involved in the study, said that it resolved the roles of heat and oxygen as causes of the mass extinction. \u201cThis makes a clear case that, of course, the two are linked,\u201d he said. The new study offers an important warning to humans over the next few centuries. The Siberian volcanoes ultimately delivered much more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than we will ever emit by burning fossil fuels. But our annual rate of carbon emissions is actually higher.\u201cThe way the Earth system is responding now to the buildup of CO2 is in the exact same way that we\u2019ve seen it respond in the past,\u201d said Lee Kump, a geoscientist at Penn State University. Just how much warmer the planet will get is up to us. It will take a tremendous international effort to keep the increase below about 4 degrees Fahrenheit. As the ocean warms, its oxygen levels will continue to drop. If ancient history is any guide, the consequences for life \u2014 especially marine life in the cooler parts of the ocean \u2014 will be disastrous.\u201cLeft unchecked, climate warming is putting our future on the same scale as some of the worst events in geological history,\u201d Dr. Deutsch said.Advertisement"}

(\u201cIt was a stage light,\u201d Mr. Worthy said, \u201cbut it was still a light.\u201d)Mr. Worthy, 32, believes in signs from the divine. He believes in stars that lead people to where they want to go. And he believes unfailingly in the power of faith.The moment he met Ms. Walley, he was bowled over by her beauty, her sweetness and the warmth of her smile. He summoned the power of all his beliefs to gain her attention.As with most good love stories, he wasn\u2019t looking for romance when it struck. But perhaps it was the right time for him.Perhaps it was the right time for her, too. That spring, she had been walking past the Hudson River and made a wish: that someone special would walk with her there. She passed the restaurant P.J. Clarke\u2019s, and wished for a date to dine there.She prayed that someone special would bring her some of her favorite flowers. She prayed that someone special would walk with her in Central Park. And she prayed that someone special would come along who believed what she believed: that being a blessing to others is more important than just about anything else in life.Mr. Worthy, a former staff member of the Clinton Global Initiative who works in philanthropy in Bentonville, Ark., had spent his career helping others. As a child in Syracuse he attended church every Sunday, sometimes twice on Sunday, always dressed in a three-piece suit. He volunteered at hospitals, nursing homes and after-school programs throughout grade school and high school.Yet when Mr. Worthy showed up, Ms. Walley couldn\u2019t see past her own fears.\u201cI had never been in a relationship before,\u201d she said. \u201cI was afraid of being hurt, afraid of being rejected, afraid of someone loving me.\u201dShe did know him, though. The two had been students together at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C. They had both traveled around 700 miles to attend the school; Mr. Worthy from Syracuse, Ms. Walley from Chicago. They had not been friends, although their circles had intersected in numerous ways. Mr. Worthy thought perhaps they had sung in choir together, but couldn\u2019t remember; Ms. Walley thinks she recalls passing him on campus. On a campus of 8,000 undergraduate and graduate students that included only a small percentage of students of color, they did not meet.Yet here they were, in New York City, population 8.6 million, meeting. For Mr. Worthy, that was a sign from the divine.He asked if she would like to get together. Ms. Walley, noncommittal, said sure. But her time was taken up with work, friends and commitments. She gave him her phone number. \u201cI wasn\u2019t intrigued,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was just a guy I knew who went to Wake Forest.\u201dHe began texting and calling; he was relentless. Such behavior was uncharacteristic.After two months of prodding, she finally agreed to have lunch with him.Then she thought about it. \u201cI said, Whoa! Was that him asking me out on a date?\u201d Ms. Walley recalled. She considered backing out, but didn\u2019t know how. She said, \u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019m not available now after I already said I was. I can\u2019t change my phone number because that would be rude.\u201dThey went to Cafe Luxembourg, a French bistro on West 70th Street. Mr. Worthy was encouraged. Two weeks later, he mentioned to Ms. Walley that he was making reservations for Flame, an Upper West Side hibachi restaurant, on Monday, her only night off. (He had remembered.) Caught off guard, she agreed to accompany him. To her surprise, they talked for hours.After dinner, he suggested a walk through Central Park. Ms. Walley is a Central Park devotee, so she couldn\u2019t say no. As they passed the Metropolitan Museum of Art, she mentioned that the museum was also one of her favorite places. Mr. Worthy told her he had never visited the Met; could she give him a tour?She quickly agreed, but not just to spend time with him. \u201cAny excuse to go to the Met,\u201d she said.For her, there was no star in her sky leading her to love. Not yet.After the success of the hibachi evening, Mr. Worthy and Ms. Walley made a date for the Met. Once the day arrived, after they had walked the Met, Mr. Worthy said they needed to hurry to get downtown. He wouldn\u2019t say why. But when they arrived at One World Trade Center, a.k.a. the Freedom Tower, Ms. Walley felt a twinge. \u201cI had never visited the Freedom Tower but had always wanted to,\u201d she said.He took her for a walk by the Hudson. He took her to P.J. Clarke\u2019s. Ms. Walley was dumbfounded. \u201cHow did he know to do these things?\u201d she recalled asking herself.On the next date, Mr. Worthy brought a bouquet of sunflowers. She had never told him they were one of her favorites.How did he know?His only explanation: \u201cGod was helping me out along the way.\u201dMs. Walley was now on board. \u201cI could tell that certain things in my heart were shifting a little bit,\u201d she said. \u201cIt became evident to me that there was something going on here that was bigger than both of us.\u201dShe orchestrated a fried-chicken dinner, her specialty, so Mr. Worthy could meet her sister.\u201cI said, \u2018Whoa! She\u2019s running him by me,\u201d Naomi Walley said. \u201cThis might be more serious than I thought.\u201dNaomi Walley watched as her sister, inexperienced in the rituals of romance, flirted with Mr. Worthy. \u201cShe did not have any experience with the opposite sex whatsoever,\u201d Naomi Walley said. \u201cBut here she was, and I didn\u2019t have to coach her. During the course of that picnic, I knew they were going to be together.\u201dFor the next several months, Mr. Worthy and Ms. Walley strolled in Central Park, watched movies, and attended Hillsong services.

{"Headline": "Wisconsin Is About to Make a Huge Mistake", "Date": "2018-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe lame duck, heavily gerrymandered Republican Legislature plans to vote on Tuesday to limit the powers of the incoming governor and attorney general, who are \u2014 surprise \u2014 Democrats.Mr. Kaufman is a writer and musician who grew up in Wisconsin.Late Friday afternoon, less than a month after a Democrat, Tony Evers, defeated Scott Walker, the incumbent Republican governor, Robin Vos, the Republican Speaker of the Wisconsin State Assembly, followed through on his threat to strip the new governor of some of his power.That day, an assembly committee released five bills that grant sweeping new authority to the Legislature at the expense of both Mr. Evers and Wisconsin\u2019s new attorney general, Josh Kaul, who also happens to be a Democrat. Drafted in secret, the legislation was rushed to the Joint Finance Committee on Monday for its only public hearing. Legislators and outraged citizens scrambled all weekend to parse more than forty serious changes to state law embedded in the 141 pages of text. The legislature is expected to vote on the bills on Tuesday and Mr. Walker has indicated an openness to signing legislation of this stripe.No one is really bothering to hide the purpose of this lame duck legislation: to continue the Republicans\u2019 hold on state government, even at the expense of core democratic principles like respect for the separation of powers and majority rule. The legislation would nullify the decision-making of Wisconsin\u2019s voters, who rejected Republicans for every statewide office in the November midterms.The lame duck legislation would, for example, prevent Mr. Evers from fulfilling a campaign promise to take Wisconsin out of a multistate lawsuit against the Affordable Care Act. It will also diminish the governor\u2019s control over the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation, a scandal-ridden public-private agency created by Mr. Walker to foster job creation, by giving the legislature an equal number of appointees to the board as the governor and revoking the governor\u2019s power to appoint the board\u2019s chief executive.Mr. Evers campaigned on closing the agency, the subject of critical audits by the state\u2019s nonpartisan Legislative Audit Bureau, which revealed that the economic development corporation had mismanaged millions of dollars in loans. The agency also attracted controversy after leading the effort to entice Foxconn, the Taiwanese electronics manufacturing contractor, to build its first American plant in Wisconsin, at a cost to taxpayers now reaching more than $4.5 billion dollars in subsidies.The lame duck legislation will also weaken the attorney general\u2019s office by eliminating the solicitor general\u2019s office in the state\u2019s Department of Justice. And it will take away the attorney general\u2019s power to determine how to spend settlement winnings and give that power to the Legislature. The bill also gives the Legislature the right to effectively act as its own attorney general by granting the Joint Committee on Legislative Organization the power to hire its own special counsel if it determines it is in the \u201cinterests of the state\u201d to do so. (Both Mr. Vos and Scott Fitzgerald, the Senate majority leader, who is collaborating closely with Mr. Vos, are members of the committee.)Apart from stripping powers from other branches of government, the legislation aims to decrease voter turnout by imposing a two-week limit on early voting, despite the fact that a federal judge struck down a similar Wisconsin law in 2016 on the ground that it was racially discriminatory. When Democrats swept statewide offices in November, it was mostly the result of record turnout in Dane and Milwaukee counties, Wisconsin\u2019s two largest, both of which allow early voting to begin roughly six weeks before an election.\u201cThe legislature is the most representative branch in government,\u201d Mr. Vos and Mr. Fitzgerald wrote in a joint statement after the bills were released. It was meant to serve as a justification, but in Wisconsin, at least since 2011, that has not been true: That year, at a law office across the street from the state capitol, Republicans drew new redistricting maps, in secret and without input from a single Democrat or member of the public. In 2016, a federal court ruled the maps so excessively partisan as to be unconstitutional, the first time a court had made such a ruling on partisan grounds in thirty years. (Earlier this year, the United States Supreme Court sent the case back to the lower courts, ruling that the plaintiffs did not have standing to sue.)Nationally, Democrats won more than 300 state legislative seats in November, but the party gained only one seat in the Wisconsin State Assembly despite winning 54 percent of the aggregate statewide vote. That leaves Democrats with 36 out of 99 seats. (Since the 2011 redistricting, they have not held more than 39 of 99 seats.) In the State Senate, Democrats actually lost a seat, giving Republicans a 19-14 margin.The lame duck legislation also takes aim at lowering turnout for a State Supreme Court election scheduled for April 2020. One measure would move the primary to March in order to avoid its being held on the same day as what is likely to be a crucial Democratic presidential primary. The cost of adding this new election is nearly seven million dollars, and the proposed date would make for three elections in three consecutive months.Last week, Dane County\u2019s clerk announced on social media that 60 of the state\u2019s 72 county clerks opposed the move. Mr. Fitzgerald admitted to reporters that the rationale for moving the election was to give a \u201cbetter chance\u201d to Daniel Kelly, whom Mr. Walker appointed to fill a vacant seat. Judge Kelly\u2019s election to a full ten-year term is essential to preserving the 4-3 conservative advantage on the Wisconsin Supreme Court.Like many Republican policies adopted in Wisconsin over the past eight years, taking power from a Democratic executive is part of a national conservative strategy. In December 2016, a few weeks after the election of Democratic governor Roy Cooper in North Carolina, Republican legislative leaders significantly weakened the state\u2019s governorship. They went so far that at the beginning of this year\u2019s legislative session, a reporter asked Phil Berger, the Republican Senate President Pro Tempore, and Tim Moore, the speaker of the House, if they planned to take away any more of Governor Cooper\u2019s powers. \u201cDoes he still have any?\u201d Mr. Berger joked. \u201cIf you have any suggestions, let us know,\u201d Mr. Moore added.In Michigan, where Democrats also won the governor\u2019s and attorney general\u2019s offices last month, the Republican-controlled legislature is debating divesting powers from both offices, including the attorney general\u2019s oversight of state campaign finance law.Perhaps fortified by the Republicans\u2019 gerrymandered advantage, Mr. Vos has been notably defiant. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about it that the voters across Wisconsin affirmed our record, the record of our party, and the agenda that we have put forward over the past eight years,\u201d he told the Assembly Republican Caucus a few days after the election despite Republicans losing all the statewide offices. \u201cWe are the ones that were given a mandate to govern.\u201dI spoke to Mr. Evers last Friday, just before the bills were released. \u201cI also have a mandate to govern,\u201d Mr. Evers told me, in response to Mr. Vos\u2019s comments. \u201cBut we have to work together and solve things for the people of Wisconsin. What Speaker Vos says in caucus, I understand that: he has to rally his troops.\u201dBut after learning about the scope of the bills, Mr. Evers was more assertive. \u201cI view this as a repudiation of the last election,\u201d he told The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. \u201cI will take any steps possible to assure the people of Wisconsin that I will not invalidate those votes. And frankly, I\u2019m encouraging citizens across the state of Wisconsin to help me in that effort.\u201dMr. Vos and Mr. Fitzgerald seem confident they can turn their self-proclaimed mandate into another chapter in their party\u2019s most enduring achievement: engineering its own dominance. Like their successful efforts to gut Wisconsin\u2019s campaign finance laws, decimate the labor movement and weaken voting rights by enacting one of the country\u2019s strictest voter ID laws, seizing powers from the state\u2019s newly elected governor and attorney general promises to further tilt the balance in the Republicans\u2019 favor.After eight years of relentless attacks on Wisconsin\u2019s progressive political traditions, its state government has been transformed into something that is hard to recognize as a democracy. If these new bills pass, it will become harder still.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google\u2019s Pichai Faces Privacy and Bias Questions in Congress", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Google\u2019s chief executive, in perhaps the most public display of lawmakers\u2019 unease with his company\u2019s influence, was grilled on Tuesday about everything from search result bias and the data Google collects about its users to plans for a censored service in China.Sundar Pichai, an engineer who rose through Google\u2019s ranks to become its leader three years ago, faced more than three hours of questions from the House Judiciary Committee. Republicans expressed concerns about unfair treatment of conservatives, and lawmakers in both parties zeroed in on privacy issues.While Google had been under scrutiny before, particularly in Europe, where regulators have fined it, it had not had to address such an array of issues in one go and in such an open forum.\u201cMr. Pichai, it was necessary to convene this hearing because of the widening gap of distrust between Silicon Valley and the American people,\u201d said Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the Republican House majority leader. He is not a member of the Judiciary Committee but made a point of attending the hearing.It was the latest in a series of congressional hearings that have made clear lawmakers\u2019 concerns about the power of big internet companies. Mr. Pichai fielded questions alone, after rejecting a request to testify with executives from Facebook and Twitter three months ago.Mr. McCarthy and other Republicans see Silicon Valley as the home of hugely influential companies with liberal executives and work forces that \u2014 intentionally or unintentionally \u2014 are allowing their biases to taint how people receive information on the internet.For Google, that means claims that its search results are skewed against conservatives, though academics and industry insiders largely dismiss those concerns. A video showing Google executives bemoaning President Trump\u2019s election victory in 2016 provided further evidence for Republicans when it was leaked this year.Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, the Virginia Republican who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee, asked if Google\u2019s employees had made decisions to filter search results contrary to the company\u2019s claims of political neutrality.\u201cThis committee is very interested in what justifies filtering,\u201d Mr. Goodlatte said. \u201cGiven the revelation that top executives at Google have discussed how the results of the 2016 elections do not comply with Google\u2019s values, these questions have become all the more important.\u201dWithout offering evidence, Representative Lamar Smith, Republican of Texas, said Google\u2019s antipathy toward conservatives gave Hillary Clinton a lift in the 2016 presidential election. He pushed Mr. Pichai to allow outside investigators to audit Google\u2019s search technology for indications of bias.\u201cGoogle could well elect the next president,\u201d Mr. Smith warned.But the company\u2019s search algorithms do not take political sentiment into account, Mr. Pichai said. Results are determined by about 200 factors, including relevance, freshness and the popularity of queries.\u201cOur algorithms have no notion of political sentiment,\u201d he said.The session offered a hint that when Democrats become the House majority in January, data privacy issues will become a priority.\u201cThere are legitimate questions regarding the company\u2019s policies and practices, including with respect to content moderation and the protection of user data privacy,\u201d said Representative Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat from New York.Mr. Pichai, who was roundly criticized by lawmakers for not appearing at the hearing three months ago, could not so easily sidestep the privacy issue.The sharpest exchange involved Representative Ted Poe, Republican of Texas, who held up his smartphone and asked Mr. Pichai whether Google was tracking his whereabouts if he walked to the other side of the room.\u201cNot by default,\u201d Mr. Pichai said, meaning it depended on the settings on the apps that Mr. Poe had installed on the phone.When Mr. Pichai wouldn\u2019t respond with a definitive yes or no, Mr. Poe raised his voice and interrupted.\u201cYou make $100 million a year. You should be able to answer that question,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m shocked you don\u2019t know. I think Google obviously does.\u201dMr. Pichai said Google offered users controls for limiting the collection of location data and did not sell user data, though he avoided saying whether the company uses location data when it sells advertising.When asked whether Google would support a federal privacy law like Europe\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, Mr. Pichai seemed open to it. He praised the European policy, which went into effect in May, as a \u201cwell-crafted piece of legislation\u201d and said there was value in consistent global regulation.Repeating earlier statements, Mr. Pichai said Google had no current plans to re-enter the Chinese market with a search engine that censored information banned by the government.He characterized the initiative, Project Dragonfly, as an \u201cinternal effort.\u201d He said the company had not discussed its plans with Chinese government officials. Mr. Pichai would not commit to scrapping the initiative, however, and said it was \u201cour duty to explore possibilities to give users access to information.\u201dLike other Capitol Hill hearings on tech companies this year, the session on Tuesday offered as much theater as policy discussion. Seated a few rows behind Mr. Pichai \u2014 in sight of television cameras \u2014 was a person sporting a top hat, a fake giant mustache and a monocle like the Rich Uncle Pennybags character from the board game Monopoly.At one point, the session was interrupted by a protester holding a sign that read \u201cGoogle\u201d across a Chinese flag.Outside the hearing room, Alex Jones, the founder of the conspiracy news site Infowars, yelled \u201cGoogle is evil!\u201d until a police officer told him to quiet down. Mr. Jones has been barred from Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, which is owned by Google.He was accompanied by Roger J. Stone Jr., the Republican political operative and a longtime acquaintance of President Trump who has drawn attention from the special prosecutor, Robert S. Mueller III, for his potential role in Russian election meddling. Mr. Stone, who was also barred by Twitter, complained that big internet companies were \u201cmonopolistic.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is Haiti Awakening to Change?", "Date": "2018-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor months, an anti-corruption movement has been growing, aided by social media and peaceful street protests. But tensions are rising as the government turns to repression. Mr. Johnston is writing a book about Haiti and international policy toward it since the 2010 earthquake.On Oct. 17, huge crowds of Haitians from all sectors of society peacefully demonstrated with banners and shirts demanding an answer to Mr. Mirambeau\u2019s tweeted question, which is still trending.The result has been a remarkable challenge to the legacy of corruption and misgovernment that Haitians share and have felt powerless to effectively counter for many decades. The big question for this tiny, impoverished country has become whether the current movement will push the political scene toward functional democracy or drive the government into a new cycle of repression.On Nov. 18, a day commemorating Haiti\u2019s victory over Napoleon\u2019s troops 215 years ago, citizens again hit the pavement, signaling that this movement will not go away.But ensuring that this momentum leads to significant change will require all interested parties \u2014 Haiti\u2019s government and business, its elite and the impoverished masses, along with the international community \u2014 to unite in the fight against corruption, the transactional status quo that extends beyond the nation\u2019s borders.After the 2010 earthquake here, foreign donors pledged more than $10 billion in aid. But less than 1 percent of the emergency aid spent in their names went directly to Haitians. The legitimate government, the private sector and civil society were cast aside in favor of for-profit aid companies in the United States and other foreign experts. It is a policy that evokes the dynastic Duvalier dictatorship in the mid-20th century, when \u201cPapa Doc\u201d and \u201cBaby Doc\u201d became international symbols of kleptocracy. Today it is a policy that has only served to weaken the state and perpetuate the corruption, this time on an international scale. And now, after the $2 billion scandal languished for a year in the hands of politicians, and with Haiti\u2019s judiciary too weak to act, Haitians on their island and living abroad took it into their own hands.Unfortunately, tensions are rising as change begins to appear possible. Last July, three days of riots followed a gasoline price hike, revealing how close the nation is to a social explosion. Then came Mr. Mirambeau\u2019s #PetroCaribeChallenge, shifting the paradigm to a nonviolent campaign. Still, armed gangs close to the ruling party, together with corrupt police officers, massacred at least 60 people just days before the Nov. 18 protest. In Haiti, stability has often been cited as a reason not to challenge misgovernment, but the events of last summer and fall revealed that continuing the status quo will only generate more instability. Nonviolent protest that puts pressure on officials to promote accountability would seem to be an obvious path out of that conundrum, but recent history does not point to much hope for significant change. For example, the government has urged patience and promised an investigation. But Haitians have heard empty promises before. After the Duvalier dictatorship fell, not one official was convicted of a financial crime. In February 2017, when Jovenel Mo\u00efse became president, he pledged a crackdown on corruption. But his political mentor and presidential predecessor, Michel Martelly, had presided over most of the Petrocaribe spending. Now Mr. Mo\u00efse too has been directly implicated, and his government\u2019s repression has picked up. With the repression only making the opposition more determined, prominent political and business figures clearly sense a moment of opportunity. Whether it is to pursue justice or to protect their own interests is an open question. Either way, an investigation will be hard put to avoid being sucked into the political swordplay in Haiti\u2019s capital.One problem is that the U.N.\u2019s recent history in Haiti includes years of refusal to accept responsibility for a peacekeeping mission\u2019s introduction of a deadly cholera epidemic. A new U.N. mission arrived in 2016, but it appears feckless in the fight against impunity. After it welcomed the assignment of an investigative judge to the Petrocaribe case this year, Haiti\u2019s government protested, and the U.N. quietly replaced the mission\u2019s director.Another barrier is that any deep international role in a reformation would be difficult to accept in a nation with a long history of foreign intervention. Still, the universal principles \u2014 investigative independence, expertise and legal empowerment \u2014 that have guided the Guatemala commission may provide a useful road map for Haiti\u2019s anticorruption movement. It would be hard to argue against the need for experienced forensic auditors, courageous prosecutors and legally empowered professionals with a mandate to follow money wherever it may lead.For the international community, whose interventions and misplaced priorities have long helped consolidate the unsustainable status quo, standing up for transparency this time could re-establish some trust with the Haitian people and keep open a path to systemic change.It is up to all of Haiti\u2019s interested parties to follow that path. \u201cI was not expecting all this,\u201d Mr. Mirambeau, whose tweet started it all, told me. Nobody was. But for now, it is this possibility of change that has brought a modicum of hope to Haitians across the world.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "With Tech Expansion, Austin Is Still Weird. It\u2019s Just More Wired Now, Too.", "Date": "2018-12-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAUSTIN, Tex. \u2014 Walking distance from the pink dome of the Texas Capitol building, there were whiskey samples, tamales and Nerf guns.The Virtual Reality crowd talked Augmented Reality. The millennials in YETI shirts and the gray-haired post-hippies in psychedelic vests racked up points in a 3-D shootout on Space Pirate Trainer. And then there was Tim Porter, the guy with the hologram-creating Merge Cube. Using an app he developed, Mr. Porter pulled out his phone and put his 4-year-old daughter\u2019s stuffed penguin into the cube, virtually speaking.Austinites have a name for all this: a Tuesday night.It was just another event at the Capital Factory, Austin\u2019s techie community center and start-up hub \u2014 this time, a virtual reality holiday party. Located in an office and hotel complex downtown, the Capital Factory has helped a number of Austinites quit their day jobs to become tech entrepreneurs. The shared work space features a Star Wars-themed floor with Luke and Leia restrooms, local craft beer on tap and a conference room hidden, Hardy Boys-style, behind a bookcase that swings open when you press the right book (\u201cThe Plains of Passage\u201d).\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what you want to do, there are five Meetups at night that will support it,\u201d said Mr. Porter, 34, the founder and chief technology officer at Underminer Studios. \u201cIt\u2019s a maker community.\u201dFor decades, Austin was defined by the bureaucracy of state government, the academia of the University of Texas and the funkiness of its hippie-cowboy, Willie Nelson-inspired music and arts scene. Today, the tech culture and economy have transformed Texas\u2019 capital city and surrounding suburbs, creating jobs, worsening traffic, raising prices and changing the region\u2019s politics, tempo and brand.None of this is entirely new \u2014 people have been calling the Austin area\u2019s tech scene \u201cSilicon Hills\u201d since the late 1980s and early 1990s. But the slogan and the hype have now dramatically caught up.Apple\u2019s planned expansion has raised a host of unanswered questions about traffic, gentrification, affordability and competition for jobs.Austin consistently ranks high on the lists of cities with the worst traffic in America. And a recent housing market analysis found a shortage of 48,000 rental units affordable to households earning less than $25,000 per year. Supplies for middle-income families are also increasingly strained.\u201dI think in the last 10 years, it\u2019s been a real struggle for Austin to keep its identity and keep its soul, as downtown is being razed and converted into condos and high-rises, and you have people like Google and Facebook and Apple taking over the town with these buildings,\u201d said Omar Gallaga, who covered the city\u2019s tech culture for The Austin American-Statesman for more than 20 years. \u201cIf you have all the artists and the creative people that make it interesting move away because they can\u2019t afford to live there, then it becomes a different place.\u201dFew dispute that tech has turned Austin into one of the most vibrant and distinctive capital cities in America. Its other varied cultures \u2014 music, military, higher-ed, food, politics, journalism, real estate \u2014 are inseparable from its tech culture.Joseph Kopser, an Austinite who founded and sold a start-up called RideScout, made an unsuccessful but attention-grabbing run this year for a seat in Congress. A longtime venture capitalist, John Thornton, was the founder of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, Austin-based digital news organization that has helped transform Texas journalism. The nonprofit Austin Tech Alliance has launched get-out-the-vote efforts and helped city government shift to paperless permitting. One of the city\u2019s biggest annual cultural attractions, the South By Southwest festival, is now as much a celebration of tech as it is music and film.On any given day, some of the state\u2019s far-right lawmakers may be rubbing elbows downtown with 20-something entrepreneurs headed to work on motorized scooters \u2014 or perhaps, not long ago, passing by Professor Dumpster, otherwise known as Jeff Wilson, the co-founder of the start-up Kasita, who lived in a 33-square-foot dumpster for a year as part of an experiment in minimalist living.Austin is still weird. It\u2019s just more wired now, too.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to become Silicon Valley \u2014 we want to be Austin,\u201d said Joshua Baer, the founder and chief executive of the Capital Factory, launched in 2009 to mentor, finance and support start-ups and entrepreneurs. \u201cWhat makes Austin really different, to me, is the culture clash. But it\u2019s not a clash. It\u2019s the culture collaboration.\u201dThere are now more than 138,000 tech-related jobs in the Austin metropolitan region, about 14 percent of the total jobs in the area. Ray Perryman, an economist in Waco, estimated that the tech sector pumps about $31 billion into the area\u2019s overall economy, about 35 percent of the total. It is far from the biggest tech community in the country. In a ranking of the top tech-talent markets by CBRE, a commercial real estate company, Austin came up sixth, behind San Francisco, Seattle, Washington, Toronto and New York. But Austin\u2019s brand as a tech hub rivals that of some of its rivals, including other cities that have a larger tech presence.\u201cWe punch way above our weight class,\u201d said Barbary Brunner, the former chief executive of the Austin Technology Council, which was founded in the early 1990s and functions as the tech community\u2019s chamber of commerce. \u201cIf you\u2019re from outside Austin, you think the tech industry here is huge, super sophisticated, super mature. We don\u2019t have the innovation leaders here. We have executors here.\u201dThe buzz lately does not revolve solely around Apple. A different older global behemoth rarely embraced by hipster tech has become a major player \u2014 the United States Army. Months before Apple\u2019s announcement, the Army opened a new center in downtown Austin to help modernize its weapons and equipment and to identify, acquire and develop innovative technology.The Army Futures Command is the only so-called four-star command that is based not on a military installation but in a civilian building, in this case in the heart of the city in a satellite of the University of Texas. The soldiers mostly shun camouflage for button-down shirts and khakis. They have embedded in Austin\u2019s tech culture, military officials say, to help make the Army smarter and more cutting-edge. The leader of the Army Futures Command, Gen. John M. Murray, a four-star general who also wears casual business attire to work, has been meeting tech entrepreneurs, hanging out at the Capital Factory and recently attended his first Austin hackathon.\u201cOne of the things that we are working on \u2014 and we have not solidified yet, this is just still a concept \u2014 is can the Army work with venture capitalists?\u201d General Murray said, adding, \u201cI\u2019ve probably had, in the last couple months, a dozen or a dozen and a half conversations with VCs. For me, it\u2019s more about understanding, because this is all new to me. So, understanding the world they live in, what their requirements are, how they can help us and how we can help them.\u201dOne of the first outcomes of the Army\u2019s new venture was a mixed success. General Murray wanted the Army to work with an Austin-based start-up, Senseye, to help reduce the amount of time a pilot spends in training. It did not work out as planned, but the Army found another application for the company\u2019s technology.The Futures Command will be fully operational in the summer of 2019, and a staff of about 500 will take over two floors of the UT System building. Until then, a subset of the Futures Command called the Army Applications Lab has a team that works out of the Capital Factory.The day after the VR holiday party, Mr. Baer and the rest of Capital Factory hosted a visit from one of the Army\u2019s top officials, Ryan D. McCarthy, the Army under secretary. Mr. McCarthy told reporters that he felt \u201cpretty good\u201d about Apple\u2019s planned expansion, and the Army\u2019s expanding role in Austin. \u201cI think it just shows the wealth of talent and opportunity that exists here in this city and this state.\u201dDavid Montgomery contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Happens If ...", "Date": "2018-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe possibilities ahead in the Russia investigation suggest we are not reaching the end of a nightmare, but rather entering one. Opinion ColumnistI no longer think that anyone in America, including Donald Trump\u2019s most loyal supporters, can afford to put off the consideration of the central question of this administration: What if Donald Trump or those closest to him were compromised by the Russians or colluded with them?There have always been those of us on the left who viewed his presidency as compromised, asterisk-worthy if not wholly illegitimate, because of the Russian interference.A crime had been committed by Russia and Trump cheered the crime and used the loot thereof to advance his candidacy. That is clear.Members of Trump\u2019s team were extremely interested in and eager to accept any assistance that the Russians could provide. That is clear.But for the people who support and defend Trump, this has already been absorbed and absolved. They may not like it, but they are willing to overlook it. Indeed, they are so attached to Trump that his fortunes and his fate have become synonymous with theirs. There is a spiritual linkage, a baleful bond, between the man and his minions.But what happens if the evidence that the investigation by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, uncovers reveals a direct link between Trump and the Russians? How do Trump\u2019s boosters respond?If Trump was lying to or misleading the American people about his efforts to do business in Russia while running for president and the Russians knew \u2014 and presumably had evidence \u2014 that he wasn\u2019t being completely honest and forthcoming, then he was compromised.While it is by no means clear that the Russians ever used any information that they may have had to blackmail or otherwise pressure Trump, Cohen\u2019s plea makes clear that they had the material to do just that.How would Americans who support Trump now respond to evidence that Team Trump put their own personal and financial interests over the national interest? Would they break from their blind support and turn away from him and turn on him? How could they justify wearing the blinders for so long and countenancing so much? What language would they use to correct their complicity?There is a precedent in the Nixon investigation. When the evidence of wrongdoing was clear and incontrovertible, people began to peel away, tails tucked and full of shame.But that was a different time, one in which media wasn\u2019t so fractured and partisan, before the advent of social media and our current dissociable mentalities.Nixon had no propaganda arm. Trump has one. It\u2019s called Fox News. There is little daylight between the network\u2019s programming and the White House\u2019s priorities. If Trump goes down, so too does Fox, in some measure. So the network has a vested interest in defending Trump until the bitter end, and that narrative-crafting could impede an otherwise natural and normal disaffection with Trump.Furthermore, Trump does not strike me as a man amenable to contrition or one interested in the health and stability of the nation.I expect Trump to admit nothing, even if faced with proof positive of his own misconduct. There is nothing in the record to convince me otherwise. He will call the truth a lie and vice versa.I also don\u2019t think that Trump would ever voluntarily leave office as Nixon did, even if he felt impeachment was imminent. I\u2019m not even sure that he would willingly leave if he were impeached and the Senate moved to convict, a scenario that is hard to imagine at this point.I don\u2019t think any of this gets better, even as the evidence becomes clearer. I don\u2019t believe that Trump\u2019s supporters would reverse course in the same way that Nixon\u2019s did. I don\u2019t believe that the facts Mueller presents will be considered unassailable. I don\u2019t believe Trump will go down without bringing the country down with him.In short, I don\u2019t believe we are reaching the end of a nightmare, but rather we are entering one. This will not get easier, but harder.The country is about to enter the crucible. This test of our republic is without a true comparison. And we do not have a clear picture of how the test will resolve. But, I believe damage is certain.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Earth\u2019s Shell Has Cracked, and We\u2019re Drifting on the Pieces ", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bybasicsPlate tectonics helped make our planet stable and habitable. But the slow shifting of continents is still a mysterious process. The theory of plate tectonics is one of the great scientific advances of our age, right up there with Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution and Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity.The idea that Earth\u2019s outer shell is broken up into giant puzzle pieces, or plates, all gliding atop a kind of conveyor belt of hot, weak rock \u2014 here rising up from the underlying mantle, there plunging back into it \u2014 explains much about the structure and behavior of our home planet: the mountains and ocean canyons, the earthquakes and volcanoes, the very composition of the air we breathe.Yet success is no guarantee against a midlife crisis, and so it is that half a century after the basic mechanisms of plate tectonics were first elucidated, geologists are confronting surprising gaps in their understanding of a concept that is truly the bedrock of their profession.They are sparring over when, exactly, the whole movable plate system began. Is it nearly as ancient as the planet itself \u2014 that is, roughly 4.5 billion years old \u2014 or a youthful one billion years, or somewhere in between?They are asking what caused the shell to crack apart in the first place, and how the industrious recycling of Earth\u2019s crust began.They are comparing Earth with its sister planet, Venus. The two worlds are roughly the same size and built of similar rocky material, yet Earth has plate tectonics and Venus does not. Scientists want to know why.\u201cIn the 1960s and 70s, when people came up with the notion of plate tectonics, they didn\u2019t think about what it was like in the distant past,\u201d said Jun Korenaga, a geophysicist at Yale University.\u201cPeople were so busy trying to prove plate tectonics by looking at the present situation, or were caught up applying the concept to problems in their own field. The origin issue is a much more recent debate.\u201dResearchers also are exploring the link between plate tectonics and the evolution of complex life. Fortuitously timed continental collisions and mountain smackdowns may well have supplied crucial nutrients at key moments of biological inventiveness, like the legendary Cambrian explosion of 500 million years ago, when the ancestors of modern life-forms appeared.\u201cThe connection between deep Earth processes and Earth surface biology hasn\u2019t been thought about too clearly in the past, but that\u2019s changing fast,\u201d said Aubrey Zerkle, a geochemist at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland.It\u2019s increasingly obvious that \u201cyou need plate tectonics to sustain life,\u201d Dr. Zerkle added. \u201cIf there wasn\u2019t a way of recycling material between mantle and crust, all these elements that are crucial to life, like carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and oxygen, would get tied up in rocks and stay there.\u201dResearchers said that pinning down when and how Earth\u2019s vivid geological machinations arose will do more than flesh out our understanding of our home base. The answers could well guide our search for life and habitable planets beyond the solar system.Robert Stern, a geoscientist at the University of Texas at Dallas, argues that if we\u2019re looking for another planet to colonize, we want to avoid ones with signs of plate tectonic activity. Those are the places where life is likely to have evolved beyond the \u201csingle cell or worm stage, and we don\u2019t want to fight another technological civilization for their planet.\u201dThe idea that continents are not fixed but rather peregrinate around the globe dates back several centuries, when mapmakers began noticing the complementarity of various land masses \u2014 for example, the way the northeast bulge of South America looks as though it could fit snugly in the cupped palm of the southwest coast of Africa.But it wasn\u2019t until the mid-twentieth century that the generic notion of \u201ccontinental drift\u201d was transformed into a full-bodied theory, complete with evidence of a subterranean engine driving these continental odysseys.Geologists determined that Earth\u2019s outer layer is broken into eight or nine large segments and five or six smaller ones, a mix of relatively thin, dense oceanic plates riding low and thicker, lighter continental plates bobbing high.At large fissures on the ocean floor, melting rock from the underlying mantle rises up, adding to the oceanic plates. At other fracture points in the crust, oceanic plates are diving back inside, or subducting, their mass devoured in the mantle\u2019s hot belly.The high-riding continental plates are likewise jostled by the magmatic activity below, skating around at an average pace of one or two inches a year, sometimes crashing together to form, say, the Himalayan mountain chain, or pulling apart at Africa\u2019s Great Rift Valley.All this convective bubbling up and recycling between crust and mantle, this creative destruction and reconstruction of parts \u2014 \u201ctectonic\u201d comes from the Greek word for build \u2014 is Earth\u2019s way of following the second law of thermodynamics. The movement shakes off into the frigidity of space the vast internal heat that the planet has stored since its violent formation.And while shifting, crumbling plates may seem inherently unreliable, a poor foundation on which to raise a family, the end result is a surprising degree of stability. \u201cPlate tectonics is a relatively benign way for Earth to lose heat,\u201d said Peter Cawood, an Earth scientist at Monash University in Australia.\u201cYou get what are catastrophic events in localized areas, in earthquakes and tsunamis,\u201d he added. \u201cBut the mechanism allows Earth to maintain a stabler and more benign environment overall.\u201dUnfortunately for geologists, the very nature of plate tectonics obscures its biography. Oceanic crust, where the telltale mantle exchange zones are located, is recycled through the upwelling and subducting pipeline every 200 million years or so, which means hard evidence of tectonic origins was destroyed long ago.Continental crust is older, and rocks dating back more than 4 billion years have been identified in places like Jack Hills, Australia. But continental plates float above the subductive fray, revealing little of the system\u2019s origins.Nevertheless, geoscientists are doing their best with extant rocks, models and laboratory experiments to sketch out possible tectonic timelines. Dr. Korenaga and his colleagues have proposed that plate tectonics began very early, right after Earth\u2019s crust solidified from its initial magmatic state.\u201cThat is when the conditions would have been easiest for plate tectonics to get started,\u201d he said. At that point, he said, most of the water on Earth \u2014 delivered by comets \u2014 would still be on the surface, with little of it having found its way into the mantle. The heat convecting up through the mantle would exert a stronger force on dry rocks than on rocks that were lubricated.At the same time, the surface water would make it easier for the hot, twisting rocks beneath to crack the surface lid apart, rather as a sprinkling of water from the faucet eases the task of popping ice cubes from a tray. The cracking open of the surface lid, Dr. Korenaga said, is key to getting the all-mighty subduction engine started. With subduction established, water, like oceanic crust, would cycle between Earth\u2019s surface and mantle.On the opposite end of the origins debate is Dr. Stern, who argues that plate tectonics is a mere billion years old or less, and that Earth spent its first 3.5 billion years with a simple \u201csingle lid\u201d as its outer shell: a crust riddled with volcanoes and other means of heat ventilation, but no moving plates, no subduction, no recycling between inside and out.As evidence of the youthfulness of the plate regimen, Dr. Stern points to two classes of rocks: ophiolites and blueschist.Ophiolites are pieces of oceanic crust atop bits of underlying mantle that have made their way onto land and thus have escaped the relentless recycling of oceanic crust. Recent research has shown that ophiolites are not just any slice of oceanic crust, Dr. Stern said, but rather were formed by the forces of subduction.Similarly, blueschists are rocks that are fashioned under very high pressure but low temperatures, and \u201cthe only place you can do that is in a subduction zone,\u201d Dr. Stern said.Nearly all ophiolites are less than a billion years old, he added, while the most ancient blueschists, found in China, are just 800 million years old. No ophiolites, no blueschists, no evidence of subduction or plate tectonics.Most geologists opt for a middle ground. \u201cScience is a democratic process,\u201d said Michael Brown, a geologist at the University of Maryland and an editor of the themed issue, \u201cand the prevailing view is that Earth started to exhibit behaviors that look like plate tectonics 2.5 to 3 billion years ago.\u201dSignificantly, that chronology decouples plate tectonics from the origin of life on Earth: evidence of the earliest single-celled organisms dates back more than 3.6 billion years. Nevertheless, scientists view plate tectonics as vital to the sustained evolution of that primordial life.Plate tectonic activity did not just help to stabilize Earth\u2019s heat management system. The movement kept a steady supply of water shuttling between mantle and crust, rather than gradually evaporating from the surface.It blocked the dangerous buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by sucking excess carbon from the ocean and subducting it underground.

Trump; since then, to press Russian views on issues like the conflicts in Syria and Ukraine; and in the future \u2014 who knows? To wield influence, Russian online operators must first build an audience. Posing as Americans, they have to persuade Americans to pay attention and give them at least a modicum of trust.Two reports prepared for the Senate Intelligence Committee and released on Monday shed some light on how Russia does it. The reports identify some of the most popular of the images and themes created by the Internet Research Agency, which is based in St. Petersburg, Russia, and owned by a businessman with close ties to President Vladimir V. Putin. Here are a few of the Russians\u2019 greatest hits.\u201cAt least 50,000 homeless veterans are starving dying in the streets, but liberals want to invite 620,000 refugees and settle them among us. We have to take care of our own citizens, and it must be the primary goal for our politicians!\u201d640,390 \u2018Shares\u201987,750 LikesThe Internet Research Agency trolls sought to tap into powerful currents of emotion and opinion in the American electorate. Not surprisingly, one of those currents was faith. This simple image, like the veteran post above, presents a standoff between opposing forces \u2014 not veterans vs. refugees this time, but Christians vs. nonbelievers. By offering Instagram users the choices of liking the image or scrolling on, the Russian operators set up a gentle test of allegiance: Surely they would want to join the Army of Jesus!\u201cPLEASE HELP THIS VIDEO GO VIRAL.

Many of the posts aimed at African-Americans, like this one, were essentially apolitical and carried heartwarming messages. As in many of the Internet Research Agency memes, the image and message were not created in Russia but taken from elsewhere: in this case, an advertisement for a black-owned footwear company named Kahmune. Experts who have studied the Internet Research Agency say such posts build a loyal audience, essentially preparing the ground for whatever future political message the Russian government may want to spread.The Black Matters theme was first created on a Facebook page in June 2015. But in the months that followed, Internet Research Agency operators spread the same brand across many platforms: Google+, Twitter and Instagram, where @blackmattersus drew 28,466 followers and 1,929,855 engagements \u2014 likes and shares. A YouTube channel with the same name posted 95 videos. There were Facebook and Google ads. A podcast ran on SoundCloud linked to a blog on Tumblr. Like any commercial enterprise, the Russian troll factory built an image and brand name using every possible online tool \u2014 all of them provided by American companies.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump After Mattis", "Date": "2018-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Secretary of Defense worked to shield the world from President Trump\u2019s worst impulses. But even he had his limits. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.\u201cOur strength as a nation,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis inextricably linked to the strength of our unique and comprehensive system of alliances and partnerships.\u201dThat\u2019s apparently not the view held by President Trump, who ran for office calling for America to do less, calling for our allies to spend more and inviting rival nations to be more assertive.Some people thought that once Mr. Trump was in office and had shouldered presidential responsibilities, he would adopt a less knee-jerk view of how best to keep the nation safe and the free world free.Mr. Mattis, a respected and disciplined man, withstood Mr. Trump\u2019s chaotic approach to governing longer than Rex Tillerson, the former secretary of state, and H.R. McMaster, the former national security adviser. He worked to prevent or blunt dangerous and impulsive presidential decisions, and he often made a difference.Mr. Mattis helped persuade Mr. Trump not to pull out of NATO and worked to assure Europe that the United States remained committed to a common defense of the continent. Mr. Mattis offered the same assurances to America\u2019s allies in Asia, who are alarmed at an assertive China and unpredictable North Korea. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump, unconvinced of the value of the relationship with South Korea, threatened to withdraw forces there if Seoul didn\u2019t bear a larger share of the basing costs.When it came to other ill-considered presidential directives \u2014 a cruel ban on transgender troops and a self-aggrandizing military parade \u2014 Mr. Mattis quietly smothered the proposals with Pentagon bureaucracy.Although he couldn\u2019t prevent it, Mr. Mattis helped delay America\u2019s abrogation of the Iran nuclear deal. He was also unable to prevent upending decades of Middle East policy by moving the American Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem without gaining any ground toward peace.On Wednesday, the president said he would withdraw all 2,000 American troops, a decision that was welcome news to Russia, Iran and Turkey. It was a bitter betrayal of groups like the Kurds, who have fought and died alongside American soldiers for more than a decade.Presidents, of course, have the authority to make such decisions. But presidents also traditionally plan out such decisions carefully and coordinate them with allies, particularly if fighting is underway. Presidents have tremendous power to make national security policy. But Congress also has a role to play, and it now needs to forcefully assert that responsibility. More immediately, the Senate would be wise to hold out for a nominee for defense secretary who is more like Mr. Mattis than Mr. Trump.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Couple With Moebius Syndrome, Love Is Expressed From the Heart", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVowsAlex Barker wasn\u2019t expecting Erin Smith to smile when they met in 2015 after almost two years of getting to know each other online. He knew he wouldn\u2019t either. Not because he wasn\u2019t sure he would find her wonderful, but because, like her, he can\u2019t.\u201cWhen we started talking through the internet group, it suddenly became apparent that there was something more there than friendship,\u201d said Mr. Barker of Coventry, England. \u201cI can remember the first time we Skyped in January 2015. I thought, she\u2019s quite nice looking.\u201dThat wasn\u2019t the outcome Ms. Smith of Linwood, N.C., was necessarily looking for when she struck up a chat with Mr. Barker in 2014. \u201cI was just going through all the different people on the group, looking around, when I found Alex. I was like, \u2018Oh, wow, he lives in England,\u2019\u201d she said.Ms. Smith had visited London as a recent high school graduate in 1998 and dreamed about one day returning. \u201cI thought it would be kind of cool to have a friend there with the same condition,\u201d she said. When she sent her first message, a simple nice-to-meet-you, she was surprised by how quickly he responded.\u201cThen we just started talking all the time,\u201d she said. \u201cWe became really close.\u201d\u201cObviously, growing up was sometimes difficult,\u201d she said. In addition to her facial paralysis, Ms. Smith was born with a club foot. (Limb abnormalities are common among people with the syndrome.) \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t really picked on at school because we all grew up together and everybody knew me and my background,\u201d she said. The closeness of the community helped steer her past the feelings of alienation and loneliness that often set in early for children with Moebius. Her temperament helped, too.\u201cGoing through school, I never saw Erin come home completely upset or terrified. She didn\u2019t get bullied much mainly because of her personality,\u201d said Ms. Smith\u2019s father, Bobby Smith. \u201cShe\u2019s always been a cheerful, happy person. You can tell when she\u2019s smiling even if it\u2019s not on her face.\u201dThose closest to Ms. Smith say they can see the smile in her eyes. Both she and Mr. Barker also communicate their feelings verbally, and with affectionate hugs.During a 2015 video chat, he told her he had a week of vacation coming up that November and no plans. \u201cShe said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you come and see me?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI was like, that sounds quite good. I was thinking, if Erin and her family are the worst people ever, it\u2019s still a week in the States. I can still go and buy American things, so it\u2019ll be O.K.\u201dWhen Mr. Barker landed in North Carolina, the Smiths \u2014 Bobby and Erin\u2019s mother, Luann \u2014 did not make him want to flee for the nearest Walmart. \u201cAs soon as I met her family I felt at home,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re so warm and welcoming. And the second I met Erin I knew she was the girl for me. In my heart I was hoping that something would happen, but I didn\u2019t know if it would.\u201d\u201cHe said, \u2018Son, I want you to come back,\u2019\u201d Mr. Barker said. \u201cAnd I was like, what? Then he said he would pay for me to come back and surprise Erin for Valentine\u2019s Day.\u201d Mr. Barker didn\u2019t hesitate. He said yes to the offer.Ms. Smith chokes up when explaining why Valentine\u2019s Day 2016 was among the best days of her life. \u201cWe realized that week Alex came to visit that we were connected, and that this was meant to be,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I found out my father offered to bring him back out here for Valentine\u2019s Day, it was obvious my mom and dad knew as well.\u201dFor Mr. Barker, the Valentine\u2019s Day trip confirmed what he already knew. He was in love with Ms. Smith, and he wanted to spend the rest of his life with her.\u201cI never set out to fall in love with someone who has the same condition,\u201d he said. Like Ms. Smith, he had dated people without the syndrome. He was once engaged, briefly. \u201cBut actually I think it makes things so much easier,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there\u2019s one real connection between people with Moebius, it\u2019s the experience of being stared at. It can cause you to feel really isolated, because having a smile is so important. If you don\u2019t, people think you\u2019re unfriendly. Sometimes it\u2019s quite hard to meet people, because you become so self-aware about how you look as opposed to how everyone else looks.\u201dWith Ms. Smith, he added, \u201cwe\u2019ve got this shared bond, even though Erin is quite a bit less affected by the syndrome than me,\u201d he said. Mr. Barker has two club feet, which affects his gait but doesn\u2019t slow him down. And \u201cI don\u2019t have all my fingers and toes, so I find doing everyday things a bit more frustrating than she does.\u201dMr. Barker\u2019s physical limitations didn\u2019t stop him from orchestrating a proposal someone without disabilities might have found daring. And stressful.He was on a slatted boardwalk with a diamond engagement ring in his pocket \u2014 a family heirloom given to him by his godmother in England \u2014 and he wasn\u2019t sure how the proposal would unfold, or if he would drop the ring between the wooden planks when he got down on one knee.\u201cI\u2019ve played the moment back again and again and again in my head,\u201d Mr. Barker said. \u201cI said, \u2018Erin, will you be my wife?\u2019 And there was this moment of stunned silence. I was worried she was going to say no.\u201d Instead, she said, \u201cOf course I will.\u201d\u201cI was shocked,\u201d Ms. Smith said. But the shock gave way to love and gratitude. \u201cIt was an amazing moment. I called my parents right afterward. Some of my friends had said, he\u2019s going to propose in California.\u201d Even so, \u201cI still couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201dThe thrill of the engagement was followed by a dilemma: On which side of the Atlantic would they live as a married couple? For Ms. Smith, who spent the holidays in Coventry in 2016 and rung in 2017 there, the decision was difficult, but clear.\u201cI love England, so that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to live, but only for two to five years,\u201d she said. After that, they plan to move back to North Carolina. Her parents are happy for her, she knows. \u201cBut I also know they\u2019re also sad I\u2019m leaving.\u201dMr. Smith said he worries his daughter will be homesick. But \u201cAlex is going to take care of me and his parents are going to take care of me,\u201d she said. Brian and Florian Barker, Mr. Barker\u2019s parents, also live in Coventry; they welcomed her as warmly as the Smiths welcomed Mr. Barker when they first met him, and they consider her a daughter already. \u201cAlex and Erin have this connection where they recognize each other. They see each other as complete people,\u201d Mrs. Barker said.Ms. Mason, Ms. Smith\u2019s lifelong best friend, shared matron of honor duties with another best friend, Holly Whitten. Both wore long violet dresses, and each fought tears as Ms. Smith approached. \u201cI love them both to death. It\u2019s just the most wonderful love story,\u201d Ms. Mason said.The traditional ceremony performed by Mr. Rummage hit a snag when Mr. Barker had trouble fitting the ring over Ms. Smith\u2019s finger. But Mr. Barker wasted no time in regrouping. Seconds later, when he and Ms. Smith were pronounced married, they walked from the altar arm and arm to Stevie Wonder\u2019s \u201cSigned, Sealed, Delivered.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m yours!\u201d Mr. Barker sang out, pumping his arms as he and Ms. Smith strutted into their future.Continue following our fashion and lifestyle coverage on Facebook (Styles and Modern Love), Twitter (Styles, Fashion, and Vows) and Instagram.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Oil Industry\u2019s Covert Campaign to Rewrite American Car Emissions Rules", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut it turns out that there was a hidden beneficiary of the plan that was pushing for the changes all along: the nation\u2019s oil industry.The campaign\u2019s main argument for significantly easing fuel efficiency standards \u2014 that the United States is so awash in oil it no longer needs to worry about energy conservation \u2014 clashed with decades of federal energy and environmental policy.The industry had reason to urge the rollback of higher fuel efficiency standards proposed by former President Barack Obama. A quarter of the world\u2019s oil is used to power cars, and less-thirsty vehicles mean lower gasoline sales.Gary R. Heminger, Marathon\u2019s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement that the company supported \u201csound fuel economy standards\u201d and wanted to \u201chelp ensure they are achievable and based on existing technology.\u201d He added, \u201cWe appreciate the administration\u2019s willingness to conduct a thorough review in order to ensure future standards are achievable and will actually benefit American consumers.\u201dA spokesman for Koch Industries, the energy conglomerate led by Mr. Koch, said the company had \u201ca long, consistent track record of opposing all forms of corporate welfare, including all subsidies, mandates and other handouts that rig the system.\u201dThe standards that the Trump administration seeks to weaken required automakers to roughly double the fuel economy of new cars, SUVs and pickup trucks by 2025. Instead, the Trump plan would freeze the standards at 2020 levels. Carmakers, for their part, had sought more flexibility in meeting the original 2025 standards, not a categorical rollback.The energy industry\u2019s efforts also help explain the Trump administration\u2019s confrontational stance toward California, which, under federal law, has a unique authority to write its own clean-air rules and to mandate more zero-emissions vehicles.California has pledged to stick to the stricter standards, together with 13 other states that follow its lead. But President Trump\u2019s plan challenges California\u2019s rule-writing power, setting up a legal battle that threatens to split the American auto market in two. \u201cHowever, you have another side who doesn\u2019t want to pivot away\u201d from the stricter rules, Mr. Heminger said. \u201cSo we have a lot of work to do to keep this momentum going.\u201d\u201cOur CEO, Gary Heminger, would be very glad for an opportunity to visit with the Administrator,\u201d a Marathon lobbyist wrote in an email to Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team on May 8, 2017. \u201cI believe this would be a constructive dialogue.\u201d The E.P.A. helps oversee fuel economy rules along with the Transportation Department.A Marathon spokesman, Chuck Rice, said Mr. Heminger did not discuss auto-efficiency rollbacks with Mr. Pruitt. An E.P.A. official did not respond to a question about whether the auto rules were discussed.Mr. Rice of Marathon said the company did not write the letter, and the company declined to say who did. It did not offer an explanation for Mr. Birsic\u2019s digital fingerprint on the document file.Representatives from the three state delegations either declined to comment or did not respond to requests. Senator Tom Carper of Delaware, the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, criticized the industry\u2019s campaign. \u201cIt appears as though oil interests are cynically trying to gin up support in Congress for the weakest possible standards to ensure that cars and SUVs have to rely on even more oil,\u201d he said. \u201cIf this attempt is successful, the outcome will be a blow to the auto industry, consumers, and our environment.\u201dMore than 3,300 of the 12,000 public comments that D.O.T. has made public contain language identical to that petition, an analysis of the files showed.Derrick Morgan, a senior vice president at AFPM, said the group \u201cregularly works with policymakers, coalition groups and individuals to promote shared goals,\u201d and also will \u201clead and join groups like Energy4US.\u201dThe Department of Transportation said it was \u201cgenerally aware\u201d that there were groups urging the public to make comments through online campaigns, but said it does not regulate them.In Dearborn, Mich., at a September meeting on the Trump fuel-efficiency rollbacks, Annie Patnaude of Americans for Prosperity, a Koch-funded group, spoke in favor. \u201cThis is a step in the right direction to protect consumers and workers against government mandates that would limit choice,\u201d she said. But Americans for Prosperity said fights like these get to the heart of its free-market philosophy. \u201cWe believe in a level playing field so all Americans have the equal opportunity to succeed,\u201d said Bill Riggs, a spokesman for the group, in a statement. The organization will keep fighting \u201cmandates that unfairly pick winners and losers in any industry,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a relic,\u201d the memo said, particularly at a time when the United States was \u201cpoised to become the largest oil producer in the world.\u201d Emails obtained by the Times show that Marathon has been working with members of the legislative exchange council to build support for the Trump fuel-efficiency rollback in state legislatures and to denounce California\u2019s power to write its own rules for cars. The emails were made public under Wisconsin\u2019s open records law to Documented, a watchdog group that tracks corporate influence in public policy. California\u2019s special authority could effectively split the American auto market in two, since 13 other states \u2014 representing roughly 35 percent of nationwide car sales \u2014 have agreed to follow California\u2019s stricter rules. That means automakers might find themselves making cars to two competing standards.\u201cWho should decide what cars and trucks consumers should buy, consumers themselves or unelected bureaucrats in Sacramento, California or Washington, D.C.?\u201d the memo sent by Marathon said.In a statement, Bill Meierling of the legislative exchange council said that mandating fuel economy was a rule that \u201cmany state legislators believe doesn\u2019t make sense for working Americans.\u201d Just days after the emails between Marathon and the Wisconsin lawmaker, some 1,500 state legislators and other officials from across the country gathered in New Orleans to cheer on Elaine Chao, the Secretary of Transportation, at the legislative exchange council\u2019s annual convention. Marathon sponsored the event.Advertisement"}

There has always been a secondhand market, as long as humans have been wearing clothes.\u201dHowever, Ms. Butchart said, \u201cThe industry is definitely changing, and fashion cycles are becoming shorter. Before, the cycle was 20 years, but now it can be five. So we\u2019re seeing trends coming back as soon as five years later.\u201dBut who can name a bona fide trend of five years ago, anyway? What was happening clothes-wise in 2013 again? It is difficult to predict what the future of vintage will look like, and what styles will be remembered favorably from the last 10 years.\u201cWhen we\u2019re living through an era, it\u2019s quite difficult to have an overriding view of it as a whole. Or be able to imagine how future generations might look back on it,\u201d Ms. Butchart said. \u201cWe can\u2019t say that we won\u2019t be able to look back at the 2010s in the future, and recognize fashion from that period.

The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.China, already an aggressive rising power known to flout the rule of law and disregard human rights, now seems to be using hostage-taking to resolve economic and diplomatic disputes.That reinforced the suspicions of many in China who think that the United States is using the businesswoman, Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of the giant Chinese technology company Huawei, as a hostage, too.Although Mr. Kovrig is understood to have been seen once by a Canadian consular office, few details about the three Canadians, their conditions and the charges against them have been released. It is not unusual for prisoners detained by China to be held in solitary confinement with the lights on 24 hours a day and be subject to prolonged interrogation, even torture.China\u2019s legal system is opaque and weighted overwhelmingly in favor of the government and against the ordinary people who get caught up in it. The Foreign Ministry said Ms. McIver had been working illegally, and it\u2019s not clear that her case is related to that of the two others. Mr. Kovrig, a former Canadian diplomat working for the International Crisis Group, a Washington nongovernmental research group, and Mr. Spavor, an entrepreneur specializing in business with North Korea, were reportedly being investigated over \u201cactivities that endanger China\u2019s national security.\u201dSuch moves are likely to chill the atmosphere in China for other diplomats and foreign businesspeople trying to work there.The arrests have added a complicating layer to an already bitter trade war between the United States and China. They have drawn a sharp protest from the Chinese government, rattled financial markets and raised suspicions among Chinese officials that at least some Trump administration officials were trying to sabotage a trade deal.Huawei and Ms. Meng, the daughter of the company\u2019s founder, are part of China\u2019s corporate elite, and her detention has brought huge domestic political pressure on President Xi Jinping.There is so far no evidence that Ms. Meng\u2019s arrest is anything more than a part of the Trump administration\u2019s aggressive enforcement of the sanctions regime against Iran. Such interference in a judicial process would undermine the rule of law and encourage countries to detain each other\u2019s citizens as a weapon of economic and political warfare.Advertisement"}

It feels as if the only constant is change, and that means we\u2019re forever at the whim of other people\u2019s judgments, opinions and decisions. It\u2019s unsettling at best. At worst, it\u2019s crippling.As 2018 began, though, I felt empowered by the knowledge that turning my failures into accomplishments would mean I\u2019d be gaming the system. Both acceptances and rejections would count as a sort of win, and I liked those odds.But, of course, I couldn\u2019t just take the compliment and move on. Instead, I explained that statistically speaking, I\u2019m a giant, pathetic failure.[Never be uninteresting.

I emailed Angela Duckworth, the author of \u201cGrit: The Power and Passion of Perseverance,\u201d to ask her what she thought of my rejection resolution. She made me feel scientifically sane.Dr. Duckworth explained that what I was doing was \u201cexposure therapy\u201d\u2014 making myself more comfortable with failure to reduce my fear of it. It was a relief, sitting at my desk, scrolling through the same inbox that contained messages like \u201cnot at this time,\u201d \u201cnot a fit\u201d and \u201cunfortunately,\u201d to see an expert in tenacity and achievement say that all this rejection was actually helpful.

I\u2019m so tired, and that\u2019s how I know I did it right. If I weren\u2019t exhausted, it would mean I\u2019d just spent the last year asking for things without putting in the work to earn them.

Andy is still unattached, and I\u2019m still living paycheck to paycheck. But we\u2019ve taken more chances and come closer to getting the things we want.So I don\u2019t regret committing to this masochistic rejection project. It made me feel embarrassed, depressed, overwhelmed and self-indulgent. But I also felt that I was moving forward instead of standing still.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Russian Trolls Came for Instagram, Too", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bythe ShiftA look at posts from the Internet Research Agency reveals that the group used Instagram for several distinct purposes.In the wake of the 2016 election, Instagram \u2014 known as the home of preening influencers, artfully arranged grain bowls and Icelandic vacation photos \u2014 somehow escaped much of the scrutiny of other social networks.But two new reports suggest that may have been a mistake. The reports, conducted by independent groups and released by the Senate Intelligence Committee on Monday, concluded that Instagram \u2014 which is owned by Facebook \u2014 became a favored tool of Russian internet trolls after the 2016 election.According to the reports, which were based on a trove of data provided by social media companies, Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency operated a vast network of accounts on Instagram that sought to infiltrate American identity groups, harden ideological divides and sow distrust in the American political system.Much of the group\u2019s activity was concentrated among several dozen large accounts, including one called @blackstagram_ and another called @american.veterans, both of which had more than 200,000 followers. Many of the group\u2019s accounts targeted specific identity groups, including African-Americans, gun-rights supporters and anti-immigration activists.\u201cOur assessment is that Instagram is likely to be a key battleground on an ongoing basis,\u201d the researchers wrote. Facebook responded by saying in statement: \u201cAs we\u2019ve said all along, Congress and the intelligence community are best placed to use the information we and others provide to determine the political motivations of actors like the Internet Research Agency. We continue to fully cooperate with officials investigating the I.R.A.\u2019s activity on Facebook and Instagram around the 2016 election.\u201dA closer look at the Internet Research Agency\u2019s posts reveals that the group used Instagram for several distinct purposes.As on other social networks, the I.R.A. used Instagram posts before the 2016 election to generate support for Donald J. Trump and attack Hillary Clinton.One post, made by an Instagram account called @feminism_tag, accused Ms. Clinton of insulting women who had accused her husband, Bill Clinton, of sexual misconduct. Another post targeted at African-American voters showed a manipulated image of Ms. Clinton with braided hair, and was captioned \u201cwhen you need the black vote.\u201d In all, roughly 7 percent of the more than 100,000 Instagram posts included in the data set mentioned Ms. Clinton, while 11 percent mentioned Mr. Trump. There were no instances of pro-Clinton content on Instagram, according to the New Knowledge report.Many of the Russian posts focused on developing audiences among specific American identity groups, which could then be used to target them with content and advertising later on.Several of the I.R.A.\u2019s most popular Instagram accounts focused on African-American themes and interests. One image, posted to the @blackstagram_ account in June 2017, showed a series of women's legs, with skin tones ranging from light to dark. The caption read, \u201cAll the tones are nude! Get over it!\u201d It received more than 250,000 likes and more than 6,000 comments.Another image, posted to an account called @army_of_jesus, encouraged users to \u201clike if you believe,\u201d and \u201ckeep scrolling if you don\u2019t.\u201d The account, which originally shared Kermit the Frog memes and jokes from \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d was later repurposed to target conservative Christians.Several of the Instagram posts traced to Russia offered merchandise for sale. One post, shared by the @stay4police account, advertised T-shirts and hooded sweatshirts that read \u201cI Support American Law Enforcement.\u201d Other posts encouraged black Instagram users to support black-owned businesses with the hashtag #buyblack, and offered natural skin care products and other merchandise targeted at a black audience.These merchandise sales most likely were not lucrative for the I.R.A. Instead, researchers suggested, selling merchandise had two other benefits: first, it allowed Russians to collect names, addresses and other personal information from users; second, it allowed them to identify strong supporters of a cause, who could then be targeted with advertisements.In the days leading up to the 2016 election, some I.R.A.-linked Instagram accounts were used to seed doubts about the integrity of the election, and to accuse Democrats of trying to rig the vote in their favor. One image, shared by conservative-focused Instagram accounts, contained a false accusation of voter fraud in Pennsylvania. It was shared to Twitter and Facebook as well.After Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, the I.R.A.\u2019s Instagram focus became more intense. In the six months following the election, the I.R.A. more than tripled its Instagram posting frequency, while its activity on Facebook increased by only 59 percent.During this time, the Instagram accounts associated with Russia continued to post partisan content, much of which was recycled from other accounts.The Russian Instagram accounts reached their peak of activity in May 2017, then experienced a sharp decline until October of that year, when they essentially disappeared from view.Advertisement"}

The year some heads rolled, and lives were ruined, and the year many tales were forgotten too quickly or discredited in too brutal a manor. The year of too much jumping on the bandwagon. The year of attempted payback, misguided payback and zero payback. The year of not enough follow-through and pitiful justice.

During my travels, interviewers asked for my opinion on American politics. Everyone wanted to know what the problem was: Had America succumbed to fake news \u2014 had the fake become real?In 1988 I wrote a short essay about my artistic theories. In it, I discussed something I called \u201cArtificial Realism,\u201d an artistic style I employed in my own paintings, and one I defined in part as \u201cthe appearance of reality through the representation of the artificial.\u201dIn the 30 years since, Artificial Realism has moved beyond the realm of art to take over global politics, setting off a nuclear explosion in the realm of truth. In 2018, truth has been blown to smithereens.Social media is the main culprit for the rise of this artificial-realist politics. I created this painting, \u201cFacebook,\u201d to exorcise the lies that I believe are inherent in a culture of friends who friend you and are not your friends \u2014 an agglomeration of bots, trolls and alien information.The message of politics today is fear, and, unfortunately, fear is working.

And yet nothing can numb me to the cruelty, to the monstrosity, of the Trump administration\u2019s actions against innocent immigrant children in the United States.In these dark times, I look for refuge in \u201cRequiem,\u201d a poem by the Russian poet Anna Akhmatova:I have a lot of work to do today; I need to slaughter memory, Turn my living soul to stone Then teach myself to live again.Alfredo Jaar is a Chilean-born conceptual artist whose wide-ranging work tackles issues related to social injustice, inequality and sociopolitical division.

Pakistani women now make up roughly 22 percent of the nation\u2019s workers, according to the World Bank. Though that number is lower than all of Pakistan\u2019s South Asian neighbors except for Afghanistan, it nonetheless represents a dramatic change for a country in which women traditionally worked in the home.Accompanying the rise of the female worker has been an increased awareness of sexual harassment on the job. The 2010 passage of a law criminalizing workplace harassment helped pave the way for Pakistan\u2019s own #MeToo movement. Today, victims are fighting back and using social media as a tool to seek justice. Earlier this year, the director of the National College of Arts in Rawalpindi was removed after facing sexual harassment allegations. And in April, Meesha Shafi, a well-known Pakistani actress and singer, posted a tweet claiming that a former male colleague of hers who is a pop star and Bollywood actor had sexually harassed her \u2014 a charge he denied.My artwork \u2014 a tapestry of sequins and beads inspired by the covers of Urdu pulp novels \u2014 is an attempt to address the ways in which sexual assault continues to subjugate Pakistani women in 2018.

Roosevelt laid out his vision of a world based on \u201cfour essential human freedoms\u201d: freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want and freedom from fear. Two years later, Norman Rockwell painted a series of oils illustrating Roosevelt\u2019s principles, published in successive issues of The Saturday Evening Post and later used to sell war bonds.I came across Rockwell\u2019s iconic \u201cFour Freedoms\u201d a few years ago and was astounded by the beauty of the images and the power with which they represented the classic American values of family, faith, freedom and security. But I was also astounded by what was missing: America\u2019s ethnic and cultural diversity. It appeared that in Rockwell\u2019s vision, and perhaps Roosevelt\u2019s, those values were reserved for white Anglo-Saxon Protestants. All other Americans \u2014 Native, Latino, Asian, African, Catholic, Jewish, Muslim, L.G.B.T. \u2014 were expected to enjoy those freedoms in the shadows, if at all. I asked myself: What would Rockwell\u2019s paintings look like if they were updated to reflect a more heterogeneous America?With the help of my friend, the photographer Emily Shur, I\u2019ve tried to answer that question. We\u2019ve reproduced Rockwell\u2019s paintings as photographs, both to mark the 75th anniversary of the original works and to highlight the America we believe in \u2014 a country where everyone is represented and valued, regardless of their social status, faith or ethnic background. To reflect this multiplicity, we created multiple versions of Rockwell\u2019s paintings casting a diverse range of people. The images you see here are only four of the nearly 80 photographs we produced.In 2018, the vibrant and diverse America represented by these photographs is arguably under greater threat than at any time since Rockwell produced his paintings. Now, more than ever, it\u2019s worth remembering that progress is a journey, and that the road is always under construction.Hank Willis Thomas is an American conceptual artist exploring the intersection of race, mass media and popular culture.

{"Headline": "The Corporate Donors Behind a Republican Power Grab", "Date": "2018-12-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWalgreens and other major companies are key supporters of the Wisconsin legislators now trying to undermine democracy.Opinion ColumnistWalgreens portrays itself as the friendly neighborhood drugstore. It gives flu shots to children, helps communities after storms, donates to charity \u2014 and makes feel-good advertisements trumpeting its various good deeds.But Walgreens also has a tougher side, one you won\u2019t see in those ads. To protect a tax break, the company has allied itself with Wisconsin\u2019s brutally partisan Republican Party. That party is now in the midst of a power grab, stripping authority from Wisconsin\u2019s governor and attorney general solely because Republicans lost those offices last month. The power grab comes after years of extreme gerrymandering, which lets Republicans dominate the legislature despite Wisconsin being a closely divided state.The story of Walgreens and Wisconsin has its roots in a decade-old court case.In 2008, the State Supreme Court ruled in favor of an aggressive tax strategy by the company, in a case known as Walgreens v. City of Madison. When calculating the property taxes it owed, Walgreens used an artificially low valuation of its stores. It did not pay taxes based on the actual value of those stores, as reflected by their purchase price and rent. Instead, it took into account the value of vacant stores nearby.A few weeks later, Walgreens donated $1,000 to Vos. Over the summer, it donated another $6,000 to the Committee to Elect a Republican Senate. A couple of weeks before Election Day, the company gave $1,000 to Fitzgerald. These donations weren\u2019t simply a matter of spreading money around. Walgreens did not donate to state-level Democrats this year, as it has in the past.\u201cIt would be healthier for companies to spend a little more time thinking about the meaning of these donations,\u201d as Judd Legum, author of the political newsletter Popular Information, told me. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s all transactional.\u201d In recent months, Legum\u2019s reporting has caused Facebook, Google, Walmart, Major League Baseball and others to ask for the return of donations to politicians whose values the companies were not comfortable defending.So far, Walgreens has not been willing to do the same in Wisconsin. I asked the company last week what it thought about the recent events in Wisconsin, and it ducked the question. But Phil Caruso, a Walgreens spokesman, told me the company was \u201cin the process of evaluating\u201d the situation.The silence of major companies is disappointing because they could actually make a difference. Republican politicians care about the opinions of their corporate backers.I realize that being able to operate in a well-functioning democracy doesn\u2019t bring the same obvious bottom-line benefits as, say, a tax break. But our corporate leaders are making a big mistake if they decide that democracy doesn\u2019t matter.Advertisement"}

It may not have been the first vial of vaccine ever delivered that way, but it was the first in Vanuatu, which is the only country in the world to make its childhood vaccine program officially drone-dependent.\u201cI am so happy the drone brought the stick medicine to Cook\u2019s Bay as I don\u2019t have to walk several hours to Port Narvin for her vaccines,\u201d her mother, Julie Nowai told a Unicef representative. \u201cIt is only 15 minutes\u2019 walk from my home.\u201dAlso, many vaccines need refrigeration, and most villages have no electricity.So the country, with support from Unicef, the Australian government and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, began its drone program on Monday. It will initially serve three islands but may be expanded to many more.That will have to be handled carefully, a Unicef representative said.Unlike military drones \u2014 which fly high and sometimes fire missiles \u2014 commercial drones must venture in low, dodge trees, land gently and even return with payloads, such as blood samples. As drones have improved, their potential uses in global health have rapidly increased, and many countries and charitable groups are considering them.Zipline has plans to start delivering vaccines in Rwanda within weeks and in Ghana early in 2019.Emergency drops of rabies vaccine for children bitten by dogs will be the first priority, said Dr. Seth F. Berkley, chief executive officer of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which joined the package delivery company U.P.S. in supporting the Rwandan effort.Vanuatu is \u201cthe perfect environment for this,\u201d said Sheldon Yett, Unicef\u2019s Pacific islands representative.Its population is small and widely spread out, the government is enthusiastic, and there are \u201cno issues with crowded skies,\u201d as in bigger island countries like Indonesia, he said.But \u201cwe don\u2019t want to over-promise,\u201d he added. \u201cWe want to start slowly.\u201dMiriam Nampil, the 55-year-old nurse who gave the shots, lives in Port Narvin, a coastal town whose clinic has a solar-powered refrigerator.\u201cThis drone will change my life,\u201d she said through a translator. \u201cNormally, I must trek about two hours over the mountain each way, and the vaccine carriers are heavy.\u201dRound trip by boat is about $70 \u2014 too much for the health ministry budget, she said, and only safe on calm days.With its eight-foot wingspan, the white Swoop drone resembles a robot albatross. But it lacks that bird\u2019s calm, ghostly floating flight pattern. Instead, it shrieks with the enraged buzz of a disturbed hornets\u2019 nest as it shoots straight up in the air and zooms off at speeds of up to 60 miles an hour.It can maintain 500 feet of altitude in the hot tropical climate and can handle rain and 30-mile-an-hour gusts, said Eric Peck, a former Australian Air Force pilot who founded Swoop with Josh Tepper, a drone racer and robotics expert.The drone will soon be doing 80-mile round trips, Mr. Peck said, and because it communicates with the Iridium satellite network, it can be piloted from anywhere in the world and will fly even if local cell networks go down, which happens frequently.Eventually, he said, Swoop will train local pilots and help the health ministry build its own drones by attaching mail-order engines to carbon-fiber wings that can be produced on a 3-D printer.To introduce Vanuatu\u2019s drone era, nurses are meeting local villagers, and national aviation officials invite them to watch test flights.\u201cWe need to make sure people aren\u2019t spooked by a buzzing thing in the sky descending on them,\u201d Mr. Yett said. \u201cWe want to make sure some kid with a catapult doesn\u2019t shoot it down.\u201dThe cults date back more than 100 years, but reached their zenith during and after World War II.The legend spread that the cargo was gifts from the ancestors, but that it had been intercepted and stolen by the foreigners. After the war ended, the cults built airstrips and model planes to lure the \u201cbirds\u201d back.John Frum, a messianic figure, is sometimes portrayed as a black American sailor or sergeant (\u201cJohn from America\u201d) whose symbol is a red cross like that on military medical tents and whose return will trigger an apocalypse, deliver vast piles of cargo, and make whites and Melanesians change places in the power hierarchy.On Vanuatu\u2019s Tanna Island, the Frum movement was so powerful that it spawned a political party. During the 1970s independence movement, it opposed the creation of a national government and espoused a return to traditional Melanesian customs.The health ministry plans to eventually fly drones on Tanna, which may provoke unpredictable responses.\u201cWe\u2019ll go gingerly, very carefully, introducing people to the technology and looking at their reactions,\u201d Mr. Yett said.But the right people to do that \u201care local leaders, not Americans with fancy degrees,\u201d he said. \u201cOur goal isn\u2019t to put our thumb on the scale of local belief systems; it\u2019s to make sure kids are immunized.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Truth was not an absolute. It was a matter of power. Of perspective. Of narrative. \u201cTruth is a thing of this world,\u201d wrote Michel Foucault. \u201cEach society has its regime of truth, its \u2018general politics\u2019 of truth: that is, the types of discourse which it accepts and makes function as true.\u201dFor decades, the left sought to dethrone reverence for the Constitution. \u201cThe Constitution,\u201d wrote progressive historian Howard Zinn, \u201cserves the interests of a wealthy elite\u201d and enables \u201cthe elite to keep control with a minimum of coercion, a maximum of law \u2014 all made palatable by the fanfare of patriotism and unity.\u201dFor decades, the left sought to enthrone identity politics. \u201cWe believe that the most profound and potentially most radical politics come directly out of our own identity, as opposed to working to end somebody else\u2019s oppression,\u201d reads the 1977 statement of the black feminist Combahee River Collective, one of the key documents in the development of contemporary U.S. identity politics.To an audience of nearly 500 new graduates and their families at the historically black college, the Massachusetts senator laid out a bleak vision of America. \u201cThe rules are rigged because the rich and powerful have bought and paid for too many politicians,\u201d she said. \u201cThe rich and powerful want us pointing fingers at each other so we won\u2019t notice they are getting richer and more powerful,\u201d she said. \u201cTwo sets of rules: one for the wealthy and the well-connected. And one for everybody else,\u201d she said.\u201cThat\u2019s how a rigged system works,\u201d she said.Of course, Warren and Trump have very different ideas as to just who the malefactors of great wealth really are. Is it Sheldon Adelson or George Soros? The Koch brothers or the Ford Foundation? Posterity will be forgiven if it loses track of which alleged conspiracy to rig the system was of the far-right and which was of the far left.At some point, it will be worth asking Senator Warren: Rigged compared to when? A generation ago a black president would have been unthinkable. Two generations ago, a woman on the Supreme Court. And rigged compared to what? Electoral politics in Japan, which have been dominated by a single party for decades? The class system in Brazil, dominated by a single race for centuries?For now, Democratic voters might think twice about embracing a candidate whose dark, distorting ideas about America bear such an uncomfortable resemblance to those of the president they detest.

{"Headline": "After Citizens United, a Vicious Cycle of Corruption", "Date": "2018-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnconstrained outside spending on elections is corrosive to our democracy.Mr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.So how did they conduct this delicate transaction?First, Ryan, Coleman and others \u201claid out a case to Adelson about how crucial it is to protect the House,\u201d according to Politico\u2019s report. Then Ryan \u201cleft the room, Coleman made the \u2018ask\u2019 and secured the $30 million contribution.\u201dThe crucial section of Citizens United reads as follows:The appearance of influence or access, furthermore, will not cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy. By definition, an independent expenditure is political speech presented to the electorate that is not coordinated with a candidate. The fact that a corporation, or any other speaker, is willing to spend money to try to persuade voters presupposes that the people have the ultimate influence over elected officials. This is inconsistent with any suggestion that the electorate will refuse \u201cto take part in democratic governance\u201d because of additional political speech made by a corporation or any other speaker.The surge in outside spending unconstrained by contribution limits is a central element of current campaign finance practice.Four decades later, there\u2019s little need for furtive fund-raising or secret handoffs of cash. Many of the corporate executives convicted of campaign-finance crimes during Watergate could now simply write a check to their favorite super PAC or, if they want to keep it secret, to a compliant nonprofit group. Corporations can spend as much as they want to help their favored candidates, no longer prohibited by law from spending company cash on elections. The political world has, in many respects, come full circle since a botched burglary funded by illicit campaign cash brought down an administration. In fact, there are scholars on both the left and right who agree with Citizens United because they think restricting campaign spending by businesses constitutes an incursion on First Amendment rights that could lead to censorship, for example, of books and newspapers.Allowing government to control who can spend enough to get heard on a grander scale would render freedom of speech illusory.implausibly downplaying, and at times all but denying, the baleful corruption of American politics by means short of criminal bribery \u2014 by means that are lamentable precisely because they are lawful.The key changes in campaign finance practices over the past eight years stem from the ruling in Citizens United and Speech Now that contributions to independent expenditure committees, including super PACs, pose no threat of \u201cquid pro quo\u201d political corruption. There is no corruption, Justice Kennedy wrote in Citizens United, because \u201can independent expenditure is political speech presented to the electorate that is not coordinated with a candidate.\u201dThe supposed barrier between candidates and unrestricted super PACs is flimsier than ever. As midterm elections approach, complaints are rolling into the F.E.C. from both parties about super PACs that share vendors, fund-raisers and video footage with the politicians they support.Candidate assistance with super PAC fund-raising efforts has pushed at the boundaries of this legally mandated independence, allowing a level of coordination that many observers believe creates a real threat of quid pro quo corruption.Although these groups may not coordinate their expenditures with those of an official campaign, their managers often understand that their job is to attack an opponent while the candidate they support takes a higher road. Super PACs have been called \u201cthe attack dogs and provocateurs of modern politics.\u201d The advertisements they produce contribute to the nation\u2019s cynicism about politics, a cynicism that runs especially deep among young people. The candidates they support need not take responsibility for what they say, and the groups usually disappear once an election is over.A strong critic of the Supreme Court decision, Sanford Levinson, a member of the law school faculty and the department of government at the University of Texas, argued in an email to me that:Citizens United reveals the importance of having a Supreme Court completely devoid of a single individual who has ever participated in electoral politics. This helps to reinforce, I believe, the tendency of the Justices to think in terms of arid formalistic abstractions \u2014 including Kennedy\u2019s views about corporations and the First Amendment \u2014 rather than address the actual realities of our political system.It is the height of hubris for the Court, by a vote of five justices on a bench of nine, simply to dismiss concerns for electoral integrity on the ground that electoral integrity is a question of law rather than of social fact.In one section of a detailed critique he sent me, Wertheimer wrote:The Court in Citizens United stated, \u201cLimits on independent expenditures, such as (the ban on corporate expenditures) have a chilling effect extending well beyond the Government\u2019s interest in preventing quid pro quo corruption. The anticorruption interest is not sufficient to displace the speech here in question.\u201d This is a remarkably misguided statement in that the Court is asserting that the foundational need of our nation to be able to protect itself from the corruption of our government is outweighed by the constitutional right of a corporation to make unlimited expenditures to influence elections.The court, Wertheimer continued, was \u201cmisguided and na\u00efve\u201d in making theassertion in Citizens United without citing a single piece of evidence for this finding that \u201cthe appearance of influence or access, furthermore, will not cause the electorate to lose faith in this democracy.\u201dIn the face of all this criticism, does Justice Kennedy, the now-retired author of Citizens United, have any second thoughts?intervention in the political process has been defined by a lack of prescience or success. What the majority in Citizens United had to say about corporate independent expenditures and the risk of corruption seemed entirely divorced from reality.The court has createda world in which both the parties and candidates can indirectly but effectively raise and benefit from unlimited donations purportedly expended on an \u201cindependent basis.\u201dJustice Kennedy, Bauer continued,Because Buckley prohibited the state from regulating independent expenditures while allowing it to regulate contributions, it \u201cproduced a system in which candidates face an unlimited demand for campaign funds (because expenditures generally cannot be capped) but a constricted supply (because there is often a ceiling on the amount each contributor can give) \u2026 The result is an unceasing preoccupation with fund-raising.\u201dCitizens United has turned campaign finance into a system universally disdained by the public, a system even more ethically unmoored than the one obtained before Watergate in the days when, to quote Eggen again:The money poured into Richard M. Nixon\u2019s re-election campaign from all corners: Six-figure checks flown by corporate jet from Texas; bundles of payments handed over at an Illinois game preserve; a battered brown attach\u00e9 case stuffed with $200,000 in cash from a New Jersey investor hoping to fend off a fraud investigation.The difference now is that the checks are bigger.How did this come about? Essentially, by legal fiat: a declaration by five Supreme Court justices that what looks, smells and feels like corruption is not in fact corruption.Tribe has summed up the decision succinctly:The Supreme Court\u2019s sin in Citizens United is not that it has been wrong to recognize and embrace the libertarian values that inhere in the First Amendment. But the libertarian campaign finance law the Court has developed fails in the broader project vital to First Amendment jurisprudence: the sensitive accommodation of competing constitutional values. The Court has not only underemphasized the egalitarian strain in First Amendment law \u2014 it has rejected that strain outright. And it has failed to recognize the range of plainly legitimate conceptions of democracy that Americans hold, instead privileging one view, democracy-by-financial-contributions, above all others.The likelihood that the current conservative majority would take into account the \u201cegalitarian strain in First Amendment law,\u201d as described by Tribe, is zero.state-created advantages not only allow corporations to play a dominant role in the Nation\u2019s economy, but also permit them to use \u201cresources amassed in the economic marketplace\u201d to obtain \u201can unfair advantage in the political marketplace.\u201dThe American system of campaign finance, undergirded by a Supreme Court whose conservative members feign innocence, has become the enabler of corrosive processes of economic and political inequality. Surely the justices are not benighted enough to believe that Paul Ryan and his ilk have no idea what they are doing.The Citizens United Court took the narrowest possible view of corruption, maintaining that the only legitimate government interest in this field is the prevention of quid pro quo corruption. But, as many have argued in response, quid pro quo corruption is far too narrow a governmental interest to identify as constitutionally relevant. It is an interest that does not begin to reflect the full stakes at issue in the campaign finance realm: the health of American democracy itself. Unless the notion of interests sufficiently compelling to count in the First Amendment calculus is strangely truncated to exclude interests this fundamental simply because they appear imprecise or diffuse, courts must recognize a compelling interest in combating corruption broadly defined as a distortion in the political process, understood to include a deviation from the ideal of equal representation embodied in Federalist 57.As resources flow toward the already most advantaged Americans, their ability to use those resources to shape policy increases. Of course rich Americans hold diverse preferences, just as the poor and the middle class. But despite some prominent liberal counterexamples, rich Americans tend to support the economic policies from which they have so greatly benefited. This raises the disturbing prospect of a vicious cycle in which growing economic and political inequality are mutually reinforcing.We are seeing that vicious cycle in operation today, with a Supreme Court incapable of applying either reason or common sense to stop the madness.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hanukkah and the Soul", "Date": "2018-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIndispensable to the Jewish worldview is the idea that humans are unique, that we possess a spiritual component and that our actions are freely chosen.Mr. Shafran is an author.Hanukkah \u2014 the Jewish \u201cFestival of Lights\u201d \u2014 is often dismissed as a minor celebration, artificially magnified by its proximity in the calendar to Christmas. The Jewish holiday is indeed not mentioned in the Torah, as the event it celebrates took place long after biblical times. Minor, though, it is not.On a superficial level, the Jewish winter holiday celebrates a Jewish rebel army\u2019s routing of the Greek-Syrian Seleucid Empire\u2019s forces, and its recapture of the Jewish Holy Temple in Jerusalem, nearly two centuries before the Common Era.It wasn\u2019t just an army, though, that was vanquished. Repelled no less significantly was a worldview, a way of understanding the human condition.To the Talmud-era rabbis who established Hanukkah, an even greater enemy than the flesh-and-blood soldiers who had defiled the Temple was some Jews\u2019 adoption of Hellenistic ideals, a fundamental part of which was what we today call materialism.No, not the luxuriating in physical pleasures, though that, too, was part of the ancient Greek world. The words \u201ccynic,\u201d \u201cepicurean\u201d and \u201chedonist,\u201d after all, are rooted in Greek philosophical schools. But rather the more rarefied philosophical concept called materialism, which contends that everything can be reduced to the physical, that there is no real entity called a soul. \u201cDualism,\u201d by contrast, is the belief that we humans are both physical and \u2026 something more.Many contemporary scientists, delighted by their advances in understanding how the brain functions, have embraced a modern version of materialism. The conviction that we have souls, they patiently explain to lesser folks, is nothing in the end but a misleading product of the electrical activity within our craniums. Our every thought and action, moreover, is predetermined. Just as other physical processes can be predicted on the basis of the array of circumstances at their origin, if we had sufficient knowledge about any individual\u2019s brain, we could predict his or her every action. Free will, to a materialist, is just a persistent illusion.\u201cThe qualities of mental life that we associate with souls are purely corporeal,\u201d Prof. Paul Bloom of Yale, for example, has averred. \u201cThey emerge from biochemical processes in the brain.\u201dA Harvard professor, Steven Pinker, advises us to set aside \u201cchildlike intuitions and traditional dogmas\u201d and recognize that what we conceive of as the soul is nothing more than \u201cthe activity of the brain.\u201d Nothing but brain cells are evident, after all, in a brain.But finding no evidence of the soul in a brain is like finding no trace of Yo-Yo Ma in a stereo speaker and concluding that the cello concerto that just ended, and Mr. Ma for that matter, are only imaginary.To dualists, though, our brains are conduits for consciousness and necessary for contemplating our souls, but not identical with them.The materialism/dualism debate was carried on by philosophers like Thomas Hobbes, championing the former view, and Ren\u00e9 Descartes, who embraced a form of the latter one.The issue is more than academic. If we humans are nothing more than our physical cells, and the innate human awareness of our souls and sense of free will are mere illusions, we have no ultimate value beyond that of any insect. And no compulsion, beyond an ultimately meaningless utilitarian social contract, to bind ourselves to any ethical or moral system. A society that denies the soul idea is, in fact, in the word\u2019s deepest sense soulless.The ancient Greeks were brilliant analyzers of the physical world. They developed the sciences, calculated the earth\u2019s circumference, proposed a heliocentric theory of the solar system and focused attention on the workings of human beings. But only as physical specimens.To be sure, the ancient Hellenist philosophers spoke of the \u201csoul,\u201d but they referred only to what we would call the personality or intellect. The idea of what we call a soul, an entity that can be sublimated or polluted by the conscious exercise of free will, was indigestible to the Greek worldview.And so, celebrating as it does, a victory, if a temporary one, over the materialistic worldview, Hanukkah is a truly profound holiday.Its eight days \u2014 eight being the number associated in Jewish texts with that which is beyond perceptible nature \u2014 are marked with the lighting of candles and the custom of giving children gifts. The greatest of the holiday\u2019s gifts, though, is its vital lesson for all humankind.Avi Shafran is director of public affairs for Agudath Israel of America, an author and a columnist for Hamodia.Advertisement"}

Think of Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain and the hard-core Brexiteers. Or of what used to be called the Republican establishment and Donald Trump.We also live in an era in which the counterexamples are few and far between. \u201cIn defeat, defiance\u201d is another great Churchillian maxim, and it\u2019s hard to name a single political figure today who embodies it \u2014 as opposed to, say, \u201cin defeat, early retirement to avoid a difficult primary.\u201dFor Churchill \u2014 who suffered as a child under the remote glare of a contemptuous father and a self-indulgent mother; fought valiantly in four wars by the time he was 25; and earned his own living through prodigious literary efforts that ultimately earned him a Nobel Prize \u2014 the main privilege was the opportunity to bear up under the immense weight of inner expectation that came with being born to a historic name.Or: To be a member of the establishment is to be a creature of it.Churchill championed free trade to the consternation of Tory protectionists. He supported super-taxes on the rich and pensions for the old to the infuriation of his aristocratic peers. He called for rearmament before both world wars against the hopes and convictions of the pacifists and appeasers in power. His great, unfulfilled political ambition was to create a party of the sensible center. Being at the center of the establishment is what allowed him to be indifferent to \u2014 and better than \u2014 it.Or: To be a champion of empire is to be a bigot.In 1899, Churchill envisioned a future South Africa in which \u201cBlack is to be proclaimed the same as white \u2026 to be constituted his legal equal, to be armed with political rights.\u201d He denounced the 1919 British massacre of Indian demonstrators at Amritsar as \u201ca monstrous event.\u201d He promoted social reform at home so that Britain could be a worthy leader of its dominions abroad. Churchill was a patriot, a paternalist, a product of his time \u2014 and, by those standards, a progressive.Or: The moral judgments of the present are superior to those of the past.One of the alleged crimes for which Churchill is now blamed is the perpetration of a \u201cgenocide\u201d in India after a cyclone-caused famine in 1943. Evidence for this is that he used racially insensitive humor during the crisis. Except that Churchill did send whatever food he could spare, Japan was threatening India from Burma, the rest of world was at war, and difficult choices had to be made.Or: In politics, what counts are actions, not words.\u201cHe mobilized the English language and sent it into battle,\u201d John F. Kennedy said (stealing a line from Edward Murrow) in awarding Churchill honorary United States citizenship in 1963. Of which leader now in office could that be said today \u2014 in any language?Finally: Churchill, notes Roberts, was able to rouse Britain \u201cbecause the battles and struggles of the Elizabethan and Napoleonic wars were then taught in schools, so the stories of Drake and Nelson were well known to his listeners.\u201d That also cannot be said of us today. In Britain, a 2008 survey found that 20 percent of teenagers thought Churchill was a fictional character but 58 percent thought Sherlock Holmes was real.It doesn\u2019t have to be that way. We reconcile ourselves to the decadence of the present only if we choose to remain ignorant of the achievements of the past.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Are Gender Reveal Parties a Thing?", "Date": "2018-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey say a lot more about our culture than they do about the sex of our soon-to-be children.Contributing Opinion Writer President Trump visited California in the wake of this deadly fire season and offered neither solace nor sympathy, let alone any awareness of the role climate change may have played. Instead, he allowed as how one of the issues was California\u2019s failure to \u201crake the forest floor.\u201d Online this observation has been mocked as #RakeNews.But I am here to tell you that at least one of the fires \u2014 the Sawmill Fire in Arizona, which burned 45,000 acres last spring \u2014 is the result of a much more complex problem: gender reveal parties.Mr. Dickey, who works as a Border Patrol agent, has described the day as \u201cprobably the worst of his life\u201d and has been put on probation for five years. He has agreed to pay the state back over $8 million in damages for the Sawmill fire, starting with an initial down payment of $100,000. Because the fire was clearly an accident, Mr. Dickey hasn\u2019t been charged with arson or lost his job with the Border Patrol. This, even though you\u2019d have to think that one of the main ways of protecting the border would not be setting it aflame.Still, all of this trouble could have been avoided if there was no such thing as a gender reveal party.I remember when the obstetrician revealed the genders of our own children, back in the day, and I recall well the sense of wonder the news brought us. Knowing the sex of our child felt as if we had cut in half the number of possible futures our family might find itself in. There\u2019s a way in which, in the heart of pregnancy, that was very comforting.But celebrating a child\u2019s gender before it\u2019s born is a tricky business. It sets expectations for who that child will be. It also leaves the unfortunate impression that gender is the most important thing to celebrate about that child.And sometimes it\u2019s just plain wrong.As a late-transitioning transgender person, I\u2019ve experienced both sides of a lot of this world. I have been both a best man and a matron of honor (and I can tell you that being a matron of honor is a lot more fun; being best man felt a little bit like being a security guard at a very sketchy nightclub). I\u2019ve attended bachelor parties as well as bridal showers. (In this instance, I\u2019d give the nod to bachelor parties, although that may be only because the one I went to in my boy days featured a guy named Amazing Larry riding a unicycle while juggling bowling pins and wearing a leotard.) At the bridal shower, my girlfriends and I mostly said ooh and ahh as we opened up boxes of high-end lingerie.Which was fun, but let\u2019s be honest: Victoria\u2019s Secret is no match for an Amazing Larry.As a transgender person I thought my eyes were pretty wide open when it came to gender issues. I tried to avoid defining either of my children based on their sex and encouraged them to find their own path, wherever it might lead.But I was still caught off guard when my older child came out to me as transgender, at age 23. The news stunned me and left me, for a little while, unable to speak.Then I put my arms around her, just as my own mother had put her arms around me, and told her that I loved her, just as my own mother had said those words to me.Would a moment like this have come about if I\u2019d greeted the news of my child\u2019s gender, back in 1994, with an exploding Tannerite device ignited with a shotgun?Possibly. But I\u2019m hoping that in spite of all the mistakes I\u2019m sure I made as a parent over the years, letting my child know that I would always love her, no matter what her gender, was not one of them.What does bringing a new life into the world actually mean, in the end, besides lighting a fire, passing the flame of your own life on to a new generation? But I can assure you, that fire will glow whether your child is male or female or even something in between.There are a lot of things to celebrate about a new baby. Gender isn\u2019t one of them.Instead, we should celebrate our child\u2019s humanity \u2014 with all of its complex, contradictory potential \u2014 with openheartedness and with love.Advertisement"}

", "Date": "2018-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGlobal healthThe W.H.O. has recommended such a test for H.I.V.-positive patients since 2015. But in poor countries, few qualifying patients are receiving it. For at least a decade, one of the most urgent needs in public health was a urine dipstick that could quickly diagnose tuberculosis in the most vulnerable population: those with advanced H.I.V. Now that test exists. It\u2019s inexpensive and has been recommended by the World Health Organization since 2015. But it is hardly used in the countries that most need it.Part of the problem, Ms. Lynch says, is that the W.H.O.\u2019s recommendation for the test is too limited. Donor organizations such as the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, known as Pepfar, tend to follow the W.H.O.\u2019s guidance on TB.TB is the leading cause of death in H.I.V.-positive people, claiming 300,000 lives in 2017. The W.H.O. recommends the test only for people who are H.I.V.-positive, gravely ill and have fewer than 100 CD4 cells \u2014 a kind of immune system cell \u2014 per cubic millimeter of blood. (The typical range for CD4 cells is 500 to 1,500.)In this group, according to evidence the W.H.O. reviewed in 2015, the test correctly diagnoses TB in 56 percent of patients. \u201cIt\u2019s a test with suboptimal accuracy,\u201d said Christopher Gilpin, senior scientist at the WHO\u2019s Global TB Program. \u201cThis is probably part of the limited uptake.\u201d Another reason, he said, is that few clinics in resource-poor regions have the equipment needed to determine CD4 counts.Advocacy groups take issue with both points, saying the W.H.O. is making perfect the enemy of good. According to a preliminary analysis by the Clinton Health Access Initiative, the estimated need for the test is between 2.7 and 2.9 million people with a CD4 cutoff of 100, and 5.8 million with a CD4 cutoff of 200. Abbott Laboratories, which makes the test, declined to say how many tests are sold, but one estimate pegs the figure at about 400,000 a year.The low adoption numbers run the risk of discouraging companies interested in developing TB diagnostics, said Ms. Lessem.\u201cThe W.H.O. is giving really mixed signals to countries and to suppliers and manufacturers, because they\u2019re basically saying on the one hand we\u2019re asking for this point-of-care test, we want to do more to stop mortality \u2014 and on the other hand, actually we think that even though we have this tool, it\u2019s not worth rolling out,\u201d Ms. Lessem said. Dr. Gilpin said W.H.O.\u2019s guidance is so cautiously worded in part because of worries that the test would be misused for people with higher CD4 levels, in whom the test is less accurate.This was a legitimate concern at one-time, Ms. Lessem said, but the pendulum has swung too far: \u201cNow even people who need the test and would benefit from it are not getting it because the guidance is worded in such a restrictive way.\u201d Pepfar released draft recommendations for TB diagnostics earlier this month \u2014 and advocacy groups are hoping the final recommendations in January include TB-LAM for anyone who is H.I.V.-positive and seriously ill.\u201cPepfar and its scientific advisory board have gone ahead of W.H.O. in the past, and frankly they should do so again,\u201d Ms. Lynch said.Advertisement"}

One dinged, the doors opened, and hoard of wristband wearing revelers poured out. This was a five-star hotel, but over one weekend this fall, it turned into a 48-hour dance party.\u201cThey\u2019re 25- to 45-years-old, well traveled, affluent professionals, mainly, who like to have fun and burn the candle at both ends,\u201d said Anthony Ingham, the global brand leader of W Hotels, which has 54 locations worldwide. The first three Wake Up Calls took place this fall in Hollywood, Barcelona, and Bali; W Dubai is slated to host the fourth next year.Historically, W has courted musicians through its Living Room Live program, in which emerging artists perform in the lounge area of their local W, and W Sound Suites, recording studios that exist within select hotels. \u201cWhen we started brainstorming what we could do next, it felt like a natural evolution to produce a music festival,\u201d Mr. Ingham said.One would think that a music festival held in a hotel, a place with walls and smoke detectors and guests who may not be partaking in late night dance parties, would be less raucous than the type that take place on open plots of land, in the middle of nowhere. One would be wrong, at least in the case of Wake Up Call Barcelona, which took place the third weekend in September and courted 4,300 attendees, thanks to headlining artists like Martin Solveig and Robin Schulz.When my husband and I checked in on Thursday evening, the W, a half-moon shaped monolith visible for miles down the Barcelona esplanade, seemed like a regular hotel (albeit, one with a vast wall of red and silver sequins in the lobby). A gray-haired man in a suit was checking in next to us; samba music played at a conversational volume.Everyone in the hotel\u2019s 473 rooms came knowing a festival \u2014 with set times starting as late (or early) as 2 a.m. \u2014 was taking place. (Fifty rooms were booked before the planning of Wake Up Call Barcelona, and W offered to relocate those guests unwilling to take part, said Mr. Ingham.)Maybe it was the booths that had been set up in the lobby to dole out festival entrance wristbands, maybe it was the two guys in the gym talking about \u201cthrowing down\u201d that night: there was a palpable feeling that a party was about to engulf the property, and indeed, that was the W\u2019s intent. \u201cThe thing that I hate, I even hate the term, is the \u2018meet and greet,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Solveig, a French D.J. who hosted a cocktail party in the hotel\u2019s \u201cExtreme Wow\u201d suite, which was used as a gathering place during the festival. \u201cYou have, like, two minutes, so it\u2019s reduced to taking a picture with a fan and that\u2019s it. What\u2019s special about this is that it\u2019s hanging out for an hour with people who have knowledge of my work.\u201dWake Up Call attendees redeemed points from Starwood or Marriott\u2019s loyalty programs (the hotel groups recently merged) to gain access to these more intimate \u201cmoments;\u201d some used points to fund their entire trip.\u201cIt\u2019s the perfect excuse to do things that otherwise you don\u2019t have the inspiration to do.\u201d said Alan Conde, 46, a management consultant based in Madrid who spent 50,000 points on a festival package. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t like about festivals so much is the crowds. It\u2019s very difficult to move, you have to make lines for everything. Suddenly, you have this concept, which I think is very creative.\u201dBeing an elevator ride away from your suitcase is also a plus. (As Mr. Ingham put it, \u201cyou can have four outfit changes!\u201d) I discovered this on Friday night, when, inspired by a group of jumpsuit and fanny-pack clad attendees grooving in a darkened conference room to the house D.J., Mr. Schulz, I ditched my cumbersome purse for the fanny pack the W had placed in every room (and stuffed, in true music festival fashion, with mints and condoms). By 3 p.m. the next afternoon, more than two dozen people snaked out the doors, waiting to buy day passes, and a security checkpoint had been set up in the lobby.Up in the Extreme Wow suite, Stacey Arkules, 57, from Arizona, was kicked back on the balcony with a cocktail and sunglasses, taking in a view of the coastline before things kicked up a notch.

{"Headline": "The Return of Paganism", "Date": "2018-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMaybe there actually is a genuinely post-Christian future for America.Opinion ColumnistHere are some generally agreed-upon facts about religious trends in the United States. Institutional Christianity has weakened drastically since the 1960s. Lots of people who once would have been lukewarm Christmas-and-Easter churchgoers now identify as having \u201cno religion\u201d or being \u201cspiritual but not religious.\u201d The mainline-Protestant establishment is an establishment no more. Religious belief and practice now polarizes our politics in a way they didn\u2019t a few generations back.What kind of general religious reality should be discerned from all these facts, though, is much more uncertain, and there are various plausible stories about what early-21st century Americans increasingly believe. The simplest of these is the secularization story \u2014 in which modern societies inevitably put away religious ideas as they advance in wealth and science and reason, and the decline of institutional religion is just a predictable feature of a general late-modern turn away from supernatural belief.[Never be uninteresting. Read the most thought-provoking, funny, delightful and raw stories from The New York Times Opinion section.]So perhaps instead of secularization it makes sense to talk about the fragmentation and personalization of Christianity \u2014 to describe America as a nation of Christian heretics, if you will, in which traditional churches have been supplanted by self-help gurus and spiritual-political entrepreneurs. These figures cobble together pieces of the old orthodoxies, take out the inconvenient bits and pitch them to mass audiences that want part of the old-time religion but nothing too unsettling or challenging or ascetic. The result is a nation where Protestant awakenings have given way to post-Protestant wokeness, where Reinhold Niebuhr and Fulton Sheen have ceded pulpits to Joel Osteen and Oprah Winfrey, where the prosperity gospel and Christian nationalism rule the right and a social gospel denuded of theological content rules the left.Which is why lately I\u2019ve become interested in books and arguments that suggest that there actually is, or might be, a genuinely post-Christian future for America \u2014 and that the term \u201cpaganism\u201d might be reasonably revived to describe the new American religion, currently struggling to be born.A fascinating version of this argument is put forward by Steven D. Smith, a law professor at the University of San Diego, in his new book, \u201cPagans and Christians in the City: Culture Wars From the Tiber to the Potomac.\u201d Smith argues that much of what we understand as the march of secularism is something of an illusion, and that behind the scenes what\u2019s actually happening in the modern culture war is the return of a pagan religious conception, which was half-buried (though never fully so) by the rise of Christianity.What is that conception? Simply this: that divinity is fundamentally inside the world rather than outside it, that God or the gods or Being are ultimately part of nature rather than an external creator, and that meaning and morality and metaphysical experience are to be sought in a fuller communion with the immanent world rather than a leap toward the transcendent.This paganism is not materialist or atheistic; it allows for belief in spiritual and supernatural realities. It even accepts the possibility of an afterlife. But it is deliberately agnostic about final things, what awaits beyond the shores of this world, and it is skeptical of the idea that there exists some ascetic, world-denying moral standard to which we should aspire. Instead, it sees the purpose of religion and spirituality as more therapeutic, a means of seeking harmony with nature and happiness in the everyday \u2014 while unlike atheism, it insists that this everyday is divinely endowed and shaped, meaningful and not random, a place where we can truly hope to be at home.In popular religious practice there isn\u2019t always a clean line between this \u201cimmanent\u201d religion and the transcendent alternative offered by Christianity and Judaism. But clearly religious cultures can tend toward one option or the other, and you can build a plausible case for a \u201cpagan\u201d (by Smith\u2019s definition) tradition in Western and American religion, which in his account takes two major forms.These descriptions are debatable, but suppose Smith is right. Is the combination of intellectual pantheism and a this-world-focused civil religion enough to declare the rebirth of paganism as a faith unto itself, rather than just a cultural tendency within a still-Christian order?What ancient paganism did successfully was to unite this kind of popular supernaturalism with its own forms of highbrow pantheism and civil-religiosity. Thus the elites of ancient Rome might reject the myths about their pantheon of deities as just crude stories, but they would join enthusiastically in public rituals that assumed that gods or spirits could be appealed to, propitiated, honored, worshiped.To get a fully revived paganism in contemporary America, that\u2019s what would have to happen again \u2014 the philosophers of pantheism and civil religion would need to build a religious bridge to the New Agers and neo-pagans, and together they would need to create a more fully realized cult of the immanent divine, an actual way to worship, not just to appreciate, the pantheistic order they discern.Advertisement"}

Ms. Soundararajan is an artist and activist.On Nov. 13, Jack Dorsey, the chief executive of Twitter, met with several female journalists and activists in New Delhi to talk about online safety in India. Female journalists and activists from religious and cultural minorities face relentless harassment and abuse on Mr. Dorsey\u2019s platform. The meeting with Mr. Dorsey and other Twitter executives was aimed at helping them better understand the magnitude of the problem in India.My colleague Sanghapali Aruna, who runs Project Mukti, an organization that leverages technology to empower Dalits to fight caste prejudice, was among the attendees. \u201cDalit,\u201d which means \u201coppressed,\u201d refers to the caste of people who suffer the greatest violence, discrimination and disenfranchisement under India\u2019s caste apartheid that structures Hindu society.After the meeting in New Delhi ended, Mr. Dorsey held my poster while posing with participants for a picture. The photograph was seen as Twitter endorsing our call to end caste and patriarchy. A fierce backlash on Indian Twitter from India\u2019s caste elites, particularly the Brahmins, followed. A campaign for Brahmins to boycott Twitter trended on Twitter. Mr. Dorsey has my empathy. He had a fleeting taste of what it is to be a Dalit woman on Twitter. But these attacks remind us of the pervasiveness of the problem that had prompted his New Delhi visit: online safety in India.But India\u2019s entrenched structures of caste privilege and power replicated on Twitter and forced caste-oppressed communities off the platform, traumatizing many in the process.Twitter executives quickly cowed before the oppressive power of caste. After the intense Brahmin outrage and calls for a boycott, Ms. Gadde apologized for the photograph of Mr. Dorsey with my poster, saying she and her colleagues should have been more thoughtful and, \u201cTwitter strives to be an impartial platform for all.\u201dThe apology translated to an endorsement of deeply problematic power dynamics \u2014 an unacceptable position given the platform\u2019s positioning as a free and open space for discussion.And given the magnitude of caste-based aggression and harassment on Twitter, its blindness to caste in India is alarming. The platform has a responsibility not to simply promote free speech but to also guarantee the freedom of expression and safety of its most vulnerable users. Coordinated attacks on vulnerable voices are shutting them out and turning Twitter into yet another tool of persecution.In the light of Mr. Dorsey\u2019s encounter with the vitriol on Indian Twitter, I hope he and his colleagues take a step back to assess, reflect and pivot. The platform urgently needs to make corrections to protect minorities in India and elsewhere in the world.Mr. Dorsey and his colleagues also need to engage in broad consultations with governments and civil society groups, especially with representatives from gender, religious and cultural minorities. These difficult conversations will reflect a difficult reality, but they need to happen if Twitter wants to be a platform where marginalized voices can be visible and heard without fear.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Is Willing to Make a Deal", "Date": "2018-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIts leaders are talking tough, but privately, many Chinese officials are worried about their economy and eager to end the trade war.Professor Prasad is an economist at Cornell University.The official word is that everything is fine. China\u2019s economy, under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, continues to grow at a robust pace and follow a steady path of \u201creform and opening up.\u201dIn private, Chinese officials admit they are worried. During a trip to Beijing last week, I encountered varying degrees of concern about the economy among bureaucrats, academics and business executives. Most of them agreed that the Chinese economy is slowing down, although some view this as better than the breakneck growth of the past.Against this backdrop, there is a real opportunity for a deal to end the damaging trade war with the United States.The trade war comes at a delicate time. It hurts foreign and domestic investor sentiment: investor nervousness has pulled China\u2019s stock market down by about 25 percent this year. Domestic investors are taking their money out, and foreign investors are no longer keen on China, which in turn puts downward pressure on the currency. This reduces the government\u2019s room to maneuver, by forcing it to spend foreign exchange reserves to prop up the currency and making it harder to cut interest rates.The economy has relied for far too long on such investment, mainly by state-owned enterprises, fueled by a surge in corporate debt. The \u201cdeleveraging\u201d campaign, which makes it harder for corporations to borrow from banks, will prevent more bad loans piling up in the banking system. To avoid shifting these risks to the \u201cshadow banking\u201d system of non-bank lenders, Chinese regulatory authorities have tightened the screws on informal financial institutions. This has starved the private sector of credit, which has also dampened growth.The Chinese government faces some important decisions. It should stick with financial deleveraging, improve the functioning of corporate debt and stock markets as alternative sources of finance, and cut corporate and household taxes to support growth. Another challenge is how to deal with the Trump administration\u2019s demands.Remarkably, some reform-minded officials now actually speak about President Trump as a positive force. Many reforms have been stalled, but under American pressure the opening up of China\u2019s economy that Mr. Xi proclaims might actually be translated into action, bringing greater access for foreign firms, better protections for intellectual property rights and an increased ability for foreign investors to participate in financial markets.China sees some of these moves as in its interest, but it wants to pursue these changes in its own way and at its own pace. American pressure could give added momentum to the movement for reform.With significant support inside China, the prospect of a trade deal early in the new year is real. The United States won\u2019t get all it asks for. China is not about to abandon its state-owned enterprises, although it may be willing to subject them to greater market discipline. The best outcome for negotiations is that tariffs imposed by the United States won\u2019t get higher and broader. So the expectation is that any deal will lead to a cessation of further hostilities but not a rollback of trade sanctions.Such an agreement would give the United States and Mr. Trump a major victory. But if American negotiators refuse to settle for anything less than total capitulation by China, his administration will squander an opportunity to help the United States and the world\u2019s economy.Eswar Prasad is a professor at Cornell University, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, and the author of \u201cGaining Currency: The Rise of the Renminbi.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Harris won by just 905 votes, and jubilation set in.But now, a month later, the story of Mr. Harris\u2019s path to victory appears far from a divine anointing.The developments have turned the national spotlight onto a previously little known pastor, and onto the political ambitions of the Christian right that he represents. Mr. Harris\u2019s race was one of the few House seats that the religious right targeted in the midterm elections, when they focused largely on increasing the Republican majority in the Senate.The Christian right represents one of most influential voting blocs for President Trump and the Republican Party, and Mr. Harris represents their ideal candidate. He is a grass-roots culture warrior who gained local fame for his opposition to gay rights and for his support of a controversial so-called \u201cbathroom bill.\u201d He is seen as someone who would champion their political priorities in Washington.Religious-right leaders are rallying around him, and are citing his commitment to faith as reason to dismiss the possibility that Mr. Harris could have done something wrong in the election. Mr. Whitson, the pastor who prayed with him on election night, calls the Board of Election\u2019s decision to not certify the results not just \u201cunfair,\u201d but \u201ccriminal.\u201d\u201cMark is a man of deep convictions, he is a man of integrity, he walks with God,\u201d Mr. Whitson said in a phone interview. He has been texting Mr. Harris spiritual encouragement that \u201cthis too shall pass.\u201dBut outrage is growing among critics, not just at the questions of possible unethical or illegal activity, but also at the way they say Christianity is being used to cloak injustices in the state\u2019s voting process.\u201cA person like Mark is once again the beneficiary of the racist policies of voter suppression and gerrymandering,\u201d said the Rev. Dr. William J. Barber II, a prominent North Carolina pastor and a longtime former leader of the state\u2019s N.A.A.C.P.Mr. Harris, he said, cannot truly be described as \u201cevangelical.\u201d\u201cThey hijacked that term to make what they are saying sound theological when it is really not,\u201d Dr. Barber said. \u201cHe is clearly a Christian nationalist, extreme on his views.\u201dMr. Harris, who declined to be interviewed for this article, has long framed his political ambitions in spiritual terms. Ever since he decided to run for office in 2014, \u201cit was almost like, I don\u2019t have a choice, I\u2019ve got to obey what God was calling me to do,\u201d Mr. Whitson recalled.He earned a reputation as a compelling orator in his more than two decades in the pulpit. But his sermons were controversial, though not uncommon in Southern Baptist circles; he asserted that women should \u201csubmit\u201d to their husbands and questioned whether it was the \u201chealthiest pursuit\u201d for women to have careers.Around the time he became the pastor of First Baptist Church in Charlotte in 2005, Mr. Harris went to a conference sponsored by the conservative Family Research Council that urged pastors to pursue civic involvement. It was a turning point that steered him toward a role in politics, and he began to train \u201cculture impact teams\u201d across his state to encourage conservative pastors to get involved politically. He worked periodically on contract with the F.R.C.In Charlotte, he often led groups of congregants to nearby government offices at City Hall to pray for and with local leaders.\u201cHe\u2019d walk across the street and come up with a group of members of his congregation and say, \u2018How can we help you?\u2019\u201d said Pat McCrory, a Republican who, before serving as governor of North Carolina, was Charlotte\u2019s mayor for 14 years.\u201cAs he got more involved, he saw more of the need,\u201d Mr. Perkins said in a phone interview. \u201cI told him I\u2019d be supportive.\u201dStill, Mr. Harris\u2019s decision to run for elected office \u2014 and to keep running \u2014 came as something of a stunner in Charlotte\u2019s sometimes clubby political scene, particularly when he began to challenge United States Representative Robert Pittenger in Republican primaries.After Mr. Harris ran for Senate in 2014 and lost to Thom Tillis, he challenged Mr. Pittenger in the House in 2016 and lost by 134 votes. This year, when he challenged the congressman again, he won the primary by 828 votes. That victory is also in question in the current investigation.\u201cI never knew he had interest in public office,\u201d said Mr. McCrory, who lives in the Ninth District. \u201cI was even more surprised when he kept doing it. The guy has been through the meat grinder in terms of losing close elections.\u201dMr. Harris was hardly ever the favored candidate of the donors who fuel Republican politics in the Charlotte area. But he found support outside of North Carolina\u2019s largest city, his brand bolstered by evangelical groups with great sway in the state.\u201cHis chance to win was going to be through a grass-roots effort,\u201d Mr. McCrory said.Mr. Harris gained momentum among North Carolina\u2019s conservative voters in 2012 when he championed an amendment to the state\u2019s constitution to define marriage as only between a man and a woman, a move that was later ruled unconstitutional and overturned in court.\u201cMark was a man who was willing to be bold and step up on the front lines and talk about biblical values,\u201d said Tami Fitzgerald, the executive director of the North Carolina Values Coalition, a group that works with pastors across the state.In 2016, he supported House Bill 2, a controversial state law that, in addition to removing anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, required transgender people in public facilities to use the bathroom that corresponded with the sex stated on their birth certificate. That bill, too, was later repealed.After a Charlotte police officer shot and killed Keith Lamont Scott in 2016, Mr. Harris went to the riots intending to defuse anger against the police, recalled his friend Leon Theatt, an African-American pastor in his district who joined him.Some progressive Christians in the state are also angered by Mr. Harris\u2019s policy focus.\u201cHe claims to be following the Bible, but he says very little about what Jesus said about policy toward the poor, the sick,\u201d Dr. Barber said. \u201cHe is aligned with others who have tried to convince America that a moral agenda is simply being against gay people, being against abortion, for prayer in school, being for tax cuts for the wealthy, and for guns.\u201dMr. Harris\u2019s supporters are encouraging him to press onward.Ms. Fitzgerald, from the Values Coalition, said she spoke with Mr. Harris last week, and they discussed the fraud allegations that have clouded his election.\u201cHe was shocked, and just a little shaken, I guess, because it totally came out of left field,\u201d she said.Mr. Theatt believes Mr. Harris won the race \u201cfair and square\u201d and that he will ultimately be awarded the victory.\u201cIt\u2019s like a bad case of a stomach virus,\u201d he said of the investigation. \u201cYou sometimes have to let it run its course.\u201dAlan Blinder and Sydney Ember contributed reporting from Lumberton, N.C.Advertisement"}

She would leave the office to sit with her son, a second-grader, on his birthday and maybe three other days a year.But then she got an email from the school district: Parents were being barred from the lunchroom.The email incensed Ms. Bonanno and other parents. And what began as a small debate in the wealthy Connecticut town of Darien erupted into a controversy about parenting that rippled throughout the world.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like a big story, but it\u2019s something that personally caused me a lot of stress,\u201d Ms. Bonanno, 42, said in an interview. \u201cIt was a big bummer to me. The reality is, as a full-time working mom, it was an opportunity to go at my discretion.\u201dThe divisive issue once again raised a question sensitive to parents and administrators: When to let go?Stephanie Jones, a professor of early childhood development at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, called the early elementary years \u201cthe first experience of some kind of independence,\u201d and added that \u201ceven though parents have the best intentions, sometimes they come in and over-help.\u201dBut what about that hard-to-open milk carton? Elliott Landon, Darien\u2019s interim schools superintendent, essentially told parents that students should learn to deal without them at the table.\u201cLunchtime is a valued part of the school day where students are encouraged to practice social skills they may have been taught during other parts of the day,\u201d he wrote in the Oct. 2 email. \u201cWith the guidance of school personnel, students also use this time to practice independence and regulation skills.\u201dA story published by The Associated Press, which ran on websites in places as far as Saskatchewan and Thailand, quoted one parent\u2019s reaction as a \u201cpunch in the gut.\u201d The mothers became an easy target online, as people made assumptions about the parents who live in a town where the annual household median income in 2015 was nearly $209,000.The New York City Department of Education said it does not have a blanket policy, but allows individual schools to determine whether parents are allowed at lunch.Brian Perkins, a former superintendent in New Haven, and now an associate professor of practice in education leadership at Columbia University\u2019s Teachers College, confirmed that parents lunching with their children was not a new or expressly suburban phenomenon. After seeing the email from the school district, however, he was not surprised by the frustration among parents in Darien.\u201cPart of my immediate reaction was their communication about why this was important might not have been as clear as it could have been,\u201d Dr. Perkins said. \u201cI\u2019ve learned over time that sometimes communication failures turn small things into bigger things in school districts.\u201dThen again, he said, often parents can have a serious sense of entitlement when it comes to their children.\u201cWe are in a society where people want what they want,\u201d Dr. Perkins said. \u201cThe idea that on its face, I\u2019d be told \u2018no,\u2019 that I can\u2019t have lunch with my child, is for some, unconscionable.\u201cThere are a number of reasons why that would be a prudent decision to make in a school district,\u201d he added. \u201cThe first thing that came to mind was about space.\u201d\u201cSteadily increasing\u201d parent attendance at lunch was why the principals of Darien\u2019s five elementary schools conveyed to Dr. Landon the need for a new policy, according to Tara Ochman, the chairwoman of the town\u2019s Board of Education.\u201cThe principals brought forward concerns regarding the effective day-to-day running of their schools,\u201d Ms. Ochman said.The presence was so disruptive, she added, that some children had a hard time when their parents left. Others were disappointed that their parents did not come for lunch.That was news to Ms. Bonanno. \u201cI was the only parent there,\u201d she said. \u201cI wish more had come.\u201dAnother parent, Terri Steadman, said at a videotaped October board meeting: \u201cI feel like this email went out abruptly, without any consideration or discussion with the parents.\u201dShe admitted at that board meeting that even she was surprised when she shed tears.Parents said they would have been happy to sign up in advance with the schools, or stagger their visits. \u201cThere are ways to find a happy medium, and they didn\u2019t think to ask the parents,\u201d Ms. Bonanno said.Dr. Landon did not return multiple phone calls, nor allow an in-person interview when a reporter visited. None of the five elementary principals would discuss the policy change when Times reporters called and visited the schools.One mother\u2019s post in a \u201cDarien moms\u201d Facebook group got at least 50 comments in response to the lunchroom ban \u2014 some commenters were furious over missing out on a special opportunity, and others were upset that they had not known they could eat lunch with their elementary schoolers. Still others were perplexed that children would even want their parents at the table.Beth Lane, the mother of a fourth-grader at Holmes Elementary, said that she was fine with the change, but added that she has \u201cless skin in the game\u201d because Holmes had unofficially discontinued the policy several years ago.\u201cI think it\u2019s healthy for children to have time when their parents aren\u2019t present and where they can interact with other children without the parental structure, which I feel changes the dynamic,\u201d Ms. Lane said.She said Dr. Landon explained his rationale further at a meeting with the Council of Darien School Parents, of which she was a former co-chairwoman.\u201cI thought it was the end of it,\u201d she said.Jayme Stevenson, the first selectman of Darien, which is akin to a mayor, said she approved of the change. \u201cPost-Sandy Hook, school security has become an important issue,\u201d Ms. Stevenson said. \u201cManaging the flow of visitors in and out of schools is a concern.\u201dThe Newtown school district in Connecticut, which includes a new Sandy Hook Elementary School, however, has a quiet policy. According to a district staff member, parents are allowed to come to the school to have lunch with their children.Kristin Hussey reported from Darien, and Liz Robbins from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Raise Your Hand if You Want to Judge Trump ", "Date": "2018-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf the president is impeached, what if, just as an experiment, the electorate gives acting like judges a whirl? But I mean the old-fashioned kind, without keggers with Squee.Contributing Opinion WriterTwenty years ago this week, the House of Representatives forwarded articles of impeachment against President Bill Clinton to the Senate. Whether or not that was constitutionally warranted \u2014 it wasn\u2019t \u2014 does any citizen on either side who witnessed or participated in that partisan dust-up honestly look back on it as an exemplary exercise showcasing Americans\u2019 shared reverence for the rule of law? I\u2019m thinking specifically of how the House Judiciary Committee member Howard Coble, Republican of North Carolina, mentioned that his office got a call from someone who hoped he would die \u201ca painful death from prostate cancer.\u201dGiven that President Trump, a Republican (or thereabouts), is at the center or periphery of numerous federal investigations, including inquiries with whiffs of high crimes like conspiring with a hostile foreign power and accepting emoluments, and given that the incoming House of Representatives, the body constitutionally charged with presidential indictment, will be majority Democrat, a 2019 impeachment is not unthinkable.That said, conviction, leading to removal, requires a nearly impossible two-thirds majority vote in the Senate. Which did not stop me from wasting three hours pondering the logistical, moral and civil rights implications of handing over a job with 18-hour work days to Vice President Mike Pence, who reportedly refuses to dine alone with any woman who is not his wife. I had some policy quibbles with George W. Bush and Condoleezza Rice, but I never once doubted their ability to share a sandwich while discussing the Triangle of Death. So the consequences of impeachment are almost as unpredictable as the crap shoot that is election.Now, in the cold and quiet of late December, is the time to do homework, to bone up on impeachment\u2019s legal intricacies and precedents so as to face the months ahead with a mutual resolve to be, if not gracious \u2014 gracious was never the point of the House of Representatives \u2014 then prepared.Considering that the only executive branch event more unnerving for voters than impeachment is assassination, Mr. Sunstein\u2019s book, among the recent harvest of titles for general readers, is a surprisingly cheerful read. A law professor who once clerked for Thurgood Marshall, the guy simply loves the law. In his handy, unpretentious chapter about mechanics and history titled, \u201cWhat Every American Should Know,\u201d he offers advice on what the citizenry should fear \u2014 both \u201cextreme partisanship\u201d resulting in \u201cunjustified, harmful, and destabilizing efforts to impeach the president\u201d and \u201cthe failure to use the impeachment mechanism in circumstances in which it really is justified.\u201d\u201cImpeachment: An American History,\u201d is a useful new anthology of essays including accounts by Jon Meacham of the Andrew Johnson impeachment and The Times\u2019s Peter Baker on Bill Clinton\u2019s. It is especially notable for the historian Timothy Naftali\u2019s curiously uplifting telling of the House impeachment investigation of Richard Nixon that everyone who either is or has a representative should read, and not just to review the nitty-gritty of how government lawyers and officials collected and presented evidence that would lead the president to resign before being impeached. One gripping scene sounds like the setup of a joke: Caldwell Butler, William Cohen and Hamilton Fish walk up to a water cooler \u2026 Over two years after the American people first heard the name Watergate, Mr. Naftali writes, Representative Butler wondered aloud to his fellow Republicans \u201cwhether the country could stand the trauma of an impeachment.\u201dIt\u2019s a question we\u2019re all asking now. As Jeffrey A. Engel observes in the anthology\u2019s introduction, \u201cIt is no secret why you are reading this book.\u201d After two years of the Trump administration grind, can an already weary, fractured people abide the acrimony that always comes when senators acting like judges hear the arguments of representatives acting like prosecutors?\u201cIt\u2019s already a tragedy,\u201d blurted Congressman Fish.So buck up. Let us remember that there is a lofty reason this country\u2019s long, national nightmares drag on so excruciatingly long: a small, old book called the Constitution of the United States.Sarah Vowell, a contributing opinion writer, is the author of \"The Wordy Shipmates\u201d and \u201cLafayette in the Somewhat United States.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "You Should Have the Right to Sue Apple", "Date": "2018-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn Apple v. Pepper, the Supreme Court will decide whether iPhone App Store customers are entitled to make their case against the tech giant.Ms. Slaughter is a commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission.Some app buyers allege that the App Store is an illegal monopoly and that Apple forces them to pay higher prices for apps than they would have paid in a competitive market. The question before the Supreme Court is not whether Apple has engaged in anticompetitive conduct in violation of the law. Instead, this case is about whether app buyers are entitled to present the facts of their case to a court \u2014 and the decision will have consequences for the ability of all Americans to hold corporations accountable for illegal monopolistic conduct.The Justice Department supported Apple\u2019s reasoning before the court. I sit on the Federal Trade Commission, the agency that is jointly responsible, with the Justice Department, for enforcement of antitrust laws, and I strongly disagree with our sister agency\u2019s position. Apple users can buy apps only through Apple\u2019s App Store. They must deal directly with Apple as a distributor of iPhone apps rather than with the individual app developers. That is why the lower court decided that consumers are indeed \u201cdirect purchasers\u201d and eligible to sue under the antitrust laws.Putting aside the merits of the underlying antitrust claim, this case comes down to first principles. Should the consumers who are potential victims of alleged antitrust violations be allowed to make their case before a judge or jury? Should citizens play a role as a meaningful check against anticompetitive corporate conduct? I believe the answer is yes. America is grappling with serious questions about the levels of concentration and competition in our economy, and the Supreme Court should reinforce rather than constrict the ability of consumers to seek justice for illegal abuses of market power.For people who have been victims of anticompetitive corporate conduct, private lawsuits are the primary means for getting compensation. A 2013 study found that 60 of the largest successful private antitrust cases from 1990 to 2011 resulted in at least $33 billion in compensation to victims. Private enforcement also bolsters the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s efforts to stop anticompetitive conduct \u2014 for example, in the pharmaceutical industry.A Supreme Court decision that treats iPhone app buyers as too far removed from Apple to bring a federal antitrust suit against the company would undermine Congress\u2019 intent to permit any victim of antitrust violations to seek justice. Worse, it would give a free pass for antitrust law violations in cases in which consumers are the victims with the greatest incentive to go to court. App developers, who Apple claims are the \u201cdirect purchasers\u201d of their app services, may not be inclined to bring an antitrust case against their business partner. Apple is the gatekeeper to the apps\u2019 millions of target customers.The case before the court is not simply about one company or one group of consumers. It is about the right of citizens to hold corporate monopoly power in check in industries across our economy.Rebecca Kelly Slaughter is a commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Magic of the Food Gift Swap ", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn holiday season exchanges, like the one organized through Food52, strangers give edible gifts and receive a sense of connection.But that\u2019s just what Liz Larkin, 52, who runs a home-baking business in Pound Ridge, N.Y., intends to do this month, when she\u2019ll ship off a box of cookies and scones to someone she has never met while she waits for another person to send her a box filled with gifts from the kitchen.\u201cIt sounds a little weird, right?\u201d Ms. Larkin said. \u201cBut connecting with a stranger like this is just a cool thing to do. Doing good is kind of contagious.\u201dLike many cooks who turn to food as a gift, she knows the magic that can come from trading something delicious and homemade with another cook. But neighborhood cookie swaps and even more informal exchanges are increasingly hard to find.This year, 1,107 people from 15 countries have signed on, a record for the effort. Since it started eight years ago, the swap has kindled enduring friendships and, for some, has become their favorite holiday tradition.Adrienne Kerrigan, a food writer in Seattle, has been a devotee of the exchange for years. Five years ago, she was randomly matched with someone who discovered through the swap organizer that Ms. Kerrigan was about to have a newborn. So he and his partner packed up a swaddling blanket and a frozen container of something they called \u201capples cooked forever.\u201d The couple included a note explaining that they had fed the long-cooked apples to their own baby. That batch became one of the first solid foods Ms. Kerrigan fed hers. Then there was the woman from St. Paul who sent Nina Wladkowski a box of wild rice and maple syrup, along with some gifts from her garden that included shallots, sweet potatoes and the only five peanuts she had managed to coax from the ground that year.She shipped back a jar of homemade jam and a thank-you note. \u201cPeople always talk about food bringing people together, but this kind of broadens that table to a national and international table,\u201d she said.She watched as the site\u2019s regulars organized gatherings of food-minded people in New York, and longed for some of that camaraderie.Why not try a similar thing, she thought, but with people who really want to cook for one another? She posted her idea on Food52. She makes exceptions for people who live outside the United States \u2014 trying, for example, to keep people in Europe or Canada together \u2014 or who have specific dietary needs. \u201cLike, I try to match gluten-free people with gluten-free people,\u201d she said.The packages, which must be shipped by Dec. 10, are supposed to have a value of $25, whether in actual dollars, or the time and effort to make them. Ms. Bittner advises swappers to \u201cgift as you would like to be gifted.\u201d Many go overboard, using the little bit of information they have about their intended recipient as a conduit to deeper online investigations, so they can send a superior package.There aren\u2019t many complaints, and there have been no conflicts that have exploded into online flames, Ms. Bittner said. A few people have written in because they received a store-bought gift or felt their package was underwhelming in some other way. She tells them that is the nature of the exchange, and suggests tolerance.\u201cA lot of the time when people get premade gifts, it\u2019s usually because someone had a last-minute family emergency,\u201d she said. \u201cI think people are receptive that life can be complicated.\u201dAmanda Hesser, a former editor and columnist at The New York Times who founded Food52 with Merrill Stubbs (both of whom participate in the swap), said the project stands out in an age where so much of life plays out online.\u201cThere\u2019s something thrilling about receiving a box of goodies from a stranger, who has taken time to bake their favorite cookie recipe for you and package it up with pickles from a local maker or a wooden spoon carved by their uncle,\u201d she said.People often ask her if exchanging food with strangers is safe.\u201cI say, \u2018Well, the good news is you get to talk to the person before you trade food, but of course you don\u2019t know what they are doing in their kitchen,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201c\u2018But if you go to a church potluck, you don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing, either.\u2019\u201dThe beauty of exchanging homemade food, she said, is getting to know other people who value making food from scratch as much as you do.Edible gift exchanges ease the financial pressure of giving, and can help build community and good will. And the stakes are lower with a box of chai-tea eggnog cookies than with a sweater.Advertisement"}

Mr. Gaba is a health care analyst and the founder and editor of the website ACAsignups.net.But the Trump administration and Republicans are still undermining the health law. Its sabotage efforts in 2018 included cutting off subsidy reimbursement payments for low-income enrollees (the cost of which insurers pass along to unsubsidized consumers), slashing the marketing budget by 90 percent and gouging the outreach-assistance budget by 40 percent. Next year will have those plus the repeal of the individual mandate and the expansion of non-Obamacare-compliant policies that don\u2019t include the law\u2019s patient protections.These moves siphon off healthy enrollees, damaging the A.C.A. \u201crisk pool,\u201d so that its customers tend to be sicker and more expensive to carriers.

Several of the students were conversing with each other, she said, so initially he went unnoticed.As they neared the library, Ms. Felix said, he touched one of the women, who pulled away. At that point, she said, the man raised his voice and became agitated.The students became concerned for their safety, Ms. Felix said, and some of them took out their phones and began filming.\u201cWe\u2019ve never seen this man,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing.

They\u2019re hurting my son!\u201dA female sergeant and three police officers, two of whom appear to be women, surround Ms. Headley and attempt to pull the child away. Then one officer, her back facing the camera, repeatedly yanks the child in an apparent attempt to separate him from his mother.After more officers join the fray, the officer who yanked the child waves a yellow stun gun at the outraged crowd of onlookers, which includes several children and people filming with their cellphones.The encounter was the latest in New York to spark outrage over excessive policing against unarmed civilians, despite the Police Department\u2019s implementation of de-escalation training.The Patrol Guide, the official police manual, states that stun guns should be used in limited circumstances: against people who are physically resisting being taken into custody; people who indicate verbally that they intend to do so; and people who are acting in a manner that could cause injury to themselves or someone else.The Police Department called Friday\u2019s incident \u201ctroubling\u201d in a statement on Sunday, and said officers had responded to a 911 call for harassment. When the officers arrived, security guards told them that Ms. Headley had refused to leave.The police officers told Ms. Headley to leave \u201cnumerous times,\u201d the police said, and after she refused, the security guards \u201cbrought the woman to the floor.\u201d Police officers then tried to arrest her; despite her resistance, she was taken into custody, the police said.Ms. Headley was charged with resisting arrest, acting in a manner injurious to a child, obstructing governmental administration and trespassing. The police said she refused medical treatment for herself and her son, who was placed in the care of a relative.She could not be reached for comment on Sunday because she was being held without bail on Rikers Island, according to online corrections records and Brooklyn Defender Services, the public defender organization representing her.Deputy Commissioner Phillip Walzak, a police spokesman, said the officers involved are all assigned to the 84th Precinct and remained on full-duty status. He declined to give their names or say whether they followed department protocols, citing its investigation.The department is investigating the incident with the city Human Resources Administration, which administers public benefits. A spokeswoman for Allied Universal, the parent company of the security firm visible on security guards\u2019 patches, FJC Security, did not respond to requests for comment.\u201cThey\u2019re always rude,\u201d Ms. Ferguson said about the guards in an interview. \u201cThey think that people that are poor don\u2019t have nothing, so you can treat them any kind of way.\u201dShe disputed the police account of the incident and said the officer who waved the stun gun, not a security guard, had forced Ms. Headley to the ground.The police \u201cdidn\u2019t help at all,\u201d she said. \u201cThey made it way worse.\u201dFor the city\u2019s poor, applying for public assistance requires copious amounts of patience, and Friday had been no different for Ms. Headley, Ms. Ferguson said.Ms. Headley had been waiting for about two hours, sitting on the floor the entire time, in the part of the office that helps families get child care, Ms. Ferguson said. The office was more crowded than usual, she said, and the wait times were agonizing.A female security guard eventually approached Ms. Headley, and several more guards followed as a verbal dispute escalated. Ms. Ferguson said they taunted Ms. Headley and laughed in her face before leaving.Ten minutes later, they returned with the police, Ms. Ferguson said. A fearful expression crossed Ms. Headley\u2019s face as they approached, she said.The police officers asked Ms. Headley to come with them, Ms. Ferguson said. When she tried to explain, they cut her off.

She added, \u201cNo mother should have to experience the trauma and humiliation we all witnessed in this video.\u201dAlex S. Vitale, a sociology professor at Brooklyn College who coordinates its Policing and Social Justice Project, said that rather than defusing tensions, the officers appear to be needlessly using force against someone who refused to comply with their requests. He said the officers deserved to be suspended.\u201cIt\u2019s just hard to imagine what possibly could have transpired before the video starts that would have warranted that level of force in those circumstances,\u201d he said.Professor Vitale added that he was baffled that no one in the food stamp office, which has security guards and social workers, could figure out how to handle the situation without calling the police.In an era when New York City\u2019s police commissioner has pushed for stronger ties between neighborhoods and the police who patrol them, Professor Vitale said incidents like these only harden mistrust of the police among poor people of color.\u201cThis just reinforces their sense that police are a source of violence and injustice,\u201d he said.Nikita Stewart contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Manhood, Moola, McConnell and Trumpism", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe motivations behind policy, from tariffs to the wall.Opinion ColumnistSo what\u2019s it about? Nancy Pelosi, almost sure to be the next speaker of the House, reportedly told colleagues that for Trump, the wall is a \u201cmanhood thing.\u201d That sounds right. But that got me thinking. What other policies are driven by Trump\u2019s insecurity? What\u2019s driving this administration\u2019s policy in general?By McConnell I mean the standard G.O.P. agenda, which basically serves the interests of big donors, both wealthy individuals and corporations. This agenda consists, above all, of tax cuts for the donor class, with cuts in social programs to make up for some of the lost revenue. It also includes deregulation, especially for polluters but also for financial institutions and dubious players like for-profit colleges.Trump\u2019s foreign policy has, however, made a break, not just with previous Republican practice, but with everything America used to stand for. Previous presidents may have made realpolitik accommodations with unsavory regimes, but we\u2019ve never seen anything like Trump\u2019s obvious preference for brutal despots over democratic allies, his willingness to make excuses for whatever people like Vladimir Putin or Mohammed bin Salman do, up to and including murder.Some of this may reflect personal values: Putin, bin Salman and other strongmen are just Trump\u2019s kind of people. But it\u2019s hard to escape the suspicion that Moola \u2014 financial payoffs to Trump personally via the Trump Organization \u2014 plays an important role. After all, unlike leaders of democracies, dictators and absolute monarchs can direct lots of cash to Trump properties and offer the Trump family investment opportunities without having to explain their actions to pesky elected representatives.But I\u2019d argue that Trump\u2019s desire to assert his manhood is playing a big role in other areas, too, most notably trade policy.So major affairs of state are being decided not by the national interest, nor even by the interests of major groups within the nation, but by the financial interests and/or ego of the man in the White House. Is America amazing, or what?Advertisement"}

London\u2019s Covent Garden district is not short of restaurants. Lots of them are links in British and international chains (anyone for Shake Shack?), but there are plenty of excellent independents too.But apart from some Beardsley-esque artwork there\u2019s little about the restaurant that\u2019s backward-looking. The food of head chef George Barson is of the moment, with appealing seasonal dishes that sometimes turn out to be more complex than they sound, but with no fuss or flash. \u201cPork & Turnips,\u201d for instance, is presa \u2014 a cut from the shoulder of Ib\u00e9rico hogs \u2014 grilled to a precise medium-rare; it\u2019s dense and tender, smoky and juicy, with a big, meaty flavor we don\u2019t always associate with pork. But the turnips are what keep the kitchen busy. Some are pickled, some mashed, some cut into wedges and grilled. Mr. Barson said that the vegetable will change with the seasons; this turnip version, served at an early-October dinner, will be hard to top.\u201cCod & Spiced Crab\u201d also sounds straightforward, yet the briefly cured cod is finished with curry butter, topped with crab meat bathed in spicy hollandaise, and accompanied by several preparations of cauliflower.And what could be simpler than \u201cChips,\u201d as in French fries? Well, like a number of other chefs, Mr. Barson has been tinkering with this irresistible staple: His version is a composite of many thin layers of potato that\u2019s cooked, allowed to set, cut into French fry shapes and fried splinteringly crisp. Do not fail to order a portion.One dish that does glance back to Cora Pearl\u2019s day is \u201cBrown Shrimp Ranh\u00f6fer,\u201d named for the 19th-century chef of Delmonico\u2019s in New York who might or might not have invented Lobster Newberg. Here, Mr. Barson binds tiny shrimp with mayonnaise spiked with mustard, smoked anchovies and herbs, and piles them onto substantial croutons, to be sprinkled with mini-confetti of dehydrated chilies. Another well-balanced starter is cow\u2019s curd agnolotti with Jerusalem artichokes two ways (pur\u00e9ed and as crisp chips). The filling is marred by a hint of truffle oil \u2014 domineering even in these small quantities \u2014 but the dish is redeemed by the subtle artichokes, by the fresh flavor of the cheese and by splashes of aromatic chervil-tarragon pesto.And for dessert there is pumpkin: roasted, pur\u00e9ed and made custardy with eggs and cream. It\u2019s served with spunky ginger ice cream and topped with pecan crumbs for flavorsome crunch.A few minutes\u2019 walk from the Royal Opera House and numerous West End theaters, Cora Pearl is a lively, convivial place for dinner before a show \u2014 or better still, afterward, when the conversation and music abate and you can contemplate the hidden complexity of those French fries.Cora Pearl, 30 Henrietta Street WC2E 8NA; corapearl.co.uk; +44 (0) 20 7324 7722.

{"Headline": "America Didn\u2019t Always Lock Up Immigrants", "Date": "2018-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOur current detention policies have very specific historical roots.Dr. Minian is a professor of history at Stanford who has written extensively about Mexican migrants to the United States.Like the Trump administration\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy enacted earlier this year, which separated children from their parents while in detention, the tear-gassing of Central Americans immediately gripped the nation\u2019s attention and was decried by many as inhumane. There was almost no mention of the fact that if these migrants did ever manage to cross the border and apply for asylum, many of them would end up in some form of detention or other. But detaining migrants was not always seen as normal. On the contrary, immigration detention has a short-lived and complicated history.How did we move so far away from the notion that detention \u2014 and not just family separation and tear-gassing \u2014 is inhumane? How did holding more than 40,000 migrants behind bars come to be seen as normal?Born in Havana in 1952, Mr. Herrera was the eldest of seven children. Like many an elder sibling, he felt responsible for his family\u2019s well-being. But life in Cuba was hard and he was regularly unemployed. His family often went hungry. At the age of 18, he decided to do something about it: He walked into a government grocery store in Havana, hid two pounds of goat cheese under his jacket and fled. He did not get far. He was arrested and imprisoned for seven years. When he was released, he was even less prepared to find a job than he had been before spending time in prison. On Sept. 21, 1979, less than five months after his release, Mr. Herrera was sentenced to 13 years for stealing two pairs of pants.But on June 24, 1980, Mr. Herrera\u2019s luck seemed to change. That day, a guard came to his cell and told him that he was going to be placed on a boat headed to the United States. Mr. Herrera didn\u2019t know it, but two months earlier, Fidel Castro\u2019s government had announced that anyone who desired to leave Cuba could depart from the port of Mariel. In response, thousands of Cuban \u00e9migr\u00e9s who were living in Florida set out in shrimpers, yachts and sailboats to pick up their relatives. When the \u00e9migr\u00e9s arrived at the port of Mariel, however, the Cuban government informed them that if they wanted to take their relatives to the United States, they also had to transport anyone else the government wanted them to take. On some of those boats, government officials forcibly placed mentally ill individuals and prison inmates, including Mr. Herrera.As he sailed across the Florida straits, Mr. Herrera heard other passengers talking about Disneyland and expensive cars. He pictured himself holding a job and finally being free.When Mr. Herrera\u2019s boat anchored in Florida, however, his dreams of freedom sank. News had spread swiftly that Mr. Castro\u2019s government had sent criminals and mentally ill people among the arriving exiles. Although very few of the exiles had committed crimes, much less serious ones, fear of this wave of immigrants became widespread. This fear, fueled by rising crime rates in Miami and other communities where the Cuban exiles settled, led many Americans to demand the detention of the new arrivals.Upon questioning Mr. Herrera, American officials determined that he had been in prison in Cuba and sent him, along with the other exiles suspected of having committed crimes, to the Federal Correctional Institution at Talladega, Ala.Thousands of other Cuban exiles, who officials believed not to be criminals, were placed in military bases around the country. There, the exiles waited to be sponsored by someone (or some institution) who agreed to take care of them until they could settle on their own.As the months went by, most exiles left the military bases, but those who had no family members or acquaintances in the United States often had difficulty finding sponsors. This placed them in an impossible situation. Without sponsorship, the only way they could leave the camps was by leaving the United States. But government officials could not deport them because the Castro government refused to take them back.These exiles, many of whom were labeled \u201cantisocial\u201d but not accused of having committed any crime, were to remain in cages in the United States on an indefinite basis, with no prospects of being set free. Americans had come to fear these exiles so much that few of them protested their imprisonment and only a small number of legal workers tried to help them. The practice of detention was seen as necessary and normal.By 1982, about 400 Mariel Cubans who still had not been sponsored were sent to prison, primarily to the maximum-security penitentiary in Atlanta. These exiles, it seemed, no longer belonged in a refugee resettlement camp, which was intended as an interim location to await sponsorship. Now they belonged in a prison.Those sent to the Atlanta penitentiary joined the ranks of Cubans from the Mariel Boatlift who had broken the law in the United States (sometimes by committing misdemeanors) and those who were believed to have committed serious crimes in Cuba.They also encountered Alberto Herrera. When he had arrived at Talladega, Mr. Herrera was told that his release depended on good behavior, but even though he had an exemplary record, he was never released because he had no sponsor. Instead, on Feb. 14, 1981, he was sent to the Atlanta prison.Government officials were determined not to allow another Mariel Boatlift. They drafted contingency plans demanding the establishment of \u201csuitable facilities to hold 10,000 to 20,000\u201d migrants, so that if another large migrant group arrived, they would be prepared. They also conceived of detention as a way to deter migrants \u2014 particularly Haitians, who had been fleeing their country since 1971 \u2014 from setting sail to the United States. Up to that point, immigration officials still tended to follow the policy of releasing Haitians on parole pending a hearing and status determination, although they also intermittently detained arriving Haitian migrants. By 1981, immigration officials were detaining all Haitians who arrived without offering them the possibility of parole. A year later, the I.N.S. formalized the practice of blanket detention with very limited parole and extended it to all migrants. This rule reversed the policy, which the Supreme Court had hailed in 1958, that had allowed most migrants to be released while their cases were determined.It is because of this history that we now imprison undocumented migrants and asylum seekers. In 2016, the government detained nearly 360,000 people in a vast network of over 200 detention facilities, consisting of county jails and privately run prisons. In 2017, the cost of this colossal detention system was $2.6 billion.Examining the practice of immigration detention today, as Central Americans are fleeing their home countries for the United States, demonstrates that the failure of our asylum system extends far beyond the instances in which migrants are tear-gassed and children are separated from their parents. The system itself is designed to treat migrants and asylum seekers like felons to be placed behind bars.But it does not have to be like this. The history of immigration detention shows us that a more cost-effective and humane way of dealing with migrants and asylum seekers is possible. After all, in the years between 1954 and 1980, we already had just such a system in place.Advertisement"}

Mr. Eldik is working on a screenplay titled \u201cPrimrose.\u201dIf you turn onto Primrose Lane at the tip of the North Shore of Long Island, you\u2019ll find a row of neat, two-story colonial homes decorated with wreaths and reindeers. My parents\u2019 home is undecorated. They are not allies of the Grinch or Mr. Scrooge. They\u2019re Muslims, the only Muslims in the neighborhood. I grew up in that home. My parents, Egyptian immigrants, moved from Queens in 1991 to raise my two siblings and me in a safer community. They were drawn to the tidy yards with swimming pools and schools with green lacrosse fields.My mom\u2019s head scarf, our odd names and our shaded skin led to persistent inquiries. Our classmates often mispronounced our names, which led to taunting \u2014 particularly after the tragedy of Sept. 11, when they would amuse themselves by chanting \u201cBin Laden\u201d at us on the school bus. One day in high school, I walked out to our driveway to find my tires slashed.My effeminacy made things worse. One Saturday night, when I was in ninth grade, kids were hanging out after a football game and drew a picture of me on our town\u2019s abandoned water tower with the words \u201cGarab (read: gay Arab) Terrorist\u201d painted on it. It might still be there. We would often wake on weekend mornings to find empty beer cans scattered across our front lawn. I would usually clean them up before my 5 a.m. shift at the local bakery on Saturday. But if it was Sunday, and I was sleeping in, my dad would pick them up. Christmas break was especially stressful because, with school closed, there was more time for vandalism.Around Christmas 2006, eggs were thrown at our home. I remember climbing onto the roof through a front-facing window in my brother\u2019s bedroom, balancing a bucket of scalding hot water to scrub the yolk off the shingles. It took hours, and I got frostbite. Our neighbors had eggnog; we had egg yolk.I hated that this happened. But I mostly resented that my family was different, that I was not white and that my name was not John or Michael. On Christmas Eve, during my bakery shift, classmates would sometimes stop by on their way home from church for holiday pastries. Some were friendly. But I was too ashamed to embrace their holiday spirit.My mother\u2019s words stayed with me, and over time helped me transform my pain into empathy. Whenever I go home, I run into those kids who used to torment me. We say hello awkwardly at a restaurant or the supermarket and catch up. My mind goes back to those painful school years, and I wonder if they remember, too. But I know it doesn\u2019t matter. The way they once saw me is no longer part of what I see in the mirror. I understand now that, through all her stories and corny words of encouragement, my mother was trying to teach me that I define myself.This is the time of year when we all go home \u2014 in a car, on a plane or just in memory. These experiences will always be part of who I am. But so are the values my parents instilled in me. Whatever your tradition, returning home for the holidays offers a chance to renew a sense of yourself. By stepping out of our daily routines and re-encountering our past we can decide who we want to be in the future. I will draw strength from my family\u2019s Muslim faith, Egyptian heritage and American experiences, the good ones and the bad ones. This Christmas, when we gather at my parents\u2019 home, we\u2019ll eat red and green peanut M&Ms while we watch \u201cThe Family Stone\u201d or \u201cA Christmas Story\u201d for the hundredth time. We\u2019ll drive into the city to admire the festive windows on Fifth Avenue, and we\u2019ll take a few selfies at Rockefeller Center. My mom will tell the story of how a mutual friend\u2019s Christmas party brought her and my father together, and she\u2019ll point out, once again, the nearby Netherland Club, where they wed.

But also remember to take the credit card with which you purchased the reservation. For flights it\u2019s particularly important \u2014 in the fine print on some airlines, you\u2019ll notice that it\u2019s actually a requirement. And while my credit card was not checked the majority of the time, on one occasion it was. Don\u2019t find yourself in an awkward situation: Make sure you have it with you.Additionally, make sure the credit card you\u2019re using to pay for your rides doesn\u2019t charge a foreign transaction fee. If you have a credit card attached to your Uber account that does charge a foreign transaction fee, you may find yourself paying extra when you use Uber overseas. The Citi Premier Card and the Chase Sapphire Reserve are two examples of cards that do not impose foreign transaction fees.Sometimes it\u2019s quicker and more convenient, however, to take a tuk-tuk, or auto rickshaw. In that event, prepare to bargain. Also be aware that tuk-tuks can\u2019t take you everywhere \u2014 when I hailed one to drop me at the airport in Delhi, it was an unpleasant surprise when the driver wouldn\u2019t take me right to the terminal and I had to take a separate shuttle \u2014 tuk-tuks, he said, were not allowed to drop you off at the actual terminal.I found exchange rates to be decent in airports, and one advantage of exchanging in person as opposed to an A.T.M. is that you can ask for small bills. You don\u2019t want to be walking around with a fistful of purple 2,000 rupee notes. Whenever you can make change, do it. Fast food restaurants are particularly good for this. You\u2019ll need small bills when you\u2019re buying a cup of tea on the street, or taking a tuk-tuk ride \u2014 do not expect your driver to be able to make change.Haggling is an art form. And while some people truly don\u2019t like doing it (I don\u2019t particularly, either), it\u2019s worth trying to get in the spirit of it, especially if you\u2019re planning to do any shopping. In general, decide what the particular thing \u2014 a shirt, or a handbag \u2014 is worth to you. Set a mental ceiling on what you\u2019re willing to pay. The first price the seller will throw at you, particularly if you\u2019re visibly foreign, will likely be very high. Come back with half of that price, or possibly even less, depending on the circumstances. The seller will dramatically dismiss your reply and come back with a slightly smaller number.From there, it\u2019s just a question of how much you want the item. Don\u2019t focus on getting to the absolute lowest price a vendor will go \u2014 if it\u2019s between paying 500 or 600 rupees for something, don\u2019t make a federal case over that last 100 rupees, which is less than two dollars, and possibly lose the sale. Remember: Objectively, you\u2019re still probably getting a good deal, and that money likely means more to them than it does to you.First, don\u2019t drink the water. This sounds obvious, but it extends to other activities: Be careful when brushing your teeth with tap water (use bottled if possible) or opening your mouth while showering. I also avoid buying drinks with ice on the street \u2014 while the fruit juice you order might be perfectly safe, the ice may not.I\u2019ll pass on fresh produce, unless it\u2019s something that can be peeled. Generally, I look for hot foods, and street stalls that have a lot of turnover. If they\u2019re serving a lot of food, there\u2019s a greater chance the food is fresh. And things like the wonderfully spiced, milky tea, which is kept at a rolling boil at the many street-side tea stands, are likely to be safer than raw items.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s a guide to breaking up with the social network and its photo-sharing app for good.You may have decided enough is enough: It\u2019s time to delete Facebook.\u201cPeople\u2019s privacy and security is incredibly important, and we\u2019re sorry this happened,\u201d the company said at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s why we took immediate action to secure people\u2019s accounts and fix the vulnerability.\u201dMaybe you are just tired of the partisan yammering and updates from the six-degrees-of-friends.I have some firsthand experience with all of this. After the disclosure of Facebook\u2019s breach, I felt my trust in the social network was broken. So I pulled out my data from Facebook and purged the account. What I found out about the process: The more you have integrated Facebook into your life, the more time-consuming it will be to delete it.To make account deletion as painless as possible, here is a step-by-step guide. I also included steps on breaking up with Instagram, Facebook\u2019s photo-sharing app, for those looking for a cleaner getaway.Before you commit to breaking up with Facebook, it\u2019s important to handicap the potential collateral damage. Some products and services are deeply integrated with Facebook and could become difficult to use without the social networking account. Doing all of that was a pain. But the exercise was worth it to ensure I wouldn\u2019t break my accounts for other sites.Now that I knew I could safely delete Facebook, I started pulling my data out of the social network. That means any personal information that I had collected in my account, including my photos, message transcripts and friends list, and that I did not already have copies of elsewhere.I requested a copy of all my data. Facebook took about an hour to assemble all the information into one file that measured about 700 megabytes. The file took about 10 minutes to download, and the information was organized into folders for different types of data, like photos, search history and messages.Pulling your information off Facebook doesn\u2019t mean you are removing it from the company\u2019s servers, though. More on that in a bit.After making sure I had a copy of all the Facebook data I cared about, it was time to do the deed. In Facebook\u2019s settings menu, I clicked the button \u201cYour Facebook information\u201d and then clicked \u201cDelete Your Account and Information.\u201dFinally, I clicked on the blue \u201cDelete Account\u201d button. A prompt popped up asking for my password. Then a box showed up warning that deletion was permanent. I wasn\u2019t fazed \u2014 and hit the button.But wait. After hitting delete, my Facebook account was not actually erased, despite all the hoops I had jumped through. The site said that my account was scheduled for permanent deletion after 30 days, and that if I logged in again, I would have the option to cancel the deletion request.This grace period is here so people can change their minds. In addition, the entire deletion process may take up to 90 days to purge all backups of your data from the company\u2019s servers, according to Facebook. In other words, be patient.If you also want to get away from Facebook\u2019s clutches by removing your Instagram account, that process is much easier. That\u2019s because Instagram is not nearly as wide-reaching as Facebook; you don\u2019t use your Instagram account to log in to other apps, for instance. I confess I did not personally follow through with this. I kept my Instagram account because I like keeping in touch with friends there.After ending a romantic relationship, have you ever blocked your ex on Facebook so that he or she can\u2019t follow you around? You should do the same after breaking up with Facebook to make sure the site stops tracking your browsing activities.After I completed these steps myself, there was no sense of closure as I had expected. That\u2019s probably because I knew I might end up reversing the Facebook deletion for the sake of writing instructive articles like this one. I have 30 days to decide.Advertisement"}

The measures also will limit early voting, allow legislators to intervene in some lawsuits and limit the power of Josh Kaul, the incoming attorney general.In addition, the new laws prevent Mr. Kaul and Mr. Evers from withdrawing the state from a lawsuit challenging the Affordable Care Act, and further codify policies passed by the Republicans, including a work requirement for people on Medicaid and a voter ID law.Mr. Walker insisted he had been gracious and helpful to Mr. Evers since the election narrowly thwarted Mr. Walker\u2019s hopes for a third term. \u201cWe have been very purposeful in wanting to make sure that this next governor has a good transition,\u201d said Mr. Walker, who added that he had allowed the governor-elect to tour the executive mansion and provided office space for his staff.And Mr. Walker seemed eager, as he has repeatedly in recent weeks, to define how his eight years in office should be remembered.\u201cTo me, that\u2019s the legacy: It\u2019s the fact that Wisconsin is working,\u201d Mr. Walker told reporters. \u201cThese bills don\u2019t change that legacy. And these bills don\u2019t fundamentally change the power of not just the next governor but any governor thereafter.\u201d\u201cWhat didn\u2019t he do?\u201d said State Senator Fred Risser, a Democrat who was first elected to the Legislature in 1956. \u201cHe reversed the progressive, innovative state we used to be proud of.\u201d\u201cHe had a backbone of steel,\u201d said Representative Sean Duffy, a Republican who represents northern Wisconsin in Congress.The final package of legislation that Mr. Walker signed on Friday came after defeats for Republicans in Wisconsin, a swing state that Barack Obama and Donald J. Trump both won. Republicans held onto the State Legislature but lost contests for governor and attorney general..Just three years ago, Mr. Walker had a spin as a front-runner in the presidential race, but his campaign ended quickly as Mr. Trump suctioned support from more traditional candidates. Mr. Walker\u2019s return to Wisconsin was difficult: People complained that he had been too focused on his own ambitions, and he spent months making up for it with parades, local meetings and ribbon cuttings. As he set off this year in a bid for a rare third term as governor, Mr. Walker warned of signs of a \u201cblue wave\u201d and pleaded with Republicans not to be complacent.In the end, he lost by roughly 30,000 votes, or about 1 percentage point.In the days that followed, Mr. Walker kept a relatively low profile. On social media, he posted messages of scripture, images of himself deer hunting in the state\u2019s Northwoods, and notes about sentimental items he found as he helped his mother move after his father died. He and his wife, Tonette, were reportedly looking for a new home and vehicle, with time in the governor\u2019s mansion winding down.\u201cIt\u2019s tough to lose,\u201d said Jim Villa, a longtime friend and former political aide to Mr. Walker. \u201cBut I\u2019ve always said that Scott has one of the calmest demeanors of anyone I know.\u201dTo Mr. Walker\u2019s supporters, the bills Mr. Walker signed on Friday were pragmatic ways to shore up Republican policies and establish reasonable checks on the incoming Democrats. By signing the bills, he had secured his legacy, they said, not sullied it.\u201c\u2018My constituents will say, \u2018Thank God you\u2019ve protected the reforms, thank God that our state will be able to continue on the path we are on,\u2019\u201d said State Senator Alberta Darling, a Republican from suburban Milwaukee.But to opponents, the bills represent something sinister.State Senator La Tonya Johnson, a Democrat from Milwaukee, said the legislation \u201cwill definitely go down in history as being the biggest power grab ever.\u201dEven some conservatives have spoken out. Sheldon Lubar, a Republican businessman who once supported Mr. Walker, said Mr. Walker\u2019s record would be destroyed by this.\u201cI think as a relatively young man, he should be very concerned of what his legacy is,\u201d Mr. Lubar said.On Thursday, a day before he signed the limits on his successor, Mr. Walker had donned an orange vest and safety goggles at a plant in Fox Crossing, about 100 miles north of Milwaukee, where workers make adult undergarments and feminine hygiene products.\u201cI said, \u2018I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s the last thing I do,\u2019\u201d Mr. Walker recounted to rows of plant workers in blue-striped uniforms, \u201c\u2018we\u2019re going to find some way to save the jobs.\u2019\u201dAmong the new restrictions on Mr. Evers: Future governors who negotiate tax incentives like those would need legislative approval for their deal.Mitch Smith reported from Fox Crossing, and Monica Davey from Chicago.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "2020 Democrats Face a Vexing Issue: Big Money From the Rich", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt is one of the most potent and feared weapons in the arsenal of modern American politics: the super PAC.But as three dozen Democrats ponder presidential runs in 2020 and begin to design their campaign infrastructures, some leading names beyond Senator Bernie Sanders are expected to forgo or disavow these fund-raising committees that allow allies to haul unlimited sums from wealthy backers. The hope of these potential candidates is that grass-roots donors and progressive activists would reward them more handsomely in the primary for rejecting such funds.If she runs, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is likely to reject the assistance of a super PAC, according to two people familiar with her thinking. And the former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. revealed in a little-noticed passage in his 2017 book that he would have gone without one if he had run in 2016, making it more difficult for him to backtrack now.The question is a politically vexing one. The financial firepower would be alluring to those with a ready network of financiers, such as Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, who is seen as likely to have a super PAC, according to donors, strategists and people close to him. Some allies are already discussing possible super PACs for Senators Kamala Harris of California and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, the two most Democratic donor-rich states in the nation. But aides to both of them say they are not currently seeking these fund-raising vehicles.The choice will represent one of the earliest and potentially more consequential crossroads of the nascent primary, and has been the subject of fierce debate within the inner circles of some candidates. Is it worth giving up possible seven-figure checks for the chance to campaign more effectively as the candidate of the little guy? Or, put another way, can a Democrat risk embracing millionaires and billionaires in an era when small donors and the party\u2019s seemingly ascendant left wing may pummel PAC-backed candidates as allies of the rich?\u201cEvery Democrat should approach the idea of a super PAC in the primary with caution,\u201d said Robby Mook, who served as the 2016 campaign manager for Hillary Clinton. \u201cThey are a liability as much as a strength.\u201dIt\u2019s no secret why these political action committees can be so appealing. Federal law currently caps contributions for presidential primary campaigns at $2,700. Campaign cash in 2020 is expected to be tight in what could be a historically crowded field. In contrast, donors face no limits with super PACs.But opposition to big money has become a galvanizing force in Democratic politics. Democrats such as Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke, the failed Texas Senate candidate now mulling a 2020 run, have turned their rejection of corporate and PAC funds into a tidal wave of small-dollar donations. Mr. Sanders inveighed against the influence of big money and raised more than $230 million in 2016.The risk for any 2020 Democrat is that reliance on a billionaire-backed super PAC becomes a litmus test of liberal credibility as a reformer.\u201cIf you\u2019re depending on a super PAC to succeed in the primary,\u201d Mr. Mook warned, \u201cyou\u2019re probably losing.\u201dThough super PACs aligned with particular candidates played major roles in the 2012 and 2016 Republican nomination fights, Democrats have not held a wide-open presidential primary featuring multiple, big, candidate-specific super PACs since the Supreme Court unshackled such spending in 2010.Strategists inside multiple potential 2020 operations described active discussions on the big money conundrum. Some call the notion of skipping out on one foolish. Others, even within the orbit of the same candidate, disagree sharply on the risks and rewards. What if one of the billionaire candidates \u2014 the financier Tom Steyer, Howard Schultz of Starbucks or the former New York City mayor Michael R. Bloomberg \u2014 gets in? What if your candidate wins an early state but fund-raising doesn\u2019t pick up fast enough to buy the ads needed by Super Tuesday or in a state like California that has jumped earlier on the primary calendar?\u201cYou have to know you have the big donors ready to write those checks,\u201d Julianna Smoot, a former top fund-raiser and deputy campaign manager for Barack Obama, said of the decision to bless a super PAC.Mr. Biden wrote in his 2017 book that he thought through the super PAC question carefully as he considered a 2016 run, saying it was \u201ctempting to play the game.\u201d\u201cFor the first time in all my years of campaigning, I knew there was big money out there for me,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut I also knew people were sick of it all.\u201dPerhaps no potential Democratic candidate counts more billionaire potential financiers as friends or allies than Mr. Booker, who attended Stanford and wooed investments from Silicon Valley when he was Newark mayor, including a $100 million donation for schools from Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook.Mr. Booker\u2019s team declined to comment, though people close to him said no steps had been taken to create a super PAC.Mark Longabaugh, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders, said the Vermont senator would disavow any super PAC support if he runs, as he did in 2016. Mr. Longabaugh also cautioned that super PACs could \u201cboomerang\u201d against those who have them: \u201cIt will be an issue in the campaign.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t on one hand oppose Citizens United and the corrupting influence of corrupting money,\u201d Mr. Longabaugh said of the court decision that helped pave the way for super PACs, \u201cand on the other hand take that money.\u201dThose candidates had something else in common: They all lost.The calculation can be complicated. Both Ms. Gillibrand and Ms. Harris, for instance, have deep relationships with home-state donors who could finance them. But both have also invested heavily in creating a digital network of small donors ahead of a possible run.\u201cAt this point, Kirsten hasn\u2019t made a decision on whether she will be a candidate for president, nor is she looking to create any outside spending if she does,\u201d said Glen Caplin, a spokesman for Ms. Gillibrand.Lily Adams, a spokeswoman for Ms. Harris, said much the same: \u201cShe has not decided whether she is running for president, but there are no plans for a super PAC for a prospective candidacy.\u201dThere is ample gray area for politicians to explore or exploit, as super PACs, by definition, are formed independently, providing candidates some plausible deniability if and after they emerge.For Ms. Harris, there have been discussions in California of a super PAC that would include two former top advisers to her past campaigns, Brian Brokaw and Dan Newman, according to people familiar with the matter.For Ms. Gillibrand, Ross Offinger, a former fund-raiser for the New York senator, has quietly been reaching out to donors to feel out interest in a pro-Gillibrand super PAC, floating the name of Bill Hyers, who ran Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s first campaign for the House in 2006 and served as Martin O\u2019Malley\u2019s campaign manager in 2016, according to a person familiar with the calls.\u201cWe would discourage any activity of this type at this point,\u201d Mr. Caplin said.In some cases, strategists have floated the idea of delaying the creation of super PACs until deeper in the race to minimize blowback; of course, that risks donors deciding not to cut checks later.In Texas, Mr. O\u2019Rourke broadly denounced super PACs throughout his Senate bid, but some still got involved late to attack his Republican opponent. The outside spending did not seem to smudge the reputation of Mr. O\u2019Rourke, who raised record sums online.In 2012, Ms. Warren struck a deal with her Republican opponent to denounce super PACs and give away money to charity if they got involved. People close to her said that she is unlikely to seek super PAC assistance in 2020 and that she is unlikely to endorse any candidate who would if she does not run.Almost every would-be campaign has been quietly gauging donors on their level of commitment.Like so many donors, Mr. Saperstein is not ready to commit in 2020 \u2014 yet.\u201cI\u2019ll probably give to Bernie and Elizabeth to start out the primaries,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I\u2019ll sit back and wait to see how things develop.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Junk Removers Manhandle My Heart", "Date": "2018-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveMeandering through grief, a man tries to replace his sofa. It doesn\u2019t go well.Our choice was the Beecroft, a tight-backed sofa with low arms and wooden legs capped with offset brass wheels and covered in a white denim slipcover. I didn\u2019t just feel grown up buying this sofa, I felt sophisticated.Initially, John balked. \u201cI\u2019m not paying $3,000 for a couch.\u201dBut it would last forever, I argued.\u201cThere has to be something cheaper that we like just as much,\u201d he said.There wasn\u2019t. Every other sofa we considered paled in comparison.When we moved into a new apartment 13 years later, Miss Beecroft was still as sturdy as ever. But with an opportunity to remodel and redecorate, we decided she was due for a refresh. We took the slipcover and cushions to an upholsterer who remade them in a natural-colored linen. The result was stunning.A few years later, our two new Chihuahua puppies, Sissy and Skeeter, quickly figured out how to pull the underside burlap from the wooden frame and create a little cave to hide in. Before long, all of the burlap had been ripped from its staples, which wasn\u2019t a good look for Miss Bee. Sadly, things went downhill from there.The linen slipcover didn\u2019t prove as durable as the white denim, especially with two small dogs. Holes appeared, so we flipped the cushions. The other sides got holes. Then one of Miss Bee\u2019s wooden legs came loose, developing a gruesome tilt.I removed the leg altogether and propped up that end on a pair of books. I had our tailor patch the fabric with large squares until the patches themselves developed holes.I handled that on my own because by then John had died, succumbing to a rare and aggressive cancer he\u2019d learned he had only two years earlier. My mind being elsewhere, I figured I would flip the cushions so no one would notice, forgetting that both sides were in tatters.I had a choice: Did I fix up Miss Bee, provider of comfort and anchor of my home and life with John? Or did I accept that she wasn\u2019t worth fixing?I don\u2019t remember what made me decide to bite the bullet and order a new sofa, only that it happened fast. I knew what I wanted. It was just a matter of checking a few boxes online, entering my credit card number and clicking \u201cBuy.\u201dAll that was left was to arrange to have Miss Bee taken away. I called a junk removal service I liked because they would try to donate reusable items to charity or thrift shops. Miss Bee had a solid frame (not to mention a beautiful heart, as crazy as that sounds), so I hoped the right person could restore her to glory.I prepared for the haulers\u2019 arrival by moving a huge shelving unit near the front door to provide fuller access to the entry. I had recently bought the unit to hold sentimental objects I had accumulated with John over the years. Before I could move the shelves, I had to remove those objects: seashells from vacations, random pottery, wasps\u2019 and hornets\u2019 nests, incense holders, pitchers, jugs and vases.I removed John\u2019s grandmother\u2019s metal salt-and-pepper shakers in the shape of two birds on a branch and her gold vase with ornate floral etching (the one John\u2019s mother keeps hinting that she wants back). I removed the simple wooden box that holds a portion of John\u2019s ashes. Made by my carpenter brother-in-law, the box also holds clippings from John\u2019s hair and beard, a few trinkets and a small bag of our first dog\u2019s ashes, because she was John\u2019s favorite little girl.I removed framed photos of John, the candles I light for him, the tiny Ganesh I bought for him in India, the incense he gave to me on our last Christmas together and the metal bird feet he bought for me many years ago and that I love so much.After moving the shelf, I was ready. Or so I thought.The October morning the haulers arrived, I explained that the sofa would fit through the doorway but only at a specific angle. I knew this because the movers who brought it in had an arduous time but finally figured it out.These haulers weren\u2019t so patient. They attempted to shove it through from different angles with no luck.And then it happened.Although I had moved the shelves and everything on them, I had left a small, porcelain deer head hanging on the wall near the door, a Christmas gift from John that was one of my most cherished possessions. The night before, I had considered moving it along with the rest of my keepsakes but then thought, \u201cNah, it won\u2019t be in the way.\u201dAs the haulers jostled and lifted, the sofa bumped the deer head and knocked it off.\u201cUh oh,\u201d the main guy said as I bounded from my chair. \u201cHold up,\u201d he said to his partner as I fell to my knees and scooped up the deer head and left antler, which had broken off.I cursed as I looked at the pieces in my hand, a wave of despair washing over me. Returning to my chair, I pulled out my phone.\u201ctrying not to have a total emotional breakdown,\u201d I texted to my friends Jessica and Rosella. \u201cthe sofa removers broke my john derian porcelain deer that john gave me for christmas.\u201d\u201ci\u2019m really heartbroken\u201d\u201cit\u2019s like john was angry at me for getting rid of our sofa\u201dNeither responded.Meanwhile, the haulers gave up trying to figure out how to fit the sofa through the doorway. \u201cI\u2019m going to the truck to get a hammer,\u201d the main guy said. Then, to me: \u201cDo you have a hammer?\u201dI didn\u2019t want them smashing up Miss Bee, but in my dazed state I retrieved a hammer for him. Within seconds, he was assaulting her back legs.They did not give in quickly. The hardwood frame was solidly built. I sat in my chair and watched as these two men violently attacked Miss Bee.\u201cthe guys are still trying to figure out how to squeeze the sofa through the door,\u201d I typed to Jessica and Rosella.\u201cthey\u2019re literally bashing it to bits with a hammer\u201d\u201ccan\u2019t stop crying\u201dNo response.Eventually, with much effort, the haulers succeeded in knocking off the back legs. Miss Bee had put up a fight, her legs cracking and splitting but not letting loose, even as chunks of wood flew across the living room.I felt as if I had watched a family member being murdered. This wasn\u2019t how it was supposed to happen. They were supposed to give her to someone who would lovingly restore her, not butcher her in my own apartment.Once Miss Bee\u2019s shattered legs were ripped away, the men were able to swiftly carry her through the doorway. Wiping away tears, I picked up her tattered seat cushions and carried them to the door, handing them to one of the haulers. I didn\u2019t want those assassins coming back in.I signed for their work. It didn\u2019t occur to me to offer them a tip. And then, I lost it.Jessica responded to my text first: \u201cno, john not angry, it\u2019s just the clumsy removal man. glue the deer. it\u2019s ok. john loves you. go stand on your balcony and take some deep breaths, look up at the sky and tell him you love him so much. inhale some fresh air. everything is ok.\u201dThen Rosella: \u201cyes everything she said. i\u2019ll be home around 1:30 and i\u2019ll come by for moral support and with some gorilla glue.\u201dThe morning\u2019s saga had unlocked a trove of mounting grief within me that wasn\u2019t, of course, about the sofa. It was about Halloween, which John loved. It was about our anniversary, Nov. 6. It was about another Thanksgiving without John, and another birthday without him, and another Christmas, and then New Year\u2019s Eve.\u201cI miss you so much,\u201d I wailed. \u201cI want you back. I need you here. Please come back to me.\u201dOut on my balcony, taking deep breaths of fresh autumn air, I realized I was dying of thirst, completely dehydrated from all the sobbing. So I poured a glass of ice water, trudged to my bedroom and collapsed into bed.Grief and catharsis can take surprising forms. I hadn\u2019t expected a sofa to play such a starring role in mine, but the murder of Miss Bee had provided a powerful \u2014 and beneficial \u2014 release.Tomorrow would be another day, and a new year beckoned. Until then, Rosella (and her Gorilla Glue) were on the way.Mike Rucker, vice president of the NBC News Brand Studio, is writing a memoir about love and loss.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Emails Show Its Real Mission: Making Money and Crushing Competition", "Date": "2018-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftThat gift was 250 pages\u2019 worth of internal emails, in which Facebook\u2019s executives are shown discussing ways to undermine their competitors, obscure their collection of user data and \u2014 above all \u2014 ensure that their products kept growing.But the internal emails, a rare glimpse into Facebook\u2019s inner workings, show that the image the company promoted for years \u2014 as an idealistic enterprise more dedicated to \u201cbringing the world closer together\u201d than increasing its own bottom line \u2014 was a carefully cultivated smoke screen.These emails reveal that in the formative years of Facebook\u2019s growth, the company\u2019s executives were ruthless and unsparing in their ambition to collect more data from users, extract concessions from developers and stamp out possible competitors.\u201cIt shows the degree to which the company knowingly and intentionally prioritized growth at all costs,\u201d said Ashkan Soltani, a privacy researcher and former chief technologist of the Federal Trade Commission.Here are four revelations from the emails that detail Facebook\u2019s aggressive quest for growth:1. The company engineered ways to collect Android users\u2019 data without alerting them.In February 2015, Facebook had a privacy dilemma.But there was a problem: Android\u2019s privacy policies meant that Facebook would need to ask users to opt in to having this data collected. Facebook\u2019s executives worried that asking users for this data could bring a public backlash.\u201cThis is a pretty high risk thing to do from a PR perspective but it appears that the growth team will charge ahead and do it,\u201d one executive, Michael LeBeau, wrote.He outlined the nightmare scenario: \u201cScreenshot of the scary Android permissions screen becomes a meme (as it has in the past), propagates around the web, it gets press attention, and enterprising journalists dig into what exactly the new update is requesting, then write stories about \u2018Facebook uses new Android update to pry into your private life in ever more terrifying ways.\u2019\u201dUltimately, Facebook found a workaround. Yul Kwon, the head of Facebook\u2019s privacy program, wrote in an email that the growth team had found that if Facebook\u2019s upgraded app asked only to read Android users\u2019 call logs, and not request other types of data from them, users would not be shown a permission pop-up.\u201cBased on their initial testing, it seems that this would allow us to upgrade users without subjecting them to an Android permissions dialog at all,\u201d Mr. Kwon wrote.2. Mark Zuckerberg personally approved cutting off a competitor\u2019s data access.In January 2013, one of Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s lieutenants emailed him with news about Twitter, one of Facebook\u2019s biggest competitors. The company had introduced a video-sharing service called Vine, which allowed users to create and post six-second video clips.When new users signed up for Vine, they were given the option of following their Facebook friends \u2014 a feature enabled through Facebook\u2019s application program interface, or API. This feature was widely used, and had become a valuable tool for new apps to accelerate user growth. But in Vine\u2019s case, Facebook played hardball.\u201cUnless anyone raises objections, we will shut down their friends API access today,\u201d wrote the lieutenant, Justin Osofsky, now a Facebook vice president.Mr. Zuckerberg, the chief executive, replied: \u201cYup, go for it.\u201dOn Wednesday, Rus Yusupov, one of Vine\u2019s co-founders, said on Twitter, \u201cI remember that day like it was yesterday.\u201dFacebook\u2019s decision to shut off Vine\u2019s API access proved fateful. Months later, Instagram released its own short-form video feature, which many saw as a further attempt by Facebook to hobble Vine\u2019s growth. Vine shut down in 2016, after stagnant growth and heavy competition led many of its stars and users to go elsewhere.3. Facebook used a privacy app to collect usage data about its competitors.According to the emails released on Wednesday, Facebook executives received reports about the performance of rival apps, using data obtained through Onavo.Sometimes, those reports revealed up-and-coming competitors. One report included in the email cache, dated April 2013, said that WhatsApp, the mobile messaging app, was gaining steam. According to Onavo\u2019s proprietary data, WhatsApp was being used to send 8.2 billion messages a day, whereas Facebook\u2019s own mobile app was sending just 3.5 billion messages daily.4. Facebook executives wanted more social sharing, as long as it happened on Facebook.In November 2012, Mr. Zuckerberg sent a lengthy note to several top executives called \u201cPlatform Model Thoughts.\u201d It outlined how intensely he wanted Facebook to be the center of everyone\u2019s social life online.The email addressed a debate that was raging inside Facebook at the time, about whether outside app developers should have to pay to connect their apps to Facebook\u2019s developer platform. Mr. Zuckerberg said that he was leaning away from a charge-for-access model, and toward what he called \u201cfull reciprocity\u201d \u2014 giving third-party developers the ability to connect their apps to Facebook free, in exchange for those apps\u2019 giving data back to Facebook, and making it easy for users to post their activity from those services on their Facebook timelines.By giving away access, Mr. Zuckerberg said, Facebook could entice more developers to build on its platform. And by requiring app developers to send data back to Facebook, it could use those apps to increase the value of its own network. He wrote that social apps \u201cmay be good for the world but it\u2019s not good for us unless people also share back to Facebook.\u201dFacebook later put in place a version of this \u201creciprocity rule\u201d that required developers to make it possible for users of their apps to post their activity to Facebook, but did not require them to send usage data back to Facebook. (Not coincidentally, this \u201creciprocity rule\u201d explains why for several years, it was virtually impossible to go on Facebook without seeing dozens of updates about what your friends were watching on Hulu or listening to on Spotify.)But back in 2012, the company\u2019s worry was not about data misuse. Instead, the company was chiefly concerned with how to use those developers\u2019 apps to spur its own growth.Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, wrote back to concur with Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s approach to data reciprocity.\u201cI think the observation that we are trying to maximize sharing on Facebook, not just sharing in the world, is a critical one,\u201d she wrote.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s a good thing for the Warriors that the rest of the West, while ridiculously deep with competent teams, doesn\u2019t appear to house a consensus threat to the overwhelming preseason favorites.Clippers (20-14)L.A.\u2019s \u201cother\u201d team is thriving amid all the attention (and pressure) heaped upon LeBron\u2019s Lakers. Little was expected of the Clippers before the coming off-season \u2014 when they plan to make their own aggressive free-agent pitches to the likes of Kawhi Leonard and Durant \u2014 but flashes of All-Star potential from Tobias Harris combined with the gritty group of veterans on the roster around him have put the Clippers on a surprising 48-win pace.Lakers (20-15)Kings (19-16) Sacramento ranks up there with the West-leading Denver Nuggets as the league\u2019s foremost Cinderella story as it bids to bring a halt to the league\u2019s longest active run without a playoff berth (12 seasons). Maintaining this level of success will be difficult in a Western Conference in which 14 of the 15 teams harbor legitimate postseason aspirations, but the fast-paced Kings \u2014 led by the speedy point guard De\u2019Aaron Fox \u2014 have already defied doubters for nearly three months after being picked to post one of the league\u2019s worst records.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)It was stunning to see so many arresting images together in one place.

{"Headline": "Bad Faith, Pathos and G.O.P. Economics", "Date": "2018-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn professionals who sold their integrity, and got nothing in return.Opinion ColumnistAs 2018 draws to an end, we\u2019re seeing many articles about the state of the economy. What I\u2019d like to do, however, is talk about something different \u2014 the state of economics, at least as it relates to the political situation. And that state is not good: The bad faith that dominates conservative politics at every level is infecting right-leaning economists, too.This is sad, but it\u2019s also pathetic. For even as once-respected economists abase themselves in the face of Trumpism, the G.O.P. is making it ever clearer that their services aren\u2019t wanted, that only hacks need apply.What you need to know when talking about economics and politics is that there are three kinds of economist in modern America: liberal professional economists, conservative professional economists and professional conservative economists.By \u201cliberal professional economists\u201d I mean researchers who try to understand the economy as best they can, but who, being human, also have political preferences, which in their case puts them on the left side of the U.S. political spectrum, although usually only modestly left of center. Conservative professional economists are their counterparts on the center right.But let me leave the pure hacks on one side for a moment, and talk about the people who at least used to seem to be trying to do real economics.Do economists\u2019 political preferences shape their research? They surely affect the choice of subject: Liberals are more likely to be interested in rising inequality or the economics of climate change than conservatives. And human nature being what it is, some of them \u2014 O.K., of us \u2014 occasionally engage in motivated reasoning, reaching conclusions that cater to their politics.I used to believe, however, that such lapses were the exception, not the rule, and the liberal economists I know try hard to avoid falling into that trap, and apologize when they do.But do conservative economists do the same? Increasingly, the answer seems to be no, at least for those who play a prominent role in public discourse.Even during the Obama years, it was striking how many well-known Republican-leaning economists followed the party line on economic policy, even when that party line was in conflict with the nonpolitical professional consensus.But the real test came after 2016. A complete cynic might have expected economists who denounced budget deficits and easy money under a Democrat to suddenly reverse position under a Republican president.What explains this epidemic of bad faith? Some of it is clearly ambition on the part of conservative economists still hoping for high-profile appointments. Some of it, I suspect, may be just the desire to stay on the inside with powerful people.But there\u2019s something pathetic about this professional self-abasement, because the rewards center-right economists long for haven\u2019t come, and never will.So what we\u2019ve learned about economics these past two years is that many conservative economists were, in fact, willing to compromise their professional ethics for political ends \u2014 and that they sold their integrity for nothing.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Saudi Regime\u2019s Other Victims", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe murder of Jamal Khashoggi has focused attention on Saudi Arabia\u2019s human rights abuses. We need to remember all of the thousands in prison.Ms. Zoepf is a journalist who writes about the Middle East.In November 2015, I spent a couple of weeks reporting in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. It had been less than two years since my last visit to the country and just 10 months since King Salman\u2019s ascension to the throne, but the mood among local activists and intellectuals had darkened considerably. On my final evening, my friend Fahad al-Fahad, a marketing consultant and human rights activist, offered to take me on a tour that, he suggested, might help to explain the new atmosphere.\u201cEvery time my doorbell rings, I think someone has come to arrest me,\u201d Fahad said.But despite continuing anger over Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s fate, too little attention is being paid to the crown prince\u2019s treatment of dissidents inside the kingdom, who often lack the resources to consider lives in exile, and who are now being imprisoned in record numbers. More than 2,600 Saudi dissidents, including prominent scientists, writers, lawyers and women\u2019s rights campaigners, are in detention in Saudi Arabia, according to Prisoners of Conscience, a Saudi group that tracks political prisoners. Most were convicted under the kingdom\u2019s counterterrorism laws, receiving sentences for such nonviolent offenses as \u201ccriticizing the royal court\u201d and \u201cridiculing religious figures.\u201d Few of these people are as well known in Western capitals as Mr. Khashoggi was, but their stories are no less important.Saudi Arabia was not always like this. Viewed from afar, Saudi kings may look like one long, undifferentiated line of autocrats. But the degree to which dissent is tolerated has fluctuated over time, depending on the temperament of the ruler and the pressures he faces.Though King Salman\u2019s predecessor, King Abdullah, was often castigated by Western human rights groups, Saudi conservatives attacked him for encouraging public discussion of reform. In 2003, while he was still crown prince, Abdullah initiated a series of meetings that brought together representatives from diverse sectors of Saudi society to examine potential solutions to the kingdom\u2019s problems. After becoming king in 2005, he gave hundreds of thousands of young Saudis scholarships to European and North American universities. By 2010, Saudis were among the world\u2019s most avid users of social media, taking to Twitter and Facebook to campaign for greater rights and freedoms, particularly for women.After King Salman took the throne in January 2015, the pace of arrests accelerated. Executions spiked, reaching levels unseen for two decades. Alongside this crackdown came a deliberate shift in narrative, led by Prince Mohammed, who, within months of his father\u2019s coronation, had been put in charge of oil, economic policy and the armed forces. Public discussion of social reform was sharply reduced. The national conversation about progress was now limited to technology and entrepreneurship. This new emphasis struck many Saudi intellectuals as cynical, calculated to impress Western visitors, who came away from meetings with the crown prince gushing praise.In the 18 months since Prince Mohammed became heir apparent, the message to those inside the kingdom has become clear: The prince\u2019s need to control the narrative is so great that he will brutally suppress not only dissidents but also those who agree with him \u2014 should they dare to express their views in public. The intended message to outsiders is clear, too: Prince Mohammed is Saudi Arabia\u2019s only hope and savior, a visionary bent on dragging his resistant subjects into the future.That narrative is now fraying. The killing of Mr. Khashoggi, a relatively mild critic of the kingdom, has exposed Prince Mohammed and the Saudi government\u2019s intolerance of any kind of dissent. But the thousands of political prisoners should be part of the conversation, too, even if they didn\u2019t write columns for major Western newspapers or were never popular dinner-party guests in Washington and London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Week in Tech: Sundar Pichai Has a Chat With Congress", "Date": "2018-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsIt was the first congressional hearing I had attended, and the spectacle was eye-opening. It underscored, to me, how Silicon Valley and Washington exist in their bubbles without really understanding each other. Lawmakers seemed like out-of-touch old people with little grasp of how technology works and where the real risks lie. Mr. Pichai came across as evasive and unwilling to acknowledge the legitimate concerns about Google\u2019s business practices.At holiday parties and informal discussions in Washington, the conversation often turned to big tech and privacy. There seemed to be a growing wariness among lawmakers, regulators and aides about data collection and the unrelenting push by companies to gather more information about us.While many expressed concern about the bigness of Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple, there wasn\u2019t a consensus on how to deal with them. A federal privacy law with real teeth seemed uncertain, and not many folks expected antitrust regulation even in the face of European action.All the while, tech companies continue to sell the message that they are job creators and engines of economic growth.\u25a0 An argument often made against antitrust action is that the technology industry is dynamic, and that today\u2019s dominant predator can become tomorrow\u2019s prey. Nokia once dominated mobile phones but lost its standing to Samsung and Apple in the smartphone era.\u25a0 It\u2019s rare for a bail hearing to make international news, but this was no ordinary arrest.Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of the tech behemoth Huawei and a daughter of the company\u2019s founder, was arrested Dec. 1 at the airport in Vancouver, British Columbia, for extradition to the United States.The American and Canadian authorities claim Ms. Meng circumvented trade sanctions against Iran, using a Huawei subsidiary. The arrest of a prominent executive at one of China\u2019s biggest tech companies, with close ties to the government, complicates the Trump administration\u2019s negotiations to end a trade war with China.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Democrats\u2019 Best Response to Republican Power Grabs", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe best option goes beyond retaliation or restraint. Mr. Levy is a professor of political theory at McGill University. Democrats are exploring the possibility of legal challenges to those maneuvers. But party leaders face a more difficult, and perhaps more consequential, problem: Should they go tit-for-tat and escalate procedural shenanigans, rules-stretching and rules-breaking? Or should they strive, leading by good example, to maintain a system of norms that have provided political stability in the hopes that a more moderate, reasonable Republican Party will re-emerge?Both strategies come with serious risks: Retaliating in kind could aggravate already deep polarization and wreck what\u2019s left of our political norms. Restraint, on the other hand, would establish new norms that establish electoral disadvantages for Democrats and embolden Republicans.Normally voters don\u2019t care about procedural questions. One state and complaint at a time, they\u2019re unlikely to remember or understand sharp dealing from two years before. If one party goes to the electorate complaining about the other\u2019s behavior, it\u2019s usually met with a shrug that all politicians cheat.But a very clear narrative or popular revulsion \u2014 or both \u2014 can change that. Examples are found in the Progressive Era around the turn of the 20th century and again in the immediate aftermath of Watergate, when procedural reform gained traction, for better or for worse, and both term limits and campaign finance reform had moments of widespread popular enthusiasm. There\u2019s good reason to think that the next two years offer the opportunity to create such a corruption narrative and to take advantage of what\u2019s likely to be growing revulsion.President Trump\u2019s administration has made this job easier: The midterm election results showed that its scandals and disgrace have already focused voters\u2019 attention. That\u2019s not the time for retaliation and escalation. It\u2019s the time offer prescriptions for rebuilding the rules that accompany a diagnosis that helps voters make sense of how badly wrong things have gone. Democrats can try to punish Republicans at the ballot box by trying to strengthen rather than weaken democratic norms.The obvious place to begin is with the White House itself. Proposals to require presidential candidates to disclose their tax returns, give teeth to the Emoluments Clause, strengthen anti-nepotism rules that should keep unqualified family members out of sensitive offices, extend conflict-of-interest rules to include the president, and turn blind trust norms into binding rules won\u2019t be hard to understand under Mr. Trump. They will reinforce voters\u2019 distrust of the president while also offering ways to prevent his abuses from becoming standard practice.Republican procedural abuses at the state level precede the Trump administration, but they can fairly be connected to it. Most important is disenfranchisement. Democrats should emphasize the sustained nationwide Republican effort to limit access to the ballot and offer proposals to restore the Voting Rights Act, end felon disenfranchisement, undo restrictive voter identification rules, ease registration, protect early voting and ensure that voting places are more widely and evenly distributed. Not only has Mr. Trump been on the wrong side of those issues, encouraging state crackdowns on imagined millions of noncitizen voters; but voting restrictions in narrowly won Midwestern states got him closer to the White House in the first place. The package of reforms that the incoming House Democratic majority intends to introduce as its symbolic first bill, H.R. 1, contains some of these ideas mixed in with others that I think will muddy the message, but it's the right kind of beginning. Other proposals, from statehood for the District of Columbia to gerrymandering reform, then make sense as part of the same effort to strengthen representation and fair democratic practice.This is also the best approach for Democrats in the short term because they\u2019re not in a strong position to retaliate even if an angry activist base wants them to. Despite some losses last month, Republicans remain in control of more governor\u2019s seats and more state legislatures. More important, making things worse right now really is the wrong thing to do. If Democrats follow a course of unrestrained but legal tactics, we could find ourselves embroiled in even more severe dysfunction and a constitutional crisis. Tit for tat is sometimes necessary to enforce norms, but escalation in an already seriously polarized environment is dangerous.If Democrats can offer a unifying indictment tying Republican attacks on democratic norms to Trump administration abuses, along with a coherent package of serious proposals to restore procedural fairness, voters will have a way of making sense of new examples of Republican sharp dealing. Proposals to shorten lame duck legislative sessions and to constrain their authority, for example, would reinforce the idea that Republicans have been the party of procedural abuses and unfairness while still setting forth a good neutral rule.This is the alternative to doing nothing or making things worse: seek to punish Republicans in 2020 by offering a vision of how to make things better.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Tawdry Tabloid Sagas Reveal Weightier Themes", "Date": "2018-12-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMediatorAudiences gravitated to the scores of articles and cable news segments about Donald J. Trump, Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal for an undeniable reason: Sex sells.But there was something more important lurking beneath the salacious surface of the stories about the president\u2019s alleged past encounters with a porn star and a former Playboy model.People who followed the sagas quickly learned that they were in for more than lurid details. Like one of those prestige television series on Netflix, FX, HBO or Showtime, the tale started off sleazy but ventured into weightier thematic territory as it unfolded.Enriching the narrative was Michael D. Cohen, who worked for Mr. Trump as factotum and fixer. He was part villain, part flunky.Now in the role of converted truth-teller for an audience of federal prosecutors, Mr. Cohen admits he was given a very big job: shut those two women up on the eve of the 2016 presidential election.He pulled it off \u2014 for a time, at least \u2014 with hush-money payments involving a hastily created Delaware shell company and the Trump-friendly tabloid news company that owns The National Enquirer, American Media Inc.The stories were tawdry, and the news coverage sometimes veered toward clickbait, but there were important questions hiding beneath the sheets.Has the presidential election process become so cynical that players in a campaign can surreptitiously blow through legal limits on spending to deceive the public?Are they free to coordinate with a media organization that behaved in a manner antithetical to the role the founders envisioned for a free press by paying to hide information about a presidential candidate, rather than share it with the public?On Friday, federal prosecutors in New York answered those questions with a resounding No.In making their stand against Mr. Cohen, they were arguing for the legitimacy of United States campaign finance law \u2014 which, for all its loopholes, may have some teeth, after all \u2014 and for the value of truth and transparency in campaigns.Mr. Cohen has pleaded guilty to two sets of criminal campaign violations. By secretly paying Ms. Daniels $130,000 for her silence in October 2016, he was flouting the law that limits individual campaign contributions to $2,700 in a general election.And by arranging for The Enquirer\u2019s parent company to squelch Ms. McDougal\u2019s affair accusation by buying the exclusive rights to her story for $150,000 and then sitting on it \u2014 a practice known in the tabloid trade as \u201ccatch-and-kill\u201d \u2014 Mr. Cohen was inducing A.M.I. to violate a law that prohibits corporations from spending any money in campaigns in coordination with candidates or their agents.\u201cCohen\u2019s commission of two campaign finance crimes on the eve of the 2016 election for president of the United States struck a blow to one of the core goals of the federal campaign finance laws: transparency,\u201d the prosecutors wrote in the sentencing memo. \u201cWhile many Americans who desired a particular outcome to the election knocked on doors, toiled at phone banks or found any number of other legal ways to make their voices heard, Cohen sought to influence the election from the shadows.\u201dPeople following the yarn may not have expected that a story centered on a porn star and a onetime Playboy model would end up with prosecutorial paeans to American ideals. But here we are.The prosecutors suggested Mr. Cohen was taking the rap for a crime that included others in higher places. They asserted that Mr. Trump \u2014 called \u201cIndividual-1\u201d in legal filings \u2014 had directed him to engage in the cover-ups, implicating the president in felony campaign finance violations.The prosecutors\u2019 memo also indicated that others in Mr. Trump\u2019s circle may have been involved in the payments. So the plot could thicken if the prosecutors \u2014 led by the acting United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, Robert S. Khuzami \u2014 pursue more charges.And then there\u2019s American Media Inc.Still, the investigators have made a powerful statement about what was a twisted use of journalism in an election.Generations of journalists have felt called to the profession, seeing a high mission in finding out all there is to know about the men and women who ask to be voted into the nation\u2019s highest office.For those who wonder why any of this might apply to The Enquirer, I would direct them to the supermarket tabloid\u2019s recent history of presidential muckraking.That dirt-digging was fully in keeping with the tabloid media tradition of going all-out to give the powerless a glimpse of what the powerful are hiding. And it led to a landmark campaign finance case against Mr. Edwards that, while ultimately unsuccessful, set the template for the one that has implicated Individual-1.By 2016, things had changed. During the campaign cycle, The Enquirer functioned more like a protection racket. According to prosecutors, the tabloid became part of the very sort of scheme it had once reveled in exposing, and it crossed the line into illegality when it spent money, allegedly in coordination with Mr. Trump, to protect his reputation.The Enquirer\u2019s behavior was part of a broader trend, in which various branches of the news media were used to distort the public debate \u2014 a corruption of mission that turned parts of the political arena into information junkyards.Beneath their words was a world-weary knowingness. Wasn\u2019t this how the game was played?On Friday, the law answered back.Advertisement"}

Your food is so good!\u2019 Always, I thought they are just telling me as courtesy. Then they grew up, and they\u2019re still telling me to do the same.\u201dSo she listened to their pleas: She began a catering service in 2015. A steady stream of loyal customers gave her the confidence to open a restaurant.\u201cIt\u2019s not something you can walk into an Indian restaurant and get,\u201d Nur-E Farhana said. \u201cEven though it\u2019s mostly Bangladeshi people working there, right?\u201d\u201cThe biggest thing we hear from customers is that it\u2019s not as heavy,\u201d she said of her mother\u2019s food, compared with the dishes they\u2019ve encountered at Indian restaurants. \u201cThere\u2019s no heavy cream. We don\u2019t use much dairy.\u201d Nur-E Gulshan\u2019s delicate chicken korma, for instance, is made with ginger, garlic, nutmeg, cumin, coriander, raisins, ghee and a touch of yogurt.More difficult for both women, but just as crucial, is making it clear that their dishes come from Bangladesh, rather than from the neighboring Indian state of West Bengal. Today, West Bengal and Bangladesh remain bound by the same language, Bengali, though dialects differ. West Bengal skews Hindu, Bangladesh Muslim. The cuisines of West Bengal and Bangladesh share many traits; thanks to their location near the Bay of Bengal, into which the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Padma rivers ultimately flow, Bengalis and Bangladeshis love their fish.\u201cBack then, that was probably the logical thing to do to make it accessible: to make it Indian,\u201d Nur-E Farhana said. \u201cYou were at least familiar with India as a country, so it made sense to label it that instead of something you couldn\u2019t even pronounce.\u201d\u201cThe food I get at Korai Kitchen is truly more representative of what I personally grew up with at home from my mom\u2019s kitchen, both in terms of taste and selection of dishes served,\u201d Ms. Shams wrote in an email. \u201cBesides being delicious, the food is a lot lighter than what you\u2019d find at other Bangladeshi restaurants and more similar to what you\u2019d find in people\u2019s homes.\u201dLately, Nur-E Farhana has begun encouraging patrons to eat with their hands, too, just as she did at her family\u2019s kitchen table as a child.Advertisement"}

On the counter was her mise en place: heirloom tomatoes, Granny Smith apples, carrot juice, raisins, brown sugar and duck confit. From this seemingly disparate collection of ingredients, she concocted one of the best chiles rellenos I\u2019ve ever had \u2014 deeply savory, tantalizingly sweet, brawny and rich, but also brothy and light, and completely unlike any other version out there.Like all the best recipes, hers was born of a deep craving.\u201cBut then I thought,\u201d she added, \u201cdo I really want to eat all that cheese?\u201dHer breakthrough was to keep the deep-fried, tomato-sauced goodness of chiles rellenos ahogados, but to replace the filling with one used in another dish, chiles en nogada. In that dish, which is from Puebla, Mexico, a braised mix of apple, onion, raisins and chopped meat picadillo is spooned into the roasted chile, but isn\u2019t fried. Instead, the whole thing gets topped with a creamy nut sauce and a flamboyant garnish of pomegranate seeds.In weaving together elements from these two different but classic stuffed chiles variations, she created a stunningly original hybrid that honors both traditions, then made it soar with her own thoughtful tweaks.For her, the combination was as practical as it was inspired. She added the duck because she had some left over from another dish on the menu (duck carnitas with white beans) and discovered that its earthiness melded perfectly with the pork. And the sweetness of the carrot juice, she said, was to balance the acidity of the heirloom cherry tomatoes that she smushed with her hands, working salt into their flesh to season them and help them break down.Her touch is all over this recipe, which is rooted in tradition and childhood memories, but filled with clever surprises.

While cookies in and of themselves weren\u2019t the most challenging thing I made on a daily basis, it was a different story around the holidays. People came to expect something dramatic and festive, code for \u201coverly complicated.\u201d It was a similar story when I became an editor at a food magazine. Holiday cookies were expected to scream \u201cspecial.\u201d This was good for newsstands and \u201csocial engagement,\u201d but I can tell you who it wasn\u2019t good for: anyone who didn\u2019t consider themselves an especially gifted baker \u2014 or anyone who had, you know, other things to do in December. I\u2019ve been complicit in this, creating more than a few cookie recipes that I look at now and think, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m not gonna do that.\u201d But ever since my work kitchen became my actual kitchen and the oven in my (otherwise wonderful) apartment barely fits a sheet tray, I\u2019ve become more realistic about what I\u2019m willing to do when it comes to \u201cfestive\u201d and \u201cspecial.\u201dTOASTED COCONUT SHORTBREADIf you\u2019re at all familiar with last year\u2019s popular salted butter chocolate chunk shortbread, then you may recognize that this recipe for unassuming, extremely tender coconut shortbread borrows from that base. (I wrote both, so it\u2019s not stealing, don\u2019t worry!) Here, a bit of unsweetened shredded coconut is swapped for some of the flour, and there\u2019s no chocolate, though that wouldn\u2019t be a bad addition. The coconut adds fat for an even more buttery cookie (if you can imagine) with faintly nutty notes and no noticeable tropical flavor. It may seem annoying to dip each otherwise straightforward slice-and-bake cookie into a pile of sanding sugar before baking, but it\u2019s necessary for the sweet and salty balance of the finished product. Plus, it\u2019s pretty fun, and if that\u2019s the hardest thing you have to do all day, then consider it a good day.CHOCOLATE-MOLASSES COOKIESSALTED PISTACHIO SHORTBREADThis is one of those rare doughs that\u2019s better when made in a food processor. Dense, buttery, salty and nutty, the cookies call for pistachios, but swap in walnuts, pecans or hazelnuts, if you prefer. One thing to note: These cookies are best sliced after baking, not before. Fresh out of the oven, the cookie is very tender and easy to cut. Do it almost immediately, as the baked cookie hardens quickly. The result is an extremely pleasing arrangement of crisp-edged triangles that may look just a little like a Danish modernist interpretation of a Christmas tree (unintentional, I promise).An earlier version of this article misstated the number of bowls needed for the chocolate-molasses cookies. It requires two bowls, not one.Advertisement"}

Trump in 2016, which would have been the stuff of farce \u2014 the ultimate tabloid backs the ultimate tabloid candidate \u2014 if it hadn\u2019t accomplished its goal.The Enquirer\u2019s power was fueled by its covers. For the better part of the campaign season, Enquirer front pages blared sensational headlines about Mr. Trump\u2019s rivals from eye-level racks at supermarket checkout lanes across America. This stroke-of-genius distribution apparatus was dreamed up by the man who made The Enquirer the nation\u2019s biggest gossip rag: its previous owner, Generoso Pope Jr.Wondering what The Enquirer\u2019s covers were worth to the Trump campaign, I called Regis Maher, a co-founder of Do It Outdoors, the national mobile and digital billboard company. He said a campaign with that level of national prominence would cost $2.5 million to $3 million a month.\u201cIt\u2019s such a powerful placement,\u201d Mr. Maher said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s gotta go to the grocery store.\u201dWith the news last week that The Enquirer had admitted to federal prosecutors that it made the catch-and-kill payment to influence the election, it\u2019s worth stepping back and appreciating the unlikely role played by the supermarket tabloid and its parent company, American Media Inc., in electing the 45th president of the United States.Now that federal prosecutors have cleared away some of the fog that shrouded the 2016 campaign, it\u2019s easy to see that The Enquirer was more than just a publication that puffed up Mr. Trump while going after his rivals.It was the real-world embodiment of the fantasy online world of trolls, Russian and domestic, who polluted the political discourse. From its perches at Publix and Safeway, it was often doing the same job as Alex Jones, of the conspiracy site Infowars, and the more strident Trump campaign surrogates on Twitter and Facebook.The Enquirer spread false stories about Hillary Clinton \u2014 illnesses concealed, child prostitution, bribery, treason. Each cover trumpeting these tales was arguably more powerful than a tweet from an account with millions of followers.It\u2019s a shame it went this route, because The Enquirer was built to cover Mr. Trump\u2019s wild ride. If it had only stuck with its original mission \u2014 digging up dirt on the rich and famous, without a care for the rules of traditional journalism \u2014 it would have had the tabloid story of a lifetime.With its online cohorts, American Media Inc. helped build a distortion machine that so polluted election news cycles that, for its more receptive audiences, Mrs. Clinton not only deserved to lose the White House, she deserved time in the big house.Before making her its main target, the machine chewed up Senator Ted Cruz. It ran unsubstantiated allegations of extramarital affairs against him at a time when he was proving himself Mr. Trump\u2019s most stubborn Republican challenger.The only person quoted by name in the affairs piece was Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime adviser to Mr. Trump, who was quoted as saying, \u201cWhere there\u2019s smoke, there\u2019s fire.\u201d (Mr. Stone, who communicated with top campaign officials through the election, is under investigation by the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III.)One passage in the Cruz story caught my eye. Citing a report in Radar Online \u2014 a gossip outlet also owned by A.M.I. \u2014 The Enquirer claimed that \u201can individual purporting to be a representative of the hacker group Anonymous posted a disturbing Twitter video that threatens to expose \u2018very dirty secrets,\u2019 including information about Ted \u2018visiting prostitutes.\u2019\u201dHere\u2019s an odd thing. Radar attributed the provenance of this supposed Anonymous video to an obscure Twitter handle with only a few thousand followers that has since gone dormant. A review of the account\u2019s activity found tweets and retweets of anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant messages relating to Europe, as well as a critique of the United States policy on Libya linked to a video from RT, the Russian state-financed cable network.It makes you wonder if the inquiring mind of Mr. Mueller would like to know more about The Enquirer than he has let on. (Federal prosecutors in New York have led the investigation of A.M.I.)Once Mr. Cruz was out of the way, two people familiar with A.M.I.\u2019s operation told me, the company pulled up files on the Clintons that it had collected over decades \u2014 some two dozen cardboard boxes filled with promising material.A.M.I. began a painstaking effort to sort through the old clips and tips concerning \u201cpay-for-play\u201d deals, rumors of affairs and Vince Foster conspiracy theories. But as the campaign wore on, The Enquirer\u2019s covers favored stories similar to those coursing through Infowars, Russian trolldom and, increasingly, your uncle\u2019s Facebook feed.According to one headline, Hillary was \u201cCorrupt! Racist! Criminal!\u201d In another, she was \u201cEating Herself To Death!\u201dThe Enquirer also reported \u2014 make that \u201creported\u201d \u2014 that she had suffered \u201cthree strokes,\u201d had \u201cliver damage from booze,\u201d and was prone to \u201cviolent rages.\u201dThe false narratives built to a frenzy that included an appearance by the A.M.I. chief content officer Dylan Howard on Infowars and a cover promising that Mrs. Clinton and her aide Huma Abedin were \u201cGoing to Jail\u201d for \u201cTreason! Influence Peddling! Bribery!\u201dFor those who were seeing the same bilge online, The Enquirer\u2019s headlines and stories may have increased their doubts about the Democratic nominee. For those seeing such stuff for the first time, right next to the gum and candy, the false coverage may have been revelatory.Placement on nationwide checkout lines was perhaps Mr. Pecker\u2019s greatest gift to Mr. Trump, and it\u2019s something that he inherited from Mr. Pope.Watching his circulation plateau as his readers moved to the suburbs in the 1960s, Mr. Pope struck a deal with major grocery chains: He would build new racks to put magazines at eye level near the cash registers, arguing that more sales for him meant more profit for them, too.\u201cIt gave us complete exposure, saturation, whatever you want to call it,\u201d his son Paul David Pope told me on Friday.\u201cI am sure my father\u2019s intention with his media empire was not to be used after his passing as an outlet for fake news,\u201d the younger Mr. Pope said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook Used People\u2019s Data to Favor Certain Partners and Punish Rivals, Documents Show", "Date": "2018-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Facebook used the mountains of data it collected on users to favor certain partners and punish rivals, giving companies such as Airbnb and Netflix special access to its platform while cutting off others that it perceived as threats.The documents show how Facebook executives treated data as the company\u2019s most valuable resource and often wielded it to gain a strategic advantage. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer, were intimately involved in decisions aimed at benefiting the social network above all else and keeping users as engaged as possible on the site, according to emails that were part of the document trove.In one exchange from 2012 when Mr. Zuckerberg discussed charging developers for access to user data and persuading them to share their data with the social network, he wrote: \u201cIt\u2019s not good for us unless people also share back to Facebook and that content increases the value of our network. So ultimately, I think the purpose of platform \u2014 even the read side \u2014 is to increase sharing back into Facebook.\u201dIn a statement, Facebook said the documents had been selectively chosen to be embarrassing and misleading as part of a \u201cbaseless\u201d lawsuit. \u201cLike any business, we had many internal conversations about the various ways we could build a sustainable business model for our platform,\u201d the company said. \u201cBut the facts are clear: We\u2019ve never sold people\u2019s data.\u201d\u201cI understand there is a lot of scrutiny on how we run our systems,\u201d he wrote, adding that context was needed. \u201cThis was an important change to protect our community, and it achieved its goal.\u201d\u201cAmericans\u2019 data belongs to them, not Facebook,\u201d said Senator Edward J. Markey, a Democrat of Massachusetts. \u201cAny evidence of a pay-for-data model would fly in the face of the statements Facebook has made to Congress and the public.\u201dMuch of what was disclosed in the documents was not new, but the emails provide insight into the calculations of top executives as they worked to cement Facebook\u2019s position as the world\u2019s dominant social network. The documents\u2019 publication coincides with a more hawkish shift in public opinion toward online collection of user data, prompted partly by revelations this year of how the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica misused Facebook users\u2019 information.The 250 pages of documents cover a period when Facebook was shifting its business from a focus on desktop computers to mobile devices. After years of being largely open in sharing data with partners, Facebook was beginning to debate how to be compensated for the data it was sharing.For companies it liked, including Airbnb, Lyft and Netflix, Facebook made special \u201cwhite list\u201d agreements. The deals gave the partners preferred access to data that other companies had been restricted from receiving after a Facebook policy change.But for other companies that Facebook perceived as a threat, the company was less accommodating. In 2013, after Twitter released the video app Vine, Facebook shut off the access to its Facebook friends data.\u201cUnless anyone raises objections, we will shut down their friends API access today,\u201d Justin Osofsky, a Facebook executive, said in an email at the time.Mr. Zuckerberg responded: \u201cYup, go for it.\u201dEmails also show that Facebook was hungry for more data and that user privacy, at least at the time, was an impediment to its goals of growth and engagement. In one email exchange, employees discussed avoiding a potential public backlash about an update to its Android app that would log calls made by people on their phones.\u201cThis is a pretty high risk thing to do from a PR perspective but it appears that the growth team will charge ahead and do it,\u201d Michael LeBeau, an employee, said in a 2015 email.The documents also demonstrate the web of companies and services that plugged into Facebook\u2019s platform to receive information on users. The Royal Bank of Canada requested access in one note, as did the dating apps Badoo and Hot or Not.At the time, Facebook was also transitioning to what it called Platform 3.0, which would give it more control over the data of its users. Facebook emphasized the privacy benefits of the change, but the documents also show it trying to create more of a walled garden that it could leverage for its business.\u201cWithout limiting distribution or access to friends who use this app, I don\u2019t think we have any way to get developers to pay us at all besides offering payments and ad networks,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said in a 2012 email.The emails also lay out how Facebook debated whether to restrict app developers\u2019 access to some data unless those developers bought advertising on the social network, a policy the company now says it never enacted.In other documents, employees outline potential ways to keep other services from using data collected from the social network in order to build their own services.\u201cWhy let someone like Pinterest or Path read all our data, create a separate stand-alone app, and then never use our paid distribution to compensate us,\u201d Mike Vernal, a former Facebook executive, said during one exchange.Facebook also relied on data from Onavo, a company it acquired in 2013, according to the documents. Onavo offered a series of apps that let people monitor their data use and protect themselves from malware and threats. The app also sent valuable data on what types of apps people were downloading back to Facebook.Adam Satariano reported from London, and Mike Isaac from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cleaning the Congressional Stables", "Date": "2018-12-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe House Democratic class of \u201919 is planning a major push on voting, ethics and campaign finance reform. All that stands in the way is the Senate. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.From petty grifting to allegations of treason, the early Trump era has offered a survey course in how to diminish public faith in democratic institutions. All signs are that the coming years will prove even more instructive.Which is why it\u2019s crucial for Democratic lawmakers to stay focused on and fired up about their emerging, much-hyped crusade to clean up Washington.Inspired by the rolling spectacle of Trumpian corruption, Democrats ran hard on a midterm message of reform. They pitched an overhaul of the nation\u2019s political system built around a trio of broad aims: improving access to and the integrity of the voting system, strengthening ethics laws and slashing the influence of big money.Enter H.R. 1, a comprehensive package of revisions to current political practice that House Democrats are looking to introduce in the opening weeks of the next Congress. While the details are still being hashed out, H.R. 1 will attempt to: establish nationwide automatic voter registration; promote online voter registration; end partisan gerrymandering; expand conflict-of-interest laws; increase oversight of lobbyists; require the disclosure of presidential tax returns; strengthen disclosure of campaign donations; set up a system of small-donor matching funds for congressional candidates; and revive the moribund matching-fund system for presidential campaigns. A plan for repairing the Voting Rights Act will move along a separate track.The package is, by design, ambitious. Now is not the time to piddle with closing this loophole and improving that reporting rule, say reformers. Such a change wouldn\u2019t stem the flood of outside money deforming the political system, but it would give candidates an alternative way to run \u2014 and provide not-so-rich Americans a greater sense that their voices can be heard. It is the foundation on which other anti-corruption efforts rest, reformers say, with a warning that if lawmakers don\u2019t address this problem, their credibility will remain in the toilet.At this point, the hunger for reform is so fierce among the Democratic base that the caucus will need to work to temper expectations. While H.R. 1 is near the top of the to-do list of the incoming House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, the package will take a while to make its way to a floor vote. At least five committees have oversight of pieces of it, and even among Democrats there are competing visions for various provisions that must be worked through. Democratic House leaders are hoping to get a bill passed early in the year. And then it is likely to go nowhere fast.Realistically speaking, enacting even pieces of a bill like H.R. 1 is more of a medium- to longish-term legislative goal. But this does not diminish the urgency of passing the package in the House as a declaration of Democrats\u2019 commitment. Its champions seem to grasp this. Mr. Sarbanes expressed optimism that serious revisions could be achieved within a couple of election cycles \u2014 but only if Democrats move quickly to get people fired up and then \u201ckeep the pressure on.\u201dEven the most ethically bankrupt politician can spout drivel about \u201cdraining the swamp.\u201d For the next couple of years, Democrats\u2019 challenge is to keep this issue hot enough to make life uncomfortable for reform foes like Mr. McConnell \u2014 and to make clear to voters what must be done if they want to take this crusade beyond one chamber of Congress.An earlier version of this editorial referred incorrectly to one of the proposals. It would promote online voter registration, not early and online voting.Advertisement"}

Recently, a team of scientists turned to George for help in this search, mining his genetic code for clues to his long life span.But years ago, Dr. Caccone hit a wall \u2014 she needed someone to help her decipher which parts of the tortoises\u2019 DNA were functional genes, which regions were not and what the genes\u2019 functions might be.She received a fateful message from Carlos L\u00f3pez-Ot\u00edn, a professor at the University of Oviedo in Spain who has built a career studying cancer and aging in humans. Dr. L\u00f3pez-Ot\u00edn was interested in unlocking the genetic secrets behind giant tortoises\u2019 legendary longevity.The researchers then compared the tortoise genomes with those of mammals, fish, birds and other reptiles, looking for discrepancies that could affect aging. The scientists found evidence that a mutation in a gene called IGF1R, which has been linked with longevity in humans and mice, might contribute to the tortoises\u2019 exceptional life span.They also discovered that the tortoises had more copies of genes related to energy regulation, DNA repair, tumor suppression and immune defense compared with other creatures. While most mammals have only one copy of a gene involved in immune response called PRF1, for instance, both tortoises had a whopping 12 copies in their genome. Generally, having many copies of genes can allow existing functions to occur more efficiently, or provide fuel for the evolution of new functions.Future avenues of research will only expand as scientists sequence the genomes of more reptiles, said Kenro Kusumi, a professor of life sciences at Arizona State University.And many reptiles, including tortoises, can enter an inactive state that allows them to survive extreme conditions. The ability to induce similar states in humans could be useful for future space travel, Dr. Kusumi said.\u201cThe beauty of having these genomes is that it\u2019s a great starting point to ask questions,\u201d he added. \u201cEven after death, Lonesome George is teaching us things \u2014 just like his ancestors taught Charles Darwin.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "New Google Campus Accelerates Tech\u2019s March Into New York", "Date": "2018-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGoogle said on Monday that it planned to create a $1 billion campus just south of the West Village. The internet company\u2019s push into one of Manhattan\u2019s most famous neighborhoods positions it to become one of New York\u2019s biggest occupants of office space, allowing it to double its work force in the city to more than 14,000 over the next decade.\u201cLaw, medicine and finance have been superseded by information technologies,\u201d said Mitchell Moss, an urban-planning professor at New York University who studies the city\u2019s economy.The centerpiece of the new 1.7-million-square-foot campus will be the St. John\u2019s Terminal building near the Holland Tunnel on Washington Street, with Google also set to occupy space at two buildings nearby on Hudson Street. Altogether, the company will expand its footprint in Manhattan by a third to about 6.75 million square feet.Google arrived in New York when it opened an advertising sales office in 2000. It added an engineering team in the city in 2003 and has steadily expanded since.Other big tech companies quickly followed. Amazon and Facebook each now have more than 2,000 employees in New York, while Apple and Salesforce each employ more than 1,000. LinkedIn has a large office in the Empire State Building, and IBM chose New York as the base for its Watson artificial intelligence and cloud computing divisions.Since 2009, jobs in tech and advertising in New York have increased 31 percent to 360,600, while financial-services jobs in the city increased about 12 percent to 475,500, according to an analysis of federal data by Ken McCarthy, principal economist at the real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield. By contrast, the education and health sectors employ about one million people in New York, while the hospitality industry employs 465,800, according to his analysis.Mr. McCarthy said federal data categorized jobs based on the employer, meaning any bank employee is counted as finance. But New York\u2019s traditional industries \u2014 banking, retailing and consulting \u2014 have also added thousands of tech jobs. JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup each employ thousands of tech workers, including many in new fields like data science, blockchain and machine learning.And New York\u2019s tech sector is accelerating. Over the past year, the share of New York postings on the job site Indeed increased nearly 13 percent for tech jobs and just 2 percent for finance and accounting jobs. About 5 percent of all New York jobs posted on Indeed are now tech related, the site said, compared with 3 percent for finance and accounting.That growth has made San Francisco, which is a gateway to Silicon Valley, a sort of sister city to New York. As a result, the air route between them is one of the nation\u2019s most competitive and heavily trafficked.\u201cThere is more economic connectivity between New York and San Francisco than between New York and any of the declining upstate cities,\u201d Mr. Moss said.Google has expanded quietly and has not asked for public subsidies. \u201cWe\u2019ve been growing steadily for the past 18 years without heralding trumpets, or asking for support from the government,\u201d William Floyd, Google\u2019s head of external affairs in New York said this month. \u201cWe\u2019ve done it by the dint our own work.\u201dAnd some in Manhattan are wary that Google and other businesses will begin to spread into historic neighborhoods.\u201cMy concern is that with Google\u2019s concentration in that area, it\u2019s going to pull in even more intense pressure for office development, particularly tech office development, in adjacent neighborhoods like the Village and East Village, where we are seeing it happen already,\u201d said Andrew Berman, executive director of the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation.Mr. Berman said he did not oppose Google\u2019s expansion in Hudson Square, which in the past decade has transformed into a commercial district, with many of its lofts and factories converted to offices for more than 1,000 companies, many in technology, advertising and media. Today, more than 50,000 people work in the neighborhood, and thousands more have made their home there following a 2013 city rezoning that allowed residential development.But Mr. Berman said the growing demand for offices has led to the demolition of historic buildings, pushed out longtime businesses and residents, and resulted in modern office towers that are out of character with the rest of the neighborhood.Chelsea has also witnessed rapid development over the past decade as it has mostly shed its working class roots and identity as a hub of gay night life. It still maintains large public housing projects, but is dotted with art galleries, new condominiums and expensive restaurants.In response, Google invested in local nonprofit organizations and said it would pay for a ferry stop at Pier 57, where it is renting office space, earning some plaudits from local elected officials.\u201cIn terms of buying the new buildings, we want to make sure that they\u2019re not chasing anyone out,\u201d said Gale Brewer, the Manhattan borough president. \u201cBut they\u2019ve been awfully good neighbors in Chelsea.\u201dSteve Lohr contributed reporting from New York, and Ed Shanahan from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s Homegrown Chips Threaten Silicon Valley Giant Intel", "Date": "2018-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmazon, the world\u2019s largest online retailer and largest cloud-computing company, is pushing into a new line of work: computer chips.Late last month, the company, based in Seattle, revealed that it had spent the last few years building a new chip for use inside the millions of servers in its data centers around the world.Amazon does not plan to sell this chip directly to customers, but the decision by one of the world\u2019s biggest buyers of computer processors to go the do-it-yourself route is likely to have a major impact on Intel, the iconic Silicon Valley chip maker.Intel has struggled to keep up with recent technology trends, from the increasing use of mobile devices to artificial intelligence, as influence over chip designs has been shifting to Amazon, Apple and Google, which already dominate much of the rest of the tech industry.The homegrown chip also gives Amazon bargaining power with Intel, which hasn\u2019t had much competition in the server market in recent years. The internet company will still buy from Intel because it would be difficult to build all the chips it needed on its own. But now it will have options.Intel acknowledges that companies like Amazon want to reduce their dependency on one big chip supplier. \u201cI am not unaware of the dynamic,\u201d Lisa Spelman, an Intel vice president, said. \u201cOur goal is to understand and respectfully acknowledge that desire.\u201dAbout 35 percent of the server chips sold around the world go to about 10 companies, including large internet companies like Amazon and a handful of telecommunication firms, said Shane Rau, a chip analyst with the research firm IDC. That just one of them is shifting its business is terrible news for Intel.\u201cEach one of these companies is so large, they represent a market unto themselves,\u201d Mr. Rau said.Apple beat the other tech giants to this cost-saving trend four years ago when it unveiled its first custom-built chip for the iPhone. Google and Microsoft are also building the chips that go into devices like smartphones and virtual-reality headsets.Amazon has upped the ante. In 2015, it spent a reported $350 million to acquire a chip maker, Annapurna Labs, which helped build the new central processing unit, or C.P.U.A C.P.U. \u2014 the centerpiece of a computer\u2019s operations \u2014 is the sort of chip that Intel has made for decades to run personal computers and servers. Building these chips requires rare expertise and hundreds of millions of dollars in capital. It is a big step up in complexity from building chips tailored to certain tasks.\u201cThe belief was that you needed some magic to build a processor, particularly a server processor,\u201d said Andrew Feldman, the chief executive of the chip start-up Cerebras and a former executive at the chip maker AMD. \u201cYou had to be Intel or AMD \u2014 and that was about it.\u201dAmazon executives believe the chip, which was designed to be more energy efficient, will help reduce the cost of electrical power in its data centers. It said it was offering a cloud-computing service that would allow business customers to use its new chip. The cost of the service could be 45 percent lower than other options.And when Amazon buys chips from other companies, a homegrown option gives it even more sway over prices. \u201cThey can now say to Intel, \u2018We will just move the workloads to other chips,\u2019\u201d Mr. Feldman said.Though it is still enormously difficult, building a chip is easier than it used to be. Amazon licensed much of the technology from ARM, the company that provides the basic technology for most smartphone chips. It made the chip through TSMC, a Taiwanese company.For Intel, Amazon\u2019s move into C.P.U.s is a strike at a longtime strength. Intel was beaten to the smartphone and tablet market a decade ago, a significant missed opportunity. The tech industry shifted, and Intel didn\u2019t shift with it.But Intel has a 96.6 percent share of server chip sales, according to IDC. It was 98.6 percent until its longtime competitor, AMD, which had stayed on the sidelines of the server business for about a decade, recently re-entered the market.Intel\u2019s profits continue to rise with the rapid expansion of the tech industry. But the financial results of its most recent quarter highlight the chip maker\u2019s dependence on servers. Intel\u2019s data center group, which sells both server and A.I. chips, pulled in $6.1 billion, a 26 percent increase over the previous year. The group now accounts for more than 30 percent of Intel\u2019s revenue.As the chip market has changed, Intel has tried to diversify. In recent years, it bought three companies that design chips for artificial intelligence and other types of hardware that are becoming increasingly important inside smartphones, cars and data centers.Through their fast-growing cloud computing services, Amazon, Microsoft, Alibaba and Google are reinventing how companies set up their computer networks. Going to a cloud service allows companies to wash their hands of acquiring and maintaining back-room computer systems \u2014 the tech experts do it for them.It is a lucrative business. Amazon Web Services brings in nearly $27 billion a year, and it accounts for 56 percent of Amazon\u2019s profits.Inside these cloud operations, the internet companies are also reinventing how computers are built. They are designing much of their own hardware, from the servers to the networking gear that connects servers. Facebook is doing similar work with the technology in its data centers.Amazon\u2019s new chip is running only a small fraction of the software across the company\u2019s online empire. But that is expected to expand.\u201cWe will look back at this as a watershed moment,\u201d said Mr. Feldman, the chief executive of Cerebras.Advertisement"}

What difference can one ordinary person make?Here are six people Fixes wrote about in the last year who show what the answer can be: a lot.Last month, Michigan voters overwhelmingly approved a ballot measure that changed the state Constitution. It created a commission of independent citizens to draw the lines of congressional districts, taking the job away from politicians.Ms. Fahey kept waiting for someone who knew what they were doing to come along and tell her to run along now, but no one did. In the last few months, Voters Not Politicians became more professional. By then, its citizen army had made its message of citizen power even more persuasive.But being amateurs also had drawbacks. \u201cThe system wasn\u2019t built for civilians,\u201d Ms. Fahey said. Most campaigns, for example, have experts file the required reports to the state. Voters Not Politicians had to learn to do it itself.Voters Not Politicians now gets calls from people all over who want to fight gerrymandering or want to organize around other issues. \u201cWho\u2019s helping the regular person who wants a dog park in their community?\u201d Ms. Fahey asked. \u201cWe challenged the assumption you have to wait for someone else, or look to a politician to fix a problem. Some 27-year-old can get a lot of people excited about gerrymandering and amend the constitution.\u201dAmazon\u2019s move to Queens will make New York\u2019s shortage of software developers far worse. At the same time, lots of low-income New Yorkers would love those jobs \u2014 but don\u2019t have the skills.Is there a way to solve both problems at once?Pursuit starts with a 10-month intensive boot camp where students learn coding, professional skills and how to navigate the tech industry. Then, for the next three years, they get coaching and support while working.That\u2019s expensive, but, Mr. Hsu says, good job training is. \u201cMost job training doesn\u2019t really have results,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to do this well.\u201dThere are lots of coding boot camps. Pursuit is different because it aims at students who can\u2019t pay. Such projects often get their money from charity or grants, but that would have kept Pursuit too small.Mr. Hsu has come up with new ways to pay for the work. Pursuit\u2019s students do pay tuition \u2014 but only after they graduate and get a job paying at least $60,000. Then they pay 12 percent of their salary for three years.Pursuit raises the upfront money in two ways. One is to issue a bond, as public infrastructure projects do. Pursuit found investors to put up $750,000 for the first bond. If enough students graduate, get high-paying jobs and pay tuition, the investors will profit. Mr. Hsu is now seeking multiple millions for the organization\u2019s next bond.The other way is to charge companies. Companies already pay recruiters to find software developers. Now, instead, they can pay Pursuit to retrain their own blue-collar workers.So far, only two companies, Blue Apron and Managed by Q, are doing this. But another company is about to start: Pursuit will run a training center inside Amazon.Ms. Joseph believes that treating patients with dignity protects them from stress.She designed her clinic to help patients feel respected, valued and in control of their pregnancies, starting with a welcoming, no-drama front desk that doesn\u2019t ask about ability to pay. \u201cOur receptionist is probably the most important person on the team,\u201d said Ms. Joseph. \u201cGreet, be nice, wipe the tears.\u201d Ms. Joseph can barely keep her own doors open. \u201cWe bill, and when people can pay, they do, and when they can\u2019t, we don\u2019t charge. There\u2019s not a business model here.\u201dThat means showing them how to clear anything flammable within 30 to 50 feet of a house. \u201cFire moves through a landscape throwing embers two to three miles ahead,\u201d said Ms. Green. \u201cIf they find flammable materials, they smolder and ignite.\u201d\u201cThe science behind defensible space has been around since the late 1990s,\u201d she said. \u201cI translate that science to residents. These are really simple changes, but not something a lot of folks think about.\u201dHer biggest challenge: Twenty people move to Deschutes County every day. They all need to learn how to protect their homes \u2014 and put in the work to do so.In August, three houses burned \u2014 the first home casualties since 2003. It was a high-wind day, and there had been no rain for more than two months. \u201cThese folks hadn\u2019t found the time to put in defensible space correctly,\u201d Ms. Green said. \u201cIt was devastating, but the way that fire was burning, it could have been 3,000 home losses.\u201dThe next year, Ms. Tracy and five or so colleagues went to the sex crimes unit\u2019s headquarters and spent three days reading through the files, flagging questionable practices. That review still happens every spring.Over time, police practices have greatly improved, Ms. Tracy said. And now the advocate reviews are starting to spread \u2014 for example, to the New York Police Department.While reading the files, Ms. Tracy noticed that the F.B.I. defined rape as \u201ccarnal knowledge of a female, forcibly and against her will.\u201d If that sounds archaic, it\u2019s because it was written in 1929. \u201cThat came as news to all of us,\u201d she said.Few women around the world can get a mammogram. They are far from a clinic, or lack the money, or just don\u2019t know about breast cancer. But now there\u2019s another kind of breast exam that could reach women that mammograms don\u2019t.That was, however, far less than half the battle \u2014 and it\u2019s the second part that trips up most entrepreneurs, especially those making products for poor countries. \u201cThere are so many great technologies out there,\u201d said Matthew Campisi, a co-founder. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make them a successful product.\u201dSo far, iBreastExam has been cleared by regulatory bodies in 10 countries. One is the United States. Mr. Shah said that 70 percent of uninsured women don\u2019t get routine mammograms. \u201cWe\u2019re not saying it\u2019s a replacement for a mammogram,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re saying there are areas where it can help.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified on second reference the organization that asked Robert Mueller, director of the F.B.I. at the time, to amend the definition of rape. It was the Women's Law Project, not Women's Law Center. The article also misidentified the place where members of the project reviewed Police Department files. It was the headquarters of the department's sex crimes unit, not the Police Department's headquarters.Advertisement"}

Fifty years ago, we finally saw it.Mr. Widmer is a distinguished lecturer at the Macaulay Honors College of the City University of New York.\u201cHey, don\u2019t take that, it\u2019s not scheduled,\u201d Frank Borman said, joking to his fellow Apollo 8 astronauts, Bill Anders and James Lovell, on Dec. 24, 1968. They were orbiting the moon, farther from Earth than any humans had ever been. On the fourth pass, they were confronted by an extraordinary sight that jolted them out of their regimented procedures. There, seen through a small window, was Earth itself, rising out of the void. For a split second, the astronauts were dazzled by the luminescent blue sphere, whorled by a white cloud cover. Then, as they were trained to do, they went back to work. As it turned out, Mr. Anders was the one who snapped a color photo, just after his fellow astronauts, Frank Borman and James Lovell, called his attention to the greatest photo op in history.The color film proved to be the key; a similar photo had been taken two years earlier, but without the dazzling blue. When the photo was republished on the cover of Life magazine, and beamed out on America\u2019s color TVs, billions of others had to same chance to look back at Earth in all its cerulean glory. That this life-giving place was the same thing as Creation was a message the astronauts reinforced on the same day, with their reading from the Book of Genesis. At the end of a bitterly divisive year, it was a rare chance, unscheduled, for all of the inhabitants of the planet to remember that they were united by factors beyond their control. Evangelicals, scientists, Americans, Russians, Chinese, Vietnamese: All people on Earth marveled that it was possible. The mission was a miracle, and so was the planet that hovered there, above the tiny spacecraft.A great deal of earth science has come from that discovery; perhaps self-discovery is a better phrase. NASA\u2019s spacecraft and their cameras have helped to locate ancient monuments and crop circles covered by forest canopies; oil leaks in the oceans; the disappearing Aral Sea; crazy weather, shrinking glaciers and other signs of a planet that has changed a great deal since 1968. For millenniums, humans had wondered what it might be like to look back at themselves from a great distance. As this gallery shows, it was a universal human aspiration, uniting people from all parts of the world. To a surprising degree, many knew, or at least intuited, that Earth was a sphere, and not flat at all. Plato likened it to a leather ball made from a \u201cpatchwork of colors.\u201d Around the time Christ was born, the Roman poet Ovid described the planet as \u201cpoised in the enveloping air, balanced by its own weight.\u201d In other words, exactly as the astronauts saw it.Ted Widmer is a distinguished lecturer at the Macaulay Honors College of the City University of New York and a fellow of the Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is There Such a Thing as an Authoritarian Voter?", "Date": "2018-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical scientists want to know. They\u2019re not the only ones.Contributing Opinion WriterA recession might be just around the corner, but for experts in the field of \u201cauthoritarian studies,\u201d these are boom times. Jonathan Weiler, a political scientist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, has spent much of his career studying the appeal of authoritarian figures: politicians who preach xenophobia, beat up on the press and place themselves above the law while extolling \u201claw and order\u201d for everyone else. He is one of many scholars who believe that deep-seated psychological traits help explain voters\u2019 attraction to such leaders. \u201cThese days,\u201d he told me, \u201caudiences are more receptive to the idea\u201d than they used to be.Could it be that millions of President Trump\u2019s supporters are simply wired to see the world very differently from his critics? \u201cIn 2018, the sense of fear and panic \u2014 the disorientation about how people who are not like us could see the world the way they do \u2014 it\u2019s so elemental,\u201d Mr. Weiler said. \u201cPeople understand how deeply divided we are, and they are looking for explanations that match the depth of that division.\u201dLong before the rise of Mr. Trump \u2014 for more than half a century \u2014 social scientists have tried to figure out why some seemingly mild-mannered people gravitate toward a strongman. They have created methods to dig below economics, religion and other social factors in the hope of uncovering a set of more essential political instincts. Sometimes these efforts veer into dangerous reductionism, but nonetheless they\u2019re probably on to something.In the years after World War II, the philosopher (and German refugee) Theodor Adorno collaborated with social scientists at the University of California at Berkeley to investigate why ordinary people supported fascist, anti-Semitic ideology during the war. They used a questionnaire called the F-scale (F is for fascism) and follow-up interviews to analyze the \u201ctotal personality\u201d of the \u201cpotentially antidemocratic individual.\u201dSkeptics complained that the F-scale conflated fascism with conservatism. Others noted that the study\u2019s psychoanalytic speculations on the subconscious childhood roots of authoritarianism were impossible to verify (the authors wrote that they \u201cleaned most heavily upon Freud\u201d and made much of the finding that many high-scoring subjects grew up with overbearing fathers). Yet their preoccupation with childhood and \u201cprimitive and irrational wishes and fears\u201d have influenced the study of authoritarianism ever since.When I called Mr. Strouse, he emphasized that researchers\u2019 psychologizing too often overlooks real suffering. \u201cI grew up in Appalachia, and I know these people intimately,\u201d he said. \u201cI love them. I\u2019ve seen what has happened to them over the last few decades. I\u2019m a working-class person, a former labor organizer, and I feel the Democrats have stabbed them in the back over a number of years. I now live in New York and live a lifestyle that most of my former neighbors wouldn\u2019t approve of, but I think it\u2019s a bummer when people here misunderstand people back home and pathologize them.\u201dAre these scholars pathologizing or just exploring the nonrational impulses that help explain why some Americans see Mr. Trump as a swindler of working-class people, while others declare him their savior?\u201cThe normal response from people is: \u2018I want both. I want them to be curious, and I don\u2019t want them throwing food around in a restaurant,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Weiler (who teaches at the same university I do, although we had never spoken before I began to work on this article). \u201cThe reality is surely messier than what we\u2019re capturing in this survey data,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat makes me comfortable with this is that politics forces us to make choices too.\u201dMoreover, using the child-rearing questionnaire, African-Americans score as far more authoritarian than whites. This result forced researchers to grant what should have been obvious: Attitudes toward parenting vary across cultures, and for centuries African-Americans have seen the consequences of a social and political hierarchy arrayed against them, so they can hardly be expected to favor it \u2014 no matter what they think about child rearing. The child-trait test, then, is a tool to identify white people who are anxious about their decline in status and power.Other scholars apply a typology based on the \u201cBig Five\u201d personality traits identified by psychologists in the mid-20th century: extroversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism and openness to experience. (It seems that liberals are open but possibly neurotic, while conservatives are more conscientious.)Historical context matters \u2014 it shapes who we are and how we debate politics. \u201cReason moves slowly,\u201d William English, a political economist at Georgetown, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s constituted sociologically, by deep community attachments, things that change over generations.\u201d Still, he said, \u201cit is a deep-seated aspiration of many social scientists \u2014 sometimes conscious and sometimes unconscious \u2014 to get past wishy-washy culture and belief. Discourses that can\u2019t be scientifically reduced are problematic\u201d for researchers who want to provide \u201ca universal account of behavior.\u201dThe researchers themselves usually qualify their claims. \u201cWe ask that you banish \u2018determine\u2019 from your vocabulary and replace it with words such as \u2018shape,\u2019 \u2018influence,\u2019 \u2018mold,\u2019 and \u2018incline,\u2019 wrote John R. Hibbing, Kevin B. Smith and John A. Alford in their book \u201cPredisposed: Liberals, Conservatives, and the Biology of Political Differences.\u201dBut in our current environment, where polarization is so unyielding, the apparent clarity of psychological and biological explanations becomes seductive. There is something entrancing and terrifying about any deterministic theory that predicts the role we are destined to play in society and lets you believe that you understand your opponent better than he understands himself.\u201cAll the social sciences are brought to bear to try to explain all the evil that persists in the world, even though the liberal Enlightenment worldview says that we should be able to perfect things,\u201d said Mr. Strouse, the Trump voter. \u201cIf everyone had access to the right education and the right therapist, they would make the right decision \u2014 we know that\u2019s not going to happen. People have wicked tendencies.\u201d In one of the ironies of history, as the social scientific portrait of humanity grows more psychological and irrational, it comes closer and closer to approximating the old Adam of traditional Christianity: a fallen, depraved creature, unable to see himself clearly except with the aid of a higher power.The conclusions of political scientists should inspire humility rather than hubris. In the end, they have confirmed what so many observers of our species have long suspected: None of us are particularly free or rational creatures.Advertisement"}

The pillows in the living room sport bears dressed in red and green. The crowded display cases contain antique Santa Claus figurines.Come December, even more decorations arrive: a white-dusted faux fir covered in homemade ornaments; Mickey Mouse stockings; poinsettias in the living room; red, blue and green lights adorning the trees and bushes outside; and red ribbon wrapped around the front-yard fence.The two worked diligently, exchanging quiet smiles, Jessica playfully reminding their mother every so often that she needs to cull her collection of trinkets.\u201cI can\u2019t do everything from Jamaica because this country is a different country,\u201d Hazel said. \u201cBut Christmas is the tradition I wanted to bring my kids.\u201dCelebrating Christmas together, to the hilt, has been one of the few constants during the family\u2019s often troubled time in the United States. The Craigs were the first black family in the neighborhood, and they did not receive a warm welcome. Hazel says she was regularly pulled over by the police for no reason. As a teenager, her son Everton Lawrence had a hose turned on him by a woman he had asked for directions to the nearest store.The family was riding in their car once when a bottle hit it, thrown from another car. \u201cMy husband pulled over, and the kids wanted to fight him, and they were calling him names,\u201d she said. \u201cI called the cops, and one of the cops said to me, \u2018Some of us are still not overcome,\u2019 meaning that some people still can\u2019t get used to \u2026 \u201c Her voiced trailed off.In 1989, their house burned to the ground. Hazel believes it was arson, as someone had spray-painted racial slurs inside the garage. \u201cWe lost everything,\u201d she said. But that didn\u2019t stop her from celebrating the holidays.A local church donated a small Christmas tree, a family friend brought presents, and in the trailer\u2019s tiny kitchen, Hazel cooked curried goat, callaloo and the spicy saut\u00e9 called ackee and saltfish (ackee is Jamaica\u2019s lychee-like national fruit) \u2014 dishes that required only one pot.Two years after the fire, the family finally moved into their rebuilt house. \u201cIt was empty and it wasn\u2019t finished, so we slept on the floor together,\u201d Jessica recalled. But once again, come Christmastime, Hazel put up a tree and cooked. That\u2019s all she needed to evoke the holidays. \u201cI wanted to instill that in my kids \u2014 just the fact that we were together,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter the fire, we grew much closer.\u201dHazel Craig said that as a child growing up in Spanish Town, she felt happiest at Christmas. \u201cIt was a lot of festivity,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople would dress up and play the drums and walk in the streets and dance. There were games.\u201d Her grandmother would always make Hazel\u2019s favorite dishes, which included curried goat and a fruitcake with cherries and raisins that had been marinating in rum since the previous Christmas.Her own children are now scattered across the country, but they all return to Central Islip on Christmas morning. They exchange gifts, and Hazel prepares a profuse feast of Jamaican specialties that keep everyone full for the whole day. They include festival \u2014 fried dumplings made of cornmeal \u2014 and a rich drink of carrot juice, condensed milk and nutmeg.\u201cChristmas is one of the few times that the whole family actually gets together to have our comfort foods,\u201d Jessica said. \u201cIt makes my mom super-happy to feed us. Those foods mean a lot.\u201d (This year, their gathering will be smaller: Everton died in August of a heart ailment, leaving a wife and two children.) Last, in a small pot Hazel combined the ingredients for the curried goat, which included a sliced Scotch bonnet chile (she did not remove the seeds), potatoes (her trick to a thick, hearty broth) and curry powder made by a friend in Jamaica. She insisted that the best way to prepare goat is not to brown the meat first, but to cook everything all at once in the same pot. \u201cWhen you heat everything up together,\u201d she said, all the flavor \u201cgets locked in there.\u201dAt L\u2019Artusi, Jessica makes olive oil cakes and panna cotta. But she talked excitedly about someday opening an all-day cafe that serves some of the dishes from her childhood, like beef patties and banana fritters.Her mother wasn\u2019t thinking that far ahead. All that was on her mind as she placed the goat in the refrigerator to marinate was Dec. 25, when her children will show up at her door with their spouses and children in tow. They\u2019ll tear open presents and reminisce over callaloo and sweet potato pudding.Life in America hadn\u2019t turned out exactly as she imagined when she left Jamaica 48 years ago.

As someone who adores lentils, split peas, chickpeas, favas and dried kidney beans of every stripe, I keep them in spades in my pantry, and I could happily survive for months without ever leaving the house.But a pot of beans simmers year round in many of the world\u2019s kitchens, usually with a pot of rice nearby, for a humble, hearty and delicious meal. In some versions, the cooked rice and stewed beans are combined before serving. In others, they are served side by side or with the beans spooned over the rice.Throughout the Caribbean and Central America, beans and rice (or rice with beans) is made with pigeon peas, red beans or black turtle beans, to name a few. There are lots of variations made with lentils. The combination of rice and lentils is also popular throughout the Mediterranean, the Middle East and South Asia, cooked together in the same pot or separately.For this variation, I decided on Spanish-style lentils with chorizo and greens, for a thick flavorful stew, but vegans or vegetarians may simply omit the sausage and still have great results. Some cooks include a few diced potatoes, which is always a good option. Instead of plain white rice, I craved Caribbean yellow rice, cooked with onions, a cinnamon stick and a few cloves. (In this case, the rice gets its golden color from turmeric or powdered annatto, not saffron.) If you want the stew to be soupier, thin it with a little water or broth. It may be necessary, as the stew will thicken as it sits.Advertisement"}

But let\u2019s focus on something possibly as dear to your heart as it is to mine. The president has abruptly undermined Israel\u2019s security following a phone call with an Islamist strongman in Turkey. So much for the idea, common on the right, that this is the most pro-Israel administration ever.Powers that maintain a reputation as reliable allies and formidable foes tend to enhance their power. Powers that behave as Trump\u2019s America has squander it.But leave that aside and consider the Trump presidency from a purely Israeli standpoint. Are Israelis better off now that the U.S. Embassy is in Jerusalem? Not materially. The move was mostly a matter of symbolism, albeit of an overdue and useful sort. Are Israelis safer from Iran now that the U.S. is no longer in the Iran deal and sanctions are back in force? Only marginally. Sanctions are a tool of strategy, not a strategy unto themselves.What Israel most needs from the U.S. today is what it needed at its birth in 1948: an America committed to defending the liberal-international order against totalitarian enemies, as opposed to one that conducts a purely transactional foreign policy based on the needs of the moment or the whims of a president.From that, everything follows. It means that the U.S. should not sell out small nations \u2014 whether it was Israel in 1973 or Kuwait in 1990 \u2014 for the sake of currying favor with larger ones. It means we should resist interloping foreign aggressors, whether it was the Soviets in Egypt in the 1960s, or the Russians and Iranians in Syria in this decade. It means we should oppose militant religious fundamentalism, whether it is Wahhabis in Riyadh or Khomeinists in Tehran or Muslim Brothers in Cairo and Ankara. It means we should advocate human rights, civil liberties, and democratic institutions, in that order.Trump has stood all of this on its head.Is any of this good for Israel?If you think the gravest immediate threat to Israel is jihadist Hezbollah backed by fundamentalist Iran backed by cynical Russia, the answer is no.If you think the gravest middle-term threat is the continued Islamization of Turkey under Recep Tayyip Erdogan \u2014 gradually transforming the country into a technologically competent Sunni version of Iran \u2014 the answer is no.If you think that another grave threat to Israel is the inability to preserve at least a vision of a future Palestinian state \u2014 one that pursues good governance and peace with its neighbors while rejecting kleptocracy and terrorism \u2014 the answer is no.And if you think that the ultimate long-term threat to Israel is the resurgence of isolationism in the U.S. and a return to the geopolitics of every nation for itself, the answer is more emphatically no.Advertisement"}

He\u2019s been running on this theme since he lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton. We will not even bother to envision what Election Day would look like if millions and millions of extra voters were standing in line.There\u2019s also Trump\u2019s more recent argument that voters should have to have special IDs because \u201cif you go out and you want to buy groceries you need a picture on a card. You need an ID.\u201dPeople, where do you think this came from?A) Traumatic childhood experience in which he treated his class to ice cream at the ballpark and told the vendor to \u201cjust send the bill to my Dad.\u201dB) Atlantic City incident when he tried to buy a bag of Doritos with a promissory note.C) A bad dream in which he had to shop on his own in a store full of badly dressed people.Beats me. Anyway, Trump appears to believe the only reason he has ever lost an election was phony voters. Remember his theory that the New Hampshire primary was flooded by thousands of people \u201cbrought in busses\u201d from Massachusetts? In the real world, this sort of thing is approximately as common as the Asian Crested Ibis.\u201cWe don\u2019t see voter impersonation fraud anywhere in the country because it would be such a dumb way to steal an election,\u201d said Richard Hasen, the author of \u201cThe Voting Wars.\u201d When he was researching his book, Hasen said, he looked for a good example of multiple-voting and never found one.Really, candidates of the future, if you want to steal an election just find ways to keep the other side from participating. You could try tweeting threats. (\u201cCheat at your own peril.\u201d) Or simply using the whole voter fraud issue to make it more difficult for people to register, and more self-conscious about how they\u2019ll be treated if they show up at the polls.For Republicans, all this has the convenient effect of discouraging people who are young, poor or minority from taking part in the system. Democrats are not really into the game. We would like to believe this is because of a firm belief in an open political process. But it\u2019s probably also because, short of putting all the polls in fifth-floor walk-ups, there\u2019s no easy way to keep elderly white men from voting.It involved a couple of counties with large African-American and rural populations, and the victim was the Democrat. Dan McCready, the Democratic candidate, is the party\u2019s new dream red-district combo: Ivy League college graduate/Marine, who found faith while fighting in Iraq and was baptized in water from the Euphrates River. People thought he had a chance, and on election night things were close, very close. But the Republican candidate, Mark Harris, a conservative former pastor, seemed to be about 900 votes ahead. McCready conceded.Suffice it to say that investigations are underway. North Carolina actually has a very open election system and chances are pretty good that the authorities will figure this all out. \u201cIn most states if this was going on you wouldn\u2019t be able to see it,\u201d said Jason Roberts, a professor of political science at the University of North Carolina.This is one of the many moments when we give thanks that there are so few close elections in New York.Several morals to this story, people. One is that Donald Trump is wrong about everything. (\u201cAll you have to do is go around, take a look at what\u2019s happened over the years, and you\u2019ll see. There are a lot of people \u2014 a lot of people \u2014 my opinion, and based on proof \u2014 that try and get in illegally and actually vote illegally.\u201d)O.K., not a shock. But feel free to notice that Trump has never bothered to mention any concern about absentee ballots. \u201cIt\u2019s the absentee ballots that are most ripe for fraud,\u201d said Roberts. \u201cPeople have been saying that for years.\u201d Meanwhile in North Carolina, the Republican State Legislature is hard at work on a constitutional amendment to require voter IDs.An earlier version of the photo incorrectly identified the man to the right of President Trump.

{"Headline": "A Salamander of Legend Emerges From Southern Swamps", "Date": "2018-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe reticulated siren is the largest vertebrate discovered in the United States in decades. It\u2019s eel-shaped and leopard-spotted, and it has no hind-limbs. It grows to two feet long. And yet until recently, hardly anyone had ever seen it.A team of researchers has discovered of new species of salamander in the pine forests of northern Florida and southern Alabama. The so-called reticulated siren is the largest vertebrate found in the United States in decades, and the first new member of its family since 1944. Known for their size and bushy gills, sirens are a fixture in Southeastern swamps and watery ditches. Previously, Dr. Steen said, the genus was assumed to contain only two species: the lesser siren and greater siren, which can grow to three feet in length, one of the longest American salamanders.But rumors of a third species have long persisted among reptile experts in Alabama and Florida. Informally called the leopard eel, one specimen ended up at Auburn University in 1970, misidentified as a greater siren. \u201cThe whole thing was kind of a campfire story,\u201d said Sean Graham, a biologist at Sul Ross State University in Texas who helped lead the new study. \u201cI was hearing rumors about it from people like Jensen, and then years would go by and I would never see a description of the species.\u201dThe process of formally describing a new species scientifically involves publishing a careful description of its anatomy and genetics; official recognition is often crucial to encouraging further research and determining conservation protections. That meant catching wild leopard eels, which proved more difficult than expected. Despite several camping trips and multiple attempts to trap the elusive salamanders, they never had any luck. He left Dr. Graham a simple voice mail: \u201cI got one. You know what I mean.\u201d Dr. Graham raced from Texas to Florida to see for himself.\u201cThat was the first time I got to see one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was so different looking. So boldly patterned, colored, even its head shape. It has this kind of puny little head that\u2019s very different from other sirens.\u201d\u201cI was just letting it crawl through my fingers and freaking out. Hollering. It was great.\u201dDr. Steen and Dr. Graham went to work. Without grants or dedicated funding, Dr. Steen said, they studied the specimen in their spare time. They enlisted the help of other experts, including Crystal Kelehear of Sul Ross State University (who is Dr. Graham\u2019s wife) and Richard Kline of the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. In 2014, they caught three more of the salamanders in Lake Jackson, on the Florida-Alabama border. As it turned out, the siren\u2019s genome is huge and packed into four sets of chromosomes, so the analysis took much longer than expected. The new study relies on seven specimens \u2014 four recently collected, three from museum collections \u2014 to formally describe the siren. But while the reticulated siren is genetically distinct from the other two recognized species, its exact place on the family tree is uncertain. Sirens are poorly understood. They like the thick muck at the bottom of swamps and ponds, which makes them hard to study. Their diet seems to consist of crustaceans and small insects, although they will occasionally eat plants, the only salamanders known to do so. Researchers didn\u2019t even know how they reproduced until 2013: Unlike other salamanders, the males fertilize eggs externally, as fish do.Without knowing more about the reticulated siren\u2019s population and range, Dr. Steen said, it\u2019s difficult to assess its conservation status. So far, the species has been found only in pine forests of southern Alabama and in the Florida Panhandle, an ecosystem of creeks and bottomland swamps that is a hot spot of biological diversity.\u201cWe\u2019re hoping that one of the outcomes of this study getting out there is that it gets on people\u2019s radar screens \u2014 funding agencies, state agencies \u2014 and they will begin to prioritize the work that is needed to fully understand the biology and conservation of this animal,\u201d Dr. Steen said. The genetic analysis also suggests that there may be other species of sirens as yet undiscovered. \u201cA lot of the animals we thought were greater sirens and lesser sirens are probably the reticulated siren or other animals that we haven\u2019t formally recognized,\u201d Dr. Steen said.Advertisement"}

This time her family does not have a place to live. Lily, a fuchsia Muppet with a mop of hair, green eyelids and a lavender nose, debuted on \u201cSesame Street\u201d seven years ago. She was shy and soft-spoken. Her family, she explained to Elmo, did not have enough to eat.At the time, Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit that produces \u201cSesame Street,\u201d wanted to create a Muppet that could help illustrate the food insecurity that was affecting nearly 17 million households with children.Lily\u2019s dramatic return will be unveiled Wednesday on YouTube.On \u201cSesame Street,\u201d \u201chomeless\u201d is never uttered because of the stigma surrounding the word; on the show, \u201cH\u201d stands for hope, help, healing and home. Sesame Workshop has produced several segments involving Lily\u2019s story arc, including one where Elmo and Rosita interact with real-life children who are homeless. The videos can be seen on YouTube and on a show-related website that has resource materials to help parents, teachers, social workers and others learn how to help children cope with homelessness. A storybook, penned by the children\u2019s author Kama Einhorn, shows Lily in a shelter comparing her situation to that of a baby bird whose nest has been destroyed.Three videos follow Lily\u2019s plight, from the revelation of her homelessness to getting an apartment. Leslie Carrara-Rudolph, the puppeteer behind Abby Cadabby, a regular on \u201cSesame Street,\u201d brings Lily to life. Sofia is played by the actress Jasmine Romero.But various people told Sesame Workshop that they needed to address childhood homelessness. \u201cHomelessness carries such a unique set of challenges and is such a unique circumstance of trauma for kids, affecting them in so many ways that other traumas do not. Their sense of physical safety, their sleeping, their access to school,\u201d Ms. Einhorn said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a pervasive trauma and it\u2019s sustained.\u201dIn one part of the segment, \u201cA Rainbow Kind of Day,\u201d Lily and Elmo are painting a mural of a rainbow. Suddenly, Lily, appearing sullen, walks away. Elmo asks Lily why she looks so sad, and then encourages her to open up.\u201cYou know, Lily, sometimes, when Elmo talks about his feelings, it makes Elmo feel better,\u201d he tells her.Lily reluctantly reveals that she and her family are homeless.\u201cConnect the Dots\u201d features Lily and Sofia talking about how to always feel at home. Sofia says her grandmother taught her a game called \u201cConnect the Dots of Love.\u201d\u201cI do it whenever I feel worried or scared,\u201d Sofia says. \u201cCan I show you?\u201dShe tells Lily to think of someone who loves her. Then, she makes dots out of the people Lily identifies. \u201cWhat do you get when you connect all these dots?\u201d Sofia asks.She then draws a heart out of the dots. \u201cAll of these people love you and they are going to take care of you no matter where you are,\u201d Sofia says.In \u201cRibbons of Hope,\u201d Lily\u2019s family moves into an apartment and she tells Elmo that her mother made her bracelets out of ribbons. Touching them kept Lily calm during difficult times. She offers one to Elmo.\u201cTogether, we got this,\u201d she says.The ribbons were comforting for Lily, said Ms. Einhorn, who also works as senior content manager at Sesame Workshop. In talking to parents and providers, she remembered hearing from a mother that she would take a car freshener, like the one hung on a rearview mirror, to each place her family stayed to create a sense of continuity through smell. The tactic is included in a list of tips for parents that\u2019s linked to the video series and storybook.A group of experts on children and homelessness helped the Sesame Workshop develop the scripts and materials. Sesame also talked to six groups of homeless and formerly homeless parents and also with providers of homeless services in New York and Pennsylvania. In this segment with Elmo and Rosita, real-life children discuss what \u201chome\u201d means.\u201cI think home is to me a special place that I would like to live every single day,\u201d Darinys Nueves, an 8-year-old currently living in shelter, says at the end of the segment.Aleida Romero, her mother, said in an interview that they were living doubled up with another family in a Brooklyn apartment but were kicked out after a dispute. Ms. Romero, 41, was diagnosed with cancer soon after the family moved into a shelter. She said she had to quit her job as a medical assistant while undergoing treatment and is now taking classes to become a nurse.She said she hoped these Sesame Workshop segments can change public perception of homelessness. \u201cI want people to think differently about us. People bully my daughter because she lives in the shelter,\u201d Ms. Romero said.Darinys chimed in, \u201cPeople should not be rude to other people just because they have other stuff.\u201d\u201cChildren who experience homelessness, there\u2019s an invisibility with that, an isolation,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cTo see your experience in a puppet, it\u2019s tremendously normalizing and validating.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "White Identity Politics Aren\u2019t Going Anywhere", "Date": "2018-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHow should Democrats understand \u2014 and confront \u2014 them?Mr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.As the Democratic Party has evolved from an overwhelmingly white party to a party with a huge minority base, the dominant strategic problem has become the tenuous balance between the priorities of its now equally indispensable white and minority wings.President Trump has aggressively exploited Democratic vulnerabilities as no previous Republican candidate had dared to do. The frontal attack Trump has engineered \u2014 in part by stigmatizing \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d \u2014 has had a dual effect, throwing Democrats back on their heels while simultaneously whetting their appetite for a fight. For Democrats to counter Trump effectively, a number of scholars believe it is essential to understand the motivations \u2014 the needs, beliefs and agendas \u2014 of those whites who have moved into the Trump camp. Only armed with that information, the way these scholars see it, can the left recapture enough of those voters to regain majority status on a more permanent basis, both in its battles for Congress and for the White House.The first is made up of those for whom their white \u201cidentity is extremely or very important\u201d to them. Surveys taken from 2012 to 2016, according to Jardina, show that the percentage of whites who say their white identity is very or extremely important ranges from 28 to 42 percent.According to Jardina, \u201chigher levels of white identity are somewhat linked to higher levels of racial animosity.\u201d At the same time, she contends in her book:A small percentage of white identifiers score quite high on measures of racial prejudice or resentment, but many more white identifiers possess average and even low levels of racial prejudice. In other words, white identity is not defined by racial animus, and whites who identify with their racial group are not simply reducible to bigots.The second group comprises those who rank high on a test of \u201cwhite consciousness.\u201d The difference between white identity and white consciousness, Jardina argues, is that those in the latter category believe that \u201cmany whites are unable to find jobs because employers are hiring minorities.\u201d Jardina reports that they also stress \u201cthe importance of whites working together to change laws that are unfair to whites.\u201dThe third constituency is made up of whites high in \u201cracial resentment.\u201dThis is based, Jardina writes, onresponses to four survey items, with response options ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree for each. The survey items ask respondents if they agree/disagree that (1) blacks should work their way up without any special favors; (2) generations of slavery and discrimination make it difficult for blacks to work their way out of the lower class; (3) blacks have gotten less than they deserve; (4) blacks must try harder to get ahead. The index is scaled to range from 0 (least resentful) to 1 (most resentful).Jardina argues in her book that the racial resentment scale reveals anew type of racial prejudice \u2014 one that is a subtle combination of anti-black affect and the belief that blacks do not adhere to traditional American values associated with the Protestant work ethic.Racial resentmentpredicts whites\u2019 opinions toward a wide range of racialized political policies and has a profound impact on political candidate evaluations. It is, quite clearly, a central component to the way in which whites interpret the political and social world.There is an ongoing dispute over the use of such questions to measure racial resentment. Jardina acknowledges that \u201csome scholars are critical of this framework\u201d and \u201cargue that racial resentment entangles conservative principles, like individualism, with racial prejudice.\u201dIn survey experiments, Carney and Enos substituted Lithuanians and other nationalities for African-Americans so that the first resentment question would ask for agreement or disagreement with the statement: \u201cLithuanians should work their way up without any special favors.\u201d Their conclusion:The results obtained using groups other than blacks are substantively indistinguishable from those measured when blacks are the target group. Decomposing this measure further, we find that political conservatives express only minor differences in resentment across target groups. Far greater differences in resentment toward blacks and other groups can be found among racially sympathetic liberals. In short, we find that modern racism questions appear to measure attitudes toward any group, rather than African-Americans alone.Carney and Enos conclude that the \u201cmodern racism scales\u201d fail tocapture attitudes specific to African-Americans. However, the scales do capture a form of racism, both a general resentment that applies to many groups and a specific failure to recognize the unique historical plight of African-Americans.But, she adds,many whites\u2019 reactions to our country\u2019s changing racial landscape do not simply manifest in outward hostility. Amidst these changes, many whites have described themselves as outnumbered, disadvantaged, and even oppressed. They have voiced their anxiety over America\u2019s waning numerical majority, and have questioned what this means for the future of the nation. They have worried that soon they may face discrimination based on their own race, if they do not already.Such fears, in Jardina\u2019s view, drive the emergence of white identity as a political issue:These threats, both real and perceived, have, as I will demonstrate, brought to the fore, for many whites, a sense of commonality, attachment, and solidarity with their racial group. They have led a sizable proportion of whites to believe that their racial group, and the benefits that group enjoys, are endangered.The result?This racial solidarity now plays a central role in the way many whites orient themselves to the political and social world.Central to Jardina\u2019s argument is the contention that some whites \u201cidentify with their racial group without feeling prejudice toward racial and ethnic minorities,\u201d while others do \u201cpossess some degree of negative affect toward racial and ethnic minorities without also identifying with their racial group.\u201dFor example, in the case of support or opposition to domestic spending programs, she writes, \u201cHigher levels of white identity and consciousness are actually associated with greater support for spending.\u201d By comparison, she continued, \u201cracial resentment is associated with support for decreasing spending on all groups, including whites.\u201dThis finding leads, in turn, to another Jardina assertion:Many whites are not motivated to oppose immigration because they dislike Latinos. They are also not inclined to support Donald Trump because they feel negatively about people of color in the United States.Rather, Jardina puts forward the argument thatthese whites feel, to some extent, that the rug is being pulled out from under them \u2014 that the benefits they have enjoyed because of their race, their groups\u2019 advantages, and their status atop the racial hierarchy are all in jeopardy.Put another way, she makes the case thatwhite identity is not synonymous with racial prejudice. White racial solidarity provides a lens through which whites interpret the political and social world that is inward looking.According to Jardina, whites, to a certain extent, are deliberately claiming victimhood:White identifiers have co-opted the language of racial discrimination and oppression. Put bluntly, the politics of white identity is marked by an insidious illusion, one in which whites claim their group experiences discrimination in an effort to reinforce and maintain a system of racial inequality where whites are the dominant group with the lion\u2019s share of power and privileges.Because for many whites \u201cidentifying with their group and protecting its status hardly seems problematic, especially compared to racism,\u201d it\u2019s difficult to \u201cconvince some whites that there\u2019s something normatively objectionable about identifying with one\u2019s racial group and wanting to protect its interests.\u201dAs the urban West gets more diverse, the finger increasingly points to the white majority as the engine of segregation. White majorities are retreating towards places where they are relatively concentrated.Kaufmann, a political scientist at the University of London, argues provocatively in an email that a strategic shift to compromise on the most divisive issues, including immigration, could work to Democrats\u2019 advantage:The right\u2019s problem in America is more its doctrinaire tax-cutting, suspicion of government and international institutions. If the left didn\u2019t give it so much domestic cultural ammunition, the right would face defeat and have to adjust.Kaufmann argues that there is a structural dilemma posed by the multiracial nature of the left coalition: he views what he calls \u201cthe institutionalization of multiculturalism/diversity/equity\u201d and of \u201chigh immigration\u201d as fueling the rightward direction of recent political movements in the United States and Europe. He believes that it would benefit progressive groups, \u201cin the interests of harmony,\u201d for liberals to \u201cargue their case for diversity\u201d but that they should \u201ctolerate difference of opinion and accept compromise.\u201dKaufmann\u2019s strategic approach and suggestions run counter to the thinking of many others.that more attention needed to be given to the dire circumstances of working white men and women, that Trump\u2019s election was a white, working-class, often rural backlash and what was needed was a focus on Middle America. This criticism coalesced with an ongoing obsession about what suburban white America was thinking.It felt, Glaude wrote, \u201clike folks weren\u2019t fighting the true problem. They were, in fact, protecting it.\u201dOne of the key attitudes revealed in survey data linked to support for Trump has been the \u201cfear of losing your job to a minority,\u201d Vavreck wrote me by email. In addition, 64 percent of Trump voters believed that \u201caverage Americans\u201d have gotten \u201cless than they deserve\u201d but \u201conly 12 percent said black Americans have gotten less than they deserve.\u201dVavreck argues that whatever identity exists at present among whites as a group is largely based on ideas about deservingness, and centers on outgroups getting too much or taking too much that is not due to them.Laissez-faire racism, he argues,identifies this new era as one where longstanding values of meritocracy, individualism, majority rule and competition in a free marketplace weave together as rationalization for persistent racial inequality in a putatively anti-discrimination, race-neutral democratic state.They surveyed 22,500 people in France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Britain and the United States and found thatrespondents greatly overestimate the total number of immigrants, think immigrants are culturally and religiously more distant from them, and are economically weaker \u2014 less educated, more unemployed, poorer, and more reliant on government transfers \u2014 than is the case.When shown more accurate \u2014 and more positive \u2014 information about the hard work performed by immigrants, respondents \u201cbecome significantly more favorable to redistribution.\u201d But that did not last long:If respondents are also first prompted to think in detail about immigrants\u2019 number and composition, then none of the favorable information treatments is able to compensate for the negative priors that resurface and that lower support for redistribution.In other words, pro-immigration, pro-diversity Democrats face clear obstacles breaking the Republican hold on white voters \u2014 and a challenge in repelling Trump\u2019s race-and-immigration-focused offensive. Still, the accumulating insights on how and where Republicans have successfully worked these levers may help demonstrate \u2014 as President Barack Obama, President Bill Clinton and the results of this year\u2019s midterm elections prove\u00a0\u2014\u00a0that these obstacles are not insuperable and that they can be overcome.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why We Miss the WASPs", "Date": "2018-12-05", "News": "Opinion Their more meritocratic, diverse and secular successors rule us neither as wisely nor as well.Supported byOpinion ColumnistThe nostalgia flowing since the passing of George H.W. Bush has many wellsprings: admiration for the World War II generation and its dying breed of warrior-politicians, the usual belated media affection for moderate Republicans, the contrast between the elder Bush\u2019s foreign policy successes and the failures of his son, and the contrast between any honorable politician and the current occupant of the Oval Office.I think you can usefully combine these takes, and describe Bush nostalgia as a longing for something America used to have and doesn\u2019t really any more \u2014 a ruling class that was widely (not universally, but more widely than today) deemed legitimate, and that inspired various kinds of trust (intergenerational, institutional) conspicuously absent in our society today.Put simply, Americans miss Bush because we miss the WASPs \u2014 because we feel, at some level, that their more meritocratic and diverse and secular successors rule us neither as wisely nor as well.Foer suggests this nostalgia is mostly bunk, since the WASPs were so often bigots (he quotes Henry Adams\u2019s fears of a \u201cfurtive Yacoob or Ysaac still reeking of the ghetto\u201d), since their cultivation of noblesse oblige was really all about \u201cpreserving [a] place at the high table of American life,\u201d and since so many of their virtues were superficial, a matter of dressing nicely while practicing imperialism, or writing lovely thank-you notes while they outsourced the dirty work of politics to race-baiting operatives.\u201cThose who are mourning the passing of the old Establishment should mourn its many failures, too,\u201d he writes. Which is fair enough: The old ruling class was bigoted and exclusive and often cruel, it had failures aplenty, and as a Catholic I hold no brief for its theology (and don\u2019t get me started on its Masonry).However, one of the lessons of the age of meritocracy is that building a more democratic and inclusive ruling class is harder than it looks, and even perhaps a contradiction in terms. You can get rid of the social registers and let women into your secret societies and privilege SATs over recommendations from the rector of Justin and the headmaster of Saint Grottlesex ... and you still end up with something that is clearly a self-replicating upper class, a powerful elite, filling your schools and running your public institutions.Not only that, but you even end up with an elite that literally uses the same strategy of exclusion that WASPs once used against Jews to preserve its particular definition of diversity from high-achieving Asians \u2014 with the only difference being that our elite is more determined to deceive itself about how and why it\u2019s discriminating.So if some of the elder Bush\u2019s mourners wish we still had a WASP establishment, their desire probably reflects a belated realization that certain of the old establishment\u2019s vices were inherent to any elite, that meritocracy creates its own forms of exclusion \u2014 and that the WASPs had virtues that their successors have failed to inherit or revive.Those virtues included a spirit of noblesse oblige and personal austerity and piety that went beyond the thank-you notes and boat shoes and prep school chapel going \u2014 a spirit that trained the most privileged children for service, not just success, that sent men like Bush into combat alongside the sons of farmers and mechanics in the same way that it sent missionaries and diplomats abroad in the service of their churches and their country.And somehow the combination of pious obligation joined to cosmopolitanism gave the old establishment a distinctive competence and effectiveness in statesmanship \u2014 one that from the late-19th century through the middle of the 1960s was arguably unmatched among the various imperial elites with whom our establishment contended, and that certainly hasn\u2019t been matched by our feckless leaders in the years since George H.W. Bush went down to political defeat.So as an American in the old dispensation, you didn\u2019t have to like the establishment \u2014 and certainly its members were often eminently hateable \u2014 to prefer their leadership to many of the possible alternatives. And as an American today, you don\u2019t have to miss everything about the WASPs, or particularly like their remaining heirs, to feel nostalgic for their competence.The interesting question is whether they had to die off as they did. The decline of the old establishment is often portrayed as a simple inevitability \u2014 with all those baby boomers storming the universities, all that demographic change sweeping away white Protestant America, how could the WASPs hope to preserve their rule?Certainly something had to change. But along with the establishment failure in Vietnam, which hastened the collapse of the old elite\u2019s authority, there was also a loss of religious faith and cultural confidence, and a belief among the last generation of true WASPs that the emerging secular meritocracy would be morally and intellectually superior to their own style of elite. Thus under '60s mandarins like the Yale president Kingman Brewster the WASP ascendancy did not simply fall; it pre-emptively dissolved itself.I\u2019m not sure that self-abnegation has aged well. In any scenario the WASP elite would have had to diversify and adapt. But its virtues were to some extent transferable to a more diverse society: The establishment had always been somewhat permeable to arrivistes, Jews and Catholics imitated WASP habits in the 1940s and 1950s, and in our era their admirable influence is still felt in figures as different as Barack Obama and Mitt Romney.So it\u2019s possible to imagine adaptation rather than surrender as a different WASP strategy across the 1960s and 1970s. In such a world the establishment would have still admitted more blacks, Jews, Catholics and Hispanics (and more women) to its ranks \u2026 but it would have done so as a self-consciously elite-crafting strategy, rather than under the pseudo-democratic auspices of the SAT and the high school resume and the dubious ideal of \u201cmerit.\u201d At the same time it would have retained both its historic religious faith (instead of exchanging Protestant rigor for a post-Christian Social Gospel and a soft pantheism) and its more self-denying culture (instead of letting all that wash away in the flood of boomer-era emotivism). The goal would have been to keep piety and discipline embedded in the culture of a place like Harvard, rather than the mix of performative self-righteousness and raw ambition that replaced them.Such an effort might also have had spillover effects on politics. It\u2019s de rigueur for liberals to lament the decline of the Rockefeller Republicans, or the compromises that a moderate northeastern WASP like George H.W. Bush made with Sunbelt populism. But a WASP establishment that couldn\u2019t muster the self-confidence to hold on to Yale and Harvard was never likely to maintain its hold on a mass political organization like the G.O.P. Whereas an establishment that still believed in its mission within its own ivied bastions might have been seen as more politically imposing in the wider world \u2014 instead of seeing its last paladin, a war hero and statesman in a grand American tradition, dismissed in the boomer era as a \u201cwimp.\u201dThe point of this counterfactual is not to just join the nostalgic chorus around Bush\u2019s departure for the Great Kennebunkport in the Skies. Rather it\u2019s to look forward, and to suggest that our current elite might someday be reformed \u2014 or simply replaced \u2014 through the imitation of the old establishment's more pious and aristocratic spirit.Right now, almost all the discussion of our meritocracy\u2019s vices assumes the system\u2019s basic post-WASP premises, and hopes that either more inclusion (the pro-diversity left\u2019s fixation) or a greater emphasis on academic merit (the anti-affirmative right\u2019s hobbyhorse) will cure our establishment\u2019s all-too-apparent ills.The meritocracy is hardening into an aristocracy \u2014 so let it. Every society in history has had an elite, and what is an aristocracy but an elite that has put some care into making itself presentable? Allow the social forces that created this aristocracy to continue their work, and embrace the label. By all means this caste should admit as many worthy newcomers as is compatible with their sense of continuity. New brains, like new money, have been necessary to every ruling class, meritocratic or not. If ethnic balance is important to meritocrats, they should engineer it into the system. If geographic diversity strikes them as important, they should ensure that it exists, ideally while keeping an eye on the danger of hoovering up all of the native talent from regional America. But they must give up any illusion that such tinkering will make them representative of the country over which they preside.

Bush 41 was probably the last president who refused to govern in a state of remorseless partisan war with his opponents. Obviously that wasn\u2019t true of his political campaigns, particularly against Mike Dukakis in 1988, but it did typify his time in office. It\u2019s almost hard to imagine that we could recover that style of politics.With that in mind, what are you looking forward to when Democrats take over the House come January?Anything you hope Congress will or won\u2019t do?I say this with some reluctance, ideologically speaking.

We already mentioned mass transit, controlling overdevelopment of beaches and other fragile areas. Reducing car emissions makes the air better. Encouraging the solar heating industry and wind power gives us an economic boost.And if I go on I will wind up once again pointing out that the worst possible approach is the one the president is taking \u2014 overturning the existing anti-warming regulations and shrugging his shoulders as if the whole issue was slightly less important than the weekend golfing schedule.We spend a lot of time jointly beating up on Trump: Is there anything he\u2019s doing that you\u2019d want to praise with a little holiday-season cheer?\u2026. thinking.\u2026. thinking.What about you?

The other two names appeared to have been overlooked, they said.The acquittal drew attention to the wider crackdown on civil society in Egypt under President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who has imprisoned journalists and rights activists, muzzled the free press, and introduced harsh laws regulating nongovernmental organizations.The crackdown stems from the events of 2011, when the wave of street protests that ousted President Hosni Mubarak was soon followed by restrictions on civil society. The prosecution late in that year of the American and European democracy groups, as well as the International Center for Journalists, was an early sign of the backlash.By then, many of the accused had already fled Egypt, and the case became a source of tension between Washington and Cairo.Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who died in August, campaigned vociferously to have the verdict overturned. The case resurfaced in August 2017 when Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson froze $290 million in aid to Egypt, citing a range of concerns that included rights abuses and the crackdown on civil society.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany also exerted pressure on Mr. Sisi as part an effort to lift a ban on the Konrad Adenauer Foundation in Egypt.In December 2017, four months after American aid was suspended, an Egyptian court reopened Case 173, as it is officially known, and in April it was referred to a retrial. Welcoming Thursday\u2019s verdict, Sam LaHood said he hoped it would be \u201cthe first step reversing the damage done by Case 173 to Egypt and her great people.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Nguyen is the author of the novel \u201cThe Sympathizer\u201d and a contributing opinion writer. For most of the four decades since the Vietnam War ended, refugees fleeing the Communist government in Vietnam have been treated differently from those refugees from most other countries. If they committed felonies, they would not be deported. According to Tung Nguyen, an activist who is in regular contact with Vietnamese detainees, the goal of indefinite and repeated detention is to \u201cpsychologically torment and break these people.\u201d The plight of these Vietnamese refugees may seem unsurprising in an era defined by Muslim bans, deep cuts in new refugee admissions and the separation of families at the Mexican border. But it also stands out for how radically this administration has departed from the bipartisan consensus supporting Cold War refugees since the end of the Vietnam War.From the fall of Saigon in 1975 until 1995, the United States did not recognize the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, and so it was impossible to deport people there. Even after diplomatic relations were restored in 1995, the American government chose not to deport Vietnamese refugees with felony records, and the Communist government in Hanoi showed no interest in receiving refugees whom it considered citizens of a country that no longer existed. Now the Trump administration is attempting to reinterpret that agreement \u2014 and effectively erase the intimate history of the Republic of Vietnam and the United States, countries linked by a brutal war and promises of friendship. Indefinite detention for anyone seems inhumane. But it seems uniquely cruel to imprison \u2014 with the intention of expelling \u2014 people who were America\u2019s allies in the war that ravaged their homeland. During the Cold War, accepting refugees from Vietnam was an important symbol of America\u2019s humanitarian largess. Today, punishing Vietnamese refugees symbolizes the new American doctrine: deportation for deportation\u2019s sake.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Tech Too Easy to Use?", "Date": "2018-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftSeven years ago, a younger and more carefree Mark Zuckerberg went onstage at Facebook\u2019s annual developer conference and announced a major change to the social network\u2019s design.\u201cFrom here on out, it\u2019s a frictionless experience,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.Of all the buzzwords in tech, perhaps none has been deployed with as much philosophical conviction as \u201cfrictionless.\u201d Over the past decade or so, eliminating \u201cfriction\u201d \u2014 the name given to any quality that makes a product more difficult or time-consuming to use \u2014 has become an obsession of the tech industry, accepted as gospel by many of the world\u2019s largest companies.Airbnb, Uber and hundreds of other start-ups have made billions of dollars by reducing the effort needed to rent rooms, hail taxis and complete other annoying tasks. And when a company fails, excessive friction is often cited as the reason.There is nothing wrong with making things easier, in most cases, and the history of technology is filled with examples of amazing advances brought about by reducing complexity. Not even the most hardened Luddite, I suspect, wants to go back to the days of horse-drawn carriages and hand-crank radios.Over the past several weeks, I\u2019ve spoken to more than a dozen designers, product managers and tech executives about the principles of frictionless design. Many said that while making products easier to use was usually good, there were cases where friction could be useful in preventing harm, and steering users toward healthier behavior.Bobby Goodlatte, a former Facebook designer who is now an angel investor, told me that the tech industry\u2019s culture of optimization \u201cpresumes that reducing friction is virtuous unto itself.\u201d\u201cIt leads us to ask, \u2018Can we?\u2019 \u2014 never \u2018Should we?\u2019\u201d he said.Several people praised the Time Well Spent movement spearheaded by Tristan Harris, a former Google design ethicist and co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology, as a kind of pro-friction cohort within the tech industry. Among other things, the group has successfully pressured companies like Facebook and Apple to take steps to curb tech addiction by including features that encourage users to limit their screen time.And a few lamented that in the tech industry\u2019s race for convenience, something important had been lost.\u201cWe wanted to juice engagement and therefore made things as frictionless as possible,\u201d said Jenna Bilotta, a design manager who has worked at Google. \u201cWe made a whole world of the literal \u2018least you could do\u2019 apps, and it\u2019s trashing people\u2019s mental health.\u201dOften, invoking the concept of friction is a useful way to obscure some larger, less savory goal. For Facebook, \u201cfrictionless sharing\u201d was a thinly veiled cover for the company\u2019s true goal of getting users to post more often, and increasing the amount of data available for ad targeting. For YouTube, auto-playing videos have sharply increased view time, thereby increasing the platform\u2019s profitability. And for Amazon, tools like one-click ordering have created a stunningly efficient machine for commerce and consumption.\u201cOur current application of tech has been to take something hard and make it easy,\u201d said Harper Reed, an engineer and the chief technology officer for President Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 re-election campaign.When tech companies do make their products harder to use, it\u2019s generally to secure them from hackers, spammers or other malicious actors. (Think of the security Captchas that require users to solve math problems or pick out photos of traffic lights, or the way YouTube requires new users to verify their phone numbers before uploading videos longer than 15 minutes.)More of these kinds of changes would be welcome, even if they led to a short-term hit to engagement. And there are plenty of possibilities.What if Facebook made it harder for viral misinformation to spread by adding algorithmic \u201cspeed bumps\u201d that would delay the spread of a controversial post above a certain threshold until fact checkers evaluated it?Or if YouTube gave users a choice between two videos when their video finished, instead of auto-playing the next recommendation?Or if Twitter discouraged abusive pile-ons by making it harder for people who haven\u2019t followed an account for a set number of days to reply to that account\u2019s tweets?This approach might seem overly paternalistic. But the alternative \u2014 a tech infrastructure optimized to ask as little of us as possible, with few circuit breakers to limit the impact of abuse and addiction \u2014 is frightening. After all, \u201cfriction\u201d is just another word for \u201ceffort,\u201d and it\u2019s what makes us capable of critical thought and self-reflection. Without it, we would be the blob people from \u201cWall-E,\u201d sucking down Soylent while watching Netflix on our self-driving recliners.\u201cImagine you run a social network and you\u2019re trying to aggregate all the trending stories based on what all users are clicking,\u201d Mr. Harris, the Time Well Spent founder, told me recently. \u201cWould you prefer to jack the plug into each person\u2019s reptilian brain to aggregate those stories, or would you prefer to jack the plug into their calm, reflective brain that is considering the consequences downstream?\u201dThere may even be a business case for complexity.Consider what happened to Tulerie, a New York start-up that makes a platform that allows women to share designer clothing.Tulerie\u2019s co-founder Merri Smith told me a fascinating story from the company\u2019s early days. In the beginning, Ms. Smith said, the company invited women to join via a brief Google survey, which it emailed to hundreds of prospective members.\u201cWe wanted to create as little friction as possible, while still having to vet these people,\u201d she said.But only one person filled out the survey. So Ms. Smith and her co-founder decided to try a more complicated approach. Anyone who wanted to join had to conduct a brief video call with a company employee first.Logically, the new strategy should have failed. But it was a huge hit. Prospective members flooded the invite list, filling up the company\u2019s interview schedule weeks in advance. By creating a more complex sign-up, Tulerie had signalled that its service was special and worth the effort.\u201cIt goes back to values,\u201d Ms. Smith said. \u201cPeople perceive it as harder to get into, and they want to be a part of it.\u201dI don\u2019t want to romanticize the slow, often frustrating processes of the past. There is nothing inherently good about complexity, and the tech industry could still do a lot of good by reducing friction in systems like health care, education and financial services.But there are both philosophical and practical reasons to ask whether certain technologies should be a little less optimized for convenience. We wouldn\u2019t trust a doctor who made speed a priority over safety. Why would we trust an app that does?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Ghost of Trump Chaos Future", "Date": "2018-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySorry, investors, but there is no sanity clause.Opinion ColumnistTwo years ago, after the shock of Donald Trump\u2019s election, financial markets briefly freaked out, then quickly recovered. In effect, they decided that while Trump was manifestly unqualified for the job, temperamentally and intellectually, it wouldn\u2019t matter. He might talk the populist talk, but he\u2019d walk the plutocratic walk. He might be erratic and uninformed, but wiser heads would keep him from doing anything too stupid.In other words, investors convinced themselves that they had a deal: Trump might sound off, but he wouldn\u2019t really get to make policy. And, hey, taxes on corporations and the wealthy would go down.But now, just in time for Christmas, people are realizing that there was no such deal \u2014 or at any rate, that there wasn\u2019t a sanity clause. (Sorry, couldn\u2019t help myself.) Put an unstable, ignorant, belligerent man in the Oval Office, and he will eventually do crazy things.But market behavior has, until recently, been a different story.But let\u2019s play devil\u2019s advocate here: Does all this Trump chaos matter for the economy, or for the stock market (which isn\u2019t at all the same thing)? At first sight, it\u2019s not all that obvious.And even trade war might not do that much harm, as long as it\u2019s focused mainly on China, which is only one piece of U.S. trade. The really big economic risk was that Trump might break up Nafta, the North American trade agreement: U.S. manufacturing is so deeply integrated with production in Canada and Mexico that this would have been highly disruptive. But he settled for changing the agreement\u2019s name while leaving its structure basically intact, and the remaining risks don\u2019t seem that large.The truth is that most of the time, presidential actions don\u2019t matter much for the economy; short-term economic management is mainly up to the Fed. But when bad things happen, we do need the White House to step up. In 2008 and 2009, it mattered a lot that officials of both the outgoing Bush administration and the incoming Obama administration responded competently and intelligently to the financial crisis.Unfortunately, there\u2019s no reason to expect a comparable degree of competence if something goes wrong again.Now imagine how this administration team might cope with a real economic setback, whatever its source. Would Trump look for solutions or refuse to accept responsibility and focus mainly on blaming other people? Would his Treasury secretary and chief economic advisers coolly analyze the problem and formulate a course of action, or would they respond with a combination of sycophancy to the boss and denials that anything was wrong? What do you think?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When the Police Become Prosecutors", "Date": "2018-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOfficers quietly wield a lot of unchecked prosecutorial power.Ms. Natapoff is a visiting law professor at Harvard Law School.American voters have realized that prosecutors hold the keys to a fairer criminal justice system. In November\u2019s elections, they replaced numerous incumbents with reformers who promised to reduce mass incarceration, its exorbitant costs and its racial disparities. Prosecutors are central to solving these problems because they control two of the most important decisions in the criminal process: who will be charged with a crime and what that criminal charge will be. But in practice they do not decide alone. In the enormous world of misdemeanor processing, the police quietly wield a lot of prosecutorial authority. So for voters seeking change, switching prosecutors is only a partial solution.In hundreds of misdemeanor courts in at least 14 states, police officers can file criminal charges and handle court cases, acting as prosecutor as well as witness and negotiator. People must defend themselves against, or work out plea deals with, the same police officers who arrested them for low-level offenses like shoplifting or trespassing.The police in other states can end up as de facto prosecutors, even without formal charging authority. Prosecutors typically lack the time and resources to screen hundreds of minor arrests, and so most arrests are routinely prosecuted. This lack of initial screening manifests in low declination rates \u2014 the rate at which prosecutors \u201cdecline\u201d arrests and decide not to bring formal criminal charges.In Mecklenburg, N.C., for example, the prosecutorial declination rate for drug offenses was only 4 percent, according to a study by the Vera Institute of Justice. For drug offenses brought against African-American women at the time, it was zero; every single arrest became a formal criminal charge. In Texas, the non-traffic misdemeanor declination rate in municipal court was around 8 percent in 2015. In Alaska, it was less than 4 percent. In jurisdictions with such low declination rates, over 90 percent of arrests convert to criminal charges without much scrutiny; getting arrested is tantamount to being charged with a crime.In places like those, prosecutors are performing the vital gatekeeping role that has earned them such broad discretion. But when prosecutors do not screen thoroughly, the police become accidental prosecutors, deciding, in effect, not only who will be arrested but also who will be charged with a crime.A minor criminal charge can have ruinous consequences. People accused of misdemeanors are under heavy pressure to plead guilty, especially if they are incarcerated and cannot afford bail. Misdemeanor defendants often do not get lawyers and must make crucial decisions without legal advice.While charges are pending, they may lose their jobs, disrupt their child care or risk their immigration status. Even when cases are dismissed, as about one-third of misdemeanor charges eventually are, defendants must still resist pressures to plead guilty, for weeks or even months.If cases are not dismissed, well over 90 percent of defendants will plead guilty. They will then struggle with fines, probation, perhaps jail, and permanent criminal records that can derail their future employment, housing and education. It turns out that simply being arrested and charged with a minor offense is a long and painful step toward being convicted of one.Those initial police decisions are crucial in another way: Arrests determine who will end up in the misdemeanor pipeline. African-Americans make up nearly 30 percent of national misdemeanor arrests although they represent some 12 percent of the population. Marijuana arrests are especially skewed by race; blacks are four times more likely than whites to be arrested for possession, even though the two groups use marijuana at the same rates. In many cities, people of color are disproportionately arrested for jaywalking, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. These racially skewed policing decisions begin an official process that formally criminalizes millions of people of color every year.That enormous misdemeanor process constitutes the bulk of the American criminal system. Thirteen million misdemeanor cases are filed annually \u2014 that\u2019s 80 percent of all state criminal dockets. This is how our criminal system works most of the time, for the most people.There are many ways that the police and prosecutors can improve the misdemeanor system, mostly by shrinking it. The police can deploy low-level arrests less often and in more targeted and strategic ways, as many community policing programs already do. And they can focus on reducing racial disparities. Prosecutors should devote more time and resources to screening misdemeanors so that minor arrests do not become criminal charges so easily and so often. The ultimate aim \u2014 and the thing voters should demand in the next election \u2014 is to ease the flood of misdemeanor arrests and convictions that quietly derails millions of people\u2019s lives every year and that exacerbates some of the worst injustices of our criminal system.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cory Booker Dips a Toe Into New Hampshire as 2020 Decision Nears", "Date": "2018-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMANCHESTER, N.H. \u2014 Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey says he will be deciding about running for president over the holidays. But as he blitzed through New Hampshire on Saturday in a whirlwind of selfies and soaring rhetoric about Americans finding \u201ccommon purpose,\u201d the 49-year-old Democrat sounded less like a candidate in a tentative early audition than one finishing off a dress rehearsal.He chatted up diners in a Nashua coffee shop, speechified to a packed Manchester auditorium, gave sit-down interviews to local news media, met with Democratic influencers and was slated to attend three house parties in different cities across the state.In dark jeans, a checkered blue dress shirt under a blue sweater and Nike hiking boots, Mr. Booker more than looked the part of a New Hampshire primary contender.\u201cThis country has enough hate, enough bigotry, enough anti-Semitism,\u201d he said in 20 minutes of remarks to about 300 party officials and activists in Manchester, the state\u2019s largest city, speaking without notes and without mentioning President Trump. \u201cWhat we need now is courageous actors who call to the conscience of our country a higher moral imagination, who call for a revival of civic grace.\u201dState Representative Peter Schmidt sought out Mr. Booker afterward, calling him \u201creverend\u201d for his impassioned delivery.\u201cCome back again,\u201d Mr. Schmidt urged.\u201cI have a feeling I will,\u201d Mr. Booker replied.New Hampshire Democrats \u2014 who go second in the presidential nominating calendar after Iowans \u2014 said Mr. Booker has been among the most active in courting them ahead of 2020. Raymond Buckley, the state party chairman, pointedly introduced Mr. Booker to the crowd by saying no one this year had raised more money for the state Democratic Party and its candidates than Mr. Booker.\u201cHe\u2019s the best friend New Hampshire Democrats had in 2018,\u201d Mr. Buckley said.At a time when leading Democrats have often defined themselves in opposition to Mr. Trump \u2014 and activists across the country have proudly branded themselves \u201cthe resistance\u201d \u2014 Mr. Booker\u2019s slate of appearances offered an on-the-ground test for his more inclusive brand of politics that at times can feel like a throwback to a bygone era.\u201cYou cannot lead the people if you do not love the people,\u201d Mr. Booker told attendees at a house party in Nashua, where he only made passing mention of Mr. Trump\u2019s name once. \u201cLove is not a soft word,\u201d he added. \u201cIt is hard.\u201dIn a brief interview, Mr. Booker said he understood the desire among some Democrats for a more confrontational and combative tone in the Trump era. \u201cI know there\u2019s a lot of folks who may have an appetite for that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not who I am, and I will continue to try to be as fearlessly authentic as I can.\u201dWill Mr. Booker\u2019s approach work? \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t, it doesn\u2019t,\u201d he said.Mr. Booker has already carried his message to 24 states during the 2018 midterms, including the four that kick off the presidential nominating contest, campaigning for more than 40 candidates and raising more than $7 million for Democratic causes and campaigns, according to his aides. His New Hampshire swing is the last one on the calendar before his self-imposed timeline to make a final decision about running for president.There is certainly interest in Mr. Booker: The fire marshal cut off access to Mr. Booker\u2019s speech at the state party\u2019s celebration on Saturday (though the room did not seem particularly full), sending extra people to a nearby overflow room.Accompanied on Saturday by three aides, Mr. Booker is further along in his New Hampshire outreach than some other would-be candidates. He and his team are reaching out to potential staff, and Mr. Booker has made calls to winners in the midterm elections, which saw Democrats take over both chambers of the State Legislature. Both new legislative leaders got personal calls from Mr. Booker.Still, few are making any commitments in what is expected to be a crowded field of more than a dozen candidates that could include liberal senators from two neighboring states: Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who won the New Hampshire primary in 2016.Mr. Booker has a local political sherpa guiding him to the proper house parties and supplying a steady list of who to call. The guide, Jim Demers, is a New Hampshire lobbyist who was a key early supporter of Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 primary campaign when Mr. Obama was a senator.\u201cI think the Booker approach is effective,\u201d said Jim Donchess, the mayor of Nashua, who met with Mr. Booker on Saturday morning for nearly an hour. \u201cWe need to heal some of the divisions and mistrust.\u201dJoining Mr. Donchess and Mr. Booker over coffee was Cindy Rosenwald, a newly elected state senator to whom Mr. Booker had directed some of his donors to support in 2018. She said she appreciated the two maximum-sized contributions she had received from supporters of Mr. Booker. \u201cIt was totally significant,\u201d she said.Mr. Booker was also in the state in late October, campaigning for some local Democrats shortly before the midterm elections. While in town then, Mr. Booker also had a meet-and-greet dinner with a few dozen local Democratic officials and political brokers at a Manchester restaurant.The dinner turned out to be the same evening as the clinching game of the World Series for the Boston Red Sox. Televisions broadcast the game in the background as the political types lingered with Mr. Booker. Some called it a sign of his 2020 allure that many still attended, though a few did slip away before the final out.Mr. Booker\u2019s formidable social media presence would be a potential advantage in 2020, though his often-packed Instagram feed was conspicuously quiet on Saturday. One woman who ran into Mr. Booker at the Nashua coffee shop said she already followed him on Facebook. \u201cI\u2019ve seen so much of your stuff everywhere,\u201d the woman, Lisa Coffey, told him.When another woman in the coffee shop noted this was not his first trip to the state, he stroked his chin.\u201cYou begin to wonder,\u201d he said with a grin.An earlier version of a picture caption accompanying this article referred incorrectly to Cindy Rosenwald. She is a State Senator in New Hampshire, not a senator-elect.Advertisement"}

Or, more precisely, the Senate majority leader shifted into his signature mode of vigorous inaction.For months, Mr. McConnell had assured reformers that, if a bill emerged with the support of at least 60 members, he would bring it up for a vote. But no sooner had Mr. Trump finished praising the First Step Act than Mr. McConnell began weaseling out of his pledge, clucking about all the pressing business the Senate faced and how there most likely wouldn\u2019t be time to tackle this issue after all.All of which sadly suggests criminal justice reform will soon be deader than disco. To get the bill moving again, Mr. Trump would need to make clear \u2014 to his base and to his Senate leader \u2014 that this issue is important to him.The president could still use a win, especially with Democrats set to take over the House next month. Admittedly, this would call for Mr. Trump displaying greater skill in handling Mr. McConnell than he has thus far managed.

{"Headline": "America Could Lead the Transition to a Digital Currency Reserve", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnother ViewAfter spending decades as the dominant global reserve currency, the dollar\u2019s position is being challenged.The greenback\u2019s share of global central-bank reserves has declined in nine of the past 10 quarters, the International Monetary Fund reported in September. The slide is hardly new: It began a decade ago when European leaders attempted to replace the dollar with a euro-based \u201cbasket\u201d of currencies as the common global reserve.But the United States should not fight against the forces of globalization that challenge the dollar\u2019s reserve-currency status. Instead, it must seize the opportunity to incubate technologies that will enable future digital currencies, which could go on to power a transnational currency \u2014 perhaps the best next option for a future global reserve.Committing to this course would provide a check on attempts to supplant the dollar\u2019s role in the global financial system with other sovereign currencies. It would also put the United States at the heart of a more open and equitable financial system.There are lessons in America\u2019s technological history that should inform future policy relating to digital currencies. More than three decades ago the United States government supported the development of the internet. Doing so unleashed huge economic impact on America that can still be seen today in the successes of the nation\u2019s biggest technology companies. The digital financial revolution that the world is on the cusp of has the potential to be just as significant for job creation and economic development.Blockchain, the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies, could prove to be as important to commerce as email and text messaging were to communications. New financial systems built on it could help connect people around the world who lack access to traditional banking services. And these innovations could be leveraged by developers in much the same way as entrepreneurs built web services on the internet \u2014 from eBay to Facebook \u2014 with the same enormous impact on the American economy.Countries around the world are racing to lead the next revolution in financial technology. While it is clear that the United States and companies like Coinbase were early entrants in this global movement, it is also true that many nations and individuals are jockeying for leadership. There are currently more than 1,400 digital currencies and tokens available, serving a variety of uses. Central banks from China to Sweden to Uruguay are considering issuing their own.America must maintain its leadership role by leading the way on research and development of cryptocurrency technologies \u2014 just as it did in the early days of the internet \u2014 rather than stifling it. And if it does, it could ultimately build dominant cryptocurrency technologies that become the backbone of the 21st Century financial system.Doing so could yield all sorts of wonderful possibilities. In the 21st century when a national market undergoes a major fluctuation, America could enable an alternative currency. It could make it easier for American farmers to sell to foreign customers without the friction of foreign exchange. And its development agencies, like U.S.A.I.D., could \u201cairdrop\u201d cryptocurrencies to hard-hit regions of the world that lack access to banking infrastructure.That the dollar is under pressure as the world\u2019s reserve currency should only lend more urgency to the endeavor, as America should not come to rely on global cryptocurrency technologies that have been developed by other nations. The United States can retain its leadership role in the global financial system \u2014 but only if it nurtures the development of the technologies that will underpin its future.Brian Brooks is the chief legal officer of Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange.Advertisement"}

Damage control will be his first task.Mr. Casta\u00f1eda was foreign minister of Mexico from 2000 to 2003.MEXICO CITY \u2014 Amid nervous financial markets, a buildup of thousands of Honduran migrants in Tijuana eager to enter the United States, pressure from the Trump administration on immigration and doubts over the eventual ratification of the new United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement by the United States Congress, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador will be inaugurated on Saturday as Mexico\u2019s new president.Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador is only the fifth democratically elected president in the country\u2019s history, but he received a broad mandate for change last July. He takes office during a troubled era in relations between Mexico and the United States, ushered in two years ago when Donald Trump entered the White House. The new Mexican leader will have to concentrate on damage control \u2014 because Mr. Trump has done a great deal of damage. The danger is that AMLO, as he is widely known, might well aggravate that damage. He is not well equipped for this challenge.Relations came to such a low point that AMLO\u2019s predecessor, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, didn\u2019t visit Mr. Trump in the United States or meet with him as president in Mexico. This was the first time in the modern history of bilateral relations. Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador has to deal with this situation, and doing so will not be simple.He is restricted from the left by his old-style, chip-on-the-shoulder nationalism, his radical base and the perception in Mexico that the outgoing president kowtowed to Washington all too often. He is pressured from the right by politicians concerned with Mexico\u2019s weakening economy (a battered peso and a wilting stock exchange), its integration with the United States and the country\u2019s vulnerability to any type of Trumpian retaliation for perceived or existing sins.Finally, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s sympathy for the regimes in Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua, given the United States\u2019 animosity toward them, will add more tensions to the relationship. If AMLO and his team had any experience in handling these matters, or if Mr. Trump showed any inclination to back off on trade, immigration and drugs with Mexico, all of these disagreements could be managed, as they have been in the past. Neither of these two conditions exists today.Misguided policies like the cancellation of a new Mexico City airport by AMLO via popular referendum; the authoritarian drift seen in the militarization of Mexican public safety and law enforcement; the sending of American troops to the common border by Mr. Trump, and his insistence on building a wall along the border and recklessly imposing trade sanctions all show just how trigger-happy both leaders can be.The Mexican economy has collapsed at least four times over the past 40 years. It can happen to any country. But not all countries can prevent collapse, or fix it. Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador and Mr. Trump are on their own, together and terribly mismatched. Hoping that everything will work out is perfectly understandable, and perfectly na\u00efve. Troubled times, indeed.Jorge G.

What\u2019s shocking is not just the lurid details and human devastation of his alleged crimes, but the way he was able to use his money to escape serious consequences, thanks in part to Acosta, then Miami\u2019s top federal prosecutor. For reasons that are not entirely clear, Acosta took extraordinary measures to let Epstein \u2014 and, crucially, other unnamed people \u2014 off the hook. Prosecutors seem to have deliberately kept the details of the settlement from Epstein\u2019s victims. Two of them are suing to overturn Epstein\u2019s plea, arguing that it violated the federal Crime Victims\u2019 Rights Act, which requires prosecutors to notify victims of plea negotiations and sentencing. (Some of Epstein\u2019s victims are expected in court for another lawsuit arising from the case, which begins Tuesday.)We don\u2019t know, but one of Epstein\u2019s victims, Virginia Roberts, told The Herald that Epstein didn\u2019t just abuse her himself, he also \u201clent\u201d her out to \u201cpoliticians and academics and royalty.\u201d She claimed in a 2015 affidavit that she\u2019d had sex with both Prince Andrew of Britain \u2014 she included a photograph of them together \u2014 and with one of Epstein\u2019s attorneys, Alan Dershowitz, now best known for his public defenses of Trump. (Dershowitz has said Roberts lied to try to extract money from wealthy men. In 2015, a federal judge, Kenneth A. Marra, struck the allegations from the court record; attorneys for Roberts called the filing a \u201ctactical mistake\u201d and withdrew the allegations.)Had the federal case gone forward, it could have shed an embarrassing spotlight on Epstein\u2019s many famous associates, including Bill Clinton, a frequent passenger on Epstein\u2019s private plane, nicknamed the \u201cLolita Express.\u201dCome January, Democrats will finally be able to investigate the Trump administration, and given all its misdeeds, they\u2019ll have to be selective about which they pursue. But if Acosta is still part of the administration next month, there should be hearings into his handling of the Epstein case. Epstein\u2019s ability to evade justice is of a piece with the elite impunity that Trump pretended to challenge, but actually embodies. Congress can send a message: Time\u2019s up.An earlier version of this column gave an incomplete description of a 2015 affidavit by Victoria Roberts regarding Jeffrey Epstein.

It began and swelled through social media, without organization or a definable agenda, a wave of anger that rapidly swept up grievances from low pay to frustration with politicians of all stripes and on to the disparate demands of groups like ambulance workers or students.The retreat is a dangerous gamble. In the view of the demonstrators, Mr. Philippe and his boss heard their anger only when they started torching cars on Avenue Kl\u00e9ber, not when it smoldered in distant villages. Social media is already buzzing with calls for more. Demands now include Mr. Macron\u2019s resignation and dissolution of the Parliament.Such steps would be big mistakes. Certainly Mr. Macron and his government have to pay much closer heed to the France outside Paris and other big cities, and they need to make far greater efforts to explain their measures and to lower the burden on the many people struggling at the borderline of poverty.But the power of social media to quickly mobilize mass anger, without any mechanism for dialogue or restraint, is a danger to which a liberal democracy cannot succumb. Mr. Macron and the Parliament were democratically elected, and the reforms they have been pursuing, both within France and in the European Union, and on the environmental front, were what they openly promised in those elections and what France needs.Advertisement"}

He was accused in a hearing on Nov. 18 by a military court of talking to the rebel group FARC and of photographing inside a security zone close to President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, the country\u2019s embattled leader, according to the report by Espace Publico.\u201cHe never touched a weapon, never joined in any demonstrations,\u201d his father, Edward Six, said in a telephone interview.\u201cThey don\u2019t have any proof of anything and there hasn\u2019t been a proper trial.\u201dOf the three journalists known to be imprisoned in Venezuela this year, Mr. Six is the only foreign reporter, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. The organization also notes, however, that several foreign reporters have been detained, expelled, or barred from entering the country in recent years.Mr. Six has reported from Venezuela, Colombia, Egypt and Ukraine. But he is largely unknown in his native Germany in part because he writes for a relatively obscure far-right weekly, Junge Freiheit, and the ultraconservative Deutschland-Magazin.While Mr. Mihr, the head of the German chapter of Reporters Without Borders, says that the organization does not approve of Mr. Six\u2019s repeated use of the word \u201cL\u00fcgenpresse,\u201d a Nazi-era term used by far-right groups to delegitimize the mainstream news media, but that his rights as a journalist are still paramount.\u201cBilly Six is a journalist and, like any journalist, has the right to speak freely and without fear of persecution and detention everywhere,\u201d Mr. Mihr wrote in an email exchange.The German consulate in Venezuela is aware of the situation and has been following his case, according to the German foreign ministry.At the time, German news media described Mr. Six as an adventurer and noted that he contributed to Junge Freiheit because it provided him a forum and would publish his reports largely unedited.Advertisement"}

Here are some tips to help you plan your first international trip.Travel is unpredictable, and sometimes that\u2019s a good thing. You spot a humpback whale during your boat tour, for example. Other times, those unpredictable travel moments are utterly aggravating, like when bad weather cancels your flight or the hotel you\u2019ve booked can\u2019t seem to find your reservation.Obviously you want to minimize the frustrating experiences as much as you can. This is especially important if it\u2019s your first time traveling outside of the country and you might not know what to expect. From passports to jet lag, here are a few tips for a smooth first trip abroad.Before using your credit or debit card abroad, call your carrier and place a travel alert on your account (you may also be able to do this on their website). This way, the credit card company won\u2019t mistake your foreign transactions for fraud and freeze your card.This can be tricky if you live in San Francisco and you\u2019re traveling to London, but the closer you can get to your destination time, the better. That might mean going to bed earlier or getting up early, depending on the time zone.Advertisement"}

But success depends on trusting that the leader knows what he\u2019s doing and where he\u2019s going.Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who generally supports Mr. Trump, said he and others in the national security establishment were \u201cblindsided\u201d by the announcement. He called for congressional hearings on the decision.There was no attempt to use the leverage of an American withdrawal to achieve any specific political or military goal.No one wants American troops deployed in a war zone longer than necessary. But there is no indication that Mr. Trump has thought through the consequences of a precipitous withdrawal, including allowing ISIS forces to regroup and create another crisis that would draw the United States back into the region.Among the biggest losers are likely to be the Kurdish troops that the United States has equipped and relied on to fight the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, considers many of the Kurds to be terrorists bent on destroying his country. In recent days he has vowed to launch a new offensive against them in the Syrian border region. Mr. Trump discussed his withdrawal decision in a telephone call with Mr. Erdogan on Friday.Decisions of such consequence normally are thoroughly vetted by a president\u2019s national security advisers. But congressional lawmakers said there were no signs that any process was followed, and a senior White House official, refusing to discuss internal deliberations, said Wednesday, \u201cThe issue here is the president made a decision.\u201dThat would be the worst rationale for a commander in chief sworn to protect the nation and to honor the men and women who serve in uniform.Advertisement"}

The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.But the fact is that most of the world \u2014 and most Japanese \u2014 have moved on from the days when killing whales was deemed an acceptable pursuit. Like shooting elephants or rhinoceroses for trophies, cruelly killing animals now shown to possess a high level of intelligence on the pretense that the practice has a cultural importance is untenable. Japan, moreover, has not said how many whales it plans to catch in its waters, or what impact this might have on global whale populations.In the end, the Japanese government\u2019s decision to quit the commission is no more than a gambit by nationalist politicians to posture as defenders of a traditional way of life, akin to President Trump\u2019s defense of coal mining. They know it won\u2019t bring back an industry that has had its day, or a diet that nobody needs any longer.Withdrawing from the whaling commission for short-term political gain is a dangerous and foolish move, especially for an advanced country like Japan that has generally supported multilateral efforts on the environment. The commission is not a Western cultural imposition, as some Japanese nationalists might portray it, but the expression of a universal obligation to manage dwindling resources and protect the planet, including the magnificent giants of the oceans.Mr. Trump\u2019s cavalier rejection of the Paris climate treaty and dismissive attitude to most other international treaties, alliances and trade accords have done incalculable damage to the postwar international order.

{"Headline": "Where Charity and Love Prevail", "Date": "2018-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChristians, it\u2019s time to rethink the whole notion of tithing.Contributing Opinion WriterNASHVILLE \u2014 There\u2019s a meme about charitable giving that makes the rounds in Southern social media circles from time to time. It\u2019s a map of United States counties color-coded by charitable giving, and it purports to demonstrate that people living in red states give a greater percentage of their income to charity than people living in blue states. The caption beneath the map reads, \u201cThose heartless conservatives \u2014 am I right?\u201dThese are figures that Southerners, accustomed to being thought selfish and cruel by the rest of the country, will happily create a meme to promote.There are many problems with a map like this, but the biggest is that it\u2019s based on the filings of taxpayers who itemize deductions. The vast majority of American taxpayers \u2014 some 70 percent \u2014 don\u2019t itemize anyway, so there\u2019s really no way to know how many people actually make charitable donations and how much they give when they do. Even so, it has become a cultural commonplace: People in red states are more generous than everyone else.In truth, we can\u2019t possibly know which region of this troubled country is populated by the most generous people. And it wouldn\u2019t matter in the least if we could. What does matter is that we think these statistics tell us something about who we are, and my brothers and sisters in the Bible Belt still believe we\u2019re the most generous people in the country.But in terms of charitable donations, red-state generosity actually looks more like regular old tithing than like what we traditionally think of as charity. \u201cThe generosity ranking changes when religion is taken out of the picture,\u201d according to the 2013 Chronicle of Philanthropy report. \u201cPeople in the Northeast give the most, providing 1.4 percent of their discretionary income to secular charities, compared with those in the South, who give 0.9 percent.\u201d In other words, when Southerners itemize their tax donations, what they\u2019re mainly giving money to are their own churches.For the I.R.S., there\u2019s no distinction between charitable donations to a church and charitable donations to an arts nonprofit and charitable donations to an organization that helps communities ravaged by fire or famine or hurricane or disease. From a moral standpoint, however, some charities clearly do make a bigger difference than others. And if part of your identity stems from the idea of yourself as a generous person, it\u2019s worth considering that difference.\u201cI was hungry and you gave me food,\u201d Jesus taught his disciples. \u201cI was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.\u201d When the disciples objected that they had done no such thing, Jesus was very clear about his relationship to people who are suffering. \u201cTruly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.\u201dThat\u2019s why many Christian churches work hard to alleviate suffering, and member donations certainly underwrite those efforts. But outreach to the needy represents only a small portion of most church budgets. And there are other aid organizations whose sole purpose is to alleviate misery in all its guises \u2014 suffering caused by poverty, illness, abuse, natural disaster, cultural upheaval, climate change. (In the context of a suffering planet, an organization like the Natural Resources Defense Council can surely be seen as a kind of global Doctors Without Borders.) Aside from all the usual satisfactions of giving, and they are many, the way you know you\u2019re donating to a true charity is that it doesn\u2019t benefit you personally.I\u2019m not saying that people should pass an empty collection plate down the pew. I\u2019m saying that if those of us who are living in red states want to earn the right to call ourselves the most generous people in America, we\u2019ll need to rethink the whole nature of tithing.While we\u2019re setting aside money to support our churches, we\u2019ll need to set aside even more for Doctors Without Borders, so it can bring medical care to war-torn areas of the world. We\u2019ll need to set aside even more for the International Rescue Committee, so it can care for displaced people around the globe. We\u2019ll need to set aside even more for AmeriCares and Direct Relief, so they can help victims of natural disasters. We\u2019ll need to set aside even more for the local food bank, so it can feed our hungry neighbors.New changes to the United States tax code mean that only about 10 percent of taxpayers will itemize their deductions this year, and that change is widely expected to cause charitable donations to drop by $16 billion to $17 billion. That\u2019s a dramatic \u2014 and traumatic \u2014 reduction in aid exactly when more and more people find themselves in tremendous need. But it won\u2019t happen if we\u2019re thinking about charity the right way: not as a tithe or as tax benefit but as a lifeline for others.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "I Dreaded Winter Until My Newborn Taught Me to Embrace It", "Date": "2018-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTiesThose long, dark, cold winter nights I had feared more than childbirth itself became something I hadn\u2019t known a night could be: a haven. A shelter.For most of my adult life, I dreaded \u2014 absolutely dreaded \u2014 winter. In that season, my own darkness multiplied and surged forth like cockroaches waiting for the lights to go out. Whatever deep-seated fears \u2014 illnesses, accidents, loved ones dying \u2014 I\u2019d managed to keep at bay in the brighter months emerged hungry and atomic-blast-proof with the 5 p.m. twilight.Sometimes, seven or eight months pregnant, I would wake in the night to use the bathroom and would peer through the slats in the blinds to the black sky outside, the stars sharp and cold through the trees. When the baby was born, those trees would be bare. When the baby was born, that blackness would be colder. I felt a terrible anticipatory loneliness in those moments. I knew what it was like to be isolated in my own head. Then my son was born, and what shocked me most \u2014 more than the surprising goriness of my body\u2019s healing, more than the strange sounds newborns make, more than the ferocity of my nursing-mother appetite \u2014 were the nights. Those long, dark, cold winter nights I had feared more than childbirth itself. They became something I hadn\u2019t known a night could be: a haven. A shelter. When our son finally fell asleep, my husband and I would go to bed ourselves, the silence of our house suddenly sacred, fragile as blown glass. And when, after an hour or two, our son would wake again and cry, I\u2019d hold him in his soft rocking chair, nurse him there in the nightlight\u2019s glow. Sometimes I\u2019d surf the internet on my phone, feeling a companionable affection for anyone posting on Facebook at 3 a.m.; sometimes I\u2019d just sit there, half in dreams. My son would fall asleep, and I\u2019d know I should try to get some more sleep myself, but often I\u2019d hold him a little longer, the heavy sleeping weight of him, the warmth of him in his soft flannel zippered pajamas against the chill of the January night. The silence a globe around us.I stopped minding when the sun dropped below the trees at 5 p.m. I was exhausted by then, and it felt right that the day should be ending. And when the full dark came and wrapped itself around our house, it felt like a cave, safe and ancient. I felt my animal self stir and settle. The night let me burrow deep in my new life. The night unthreaded me from human time, human brain. There was a baby, and there was my body, and there was food and shelter and the warmth of the other bodies in this shelter. There were cockroaches sometimes, too, but I couldn\u2019t be bothered with them, not for long. I was a bear, a bobcat, a wolf. I was large and furred. I was going on instinct. When something crawled across me, I let it, then got back to tending. I was busy with the work of winter.My anxiety didn\u2019t disappear, of course. There was an abundance of it (suffocation, choking, a new set of worries \u2014 torticollis, R.S.V., infant botulism \u2014 in which I quickly became expert), and there still is. I lose hours to it sometimes, disappear down the rabbit hole as I always have. But since my son\u2019s birth, nearly a decade ago now, I haven\u2019t once dreaded the end of Daylight Saving Time, that autumn date that confiscates 60 minutes of gold-light evening. Now when I see it approaching on the calendar, I feel a little ping of glad anticipation. These days, winter means an excuse to stay in. It means a harking back to those early weeks. It means \u2014 unbelievably \u2014 comfort. Winter is dark, but now it\u2019s a darkness I want to climb inside.One evening that first February of my son\u2019s life, it snowed, unusual for Mississippi. At 1 a.m. I held my son in his rocker. Outside, the moonlight and streetlights on the snow turned the sky a glowy gray orange. The neighborhood was silent, blanketed in its unexpected whiteness. It was the witching hour again. And I\u2019d been right: It was not a time for humans. It was a time for my son and me, two animals warm against the cold world outside. And it was a time for that world, too deep in the work of winter to pay us any mind.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Your Tax Dollars Help Starve Children", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe famine in Yemen could become the worst the world has seen in a generation.ADEN, Yemen \u2014 He is an 8-year-old boy who is starving and has limbs like sticks, but Yaqoob Walid doesn\u2019t cry or complain. He gazes stolidly ahead, tuning out everything, for in late stages of starvation the human body focuses every calorie simply on keeping the organs functioning.Yaqoob arrived unconscious at Al Sadaqa Hospital here, weighing just over 30 pounds. He has suffered complications, and doctors say that it is unclear he will survive and that if he does he may suffer permanent brain damage.\u201cThe risk of a major catastrophe is very high,\u201d Mark Lowcock, the United Nations humanitarian chief, told me. \u201cIn the worst case, what we have in Yemen now has the potential to be worse than anything any professional in this field has seen during their working lives.\u201dBoth the Obama and Trump administrations have supported the Saudi war in Yemen with a military partnership, arms sales, intelligence sharing and until recently air-to-air refueling. The United States is thus complicit in what some human rights experts believe are war crimes.The bottom line: Our tax dollars are going to starve children.After witnessing the human toll and interviewing officials on both sides, including the president of the Houthi rebels who control much of Yemen, I find the American and Saudi role in this conflict to be unconscionable. The Houthis are repressive and untrustworthy, but this is not a reason to bomb and starve Yemeni children.What is most infuriating is that the hunger is caused not by drought or extreme weather, but by cynical and failed policies in Riyadh and Washington. The starvation does not seem to be an accidental byproduct of war, but rather a weapon in it. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, backed by the United States, are trying to inflict pain to gain leverage over and destabilize the Houthi rebels. The reason: The Houthis are allied with Iran.The governments of Saudi Arabia and the United States don\u2019t want you to see pictures like Yaqoob\u2019s or reflect on the suffering in Yemen. The Saudis impose a partial blockade on Houthi areas, banning commercial flights and barring journalists from special United Nations planes there. I\u2019ve been trying for more than two years to get through the Saudi blockade, and I finally was able to by tagging onto Lowcock\u2019s United Nations delegation.After a major famine, there is always soul-searching about how the world could have allowed this to happen. What\u2019s needed this time is not soul-searching a few years from now, but action today to end the war and prevent a cataclysm.Yaqoob was especially vulnerable. He is the second of eight children in a poor household with a father who has mental health problems and can\u2019t work steadily. Moreover, the father, like many Yemenis, chews qat \u2014 a narcotic leaf that is very widely used in Yemen and offers an easy high. This consumes about $1 a day, reducing the budget available for food. The family sold some land to pay for Yaqoob\u2019s care, so its situation is now even more precarious.A few rooms down from Yaqoob was Fawaz Abdullah, 18 months old, his skin mottled and discolored with sores. Fawaz is so malnourished that he has never been able to walk or say more than \u201cMa\u201d or \u201cBa.\u201d\u201cI used to be able to buy whatever I wanted, including meat and fish,\u201d she told me. Since fleeing, she said, war-induced poverty has meant that she hasn\u2019t been able to buy a single fish or egg \u2014 and that is why Fawaz suffers severe protein deficiency.\u201cThey asked me to buy milk for Fawaz, but we can\u2019t afford it now,\u201d she said.We think of war casualties as men with their legs blown off. But in Yemen the most common war casualties are children like Fawaz who suffer malnutrition.\u201cThese children are the future of Yemen,\u201d Dr. Aida Hussein, a nutrition specialist, told me, looking at Fawaz. \u201cHe will be stunted. How will he do in school?\u201dIn the capital, Sana, I met a child who was suffering both malnutrition and cholera. The boy was Saddam Hussein (he was named for the Iraqi leader), eight years old, and the parents repeat the mantra I hear from everyone: Life is much worse now because of the war.\u201cWe don\u2019t know what we will eat tomorrow,\u201d Saddam\u2019s mother told me.Yemen began to disintegrate in the aftermath of the Arab Spring, and then the Houthis, a traditional clan in the north, swept down on Sana and seized much of the country. The Houthis follow Zaydi Islam, which is related to the Shiite branch dominant in Iran, and the Saudis and some Americans see them as Iranian stooges.In some ways, the Houthis have been successful. They have imposed order and crushed Al Qaeda and the Islamic State in the parts of Yemen they control, and in Sana I felt secure and didn\u2019t fear kidnapping.However, the Houthis operate a police state and are hostile to uncovered women, gays and anyone bold enough to criticize them. They recruit child soldiers from the age of about 12 (the Saudi- and American-backed forces wait until boys are about 15), interfere with food aid, and have engaged in torture and attacks on civilians.The foreign minister on the Houthi side is Hisham Sharaf Abdalla, a congenial American-educated official.After our conversation, he brought me over to his desk and showed me his assault rifle and two handguns. \u201cWhen I was in the U.S., I was a member of the N.R.A.,\u201d he told me. \u201cI would like to have an N.R.A. chapter in Yemen.\u201dMr. Sharaf talks a good game but is not himself a Houthi, just an ally, so I wondered if he was a figurehead trotted out to impress foreigners. Later I interviewed a man whose power is unquestioned: Muhammad Ali al-Houthi, the president of the Supreme Revolutionary Committee. As his name signifies, he is a member of the Houthi clan.An aide picked me up and ferried me to him, for President Houthi changes locations daily to avoid being bombed by the Saudis. President Houthi, a large, confident man with a traditional dagger at his belly, was friendly to me but also suspicious of the United States and full of conspiracy theories. He suggested that Washington was secretly arming Al Qaeda and that the United States was calling the shots for Saudi Arabia in Yemen, at the behest of Israel.Still, he said that he wanted peace and that although the Houthis have fired missiles at Saudi Arabia, his side would pose no threat to Saudi Arabia if the Saudis would only end their assault on Yemen.\u201cThere\u2019s no need for enmity with the United States,\u201d he told me in Arabic, and that seemed a message he wanted me to convey to Washington and the American people.I asked President Houthi about the sarkha, the group\u2019s slogan: \u201cGod is great! Death to America! Death to Israel! Curses on the Jews! Victory to Islam!\u201d That didn\u2019t seem so friendly, I said.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing against the American people,\u201d he replied. \u201cIt\u2019s directed toward the system.\u201dWhen I asked about Saudi and American suggestions that the Houthis are Iranian pawns, he laughed.\u201cThat\u2019s just propaganda,\u201d he said. \u201cI ask you: Have you ever seen one Iranian in Yemen? Do we speak Farsi?\u201d This was all a trick, he said, analogous to the allegations of weapons of mass destruction used to justify war with Iraq.While the Houthis are called \u201crebels,\u201d they clearly rule their territory. In contrast, the Saudi- and American-backed \u201cinternationally recognized government\u201d of Yemen is a shell that controls almost no territory \u2014 hence it is based in Riyadh. The \u201cpresident\u201d of this exile government, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, is said to be gravely ill, and when he is gone it will be even more difficult to sustain the fiction that this is a real government.More broadly, I don\u2019t see any hint of a Saudi or American strategy. There\u2019s little sign that bombing and starvation will actually dislodge the Houthis, while the Saudi military action and resulting chaos has benefited the Yemeni branches of Al Qaeda and the Islamic State. In that sense, America\u2019s conduct in Yemen has hurt our own national security.In one sign of the ineffectiveness of the Western-backed government, the hunger is now as severe in its areas as in the rebel-held north. I saw worse starvation in Aden, the lovely seaside city in the south that is nominally run by the internationally recognized government, than in Houthi-controlled Sana.And while I felt reasonably secure in Houthi-controlled areas, I was perpetually nervous in Aden. Abductions and murders occur regularly there, and my guesthouse offered not a mint on the pillow, but a bulletproof vest; at night, sleep was interrupted by nearby fighting among unknown gunmen.What limited order exists in Aden is provided by soldiers from the United Arab Emirates and allied militias, and I worry that the U.A.E. is getting fed up with the war and may pull them out without alternative arrangements for security. If that happens, Aden may soon plunge into Somalia-like chaos.Mohamed Zemam, the governor of the central bank, believes that there are ways to shore up the economy and prevent starvation. But he cautions that the risk of another Somalia is real, and he estimates that there may be two million Yemenis in one fighting force or another.\u201cWhat they have is the way of the gun,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t solve that, we will have problems for 100 years.\u201dAnother danger is that the Saudi coalition will press ahead so that fighting closes the port of Hudaydah, through which most food and fuel come.I stopped in Saudi Arabia to speak to senior officials there about Yemen, and we had some tough exchanges. I showed them photos on my phone of starving children, and they said that this was unfortunate and undesired. \u201cWe are not devils,\u201d one said indignantly. They insisted that they would welcome peace \u2014 but that they must confront the Houthis.\u201cThe most important thing for us is national security,\u201d the Saudi ambassador to Yemen, Mohammed Al-Jabir, told me. Dr. Abdullah Al Rabeeah, an adviser to the royal court and director of a fund that provides aid to Yemen, told me that Saudis don\u2019t want to see hunger in Yemen but added: \u201cWe will continue to do what it takes to fight terrorism. It\u2019s not an easy decision.\u201dSaudi and U.A.E. officials note that they provide an enormous amount of humanitarian aid to Yemen. This is true, and it mitigates the suffering there. But it\u2019s difficult to give the Saudis much credit for relieving the suffering of a country that they are bombing and starving.To avert a catastrophe in Yemen, the world needs to provide more humanitarian aid. But above all, the war has to end.That solution will entail strong American backing for a difficult United Nations-backed peace process involving Yemeni factions and outsiders, aiming for a measure of power sharing. This diplomatic process requires engaging the Houthis, not just bombing them. It also means a cease-fire and pressure on all sides to ensure humanitarian access and the passage of food and fuel. The best leverage America has to make the Saudis part of the solution is to suspend arms sales to Riyadh so long as the Saudis continue the war.In conference rooms in Riyadh and Washington, officials simply don\u2019t fathom the human toll of their policies.In a makeshift camp for displaced people in Aden, I met a couple who lost two daughters \u2014 Bayan, 11, and Bonyan, 8 \u2014 in a bombing in a crowded market.\u201cI heard the bomb and I went running after them,\u201d the dad, Ahmed Abdullah, told me with an ache in his voice. \u201cThey were dead. One had her skull burst open, and the other had no arms or legs left.\u201dAnother son died of fever when the family could not afford to take the boy to a hospital. There are several other children, and none of them are going to school any more; a 10-year-old daughter, Baraa, who is next in line to be married, couldn\u2019t tell me what seven plus eight equals.A bit hesitantly, I told Ahmed that I thought that my country, America, had probably provided the bomb that had killed his daughters. He was not angry, just resigned.\u201cI am not an educated person,\u201d he told me earnestly. \u201cI am a simple parent.\u201d And then he offered more wisdom than I heard from the sophisticated policy architects in America and Saudi Arabia: \u201cMy message is that I want the war to stop.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But Most of Us Don\u2019t Know a Cow\u2019s Normal Size.", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf you thought Knickers was a once-in-a-lifetime giant, you may not be spending enough time with cattle. I was surrounded by Knickers knockoffs, or Knickers cousins, or at least other giant Holsteins. It reminded me of an old video game called Diablo, which had a secret cow level. In it, quickly multiplying bipedal Holsteins surrounded and killed your avatar. That\u2019s about as close as most of us get to Holsteins, which actually walk on all four legs and are very gentle. We all kind of know that, which is why the secret cow level was so weird and disturbing, and perhaps why Gary Larson put them in so many cartoons. That and the guilt so many people feel about their ignorance of the lives of the animals that end up on sesame seed buns.Not only do we eat them, we know almost nothing about them, which no doubt has something to do with why we eat them. But we don\u2019t even know how big they are anymore.Enter Knickers. Now that his meme is waning, it seems that we should all reflect on the simple fact that most of us had no idea how big cattle actually are, how big Holsteins are, and certainly not even an inkling of how big Holstein steers are, and what they do for a living, while they are living. The short answer is that they mostly don\u2019t live past 15 months, because Holsteins are mostly dairy cows. There is no such thing as a dairy steer.When I was invited to come to the shelter and put Knickers in some perspective, an old song by an old folk singer came to mind, and I heard David Bromberg\u2019s twangy whine insisting, \u201cStand beside me when you measure my size.\u201d So I did.At the shelter here, I stood amid three steers, Orlando, Milbank and Lawrence, all of which reached about 6-foot-4 at the shoulder and weighed 3,000 pounds.Sam, of similar size, was at another barn. And the other Holsteins in the barn, some of whose ears I scratched, were not more than a few inches shorter. What are they? Merely enormous?Oh, and there was Tweed, at 6-foot-8. I actually drove to the shelter to see him, but he had some skeletal abnormalities so I wasn\u2019t sure how to count him if we were judging for the record. But the point that Susie Coston, the national shelter director for Farm Sanctuary, wanted to make wasn\u2019t that her cattle could beat out Knickers for some imaginary large animal gold medal.The point, she said, was \u201cthat\u2019s the norm.\u201d We just don\u2019t see them. Or, as Tara Hess, the shelter manager at Watkins Glen, said, \u201cWe don\u2019t actually know what\u2019s normal.\u201dMs. Hess introduced me to the Holsteins and to Rory the pig and a few chickens, a tiny sampling of the cattle, goats, sheep, ducks, geese, chickens and turkeys that live here. All of them are bigger than the animals raised for food, which are slaughtered young. Among the chickens at the shelter, for instance, is an 18-pound broiler, Ms. Hess said. Broilers are usually slaughtered around eight weeks of age. This one, somehow, happened to grow up.Standing next to the steers was, above all, disturbing. I thought of hamburgers past, as pretty much every nonvegetarian who visits must. And I thought of such vast animals being so inconsequential to the industry that bred them. And I thought about Gary Larson cartoons. By the way, if you think Gary Larson embellished on cow personality, or that cattle would never surround you as they did in Diablo, Ms. Hess said that the idea that cattle have no personality is completely wrong.Not only are they all different \u2014 some like to be scratched, some like you to just back off \u2014 \u201cThey are fiercely loyal to each other.\u201dWhen one dies, she says, sometimes they won\u2019t let you near the dead animal. They surround the corpse and bellow in what she said is mourning.\u201cThey\u2019ll even take out the veterinarian\u2019s car,\u201d she said.And, in case you haven\u2019t stood next to one recently, the Holsteins are really, really big.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "If America Had a Parliament", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat would its political parties look like? And what does the answer say about where the two parties stand today?Contributing Opinion WriterIt\u2019s been said in recent years that the American system of government is coming to resemble a parliamentary system, characterized by political parties that operate with much stricter ideological discipline than we\u2019ve been accustomed to.With that in mind, and contemplating the Democrats\u2019 return to power in the House of Representatives, here\u2019s a little thought experiment. Suppose we did have a parliamentary system. How many political parties would we have? And what can this thought experiment tell us about the nature of our two parties and the dysfunction we see daily?For present purposes, let\u2019s just imagine that we had a pure parliamentary system in which we elected our representatives by proportional representation, so that if a minor party\u2019s candidates got 4 percent of the legislative votes, they\u2019d win 4 percent of the seats. What might our party alignment look like?A number of mainstream liberals would find themselves torn between these two parties, but they\u2019d have to choose one or the other, as there would be no room for three big parties of the left. I suspect many might go back and forth, depending on the issues of the moment and whom each party chose as its leader.One can envision maybe some other small parties \u2014 a party organized around gun control, say. But that would probably be the basic lineup on the broad left. Now, what about the right?One question here is whether the more avowedly Christian evangelical portion of this coalition would branch off and form its own party to place more emphasis on social issues. History tends to suggest, though, that the forces of the right hold together for strategic purposes, while the forces of the left do not. On the right, at least in America, they lean toward emphasizing the things they agree on, while on the left, they elevate the disagreements. (It\u2019s a long story.)As on the left, there might be a few offshoot parties. There might be a Second Amendment party; there might even be a white supremacist party, which rejected the cleansing euphemisms that most racists have learned to adopt. But these would be minuscule, rarely winning a single seat.Now, let\u2019s look back over this list. If I\u2019m right, the Democrats would split into four parties, and the Republicans into two, although the second one would be tiny. In other words: The Trump-era Republican Party already is in essence a parliamentary party. This will be especially so in the next Congress, given the retirements of some of the last Republicans who could plausibly be called moderates (Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania) and the defeat of others (Mike Coffman of Colorado).The Democrats, however, are an unruly bunch. There\u2019s a lot they agree on in terms of broad principles \u2014 doing something about climate change, raising wages, expanding health care. But boy do they disagree on how to go about doing them. Some of these fights will inevitably define the 116th Congress. Medicare for All provides a perfect example. There are going to be perhaps 235 Democrats in the new Congress, and just over half that number has co-sponsored the Medicare for All bill. The other near-half is against.Indeed, the Democrats\u2019 battles aren\u2019t even limited to being between its parliamentary factions. Ms. Pelosi has already survived two mutinies, both emanating from within Party One!The upshot of all this?

{"Headline": "Would Human Extinction Be a Tragedy?", "Date": "2018-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHE STONEOur species possesses inherent value, but we are devastating the earth and causing unimaginable animal suffering. Mr. May is a professor of philosophy at Clemson University.[Never be uninteresting. Read the most thought-provoking, delightful and raw stories from The New York Times Opinion section.]To make that claim less puzzling, let me say a word about tragedy. In theater, the tragic character is often someone who commits a wrong, usually a significant one, but with whom we feel sympathy in their descent. Here Sophocles\u2019s Oedipus, Shakespeare\u2019s Lear, and Arthur Miller\u2019s Willy Loman might stand as examples. In this case, the tragic character is humanity. It is humanity that is committing a wrong, a wrong whose elimination would likely require the elimination of the species, but with whom we might be sympathetic nonetheless for reasons I discuss in a moment.Humanity, then, is the source of devastation of the lives of conscious animals on a scale that is difficult to comprehend.If this were all to the story there would be no tragedy. The elimination of the human species would be a good thing, full stop. But there is more to the story. Human beings bring things to the planet that other animals cannot. For example, we bring an advanced level of reason that can experience wonder at the world in a way that is foreign to most if not all other animals. We create art of various kinds: literature, music and painting among them. We engage in sciences that seek to understand the universe and our place in it. Were our species to go extinct, all of that would be lost.Now there might be those on the more jaded side who would argue that if we went extinct there would be no loss, because there would be no one for whom it would be a loss not to have access to those things. I think this objection misunderstands our relation to these practices. We appreciate and often participate in such practices because we believe they are good to be involved in, because we find them to be worthwhile. It is the goodness of the practices and the experiences that draw us. Therefore, it would be a loss to the world if those practices and experiences ceased to exist.Let\u2019s turn, then, and take the question from the other side, the side of those who think that human extinction would be both a tragedy and overall a bad thing. Doesn\u2019t the existence of those practices outweigh the harm we bring to the environment and the animals within it? Don\u2019t they justify the continued existence of our species, even granting the suffering we bring to so many nonhuman lives?So, then, how much suffering and death of nonhuman life would we be willing to countenance to save Shakespeare, our sciences and so forth? Unless we believe there is such a profound moral gap between the status of human and nonhuman animals, whatever reasonable answer we come up with will be well surpassed by the harm and suffering we inflict upon animals. There is just too much torment wreaked upon too many animals and too certain a prospect that this is going to continue and probably increase; it would overwhelm anything we might place on the other side of the ledger. Moreover, those among us who believe that there is such a gap should perhaps become more familiar with the richness of lives of many of our conscious fellow creatures. Our own science is revealing that richness to us, ironically giving us a reason to eliminate it along with our own continued existence.One might ask here whether, given this view, it would also be a good thing for those of us who are currently here to end our lives in order to prevent further animal suffering. Although I do not have a final answer to this question, we should recognize that the case of future humans is very different from the case of currently existing humans. To demand of currently existing humans that they should end their lives would introduce significant suffering among those who have much to lose by dying. In contrast, preventing future humans from existing does not introduce such suffering, since those human beings will not exist and therefore not have lives to sacrifice. The two situations, then, are not analogous.It may well be, then, that the extinction of humanity would make the world better off and yet would be a tragedy. I don\u2019t want to say this for sure, since the issue is quite complex. But it certainly seems a live possibility, and that by itself disturbs me.There is one more tragic aspect to all of this. In many dramatic tragedies, the suffering of the protagonist is brought about through his or her own actions. It is Oedipus\u2019s killing of his father that starts the train of events that leads to his tragic realization; and it is Lear\u2019s highhandedness toward his daughter Cordelia that leads to his demise. It may also turn out that it is through our own actions that we human beings bring about our extinction, or at least something near it, contributing through our practices to our own tragic end.

{"Headline": "Putin\u2019s Keystone Spies", "Date": "2018-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe once-terrifying Russian military intelligence agency has been so sloppy and prone to fumbling that you have to ask: Why does a strongman brought up in the K.G.B. put up with it?Ms. Latynina is a Russian journalist who has been a visiting expert at the Kennan Institute.But earlier this year, in Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia, this grandiose image of the Great Evil was forever destroyed in a Chernobyl-scale meltdown experienced by the G.R.U. in the wake of the British indictment of two G.R.U. hit men, Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, who bungled an attempt to poison their former colleague Sergei Skripal and his daughter.The two intended killers were no James Bonds. They were clowns. Murderous, for sure. But clowns nevertheless.After all, such botches were nothing new. \u201cSpying is one of the most important jobs in the world,\u201d President Putin proclaimed recently. But if he really thinks it\u2019s so important, why does he put up with such sloppy spycraft?The easy answer is: because there\u2019s no efficient state machinery. The state apparatus is customized for graft, ineptitude and corruption. Spies are no exception.Then why doesn\u2019t he clean up the apparatus?The blunt answer is: because he is afraid to. An efficient military could stage a coup against him. So inefficiency is a price Mr. Putin will pay.And when did the sloppiness start?The first public poisoning we know about \u2014 apparently with dioxin \u2014 was the attempt on Sept. 5, 2004, to kill Viktor Yushchenko, a candidate opposing a pro-Kremlin favorite in a Ukrainian presidential election. He recovered and won the presidency.But the attacks were not always successes. The agents blew up an old pipeline, mistaking it for a new one. Instead of blowing up a wall of the American Embassy, they blew up an adjacent wall. When a bomb set to blow up a railway bridge on Oct. 2, 2010, didn\u2019t go off, the agent responsible for the attack tricked his handlers by claiming, incredibly, that the Georgians were hushing up an explosion. To check his story, Major Borisov\u2019s deputy called a European Union monitoring mission in Georgia with profuse offers of help, all but admitting the provenance of the device. Five days later, it was discovered intact, completing the major\u2019s humiliation.Why is all this history important? Because the timing hints at the motivation behind all of this skulduggery. The Yushchenko poisoning occurred on Sept. 5, 2004. The attacks on Georgia started a week later \u2014 in the wake of \u201ccolor\u201d revolutions for democracy in Ukraine and Georgia, and also during the American-led war in Iraq. When the color revolutions swept through Georgia and Ukraine the next year, Mr. Putin \u2014 then a 51-year-old ex-K.G.B. lieutenant colonel \u2014 acted as if they were the result not of political mistakes, miscalculations and the inability of corrupt governments to contain discontent in those former Soviet republics.No, he apparently thought, all of this was one nefarious plot hatched in Washington to encircle Russia deep in its historical sphere of influence. Americans had smiled when they persuaded him in 2002 to accept Lithuania and Poland as new NATO members, and all the time they were just waiting to plant a dagger into his back.We need to understand that in the Kremlin\u2019s warped worldview, the Yushchenko poisoning or the Georgian explosions were not attacks, but payback. To the Kremlin, Mr. Yushchenko was a United States agent, simply because he had an American wife who worked for the United States Treasury and whom he had met by chance on a plane. It seems never to have occurred to Mr. Putin\u2019s spymaster that Russia was losing influence because of its own actions. Which leads to a final question: Why is Mr. Putin doing all this?The answer is obvious: because he thinks he has no other choice \u2014 that Americans, not Russians, are the aggressors, and he\u2019s just striking back. And he can\u2019t renounce this view. It would be tantamount to renouncing his vision of himself as a powerful leader who wants to Make Russia Great Again. He\u2019d have to acknowledge the truths that he, not America, is turning Russia into a third-world country hemorrhaging its smartest brains, with a failing economy and no chips with which to bargain with the rest of the world.So more of the same is to follow, and God help us all.Yulia Latynina is a Russian journalist with Echo of Moscow and Novaya Gazeta, and is a recipient of the Defender of Freedom Award from the United States State Department.Advertisement"}

Both women had been studying at the same school in Norway to become tour guides.Prime Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen of Denmark said on Thursday that the killings might be \u201cpolitically motivated, and thereby an act of terror.\u201d He added that \u201cthere are still dark forces that want to fight our values\u201d and that \u201cwe must not give in.\u201d\u201cWhat should have been a holiday trip turned into a nightmare,\u201d Mr. Rasmussen said. He vowed to do everything possible to solve the crime.A video posted on social media purported to show one of the victims screaming while a man cut her neck with a knife. The Danish Security and Intelligence Service said it was working to authenticate the video.In the statement, the intelligence service said it was an \u201cunusually gruesome\u201d case: \u201cThe video and preliminary investigation according to the Moroccan authorities indicate that the killings may be related to the terrorist organization Islamic State.\u201dThe video, which was shared on Twitter, showed the men vowing fealty to the group\u2019s leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and saying that they \u201ccannot remain seated, witnessing the destruction caused by Crusader planes,\u201d terminology typically used by the group to refer to Western airstrikes in Iraq and Syria.Prime Minister Erna Solberg of Norway called the killings \u201ca senseless attack,\u201d adding that the case \u201cemphasizes the importance of combating violent extremism.\u201d She said that Norway would assist the Moroccan authorities in their investigation.The deaths have shocked Morocco, a popular tourist destination where attacks on foreigners are extremely rare. But the country has battled Islamic extremism for years, and thousands of Moroccans have joined the Islamic State group, also known as ISIS. The last terrorist attack happened in Marrakesh in 2011, when a bomb attack in a cafe killed 17 people, including 11 Europeans.Abdellah Rami, a Moroccan expert on Islamist movements, said that if the terrorism link were to be verified, it would be the first terrorist attack outside Morocco\u2019s urban areas.\u201cThe ideological identity is clear, but the organization they\u2019re affiliated to isn\u2019t,\u201d he said on Thursday of the suspects. \u201cSo the question is, did they commit this independently or was it a sleeper cell?\u201dHe noted that the attack \u201ctargets very sensitive matters like tourism, which is an essential component of the Moroccan economy.\u201d He added, \u201cIt is hard for the authorities to protect these areas and easier for organizations like ISIS to start operating in these places.\u201dMs. Ueland\u2019s mother, Irene Ueland, was quoted in a regional newspaper as describing the killings as \u201cpure madness.\u201dMs. Jespersen wrote a post on Nov. 21 on Facebook about her coming trip: \u201cDear friends, I\u2019m going to Morocco in December.

{"Headline": "Teaching Children Regardless of Grade", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFixesEducators in a remote valley in India devised a community approach to instructing students when teachers were sparse. It\u2019s catching on.Ms. Dharssi is a journalist who reports on global development, sustainability and immigration.One day at the beginning of the 2017-2018 school year in the rural Rishi Valley region of Andhra Pradesh, India, two dozen children in Grades 1 through 5 gathered quietly around four tables on colorful mats on the floor of their one-room school, working with books and worn laminated materials. Few looked up when I walked in. Their school has no chairs and is more than three hours from Bangalore, the closest major city. But the students were working with learning aids so effective that by now they\u2019ve been adopted by more than 250,000 schools across India and in more than a dozen countries, including Kenya, Nepal and Sri Lanka. The common problem they address is one of the thorniest in education: teaching in primary schools where one teacher instructs children at multiple grade levels at once.But experts, including Mr. Antoninis, say that Rishi Valley\u2019s pedagogy, which lets children study at their own pace, offers a solution to the problem. The approach has also been found to be useful in wealthier countries like Britain and Germany, and is applicable in countries like the United States, where teachers often manage large classes of students who have varied levels of understanding even within the same grade.In the Rishi Valley school when I visited, students in different grades were studying Telugu, the local language, side by side. At one table, a teacher helped six students, including a 5-year-old girl learning the alphabet with foam letters and a girl in fourth grade reading a song about diversity in India. At another table, a boy in first grade helped a girl learn the word for \u201cmuddy road.\u201d Nearby, two fourth graders took turns rolling dice in a game with words they recently learned.The method is meant to let students study at their own pace. They work through the curriculum by following subject-specific \u201clearning ladders\u201d that outline lessons with various levels of support from the teacher. Each rung of the ladder represents a learning milestone; the cards outline activities that introduce the student to a new concept, give him or her a chance to practice it and evaluate his or her understanding of it, along with possibilities for enrichment and remediation. To help children relate to concepts, activities incorporate local dialects, folklore and natural materials from the local environment. The curriculum also incorporates community festivals and group activities like singing and puppetry.Students typically begin learning milestones at a table for teacher-supported work, where the teacher introduces the concept. Students follow the ladder to identify their next activity and then move through other tables to do work that is either teacher-supported, peer-supported, partly teacher-supported or independent. Teachers track student progress and adjust tasks as needed. This way, the process engages learners who differ in natural quickness, prior knowledge and time to study. Child laborers, who frequently miss school for work, can pick up where they left off.The method allows for a \u201cpersonalized education that one usually associates with very developed economies\u201d and \u201cmakes that affordable for low-resource environments,\u201d said Fabio Segura, head of international programs at the Jacobs Foundation, a Swiss nonprofit organization focused on improving child and youth development worldwide. Starting in 2015, the foundation considered more than 3,600 models to improve education in Ivory Coast\u2019s cocoa-growing communities. Rishi Valley\u2019s model is one of 12 the foundation is testing, with assistance from cocoa companies and the government, Mr. Segura said.In Germany, about 150 schools use the method, according to Ulrike Lichtinger, a professor at Vorarlberg Teaching University in Austria. She spreads the approach with educators like Thomas M\u00fcller, professor of special education at Julius Maximilian University in W\u00fcrzburg, Germany. When he introduced it at a school for children with emotional and behavioral problems where he was headmaster, students became more attentive and behavioral problems dropped \u201cnearly to zero,\u201d he said.The approach gives students greater control over learning than conventional classrooms, said Kathrin Trimborn, a German teacher who studied the method for her doctorate and works with students with emotional and behavioral problems. \u201cWorking with the learning ladder, they always know, \u2018O.K., I\u2019m here and I have to do \u2014- for the next week \u2014- this, this, this. So many steps.,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cBut they see how they improve and that\u2019s what\u2019s really, really motivating for them.\u201dNevertheless, the way this teaching method overturns classroom and teaching norms has inhibited its spread in some places. In India, the pedagogy runs into a \u201cchalk-and-talk\u201d culture in which teachers stand in front of a class, lecturing from textbooks, and evaluate students based on memorization, said Venu Thane, coordinator at the Rishi Valley\u2019s educational resource institution. The problem was that most teachers were poorly trained or didn\u2019t understand the model. Others didn\u2019t take it seriously, which means they didn\u2019t appreciate how it could enhance their teaching. Some schools reverted to textbooks instead of activity cards, or didn\u2019t adapt activities to make lessons relevant for their students.The findings underscore what Mr. Rao describes as the biggest challenge to using the model to improve education, \u201cdilution.\u201d What\u2019s needed is political backing, buy-in from teachers and long-term support for teachers, he added.Such setbacks are to be expected, Mr. Vijayakumar said, noting that teachers have lectured at children in rows for centuries. Reform, he said, is not magic. \u201cChanging the mind-set of so many teachers and so many parents and millions and millions of children, it takes time,\u201d he said.Even so, the approach is having a notable impact. Children in Indian states that use it performed \u201csignificantly better\u201d on a national survey of learning achievements last year, said Begur Ramachandra Rao, an education specialist at Unicef India, in an email.The Rishi Valley institute is now more deliberate about assuring that the model is adopted rigorously. The institute prefers contracts of three years or more so it can adequately support teachers and troubleshoot, Padmanabha Rao explained. This is a departure from a previous model, in which the institute helped with curricular adaptation and initial teacher trainings before moving on.The institution is also incorporating technology into the method with support from the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation and the World Economic Forum. The institute has developed digital training guides, including videos, to help officials and teachers understand it. Last year, the institute also added activities involving tablets to the method in government schools in Andhra Pradesh. Students\u2019 results are uploaded to a database where officials can pinpoint which schools need more support, Mr. Rao said.Alia Dharssi, a freelance journalist in Vancouver, reports on global development, sustainability and immigration.

{"Headline": "The Genes That Make Parrots Into the Humans of the Bird World", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesLong-lived and clever parrots may be as different genetically from other birds as humans are from other primates.After comparing its genome with those of dozens of other birds, the researchers\u2019 findings suggest that evolution may have made parrots something like the humans of the avian world. A general rule of life span in birds and other animals is the bigger or heavier you are, the longer you live. A small bird like a finch may live five to eight years, while bigger ones like eagles or cranes can live decades. The blue-fronted Amazon and some other parrots are even more exceptional, in that they can live up to 66 years \u2014 in some cases outliving their human companions.In their analysis, Dr. Mello and his colleagues found that these parrots and some other long-lived birds shared changes in a set of 344 genes that seem to be involved in various processes that influence life span, like how an animal\u2019s body repairs DNA, manages cancer or controls cell growth. While about 20 of these genetic changes have been implicated in aging in other animals, the rest of the genes\u2019 direct role in life span has not been investigated. Future studies may reveal that they\u2019re not just important to aging in parrots or other long-lived birds, but in other animals as well.Parrots are distinguished not only by their longevity, but also by their cognitive abilities.\u201cThey\u2019re really, really smart animals, and the brains are particularly big. We seem to see a parallel in humans that have bigger brains and enhanced capacities, compared to other animals,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think parrots are the parallel in the avian world.\u201dThe team found changes in parts of the parrot genome remarkably similar to those that set humans apart from other primates.This intrigued Dr. Mello. The similar changes found in parrots and humans aren\u2019t to the genes themselves, but occur along regions of the genome that regulate the expression of nearby genes that seem to play a role in brain development and intelligence. Could these changes explain the parrot\u2019s large, complex brain and diverse set of talents?By looking at specifics in the genetic changes of parrots and humans, researchers in the future may develop a better understanding of the powers of convergent evolution. Perhaps there is only one path that leads complex brain structures and advanced cognitive abilities like those of parrots and humans. Or it could be that there is more than one evolutionary route capable of producing such complex creatures in different parts of the animal kingdom.Advertisement"}

Believing it to be an act of retaliation, Ms. Dushku went through mediation with CBS and won a $9.5 million settlement.\u2022 \u201cThe lawyers said the company\u2019s handling of Ms. Dushku\u2019s complaints was not only misguided, but emblematic of larger problems at CBS.\u201d\u2022 \u201cWhen faced with instances of wrongdoing, the company had a tendency to protect itself, at the expense of victims, the investigators wrote.\u201dIn a letter to staff members, Richard Handler, the C.E.O. of the investment bank Jeffries, explained that he was vexed by \u201cthe thoughtless, paranoid and fundamentally wrong reaction that many people in our industry are expressing about the #MeToo movement.\u201d\u2022 \u201cIf you don\u2019t know how to conduct yourself as a responsible, courteous and balanced human being, the fault lies exclusively with you and not with an allegedly flawed system designed to ensnare the innocent,\u201d he wrote.\u2022 His conclusion: \u201cWe cannot control the markets, but we can control how we act and behave.\u201d\u2022 \u201cThe industry had reason to urge the rollback of higher fuel efficiency standards proposed by former President Barack Obama. A quarter of the world\u2019s oil is used to power cars, and less-thirsty vehicles mean lower gasoline sales.\u201d\u2022 \u201cIn Congress, on Facebook and in statehouses nationwide, Marathon Petroleum, the country\u2019s largest refiner, worked with powerful oil-industry groups and a conservative policy network financed by the billionaire industrialist Charles G. Koch to run a stealth campaign to roll back car emissions standards.\u201d\u2022 \u201cThe campaign\u2019s main argument for significantly easing fuel efficiency standards \u2014 that the United States is so awash in oil it no longer needs to worry about energy conservation \u2014 clashed with decades of federal energy and environmental policy.\u201dStocks on Wall Street are poised to end the week higher than they started it, with trade tensions between China and the U.S. apparently easing.Year after year of support from global central banks and their multi-trillion dollar asset purchase programmes had indoctrinated the BTD [buy the dip] moneymaking strategy: buy on any sign of a pullback, policymakers have you covered.But with the Federal Reserve well into a policy tightening cycle and concerns about the U.S.-China trade war weighing on the global growth outlook, investors appear a lot less keen to place their belief \u2014 at least for now \u2014 that stocks always go up.DealsPolitics and policyTradeTechBest of the restThanks for reading!

His mother was young, and \u201cwe decided that it would be best if I raised him,\u201d she said. She began raising another grandchild a few years later. Then, five years ago, Ms. Green became the full-time caregiver of a son\u2019s three children \u2014 now 2, 3 and 5 \u2014 when their parents became unable to care for them.\u201cI look at it like this \u2014 I didn\u2019t want any of my children to go into the system, so I did put my life on hold,\u201d she said. \u201cTo me, that was more important than what I wanted to do with my life.\u201dThings got more difficult in 2009 when Ms. Green began to experience severe muscle cramps. The problem began in her hand but eventually traveled down to both of her legs and then her neck. Ms. Green learned she had a muscle disorder known as dystonia. There is no cure; she receives Botox injections every three months to help ease her symptoms.The cramping in her right hand got so intense that she had to teach herself how to write with her left. Her brain still sends signals to the right hand even though she is writing with her left, she said. And some days it even affects her speech.\u201cI would be talking to people, and then my voice would mumble,\u201d she said. \u201cIn my brain, I would hear myself talking regular, but it wouldn\u2019t come out that way.\u201dShe cannot work because of the dystonia and is unlikely to return to the work force. In 2008, she was working at a Walgreens when she fell and hurt her knee. She then began taking care of her grandchildren full-time.But, as Ms. Green said, \u201cA mother\u2019s got to do what she\u2019s got to do. Even if I\u2019m not up to it, it has to get done anyway.\u201dGrowing up in Queens, Ms. Green was the victim of multiple sexual assaults as a child and teenager, she said. The pain of the abuse led her to abandon her education. But in 2016, she was able to obtain her high school equivalency diploma.When she started seeing friends on Facebook celebrating college graduations, she decided that she, too, wanted a degree.Ms. Green receives $750 a month in Supplemental Security Income for herself, another $750 a month in Supplemental Security Income for her oldest grandchild, who has A.D.H.D., and $500 each for two of the other grandchildren living with her, who have disabilities. She also receives $260 a month in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits.In March, Ms. Green began taking online classes at Hudson Valley Community College. Choosing her major was simple: early childhood education.\u201cYou know what, you\u2019ve raised a lot of children,\u201d she said she told herself. \u201cDo something you\u2019re good at.\u201dMs. Green said she wanted to know more about how to help children. \u201cIt does get frustrating with the children and not knowing all the answers,\u201d she said.She spends much of her day looking after her grandchildren and tries to study after they go to bed.\u201cI\u2019m doing this because I want people to know that no matter your condition, just go for your dreams, do what you got to do,\u201d she said. \u201cI want my grandchildren to see that nothing can get in the way of you doing what you have to do.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Does It Mean to \u2018Speak as a Woman\u2019?", "Date": "2018-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHE STONEIf I attempt to control a conversation based on the fact of my gender, I may be a bully, looking for a way to humiliate you. But I may be justified.Ms. Callard is an associate professor of philosophy at the University of Chicago.Suppose a man and I are having a conversation about recent events, and suppose I introduce one of my statements with \u201cAs a woman, \u2026\u201d He probably wouldn\u2019t react in the same way if he were discussing a topic that touched on physics, and his interlocutor said, \u201cAs a physicist \u2026\u201d In that case, she has expertise that he is likely to recognize as conversationally relevant. Even if he knew she was a physicist before the conversation began, he might find it reasonable for her to preface some of her assertions with a reminder that she is speaking from a position of special knowledge.Being a physicist gives a person a certain standing in conversations that have something to do with physics. So why shouldn\u2019t being a woman give me a certain standing in conversations that have something to do with gender?Let\u2019s distinguish two ways in which the expertise of a physicist might figure in a discussion of some question. First, it might allow her to introduce facts into the conversation that have bearing on the question. Call this, \u201cinformational standing.\u201d Second, it might put her in a privileged position to manage the conversation: to determine who speaks when, how the question is pursued, when it counts as answered and so on. Call this, \u201cmanagerial standing.\u201dIf conversations were information-extraction exercises, we would be indifferent as to whether our interlocutor was telling the truth, or lying, as long as we knew which \u201cfilter\u201d to apply. (Either way, we can extract data from the utterance.) Spies might be satisfied with information extraction, but in normal conversation it is important to us that our interlocutor make an honest effort to speak truthfully. This is because, when we converse, we have the goal of thinking with our interlocutor, and you only invite someone into your mind to the extent that you are willing to lay it open before them; and because you expect them to do the same. The ideas of respect and equality have many applications in civic life, especially in a democracy, but one of the most basic is conversational: mutual recognition as having equal standing to contribute to the discussion of some question.This brings us, finally, to the kind of speaking \u201cas a woman\u201d that engenders defensiveness and hostility. When I adopt managerial standing on the grounds of some demographic fact, I am saying that given the difference between us with respect to gender, race, sexual orientation, or socio-economic status, we cannot converse as equals \u2014 moreover, that in order for us to converse, you have to allow me to be in some way in charge of the conversation. You have to hand me the reins.This demand on my part will sometimes be illegitimate \u2014 I may, in fact, be a bully, looking for a way to grab power, humiliate you or show off in front of others. But is it always illegitimate? If I speak as an X, managerially, I am saying that a certain ideal kind of conversation \u2014 conversation among equals \u2014 is impossible for us. Could that be, simply, true? Could it be that, as in the case of the physicist, our only option besides putting me in charge is fake conversation?If the answer is, \u201cyes,\u201d this won\u2019t be because demographic membership constitutes a form of expertise. We can use our expert replacement test: If you are having a conversation about rape with someone who says, \u201cas a rape victim,\u201d her claim to managerial standing, unlike any informational claim she might make, will in no way be undermined by the presence of a rape researcher. Unlike informational standing, managerial standing can be demographic \u201call the way down.\u201dThese issues of structural injustice can be very tricky. Consider the summer of 2018 controversy that arose around the work of Kathleen Stock, a philosophy professor who argues against redefining the category of woman and lesbian to include trans women. Why does the terminology matter so much here? Among other things, what is at stake is the question of whether trans women have managerial standing to speak as women.It is also important to note that not every case of demographic managerial standing will be predicated on injustice. Someone with personal experience of a natural disaster might not to be able to speak on that topic without getting emotional. Allowing that person to manage the conversation may make it possible for him to be as rational as he can be, under the circumstances.One could avoid demographically managed conversations by restricting one\u2019s interlocutors. You might think that a philosopher would be inclined to do this. Philosophers place special value on a specific kind of conversation \u2014 those in which strict equality between participants makes possible the no-holds-barred argumentative warfare that is our bread and butter. We think that when people refute us, they are doing us a favor. And refutation does not fit comfortably in demographically managed conversation: If you are the manager, my refuting you undermines my acceptance of your managerial standing, and if I am the manager, refuting you might well constitute an abuse of it.But philosophers are also teachers of philosophy, charged with producing the next generation of philosophers. We not only conduct but also induct people into such conversations, and this means that we are interested in the porousness of the boundary that surrounds them. We don\u2019t choose our students, we don\u2019t choose our society, and we can\u2019t always choose our conversations.For this reason, I think all of us \u2014 even philosophers \u2014 should be prepared, at times, to accept demographic claims of managerial standing; but I also think we should aspire to navigate each of those conversations with the kind of intellectual excellence, respect and sensitivity that would allow them to become the full-fledged, unmanaged conversations they aspire to be.Advertisement"}

To me, his behavior suggested that, one, because we were people of color we were a threat to their safety, and, two, because we are people of color we can\u2019t afford to live in that type of apartment complex.\u201dHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s the Upper East Side.

Mr. Okafor had never seen him in the building before the encounter.Mr. Okafor said he reported the incident to the building manager and that she told him she could not address personal matters and advised him to report the incident to the police if he wanted to pursue legal action.The manager, Cathy Burton, did not respond to a request for comment on Monday.Mr. Okafor, who is spending the holidays in Chicago, said he planned to re-sign his lease, and though he did not plan to pursue legal action, he was expecting an apology from the man and he thinks the man should be evicted from the building.\u201cI\u2019m not going to change how I live my life based on this guy\u2019s inappropriate behavior,\u201d Mr. Okafor said.Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "France Declares Strasbourg Shooting an Act of Terrorism", "Date": "2018-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySTRASBOURG, France \u2014 The deadly shooting at a crowded Strasbourg street market was an act of terrorism, officials said Wednesday, as hundreds of police officers hunted the fugitive assailant, a man described as a radicalized hometown career criminal.The gunman killed at least two people and wounded 12 in the Tuesday night shooting spree at the famous Christmas market in Strasbourg, a city of more than a quarter-million in France\u2019s northeast border with Germany.Officials said the suspect had an extensive record and had served time in prison. More than 700 members of the security forces were searching for the suspect in Strasbourg, the French interior minister said.\u201cHe had been incarcerated multiple times and was known to the prison administration for his radicalization and his proselytizing attitude,\u201d Mr. Heitz said of the suspect, identified as Ch\u00e9rif Chekatt, 29, who was born in Strasbourg. He was released from prison in late 2015.On Wednesday evening, the French authorities appealed for witnesses, issuing a notice that included a picture of Mr. Chekatt and a physical description.The notice asked people who might have seen him to contact the police but warned them not to confront the suspect, calling him \u201cdangerous.\u201dMr. Chekatt was one of about 20,000 people flagged for possible radicalization by the French security services, and was also flagged with what is known in France as a Fiche S, or an S File, Mr. Heitz said. Four people in the suspect\u2019s entourage were taken into custody overnight, he added.The authorities initially said that the gunman had killed three people, but Mr. Heitz later revised that death toll, specifying that two people had been killed and one was considered brain-dead. Six people were seriously wounded, he said.City officials said the two people who were killed were a French citizen and a Thai citizen.Among those injured was the daughter of a couple who own a cheese chop in the Rue des Orf\u00e8vres, a narrow street near the city\u2019s cathedral, where the attacker opened fire.The shooting recalled other attacks in recent years by Islamist extremists in France, Belgium and other parts of Europe. Benjamin Griveaux, the French government spokesman, said after a cabinet meeting in Paris on Wednesday that President Emmanuel Macron had warned that \u201cthe terrorist threat is still at the heart of our nation\u2019s life.\u201dThe Strasbourg market has long been in the cross hairs of the Islamic State and Al Qaeda, which see it as a symbol of an infidel holiday. In 2000, a cell based in Frankfurt plotted to attack the market, but its communications were intercepted and the plot foiled.More recently, in fall 2016, a group of men deployed by the Islamic State\u2019s external operations arm in Syria planned to attack the market. French officials penetrated the cell and thwarted the attack, but it prompted the United States State Department to issue a travel alert, warning of credible threats against holiday events in Europe.The market remained closed on Wednesday, leaving the city center mostly empty and cordoned off by security forces. Sports centers, cultural institutions and many shops in the area were closed, and security checks were reinforced.\u201cIt might be the biggest Christmas market in France \u2014 you\u2019d never think of an attack when you hear the first gunshots,\u201d said Marc Meyer, 32, who was standing by the market\u2019s giant Christmas tree when he saw a panicked crowd rushing toward him around 8 p.m.Jamel Beli, who was sitting on a nearby terrace when he heard the first gunshots, also thought the Yellow Vests were behind the agitation. \u201cIt was so, so crowded,\u201d said Mr. Beli, 42. \u201cIt could very well have been carnage.\u201dMr. Heitz, the prosecutor, said that the gunman was first seen shortly before 8 p.m. on the Rue des Orf\u00e8vres, in the heart of the Christmas market. He then moved through several streets, attacking with a handgun and a knife as he went.Four soldiers on patrol shot at him, wounding him in the arm, Mr. Heitz said, but the attacker escaped and took a taxi to another area of Strasbourg. The driver told the police that the gunman had described the attack to him and tried to justify it. After exiting the taxi, the attacker came across more police officers, who shot at him but lost track of him.The taxi driver\u2019s account helped the police identify Mr. Chekatt as the suspect, Mr. Heitz said. Tuesday morning, before the attack, the police had raided Mr. Chekatt\u2019s home in an unrelated murder investigation and found a grenade, a rifle, ammunition and several knives. He was not at home during the raid.Laurent Nu\u00f1ez, France\u2019s junior interior minister, told France Inter radio that it was possible that the suspect had fled into Germany, just across the Rhine from Strasbourg, and that border checks had been strengthened.Mr. Nu\u00f1ez said Mr. Chekatt had never been convicted of terrorism and did not appear to have tried to go to Syria, as some others on European terrorism watch lists have done.Still, Mr. Heitz, the prosecutor, said that the suspect had an extensive criminal record, with 27 convictions, mostly for robberies and assaults, in France, Germany and Switzerland.Being flagged with an S file \u2014 the \u201cS\u201d stands for La S\u00fbret\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00c9tat, or security of the state \u2014 does not mean that a person has been convicted of an offense or is even suspected of one. Instead, it is a way for French security forces to keep track of a wide range of people who are thought to potentially pose a security threat, in some cases merely because they are acquainted with someone else under watch.\u201cThe S File can target individuals who aren\u2019t very dangerous, and it is used only to watch their movements and trips around the country,\u201d Mr. Nu\u00f1ez said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a criterion of dangerousness.\u201dThe shooting was not the first time that Strasbourg has grappled with the consequences of radicalized youth.Delphine Rideau, the head of Maison des Adolescents, an organization in Strasbourg that helps local youths and is involved in the prevention of radicalization, said that there had been several cases of radicalized individuals in Strasbourg, although not all were violent.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen petty criminals who became radicalized all of sudden, and others who were isolated, abandoned, and lost ground,\u201d she said.Robert Hermann, the president of the Strasbourg Eurom\u00e9tropole, a grouping of city councils in the region, said that the Christmas market was the city\u2019s most secured event of the year, but that \u201czero risk\u201d was impossible. The Bas-Rhin Department, which includes Strasbourg, has less than 2 percent of France\u2019s total population but about 10 percent of people flagged with an S File, he said, adding that monitoring everyone all the time was impossible.\u201cSome are intellectuals who convert people, others are ideologists who will take action, other get radicalized in prison,\u201d Mr. Hermann said. \u201cThe profile of the main suspect is even more complex.\u201dThe Strasbourg Christmas market, which started in 1570, is one of France\u2019s most popular winter events. In the past few years, it has attracted more than 2.5 million visitors annually, and the authorities have tightened security, including by deploying undercover police officers.The Strasbourg mayor, Roland Ries, said at a news conference that he planned to reopen the market on Thursday if security conditions allowed. One street reopened to the public Wednesday afternoon, and dozens of people laid flowers where the shooting took place.\u201cToday we are mourning,\u201d Mr. Ries said. \u201cBut I hope that, as soon as tomorrow, we can resume our normal lives.\u201dElian Peltier reported from Strasbourg, and Aurelien Breeden from Paris.

{"Headline": "Nothing Is More American Than Chinese Food on Christmas", "Date": "2018-12-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJewish families and others used to flock to Chinese restaurants because that was all that was open, but now it\u2019s almost as traditional as milk and cookies for Santa.Ms. Li is the author of the novel \u201cNumber One Chinese Restaurant.\u201dWhen my mother first came to America over three decades ago, she waited tables for five years at a restaurant called Forbidden City in Ann Arbor, Mich. She quit when she became pregnant with me, but I grew up hearing stories about her time as a waitress. Stories about stingy customers and cooks she tried to avoid \u2014 and the busiest day of the year: Christmas.\u201cI always got my pick of the big party tables,\u201d she told me. \u201cEntire families, including grandparents, would come for dinner.\u201dI knew that Christmas was a busy day for Chinese restaurants, and I assumed that she hated that shift. But I was wrong.\u201cAll the customers were in happy moods,\u201d she corrected me. \u201cAnd gave us blessings.\u201dAs most Americans know: Chinese restaurants almost never close on Christmas. Early Chinese immigrants were not Christian, and losing an entire day of sales for a holiday they didn\u2019t understand did not make economic sense, especially when Chinese restaurants occupied a tenuous position in America. It\u2019s hard to imagine now, when there are over 40,000 Chinese restaurants in the United States (McDonald\u2019s, for scale, has just over 14,000 restaurants), but before Americans were crowding into Chinese restaurants for Christmas dinner, they were more interested in crowding these restaurants out.Jewish and African-Americans also patronized those early Chinese restaurants in noticeable numbers. As one newspaper from 1892 put it so delicately, \u201cWhites, blacks and Mongolians mingled without sign of prejudice.\u201dChinese restaurants used to be one of the few public places that welcomed African-American diners, according to Yong Chen\u2019s \u201cChop Suey, USA: The Story of Chinese Food in America.\u201d In \u201cA Kosher Christmas,\u201d Rabbi Joshua Plaut writes that Jewish customers were welcome in Chinese restaurants because \u201cChinese owners and waiters had no history of prejudice toward Jews.\u201d It makes sense that Chinese restaurants were a destination for Jewish families on Christmas \u2014 they were among the only ones open, both literally and metaphorically.The summer before I went to graduate school, I got a job waiting tables at a bustling Chinese restaurant. Lines sometimes went out the door and parties of 10 to 15 packed my tables. The restaurant was known for its Peking duck, carved tableside and then wrapped in flour pancakes by the servers. My first week on the job, in a sweltering July, one of my co-workers caught the terrified grimace on my face and said, \u201cYou think this is bad, wait until Christmas.\u201dI didn\u2019t make it until Christmas. I barely made it until the end of July. And after I turned in my name tag, I avoided Chinese restaurants for almost a year after. My brief time as a Chinese restaurant waitress illustrated the perpetual foreignness I\u2019d always felt as a Chinese-American, the foreignness I\u2019d seen my parents, as immigrants, struggle with even decades after they\u2019d received citizenship.The customers I served saw me, and my co-workers, not so much as people as the furniture of the restaurant, and talked about us as if we couldn\u2019t hear, or understand, what they were saying. My experience as a waitress was one more glaring reminder that to be Chinese in America is to be always on the outside looking in.But the Christmas crowds now make me think of something else. Chinese food on Christmas has become, according to Rabbi Plaut, an acceptable alternative for anyone looking outside the usual holiday celebrations.

Egyptian fruit bats \u2014 also called \u201cflying foxes,\u201d because of their dog-like faces \u2014 are found as far south as South Africa and as far east as Pakistan and northern India. They are not migratory, but it is not known how far individuals or groups normally range.Genetic testing found multiple strains of the virus in each bat, suggesting it had circulated in West African colonies for many years.There have been no known human Marburg outbreaks in West Africa, but the potential for one exists. The virus was named for the German city where it was first detected in 1967, nine years before the discovery of Ebola. A mysterious disease that included hemorrhagic fevers struck workers at a vaccine factory who had handled a shipment of green monkeys from Uganda. The virus also infected people in Frankfurt and Belgrade; 31 people fell ill, and seven died.The bats are about six inches long with wings two feet wide; they roost in caves or in the deep forest, and come out at night to eat fruit \u2014 a habit that leads fruit farmers to poison large numbers of them.Humans may get it from being bitten when they capture bats to eat, from cuts during food preparation or from infectious bat guano. Most human outbreaks have begun in people who visited bat-infested caves or mines.The largest known outbreak of Marburg virus, which began in Angola in 2004, sickened over 250 people and had a 90 percent fatality rate. Two of the strains found in Sierra Leone bats were similar to the Angolan ones.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On Climate, the Facts and Law Are Against Trump ", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA recent government report predicts dire consequences from climate change. That complicates efforts to weaken environmental laws.Mr. Revesz is a professor at the New York University School of Law.The report is likely to bolster anticipated lawsuits against the administration over its decision to vastly weaken the nation\u2019s two major climate change regulations, which would limit planet-warming emissions from power plants and vehicles, the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions. The new report could play a key role in these lawsuits.Now that this report is part of the official government record, the administration cannot credibly suggest that climate policies should be weakened. Prepared by dozens of experts and government officials, the assessment predicts hundreds of billions of dollars in damages from storms, crop failures, ruined infrastructure and climate-related deaths and illnesses. Stronger regulations to limit emissions are needed, it says.So not only have the facts been against the government\u2019s position. So has the law.In weakening the vehicle emissions rule, the administration relies on economic and legal arguments that don\u2019t stand up to scrutiny. The current standards require automakers to steadily increase the fuel efficiency of new passenger vehicles, limiting climate pollution while reducing consumer fuel costs. The freedom that the Trump administration favors has little to do with what the founding fathers prized. It is a freedom for favored industries to impose numerous premature deaths, hospitalizations and other major harms on the public in pursuit of profit, even when the net cost to society is large.The Trump administration will have nothing to show for pounding its fists and yelling. Without the facts or the law on its side, these antics won\u2019t be an adequate legal defense for the administration\u2019s choice to undermine the very climate policies its report says are needed to protect Americans.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Adventures in \u2018the Most Organized City\u2019 in India ", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHE 52 PLACES TRAVELERWith only three more stops to go, our columnist takes in Chandigarh, Le Corbusier\u2019s rigorously planned city, and, on the flip side, a fantastical rock garden, with a mirrored fun-house and waterfall. A tiny figure in flowing blue fabric ran in front of me, giggling, then another, then another, then perhaps a hundred more. They filed through what looked like a handcrafted version of a canyon from the moon: a narrow passageway of pockmarked concrete embedded with rocks, stretching two stories into the air.There they were again, taking selfies next to a man-made waterfall tumbling from some kind of shrine on a hill.And then, quick as panthers, they were behind me, waving from a bridge festooned with clay vines: \u201cHello! Hello! Where are you from?\u201dAnd they weren\u2019t even close to the only school group I\u2019d see that day \u2014 the place was awash with children and teenagers, leapfrogging over one another, having the time of their lives. Boys in black sweaters with white jeans and white sneakers streamed past my Malerkotla friends, who were streaming past young Sikhs in green turbans, who were streaming past little girls in plaid skirts with pigtail braids.Most of them were coming from rural areas. Chandigarh, the dual-capital city of the states of Punjab and Haryana, was one of the biggest cities they\u2019d ever seen. And judging from how many of them wanted to \u201csnap a selfie\u201d with me, I was likely one of the only foreigners they\u2019d ever seen, too. Add to the mix families, honeymooning women in elaborate pink saris, the occasional stray dog, and workers asleep on walls. It was such a life-affirming scene that I couldn\u2019t stop grinning.\u201cSomeone please tell me John Waters has been here,\u201d I whispered, while looking at a three-headed ghost made of pebbles.That so much space has been given over to the organic expression of one artist\u2019s vision in Chandigarh, of all places, seems wild. This is independent India\u2019s first planned city, designed by the Swiss-French architect, Charles-\u00c9douard Jeanneret, known as Le Corbusier. Here you\u2019ll find monumental, concrete, Brutalist buildings amid one of the only urban-grid layouts in the country. Le Corbusier divided the city into numbered sectors that are meant to be self-sufficient neighborhoods, each with its own health center, schools, shops and green space. In between them run wide boulevards lined with trees.\u201cIt\u2019s the best city in India,\u201d said Suri Kumar, an Air Force officer I\u2019d met on the subway in New Delhi. \u201cThe cleanest, the most organized, the best.\u201dAs I learned from talking with Rajnish Wattas, the former principal of the Chandigarh College of Architecture, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru was determined to make a new capital city that would be the pride of modern India, with no references to a past of palaces and fortresses. The planning had begun with the American architect Albert Mayer and his partner, Matthew Nowicki, but halted when Nowicki died in a plane crash. Nehru\u2019s selection committee then convinced Le Corbusier to come onboard, using some of the first team\u2019s sketches of the city layout.Le Corbusier, it turned out, had long dreamed of building a new city. He\u2019d even come up with a plan for modernizing Paris with vertical towers that never came to fruition. (Thank goodness.) \u201cIf Chandigarh was lucky to get Corbusier,\u201d said Mr. Wattas, \u201cthen Corbusier, too, was very lucky to get Chandigarh, because this was his biggest realization.\u201d\u201cAccording to Corbusier,\u201d said our guide, \u201can open hand cannot hold a weapon.\u201dAll that planning, though, couldn\u2019t quite account for people moving in. Walking along those wide boulevards with my friend Lisa Philp \u2014 an architecture and history buff who happened to have planned a trip to Chandigarh the weekend I was there \u2014 we rarely found a sidewalk. But we did see roadside barbershops and portable Hindu temples and playgrounds with trash cans in the shape of strawberries. While in a nature preserve next to the vast, man-made Sukhna Lake we came upon two monkeys vigorously mating. In a roundabout thick with traffic, I once looked out the window of my Uber and saw a horse cart go by.Chandigarh, after all, was once countryside. Some 58 villages stood where the city now does, and only 16 are still intact. Along with the slums that formed later, they make up an impoverished periphery to a city whose per capita income, car ownership (three to four per household) and real estate prices are among the highest in the country. Now the city\u2019s population is over double the half million it was built to hold. \u201cNo one ever thought to prepare for rickshaws and pavement hawkers, the fringe people,\u201d said Mr. Wattas.Following Lisa\u2019s lead, I walked through the city whenever I could, to see what perfection looks like when life happens to it.The rock garden, too, wouldn\u2019t exist without the Partition. Nek Chand\u2019s family was living on the side of the divide that became Pakistan in 1947. They fled to New Delhi for safety, then Chand moved to the still-under-construction Chandigarh. During the building of the city, some 40 villages were razed. Chand became a road inspector for the public works department; afterward, he collected debris from those villages that had been destroyed, and carried it on his bike to a secret spot in the forest outside the city.Chand\u2019s debris haven was in a Corbusier-designated urban wilderness near the Capitol Complex where building was illegal, and for 18 years he\u2019d go there at night to craft sculptures out of discarded electrical sockets, broken tiles and the like, along with rocks he collected from the river.When the authorities did find the site in 1975, it ignited a huge debate between city officials who wanted to tear it down, and those who thought it ought to be preserved. People began making treks into the forest to see this act of passionate art. Eventually the government not only relented in preserving the site, but also gave Chand an official title, a salary so he could continue his artistic work full time, and a crew of 50 to help him expand it. I went to the Rock Garden twice, for multiple hours, to soak in the spirit of Nek Chand\u2019s creativity. It is an oasis of spontaneity and deliberate chaos in the midst of a city built on laws and structure. And even then, I felt like I\u2019d barely scratched the surface, that I would have to return.Good thing two of the people who\u2019d asked me for selfies also invited me to their weddings next year.Previous dispatches:Next dispatch: BhutanAdvertisement"}

(Warning: iPhone addiction ahead.)Tech and media have long been converging. What are the biggest effects on the media industry, and how has it had to adapt? The effects cannot be overstated \u2014 and in some ways, everything is changing, which is what makes it so exciting to cover. The question is what the new power structure will look like. Will it be more reflective of America and continue to tell better stories about it? Or will it be meet the new boss, same as the old boss?At the same time, the digital transformation has introduced supercool ways of telling stories and given the industry a new dynamism from a new talent pool. At the end of the day, though, the basics still rise: penetrating, holy-smokes reporting in stories well told.How do you consume media now? Which gadgets or tech services do you use most often?I am so addicted to my iPhone that my fingers hurt. My distal interphalangeal joints \u2014 the ones toward the tips of my digits \u2014 take it particularly hard, though they are probably so strong by now they could lift a VW Bug. I\u2019m a 6s-type person, and if I didn\u2019t have the iPhone battery case I\u2019d be dead in the water by noon every day (especially when dealing with sensitive sources via battery-eating encrypted apps).Most of my iPhone time is spent on Twitter, far more than I want to admit. I use Twitter far more to consume than to tweet myself; I prefer to save my best thoughts for my column, though I am constantly reassessing that as I watch many of my colleagues make wonderful use of the platform to report without cutting into their more traditional dispatches. I\u2019m using Apple TV more and more, and am constantly toggling between my content on Apple, Amazon Prime, Netflix and the cable box. I\u2019ve yet to figure out the remotes; I just push buttons until stuff turns on. Spotify is a constant in my life, and it\u2019s what I usually use on my Sonos home speaker system as well.What could be better about the tech tools you rely on most for your beat?Also, the platforms simply have to do a better job of identifying and eradicating bots whose sole mission appears to be to inflame and harass. Yes, they target all sorts of users, but in some cases (and in the parochial terms of my beat) they\u2019re aimed at journalists \u2014 either to sway them or to just attack them, in another affront on democracy\u2019s fourth estate. Don\u2019t get me started on misinformation. I have too many columns ahead to fill on the topic.What tech product are you personally obsessed with? I\u2019m going to cheat and talk about two. And it won\u2019t be pretty. Let\u2019s start with Nest. The device \u2014 at least ours, which we got two years ago \u2014 has a mind of its own. At times, it makes me feel as if I\u2019m in the \u201cJetsons\u201d reboot episode in which the robots all turn against George. My wife and I are often away from our house for long periods, so we keep the heat low. The Nest allows us to warm it from afar hours ahead of time so we don\u2019t come home to an icebox. But then, for no apparent reason, the Nest will set the heat back to low when we\u2019re in the house so it is suddenly freezing again. This has happened in exceedingly cold weather when there are pipes to worry about. The device is running on an algorithm that we can turn off \u2014 I get that (theoretically, at least; my m.o. with tech is to figure out the minimum that will serve my needs and leave it at that). And I\u2019m sure there are other ways to fix it. The other day I hit up against a new and unforeseen problem \u2014 it went totally dead on me just as a cold snap kicked in. I forgot to pay the internet bill. I know one thing: My old thermostat was immune to my own idiocy, didn\u2019t play games with me or jeopardize my plumbing and I didn\u2019t need to pore through a manual to figure it out. We are giving it one more chance before we ditch it. Ditto Sonos. The stereo speakers are wireless and portable, so you can play music throughout your house from your iPhone, without having to hire a contractor to embed speakers in your walls or sell you some fancy and expensive system. But often \u2014 usually when we\u2019re throwing a dinner party \u2014 the speakers will stop playing as the app goes on the fritz for prolonged periods without obvious reason. (And customer support isn\u2019t all that supportive.) That never happened with my old Sony hi-fi. One more ruined playlist during a party and I\u2019m out.What\u2019s one app you can\u2019t live without?Surfline. It\u2019s not the only app to give you surf conditions and predictions, and it\u2019s not the only good one. But its easy-to-digest ratings \u2014 \u201cgood,\u2019\u2019 \u201cfair,\u2019\u2019 \u201cpoor\u201d \u2014 are great for committed surfers with the unfortunate affliction of a day job. The app offers plenty of data and has a wealth of surf cams from breaks around the world, so you can see the swell before you go \u2014 or stare longingly at your home break when you\u2019re in another meeting and your editor\u2019s all, like, blah, blah, blah.

{"Headline": "The Duck That Came In From the Cold", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCity KitchenFor a succulent winter meal, steam duck legs, then roast them and serve with a crunchy, spicy persimmon salad.Until I changed my mind.Some Chinese cookbooks recommend steaming duck before roasting it to crisp the skin. It is a good technique to master. Steaming yields moist, tender duck, and it provides bonus ingredients to save for later: the liquid left in the steaming pot contains a fair amount of rendered duck fat and a small amount of concentrated duck broth. The two will separate when refrigerated.I seasoned the legs with a blend of toasted Sichuan pepper and salt and left them to cure for a few hours before cooking. Many pasta pots, mine included, come with a steaming basket insert. A few crushed cinnamon sticks and star anise pods in the basket would perfume the duck as it steamed. Sichuan pepper, unlike black pepper, is not spicy; it is pungent, floral and tingling, and makes almost anything taste better. (Try it with roasted chicken.) To make it, toast Sichuan peppercorns and flaky salt in a dry skillet over medium heat, then grind them to a coarse powder.Before roasting the duck legs, I whisked up a simple glaze for them, with soy sauce, brown sugar, sesame oil and a bit of the fermented spicy bean paste doubanjiang.I wanted a bright, juicy salad of winter fruits to accompany the duck. Persimmons, oranges and pomegranate tossed with daikon, Serrano chile, lime juice, ginger and sesame oil provided a kicky contrast to the crisp-roasted duck. (Be sure to use Fuyu persimmons, which can be eaten unripe. The long, pointy Hachiya persimmon must be completely ripe to be palatable.) As we sat down to dinner, it was still drizzling outside. Perfect weather for duck, without a doubt.Advertisement"}

Nearly a dozen Indian cookbooks geared toward the kitchen tool have appeared in the last year. There are more electric-pressure-cooker cookbooks for Indian food than for any other cuisine \u2014 or for keto, paleo and vegan cooking.There may be no more perfectly satisfying treat than a Canadian butter tart.

Conflicts over this long-handled cooking tool have fostered a social-media meme, a front in the #MeToo movement and a handcrafted version that costs $250.The renowned musician and composer found the music at his local Japanese restaurant to be thoughtless, so he suggested to the chef that he could take over the job of choosing it, without pay, if only so he could feel more comfortable eating there.In April, before Mario Batali faced additional allegations of sexual misconduct in New York and Boston, the celebrity chef considered his business options. He is one of many prominent men brought down by the #MeToo movement. \u201cHe identified with the grunts, portraying himself as a slinger of cheap steaks and French fries. The grunts, in turn, identified with him, not because of his contributions as a chef \u2014 who can name an Anthony Bourdain dish? \u2014 but because he told the world what the work was really like. And once he left kitchens behind for a career in travel television, he didn\u2019t lead his camera crews on a tour of the world\u2019s most luxurious resorts. He went to Detroit and the Bronx, Libya and Beirut.\u201dThe quarter-sheet pan lets the home cook multitask. You may be able to fit four in your oven all at once, which makes them highly flexible when you want to cook several things at the same time. Anthony Bourdain, whose darkly funny memoir about life in New York City restaurant kitchens made him a celebrity chef and touched off his second career as a journalist, food expert and social activist, was found dead in a hotel room.Advertisement"}

The sleek, minimalist White Hotel, which opened in July 2017 on the main island of S\u00e3o Miguel, is a notable exception. Its whitewashed public spaces and its 10 design-centric rooms offer little in the way of color to distract from the ultra-blue ocean, vibrant greenery and volcano-formed caldera lakes of the North Atlantic islands. Though other popular sights on S\u00e3o Miguel, like Furnas and Sete Cidades, tend to be cool, misty and wooded, the White capitalizes on its sweeping waterside views and starkly contrasting design to evoke more tropical Mediterranean isles. LocationSet in a 17th-century volcanic rock manor house once used for winemaking, the White\u2019s lobby and terrace opens to dramatic views of the Atlantic Ocean. Fishermen cast out from the rocks, and swells roll out from the scalloped mini-bay the hotel is set within. The White is about 20 minutes from Ponta Delgada\u2019s city center and five minutes from the neighborhood beach.The RoomA large-scale custom macram\u00e9 work by the Lisbon artist Diana Meneses Cunha \u2014 rope shot through with twigs and blue cotton accents \u2014 was suspended from the ceiling, dividing the seating and bed areas of our ocean-view suite. The bed featured linens of soft Portuguese cotton, although we very much missed a flat sheet. A gray sleeper sofa sat under a mirror with a big distressed-wood frame. What looked like a closet opened up into a full kitchenette, complete with baking dishes. A small balcony overlooking the terrace and ocean below held a simple white bistro table and two chairs. Only a TV mounted awkwardly on a corner of the wall broke the careful minimalism of the d\u00e9cor. The BathroomThe bathroom, painted gray for a weathered-exterior look, was huge and high-ceilinged, although its fluorescent lighting was less than flattering. A small step stool and a rustic wooden ladder, which proved useful for hanging clothes and drying swimsuits, were the bathroom\u2019s only furnishings. The sink, a dark-wood bowl, stood out as an interesting design touch.AmenitiesAlthough the hotel\u2019s official check-in time was 2 p.m., the staff made our room available at 8 a.m., when my husband and I arrived from our red-eye flight, so we could restore ourselves immediately with a nap. The room had no phone, but a Samsung tablet was provided both for using the free Wi-Fi and, if needed, contacting the front desk. The minibar featured No Fork brand pretzels, cashews, peanuts, gummy candies, chocolate crinkles and butterfly puff cookies (2.60 to 3.60 euros). Drinks on offer were local Laranjada Melo Abreu and Kima passion fruit soda, along with Fever Tree soda water and Coke (all 2.50 euros). Morning beverages were available for, surprisingly, an extra charge: Gorreana teas from one of the island\u2019s own tea plantations for 1 euro, along with Nespresso coffee pods for 2 euros.Dining Exposed black volcanic basalt rock is to the Azores, what exposed brick is to many other cities, and the intimate 14-seat restaurant Cardume dramatized itself with a full wall of it. Dinner featured typical Azorean flavors in elevated dishes \u2014 fish confit with passion fruit sauce (26 euros), slow-cooked pork shoulder with caramelized local pumpkin and sweet potato (32 euros), and a sweet potato brownie with lime ice cream (12 euros). I indulged in a tall, thick glass of passion fruit juice, while my husband had a gin and tonic made extra-spicy with local Azor gin. The complimentary breakfast the next morning included yogurt with granola, fruit and six other small jars of toppings like a seed mix; local cheese and meat; Portuguese biscuits; scrambled eggs; banana pancakes and fresh mango juice.Bottom LineWhite Exclusive Suites & Villas; Rua Rocha Quebrada 10, Ponta Delgada, Azores, Portugal; +351 296 249 153; whiteazores.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Trump Should Listen to the Old Guard", "Date": "2018-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA generation of postwar foreign policy leaders is passing from the scene.Ms. Giacomo is a member of the editorial board.They are in their 80s and 90s now, national security titans from years past when certain values were broadly shared, like the imperative of America\u2019s global leadership and the nation\u2019s commitment to democracy, diplomacy and the North Atlantic alliance. In various ways, they have continued to try to shape national security policy even after leaving office. All are moderates reflecting varying realist, internationalist, pragmatic and political tendencies. They value America\u2019s alliances, especially with Europe; believe in American strength but not winner-take-all dominance; support working within the United Nations and other multinational institutions; understand the sustained effort needed to build trust with friends and manage adversaries; include human rights and rule of law as part of the agenda; and recognize the limits of cozying up to despots. Some of these values \u2014 particularly the last \u2014 were observed mainly in the breach when these officials held high office. Still, individually and sometimes in groups, they have brought reason, experience and a sense of history to bear on national security debates.That\u2019s a valuable contribution in an era when President Trump and his enablers are trampling on the values, norms, institutions, treaties and relationships that have maintained Western stability and democracy for decades. Mr. Trump may not care what these gray eminences have to say, but Congress and the public should listen and learn.Along with President Ronald Reagan, Mr. Shultz and Mr. Gorbachev were central to Cold War efforts to reduce the risk of nuclear war, and they are now pleading with Mr. Trump not to abandon the treaty but to \u201cpreserve and fix it.\u201d The alternative, they argue, is \u201ca new arms race, undermining strategic stability and increasing the threat of miscalculation or technical failure leading to an immensely destructive war.\u201dI cut my foreign policy teeth as a correspondent for Reuters first covering Congress, then traveling the world with eight secretaries of state, starting with Mr. Shultz in the late 1980s. Before interviewing him, I struggled to devise questions that would make news while avoiding a filibuster on foreign policy arcana. I usually failed, and I\u2019m richer for it. Then he laid down rules for effective diplomacy wholly at odds with Mr. Trump\u2019s approach: Be discreet, since much important work between states is done in private. Pick your battles carefully. Compromise on small points in service of winning the important ones. Most successful agreements are based on mutual advantage, not zero-sum outcomes.As these leaders pass from the scene, it will be left to a new generation to find a way forward from the wreckage Mr. Trump has already created.Advertisement"}

Reimagining the scallops as miniature filets mignons makes sense, non?The whole affair comes together in less than 30 minutes. The scallops are generously dusted with the three-pepper mixture and saut\u00e9ed on both sides in butter over medium-high heat.

{"Headline": "The Fight for and Against Australian Secrecy", "Date": "2018-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter 85______But publishing news about this case is illegal.Judges in Australia and some other countries, including Britain, often issue gag orders that temporarily restrict the publication of information related to a criminal proceeding on the grounds that it might sway jurors or potential jurors.Sometimes, judges even require the existence of these orders to be kept secret.In this case, something unusual is happening \u2014 the sweep of the restrictions is so all-encompassing that the conflict between the public\u2019s right to know and the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial is rippling across the internet and the world, touching news outlets and institutions in distant countries.If you\u2019re not in Australia, you may have already read recent coverage of the case.If you are in Australia or depend on online news from international organizations like The New York Times, The Associated Press or Reuters, you probably know nothing about it.Gag orders, also known as suppression orders, are supposed to work that way. They usually apply to speech within a specific jurisdiction.But the global nature of the internet has blurred the lines, giving local judges the power to threaten any website accessible to local residents, regardless of where the site or its journalists are based.That includes The Times: The Times is not publishing the latest news of the case online, and it blocked delivery of the Friday print edition to Australia, to comply with the judge\u2019s order. The Times\u2019s lawyers in Australia have advised the organization that it is subject to local law because it maintains a bureau in the country.Two Times journalists who have been covering the case would be at risk. The judge in the case has threatened journalists with contempt of court charges, which can bring up to five years in prison.Some publications that have published the news have no full-time staff in Australia and face no such risk. Even naming them appears to be illegal.But the battle reaches beyond one particular case. It\u2019s a contest of competing democratic values.The core debate is an old one, pitting the right of the accused to a fair trial against the right of free speech, and of the public to know what\u2019s going on in the courtroom. Those poles are not mutually exclusive: Trials in Australia, as in the United States, are usually both open and fair.\u201cWhat you need for a fair trial are fair and unbiased jurors, not people who have been kept in the dark,\u201d said Kurt Wimmer, a media and technology lawyer who is a partner with Covington and Burling in Washington.Because of the way technology has shifted the media landscape, gag orders now raise additional questions of scale and geography. The question now is whether a local judge, in protecting the right to a fair trial, should have the unilateral authority to silence journalists and publishers around the globe.In the case at hand, a criminal matter involving someone whose previous position of power touched the lives of millions all over the world, the stakes are especially high. The defendant is well known, having played a public role with issues and institutions that inspire strong emotions, making bias harder to stamp out.On the other side are not just journalists, but also those who were affected by the defendants\u2019 actions over many years in many places. They demand accountability, and also claim a right to know, seeing secrecy as an accomplice to the crimes of the case.A few news outlets without personnel or a corporate presence in Australia \u2014 and therefore no legal obligation or vulnerability \u2014 have already reported the case\u2019s latest developments online. On Twitter and Facebook, where the news can be found but is not ubiquitous, there has been praise from some Australians that the news was posted, and criticism from others worried that publication has jeopardized justice.Other attempts to maneuver within the law have varied. One news site published the news online but tried to block access to the article in Australia. The New York Times published the news in its American print editions, but not online, while Australian media outlets have tried to sidestep the issue, boldly calling out the court\u2019s restrictions while avoiding mention of the underlying news.Several newspapers published front-page editorials this week. One led with a large-font headline that said: \u201cCensored.\u201dThe court, in turn, has been strictly enforcing limits within a common framework.Suppression orders that completely ban coverage related to continuing sensitive prosecutions have become more frequent in many parts of Australia. It happens more often when there are two related trials in close succession and the goal is obvious: to prevent the risk of prejudice by juries, and to ensure that accusers and the accused can have their cases heard without being undermined at trial or on appeal.But, international lawyers note, there are other ways to accomplish that. In the United States, the First Amendment prohibits prior restraint on publication in nearly all instances. Courtrooms are rarely closed, and those that are shut mostly involve cases with classified information.For the most sensitive, dangerous or high-profile cases, such as O. J. Simpson\u2019s murder trial, juries are sequestered. They are kept in a hotel away from the internet, television and other media when not in court, and ordered not to discuss the case with anyone.In Australia, too, there are states \u2014 Queensland, for one \u2014 that rarely muzzle the media to provide an extra layer of protection for a fair trial. But in Victoria, the location of this particular case, suppression orders have become fairly routine.Hundreds of cases each year in Victoria are subject to such orders, according to court statistics \u2014 a trend that began in the 1990s with dozens of overlapping murder cases involving organized crime. And the scope of these prohibitions tends to be broad. In many cases, they bar all information derived from legal proceedings, including ancillary issues that appear to have little to do with protecting the defendant, like a judge\u2019s ruling on challenges to the gag order itself.Some legal experts in Australia say that such orders reflect a misplaced lack of faith in jurors\u2019 ability to reach a fair conclusion without being influenced by coverage or related cases.\u201cWe should trust juries, and we should give clear instructions,\u201d said Bruce Baer Arnold, a law professor at the School of Law and Justice at the University of Canberra. He added that this was the standard in the United States, as in most of Australia. \u201cTake the law seriously. Obey instructions. You make your decision on the basis of the argument and the basis of the facts.\u201dJournalists and scholars have also argued that there is another problem with prohibiting publication of facts about such a significant case: the suppression of criticism and accountability.Several lawyers in Victoria declined to be quoted about the issues raised by this case, even generally, fearing they would run afoul of the judge.Members of the public who have already spent months in court observing the case\u2019s progress have also been silenced, unable to share their conclusions with the world when they are most relevant and likely to be respected.For now, one judge in an Australian court is altering how the world sees a global figure accused of serious crimes. To preserve a local media blackout, he and the case\u2019s lawyers, who have supported the media ban, demand that the rest of the world not publicly debate their competence or the man being prosecuted to ensure, as much as possible, fair treatment in court.To some, that suppression of information will be seen as a triumph of justice, a noble win for local self-determination and the rule of law.To others it will be seen as an act that, however well intended, undermines transparency and accountability in a case that much of the world would desperately like to discuss.______Let us explain.______Sometimes celebrity isn\u2019t all it\u2019s cracked up to be.______Why do some people get stuck in fear to the point of debilitating anxiety and stress, developing post-traumatic stress disorder or other panic disorders, while others seem to become more, well, fearless?______Fun and serious coverage abounds.

{"Headline": "The Impolite Realities of Observing Police Abuse", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI stepped outside of work to get a slice of pizza \u2014 and ended up embroiled in an all-too-common case of aggressive policing. Mr. Smith is on the staff of The New York Times Opinion section. Port Authority Police officers approached those of us filming and told us not to interfere. The other person next to me filming, a young-looking Latino man wearing a beanie hat, kept his distance, but loudly protested. \u201cI got the right to record all I want,\u201d he shouted. \u201cI don\u2019t have to step off the sidewalk. Freedom of speech.\u201d He then called the officers \u201cpigs,\u201d lacing his taunts with profanity.When I asked a nearby police officer his name and what prompted the clamor, he threatened me with arrest for blocking the sidewalk, at which point I identified myself as a New York Times journalist just trying to observe.The officers\u2019 focus then turned toward the Latino man in the beanie, who continued to trade barbs with the five or so officers slowly surrounding him. He swiveled from side to side, waving his phone in a panoramic motion, its lens now serving as his shield.I walked off toward the spot where the black man was detained to ask others if they\u2019d seen what started the commotion. Within moments, I heard the clang of a body hitting the metal barricades behind me.The Latino man in the beanie was pinned to the ground by four officers, one of them crushing the man\u2019s neck and head into the concrete while another gave him quick blows to the side, as yet another cuffed him and a fourth twisted his leg.\u201cAll right, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry, man \u2014 just let me go home, please,\u201d the man pleaded. \u201cLittle late,\u201d one of the officers said, tightening the cuffs.A plainclothes officer approached me and pushed away my phone. \u201cSir, you want to go to jail?\u201d he threatened. \u201cStop recording.\u201dThis time, I stopped. When asked why the man in the beanie had been arrested, the officer limply offered, \u201cDisorderly conduct.\u201dWith the sinking feeling that his response was most likely the first step in an attempt by the police to cover for themselves, I returned to work and began to do a little digging.In response to my inquiries, the Port Authority said through its press office that the matter had been referred to the agency\u2019s independent Office of the Inspector General. \u201cWe hold our officers to the highest standards,\u201d the statement says. \u201cAnd any conduct that would require disciplinary action will be addressed following the conclusion of the investigation.\u201dThe police also wrote in their official complaint that Mr. Espinosa, while in custody on the way to the hospital, \u201crepeatedly kicked\u201d an officer, hurting his hand. Mr. Espinosa is contesting all the charges and has declined to plead guilty to reduced non-felony charges. Citing privacy concerns, Ms. Phipps would not provide me with any further personal information about Mr. Espinosa. The facility commander of the Port Authority Police declined to comment in response to inquiries about Mr. Espinosa\u2019s initial felony-assault charge.While the truth of what happened on the way to Bellevue Hospital may end up a matter of Mr. Espinosa\u2019s word versus that of the Port Authority police officers, the police\u2019s less than forthright characterization of Mr. Espinosa\u2019s arrest suggests this incident may be yet another case of excessive force by New York City public safety officers.Mr. Espinosa may be a less sympathetic character than the young mother. But his original offense \u2014 using obscene language \u2014 is a violation typically punished with a ticket and a fine, not an elbow to the face. (I\u2019ve seen white men I grew up with in the South and Northeast do much worse in the presence of the police without reprimand, and I\u2019ve heard students of color at protests on elite college campuses call officers equally harsh names to their faces without being tackled.)Talmon Joseph Smith is on the staff of The New York Times Opinion section.

{"Headline": "Lean In\u2019s Sheryl Sandberg Problem", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe door to the Lean In office in Palo Alto, Calif., has Sheryl Sandberg\u2019s name on it. The email addresses for Lean In employees bear her initials. And millions of dollars in funding every year for the women\u2019s empowerment organization comes from her.But inside, surrounded by wall art reminding women to be bold, the Lean In staff has a singular message: Ms. Sandberg now has little to do with the group she founded.The sentiment extends beyond Silicon Valley. \u201cSheryl\u2019s not really Lean In,\u201d said Emily Schwarz, who runs Lean In Atlanta, a group of about 2,000. \u201cWe are Lean In.\u201dFor Ms. Sandberg, 49, none of this was the plan. She was widely expected to leave Facebook after the 2016 election and work for President Hillary Clinton, perhaps as secretary of the Treasury. When Mrs. Clinton lost, Ms. Sandberg continued at the company just as it became engulfed in crises.After an initial interview, Ms. Thomas emailed to say Ms. Sandberg remains \u201ca driving force behind all we do\u201d and has for years discussed making her own brand less central to Lean In. Through a Facebook spokeswoman, Ms. Sandberg declined to comment.Lean In inspired outrage from the start.But Ms. Sandberg\u2019s message largely won over the feminist mainstream, and she became one of its iconic leaders. According to the organization, more than 40,000 Lean In Circles now meet regularly around the world, from Fremont County, Wyo., to New Delhi and Paris.Some were drawn to Lean In exactly because of Ms. Sandberg\u2019s business success. They wanted more economic power, and here was a mother of two who had figured it out and whom they could aspire to be like.\u201cYou\u2019re looking at someone who\u2019s in Silicon Valley, a billionaire, one of the most powerful people in the world,\u201d said Julene Allen, describing why she founded Lean In Dayton in Ohio. \u201cHow can I be more influential?\u201dThat tipped the delicate balance of having a corporate leader as a feminist leader.\u201cAll people in power have potential to be corrupted by it, and women are no different,\u201d Ms. Westervelt said. \u201cYour social movement can\u2019t be led by a C.E.O. or the C.O.O.\u201dWhen I attended a few Lean In Circle meetings in 2013 and 2014, most of us had Ms. Sandberg\u2019s book \u2014 with her face on the cover \u2014 on our laps.Her life story inspired us, a group of mid-20s professionals in San Francisco confronting workplace challenges for the first time. And I found the advice, like to stop insulting my own work and to not be afraid of being disliked, useful.The manifesto, which was full of intimate anecdotes, made Ms. Sandberg a household name. It took her out of simply being Facebook\u2019s No. 2 and reframed her as a thought leader and, many fans thought, a potential candidate for president.In Silicon Valley, Ms. Sandberg became the social nexus for a collective of powerful women who met regularly for dinners at her house. At the events, she often invited a guest of honor and did a casual interview, the two in armchairs in front of 30 or so female guests who held plates on their laps.But what has changed is that some of those leaders and even friends of Ms. Sandberg\u2019s are playing down her role, and positioning her as a peripheral character to the movement.\u201cFrom the very beginning, Sheryl drew people in,\u201d said Deborah Gruenfeld, a professor at Stanford and a co-director of the university\u2019s Executive Program in Women\u2019s Leadership. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think of her as all that central to what\u2019s happening right now.\u201dAlexa Crisa, a digital strategist who leads Lean In Atlanta alongside Ms. Schwarz, told me: \u201cWe don\u2019t work at Facebook, we work with Lean In. We only ever even mention who Sheryl is to explain why her experience is relevant to women. That\u2019s where it ends to us in terms of the mention of Sheryl.\u201dThese women were ones Lean In suggested I call.Most anyone not on its list had a different take. Gia Punjabi, a senior finance analyst at Levi Strauss & Company, founded a Lean In Circle in San Francisco in August 2017. She said that she had noticed a recent drop in interest, and that she suspected it was tied to Ms. Sandberg\u2019s changing brand.\u201cAt the end of the day, Lean In is something that\u2019s integrated with Sheryl\u2019s name,\u201d Ms. Punjabi said. \u201cYou can\u2019t know one without the other.\u201dMany in Ms. Sandberg\u2019s corner argue that the news coverage of her role at Facebook has been unfair. They say it is sexist and focused more on Ms. Sandberg than on Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s founder and chief executive. Some I spoke with called the claims that she was involved in nefarious behavior false news.\u201cIt\u2019s starting to sound a little bit like a witch hunt,\u201d said Nuala Murphy, the founder of Lean In Belfast in Northern Ireland and chief executive of Moment Health, a health technology start-up.Kathy Andersen, the executive director of the Women\u2019s Fund Miami-Dade in Florida, said the media was trying to fool women into disavowing one of their advocates.\u201cWomen are not fooled by the gender-biased tear-down of Sheryl that\u2019s happening,\u201d Ms. Andersen said. \u201cThey\u2019re fueled by it.\u201dThe critical articles about Ms. Sandberg are rooted in sexism, said Shelley Correll, a professor of sociology at Stanford and the director of the Clayman Institute for Gender Research.\u201cFlawed people were involved in the civil rights movement,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t give up on a movement because people aren\u2019t perfect.\u201dOne chilly day in November, I visited the Lean In office, in an open-air shopping center above a Bar Method in Palo Alto. There, I met Ms. Sandberg\u2019s longtime friend Ms. Thomas, who led me past a \u201cProceed and Be Bold\u201d sign and into a room called \u201cPeople First.\u201d\u201cHas Sheryl inspired a lot of what we do here? Of course,\u201d Ms. Thomas said. \u201cBut it\u2019s really grown way beyond Sheryl.\u201dShe added that moving beyond Ms. Sandberg\u2019s name was always the agenda for Lean In and was what Ms. Sandberg had wanted. (When I later called another founding member of the Lean In team, she laughed and disputed that characterization. Ms. Sandberg is the organization\u2019s sole source of funding, and no other figures have stepped in to take her place.)Ms. Thomas talked about what Lean In was doing now. The organization had published a fourth annual study with McKinsey called \u201cWomen in the Workplace,\u201d and has created a new workplace justice-oriented deck of cards called 52 Ways to Fight Bias. On the front of each card is a microaggression, like the female executive who is mistaken for a more junior figure; on the back is why it happened, why it matters and what to do.We circled back to Ms. Sandberg\u2019s work at Facebook. Wasn\u2019t it always risky, I asked, to have someone leading such a large company also leading a movement fighting for workplace equality?\u201cI\u2019m curious,\u201d Ms. Thomas said. \u201cYou\u2019re a smart, engaged woman on all of this \u2014 why is that hard for you?\u201dIt\u2019s hard, I replied, to reckon with the idea that we have taken life and career advice from someone who could be building something that\u2019s not good for the world.For a beat, Ms. Thomas sat silent and looked right at me.She later brought up a study, which she wanted to make clear was apropos of nothing and was part of an \u201cintellectual conversation,\u201d about how we perceive women in power who do something bad.\u201cWomen candidates had an edge out of the gate because people assumed that women were more ethical,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if women did something that was perceived as less ethical, the fall was \u2014.\u201dMs. Thomas stopped herself and did not finish the sentence.She picked up again: \u201cIt was just interesting the complexity around gender and expectations.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "New York\u2019s Top 10 New Restaurants of 2018", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRestaurantsIn an unsettling year, Pete Wells finds many reasons to cheer. Staying focused on the soups and pies wasn\u2019t always easy this year. At the same time, everybody who writes about restaurants was still trying to metabolize last year\u2019s dismal revelations about the way some major chefs and proprietors are said to treat women in their establishments. We all know that we are in a new place, but its contours aren\u2019t firm yet. Each new turn in those stories started a fresh round of questions about restaurant culture and what its future should look like. Simultaneously, incidents of overt racism, sexism and anti-immigrant animus in the national news made it seem more urgent to face those problems in the restaurant business, where they are often so deeply embedded that they\u2019re taken for granted. But after I\u2019d complained in print that hoteliers and developers were handing too many plum projects to the same people who\u2019ve always gotten them, I was glad that a major builder in Brooklyn gave Missy Robbins the chance to build Misi in the redevelopment of the Domino refinery site. I was thrilled that when the Life Hotel couldn\u2019t make its new restaurant, Henry, work, it called in J.J. Johnson, a black chef with ambitious ideas about African food.And sometimes, I got to cheer for an entire cuisine. This year I watched a chef and his wife, both born in South Korea, open a restaurant that presents Korean food and culture in a new and often revelatory light. Its name is Atomix, and it easily won its spot at the top of my list.\u2605\u2605\u2605A restaurant isn\u2019t a particularly good medium for expressing philosophical concepts, but it\u2019s ideal for expressing a whole culture. Atomix seizes this opportunity to open our eyes to South Korea over the span of a $175, 10-course tasting menu. The architecture, uniforms, ceramics, glassware, woodworking and menu art blend tradition and innovation to present a living, modern view of Korean aesthetics. Junghyun Park, the chef, builds dazzling, unexpected dishes out of things like white soy and an exhilarating tangerine vinegar from the island of Jeju. The dishes are elaborate, with upward of 20 ingredients on some plates, but they never go out of focus. The whole restaurant is like that.\u2605\u2605\u2605The chefs, Lee Hanson and Riad Nasr, are veterans of the pseudo-brasserie scene who have finally opened their own restaurant after 20 years of cooking together in someone else\u2019s. Their menu is a skillful and refined homage to the heart-stopping food served at a few old-time places around Les Halles in Paris; it includes snails, brains, tripe, tongue and other things that don\u2019t exactly sell themselves in the United States. This might cause trouble with the chefs\u2019 boss it if they had one, but they don\u2019t, and they know just what they\u2019re doing. The organ meats are beautifully handled. So are less confrontational items like duck breast with paradigmatic fries and roast chicken served over planks of baguette laden with rotisserie drippings. Frenchette also happens to have one of the broadest and most drinkable collections of natural wine in the city. The wines taste idiosyncratic and unbridled, just the thing for food that is a celebration of sticking around long enough to do what you want.\u2605\u2605\u2605New York is filling up with omakase sushi meals so quickly it\u2019s hard to keep them straight, but 69 Leonard Street is one address to write on the back of your hand. The first half of the menu (available at three different lengths costing $190, $252 and $295) weaves some local ingredients into dishes that roughly follow the kaiseki format. This is a chance for the chef, Derek Wilcox, to freestyle a bit within that tradition\u2019s prescribed boundaries, resulting in memorable hybrids like a late-summer chawan mushi made with East Coast lobster. The second half is a sequence of exceptional sushi, sliced and seasoned in the gimmick-free Edo manner. Either the sushi or kaiseki segments alone would be among the best of their type in the city, but the only place that does both this well is Shoji.\u2605\u2605\u2605Missy Robbins has become the city\u2019s leading practitioner of the bright, energetic, produce-centered branch of Italian cooking. Even in the winter, her food tastes like the afternoon sun beating down on a tomato patch. Misi is Missy (get it?) pared down to the things that show her skill off to greatest advantage, pasta and vegetables. The noodles, made on site, are a catalog of shapes, from long strangozzi with pork rag\u00f9 to round, flat corzetti with cherry tomatoes warmed just enough to break their skins. For dessert there are six flavors of gelato, all with the same intensity and immediacy as the rest of the meal.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605The only rough patch at this breakfast-through-dinner cafe comes at the beginning, when your server informs you that every piece of tableware can be purchased at the adjoining shop. After that it\u2019s all as smooth as the melted butter in the pans where the crisp, savory buckwheat crepes are sizzled. Marie-Aude Rose, the chef, applies classical precision to eggs, salads, bouillon, boeuf bourguignon and other French cafe standards, which is more than you can say for some cafes in France.\u2605\u2605Mako Okano, the chef of this little Japanese hide-out on Delancey Street, loves shabu shabu so much that she decided to open a restaurant where she would cook it for every customer. Normally, it\u2019s a do-it-yourself affair, but Ms. Okano\u2019s evident pleasure in taking care of people brings a touching intimacy to the simple process of dunking meat and vegetables into hot broth. The shabu shabu meats are superb, from Wagyu beef crammed with fat streaks to exquisite chicken meatballs. But she has a lovely touch at the stove, too, whipping up an airy omelet before you notice her back is turned, or skimming swatches of yuba from hot soy milk to serve as a warm bed for a tongue or two of sea urchin.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605The Oaxacan food at Claro isn\u2019t the uncut stuff you\u2019d find in Mexico; kale and sunchokes are in play, for one thing. But T.J. Steele, the chef, is serious about his moles, which show off the different traits of various chiles in deep, complex layers. Pork cheek, for instance, is stewed in a mole rojo with a beguiling undercurrent of chocolate. Masa, which can be dismal in New York City, is ground and nixtamalized in the restaurant, and makes a delicious foundation for about half the things on the menu. Mr. Steele, who lives part-time in Oaxaca, has filled the place with items he has brought back, including the plates and a mezcal that he imports.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ukraine Wins New I.M.F. Support as Tensions Rise With Russia", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Ukraine won a new lending commitment from the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday, a lifeline from the West for a country whose economy has been sapped by corruption and war with Russian-backed separatists.Before the new loan was announced, Ukraine had seemed headed toward default with $11 billion in debt coming due within two years.The I.M.F. has been demanding that Ukraine create an independent anticorruption court to crack down on the theft of budget money \u2014 which partly consists of Western aid \u2014 by government insiders. It is also urging the government to raise natural gas prices.The government has said an anticorruption court will be up and running next year.For decades, natural gas subsidies had left Ukraine vulnerable to Russian meddling, as the gas companies whose pipelines enter Ukraine from Russia and the Kremlin had insisted on dealing through middlemen. Some of those middlemen used their profits to finance a political party loyal to Moscow.A genuine market for gas, if it develops, is seen as a long-term solution for providing stability to Ukraine\u2019s economy, either by stimulating companies to tap the country\u2019s own large gas reserves or by importing from a diverse group of suppliers \u2014 rather than relying on a country Ukraine now considers its enemy.The government had resisted raising prices before an election, but agreed in October to increase them by 23 percent. Although the government had pursued the natural gas subsidies, Ukraine\u2019s prime minister, Volodymyr Groysman, said they had hurt the country.\u201cPopulism has led to the weakness of Ukraine,\u201d he said.The new program will last 14 months and will help a fragile recovery in Ukraine\u2019s economy, which is projected to grow by 3.5 percent this year, according to the I.M.F.Iuliia Mendel contributed reporting from Kiev, Ukraine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Airports of the Future Have Arrived", "Date": "2018-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwo of the biggest airports in the world \u2014 Istanbul and Beijing \u2014 aim to make travel easier and faster for the passengers who use them.Air travel is growing in popularity across the world, and the global aviation system is undergoing projects big and small to keep up.\u201cWe\u2019re forecasting that traffic will double in the next 17 years,\u201d said Angela Gittens, director general for Airports Council International (A.C.I. World). \u201cMillions more people will be traveling.\u201dAnd those people, she said, won\u2019t just be in places where flying is already popular. \u201cAn emerging economy now will be an advanced economy later,\u201d Ms. Gittens said.New and expanded airports are needed to meet that demand. Istanbul, for example, has already begun opening its new airport in phases that will eventually be able to accommodate hundreds of millions of travelers a year. When it is completed, it will be the world\u2019s largest. Beijing is set to get its own new airport up and running next year, one that will come close to rivaling Istanbul\u2019s in size and ambition. (It was designed by the architect Zaha Hadid before she died in 2016.) The key to making both airports manageable for passengers, Ms. Gittens said, is taking advantage of technology to facilitate how people and goods pass through them.\u201cWe have to do things more efficiently. We have to have technology work more efficiently for us. We have to figure out how to process passengers, aircraft and cargo more efficiently in the air as well as on the ground,\u201d she said.The airports\u2019 designers agreed, and said that efficiency has to start with the buildings themselves.\u201cWe're starting to arrive at scales which were previously unimaginable for the size of these airport buildings,\u201d said Andrew Thomas, a partner at the architectural firm Grimshaw, which designed the Istanbul airport along with the Nordic Office of Architecture and Haptic Architects. \u201cIt almost doesn't matter what you put in it if the walks are so long that people are exhausted by the time\u201d they get to their gate.The designers of the Beijing airport agreed. \u201cYou keep it on the human scale,\u201d said Cristiano Ceccato, an associate director and director of aviation at Zaha Hadid Architects.  Ms. Gittens said that technological innovations will help passengers navigate the buildings more quickly and efficiently.\u201cI think one of the things we can really expect is that biometrics will be used throughout the entire process. If you can avoid people having to stop and queue \u2014 stopping and queuing takes up space \u2014 if people can move, they don't need as much space,\u201d she said.Mr. Thomas agreed that biometrics, including facial recognition technology, will likely take on a bigger role as those technologies develop, but he said other systems already exist that make airports more efficient than they used to be. For example, he said, automation is making it quicker and less stressful for most travelers to check in. \u201cThe process, as it becomes automated, becomes much more simple,\u201d he said. Istanbul will still have check-in staff, \u201cbut they move from behind the desks and they deliver much more personal customer service.\u201d Ms. Gittens said that kind of technology also makes airports more flexible, as multiple airlines can share the physical infrastructure more easily.Beijing\u2019s airport is taking automated check-in even further, according to Mr. Ceccato. Normally, he said, airports have two levels: one for departures and one for arrivals. But Daxing International will have a third floor with a new format.\u201cA purely self-processing level for domestic travelers \u2014 no ticket agents or anything,\u201d Mr. Ceccato said. \u201cThey realized that the full service check-in that you have upstairs, most people don\u2019t need that anymore. They just need to get on with it much like they\u2019re taking a train. That is a big facilitation to making the travel as seamless as possible.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the distinction of the Istanbul airport. When Beijing's airport is completed, it will not eclipse Istanbul in size. Istanbul will remain the world's largest.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Japan Offers Lessons in Eating, Walking and Bridging the Distance", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe 52 Places TravelerOur 52 Places columnist tries on traditional robes and footwear; learns to enjoy seafood (as long as it\u2019s not chewy); and discovers (once again) how small the world is.I had spent some 39 years of my life believing I knew how to walk, but click-clacking down the streets of Kinosaki, Japan, in geta sandals, I wasn\u2019t so sure anymore.As I ventured outside, I heard loud, assured click-clacking behind me \u2014 two women in the same outfit that I was wearing. They were sisters from Singapore and moved like gazelles in their getas. I wobbled behind them, and then nearly lost my footing as I took in the scene near the lantern-lit Otani River winding through the city. It was a veritable thoroughfare of yukatas and getas, in an array of colors, on visitors young and old, shuffling, striding and practically skipping through the night.People come from all over Asia and beyond to soak in Kinosaki\u2019s seven onsen, or public hot spring baths, and pretty much everyone does it walking around in a robe all day. The city is one big inn. The ryokan you stay in is your individual room and the streets are like the inn\u2019s corridors. It\u2019s all very romantic until it hails and rains.I had come to Kinosaki, on the western coast of Honshu, Japan\u2019s biggest island, though, not for dressing up, but on a kind of pilgrimage. As a Japanese friend put it to me in an email, \u201cDon\u2019t they have that Buddha that\u2019s only unveiled to the public every 33 years?\u201dBefore modern medicine, ill people would trek to Onsenji temple, pray to the spirit of Dochi Shonin, and then bathe, naked, with a wooden ladle in the hot springs. Once there, the ritual is to strip down, shower while sitting and then soak in those healing waters, surrounded by bodies of all shapes and sizes. (Onsen are divided into all-male and all-female sides.) I was struck with the ease of nudity, how young girls splashed around with their mothers and big sisters and grandmothers, and what an impact that must make on their self-image, to know that bodies are all different and we all have one. The hot spring water warmed away the foul weather.As I left, I put on my yukata, thinking of the words I\u2019d heard in the ryokan: left-side over right, \u201cO.K., O.K., O.K.,\u201d and stepped out into the thoroughfare that seemed like a reversal of time. The onsen were a little hot for me, but I could walk around in a robe forever.His name was Sushi Tiger. He was 76 and he\u2019d been studying the art of cutting raw fish for 50 years. Why didn\u2019t I come in and take a seat?Sushi Tiger, who also goes by Takashi, wrapped a twisted white bandana around his forehead as he prepared my dinner. He spoke little English and I spoke almost no Japanese, so we communicated by writing on napkins, pointing at a sign with pictures of sushi and Google Translate, which is even more hopeless at Japanese than it is at other languages. At one point he brought out a book of cartoons used for teaching English to school children and taught me a few Japanese phrases, while serving me sake. I was glad to be his only customer.I am not an adventurous eater, particularly when it comes to seafood; I was a vegetarian for a long time, in New Mexico, which has no sea. But when I set out on this 52 Places trip, I made a vow to overcome my pickiness, which meant eating a few insects and a small slice of wallaby (I still feel guilty). Japan, I thought, would really test those limits.In my Kinosaki ryokans, at lavish kaiseki dinners, the learning curve was steeper. I\u2019d sit down to a tray filled with 20 little plates and no one who spoke English to guide me through them. What order was I supposed to eat them in? Did any of them get dipped in soy sauce? So I\u2019d try first and ask questions later. It turns out I am not a fan of preserved fish eggs melded into a rectangular cake, but I\u2019m O.K. with tender fish intestines.The big reason Kinosaki still has such a thriving Asian tourism business in the winter is that snow crab season starts in November, and lasts only a few months. People come for the crab and stay for the onsen. A good crab can sell for up to $300.Before long, the 79-year-old, English-speaking owner, Yatsui Kiyoshi, emerged. When he heard I was on a long trip, he pulled out a weather-beaten Rand McNally atlas and told me he had studied nuclear physics at Cornell, and driven across the United States to spend two years in Los Alamos, N.M.My hometown.He loved the mountains and the tequila but thought it was too hot, and he missed Japan and his family. So he came back to continue a life in nuclear physics and carry out his legacy as a fifth-generation lacquerware artisan. His wife took some pictures of us, which he emailed to me with a note about what a small world it is and how wonderful it had been to find someone with connections to New York and New Mexico. Then he reminded me, for about the fifth time, not to put the chopsticks I\u2019d bought in the microwave.There\u2019s also a surprising lack of trash cans in public spaces. The local expectation is that you pack your trash, and dispose of it when you get to a place with garbage and recycling bins.Previous dispatches:Next dispatch: Chandigarh, IndiaA previous version of this article incorrectly referred to the Kannon, the goddess of mercy in the Buddhist tradition, as a Buddha.

{"Headline": "Is Mueller Building an Expansive Obstruction Case? ", "Date": "2018-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe sentencing memos suggest the possibility that Trump and perhaps others were involved in a series of lies from Paul Manafort and Michael Cohen. Mr. Bauer is a professor of practice and distinguished scholar in residence at New York University School of Law.The court filings on Friday in the Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort cases require reading between the lines. Some lines, redacted, are missing altogether. However, what has been made public calls for reconsidering the longstanding assumptions about President Trump\u2019s potential exposure to a charge of obstruction of justice. That discussion has been dominated by the circumstances around the firing of James Comey, the former F.B.I. director. But Mr. Cohen and Mr. Manafort, along with the former national security adviser Michael Flynn, may now have become central figures in inquiries into whether the president, and perhaps others acting at his guidance, directed, encouraged or acquiesced in lies to criminal and congressional investigators.The new memo suggests that there is more to be known about the White House\u2019s \u2014 and hence, the president\u2019s \u2014 review of that testimony and any potential complicity in the lies that Mr. Cohen subsequently told. Why else would the facts that Mr. Cohen supplied in this respect be \u201csignificant\u201d?Any communications he had with the White House about the testimony would have been important only insofar as there was a discussion of its content. The president would have had a keen interest. It is exceedingly unlikely that he did not know what members of his staff and his lawyers learned about what Mr. Cohen was prepared to say. We also know that Mr. Cohen lied about the Moscow hotel project.While in his plea agreement Mr. Cohen noted that he understood and sought with his lies to bolster one aspect of the president\u2019s public messaging on Russia \u2014 namely, that he had no business dealings with the Putin government \u2014 he did not say anything inconsistent with the possibility that the president knew that Mr. Cohen planned to lie to Congress. Did Mr. Trump encourage Mr. Cohen directly, or through others, to lie about the hotel project, to protect his public account? Or did the president, knowing Mr. Cohen would tell a lie, acquiesce in the false testimony \u2014 signaling with this silence approval, or at least acceptance?In the same week we learned that Michael Flynn, unlike Mr. Cohen and Mr. Manafort, was actively cooperating. It\u2019s not yet in the public record, but one issue on which he is certain to have come clean are the circumstances in which he lied to the F.B.I. about discussions in December 2016 with the Russian ambassador. It is known that Sally Yates, then the deputy attorney general, briefed the White House counsel promptly about the problem with Mr. Flynn\u2019s F.B.I. interview, and Mr. Trump\u2019s press secretary later assured reporters that the president was immediately briefed about \u201cthe situation.\u201dYet weeks passed before the president fired Mr. Flynn, and when he did he did so, he cited lies told to the vice president, not investigators. In other words, Mr. Trump steered clear of holding Mr. Flynn responsible for the criminal offense. Mr. Flynn may have light to shed on the president\u2019s motives for this reticence. Mr. Trump might have avoided addressing publicly the lie to the F.B.I. if he had any part in it \u2014 either by encouraging Mr. Flynn to lie, or because he has been willing to wait out the \u201csituation\u201d and see if Mr. Flynn could get away with it.For some time, the question of obstruction revolved entirely around the true reasons for Mr. Comey\u2019s firing. Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers have argued that the president was within his constitutional rights to fire Mr. Comey for any reason \u2014 and that, in any event, he had such a reason. They point to the controversy over Mr. Comey\u2019s handling of the Clinton email investigation, and they stress that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein provided the president with a particularly damning memorandum making the case for the former director\u2019s breach of departmental procedures and standards.But none of these complexities are present in the Cohen, Manafort and Flynn cases. In those, the president and his agents may have simply sought to undermine lawful inquiries. It bears remembering that when the House Judiciary Committee voted articles of impeachment against Richard Nixon in 1974, Article 1 included a charge against him for lying to Congress. The impeachable conduct was defined to include \u201ccondoning\u201d and \u201cacquiescing in,\u201d not only \u201capproving\u201d and \u201ccounseling,\u201d false testimony. The Cohen, Manafort and Flynn cases may reveal yet another instance of such impeachable, and perhaps prosecutable, acquiescence \u2014 if not more in the nature of \u201capproving\u201d and \u201ccounseling.\u201dBob Bauer is a professor of practice and distinguished scholar in residence at New York University School of Law and served as a White House counsel under President Barack Obama.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Macron, Confronting Yellow Vest Protests in France, Promises Relief", "Date": "2018-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Faced with violent protests and calls for his resignation, President Emmanuel Macron of France said Monday that he had heard the anger of the many whose economic suffering has burst into the open in recent weeks and that he would take immediate steps to relieve their hardship.Mr. Macron\u2019s mea culpa on national television signaled a remarkable step back from his ambitions to reshape France\u2019s economy and become the European Union\u2019s foremost leader. For now, his chief goal is shoring up his own political support in France.He announced tax cuts and income increases for the struggling middle class and working poor, vowing to raise the pay of workers earning the minimum wage. He promised to listen to the voices of the country, to its small-town mayors and its working people.\u201cThere is anger, anger and indignation that many French share,\u201d he said in 13-minute prerecorded speech from the Elys\u00e9e, the presidential palace.Attempting to show that he understood, Mr. Macron acknowledged the anger of \u201cthe couple who earn salaries that do not finish the month, and who get up every day early and come home late.\u201d He sympathized with \u201cthe single mother, a widow, a divorc\u00e9e,\u201d whose life is no longer worth living, he said, and \u201chas no more hope.\u201dMr. Macron recognized the anger too, he said, of retired people of small means who have \u201ccontributed all their lives and often helped both parents and children, and no longer make ends meet.\u201dAnd in a rare admission of having fallen short, he said he took responsibility for having not responded more quickly, saying that he realized that people had the impression that he had \u201cother priorities\u201d and was not concerned about their problems.Mr. Macron said that the details of his relief steps would be announced by Prime Minister \u00c9douard Phillipe in Parliament on Tuesday, but that there would be a supplement of 100 euros, or about $115, to workers earning the monthly minimum wage starting in January; that taxes on overtime pay would be eliminated and that retirees whose earnings are less than 2,000 euros a month, about $2,270, would no longer be asked to pay a recent increase in social security taxes.Whether Mr. Macron\u2019s actions will ease the deep-seated resentment toward him in France was unclear at best. So were the particulars of his proposals, which could translate into less in people\u2019s pockets than he made it sound.Criticisms came quickly from many of Mr. Macron\u2019s political opponents, who said his proposals fell far short of people\u2019s needs. More sobering for Mr. Macron could be the disappointment of many in the Yellow Vests movement who said his proposals did not speak to their needs.While some protesters welcomed the president\u2019s announcements as a first gesture, and a few praised him for his contrition, many more criticized what they called \u201chalf measures.\u201dOn the dozens of Facebook groups dedicated to the movement that have buzzed over the past month, a majority of Yellow Vests protesters said they felt it was too little, too late. A number expressed dismay that he had not even mentioned the Yellow Vests movement by name.\u201cThere are a lot of forgotten,\u201d one user, Bruno Ceneda, said in the movement\u2019s main group. \u201cAnd the others only have the crumbs left.\u201d\u201cHe is kidding us,\u201d said another, Jean-Jacques Brial.Political analysts suggested that appeasing the anger toward Mr. Macron would require significantly more than what he promised.\u201cWhen one listens to the Yellow Vests, one hears many different demands, but there is more and more agreement that Emmanuel Macron should resign,\u201d said Thomas Sn\u00e9garoff, a professor of political science at Sciences Po in Paris. \u201cThe people allude to the French Revolution, \u2018We have to cut off the head of the king.\u2019\u201dAt the same time, many do not believe his departure would improve their situation, suggesting they are not sure themselves what would truly improve their lives.Mr. Macron, elected in 2017 to a five-year term, came into office promising to make France more economically competitive. One of his early moves was to cut taxes on the wealthy to stimulate investment. Such changes alienated many working people who called him a \u201cpresident of the rich.\u201dFor more than a year, Mr. Macron has positioned himself as the natural heir to Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany as the bloc\u2019s dominant political figure. He has put himself forward, at times, as an establishment champion for a Continent besieged by far-right populism and has called for reforming the euro currency union and building a European army.\u201cWith Macron, you had a very ambitious European agenda from a young president urging European renewal and reform,\u201d said Pierre Vimont, a former French ambassador to the United States. \u201cBut here we see a more subdued president facing a difficult situation, and whose prospects to shape the next European Commission are not as good as before.\u201dEarlier in the day, Mr. Macron\u2019s political vulnerability was on full display. He consulted with representatives of the major unions \u2014 a move he had largely spurned before \u2014 and met with business leaders, associations representing local politicians and parliamentary leaders, whose support he will need if he wants to push through new legislation.The notice to reporters announcing the Monday meetings made no pretense about their significance. \u201cAt this serious moment for the nation, the president is bringing together all forces, political, local, economic and social, to hear their voices, their proposals and with the objective of mobilizing them for action,\u201d it said.But Mr. Macron\u2019s assured and sometimes even condescending tone has also backfired. He has often been dismissive of complaints and suggested the complainers were not trying hard enough. That has fed the feeling that he represents the elites and not the vast majority of the French. At the same time, lawmakers in Mr. Macron\u2019s political party have also been criticized for lacking roots in the working class.\u201cHe has been insensitive to the kinds of popular concerns that make people feel they are drowning\u201d said Pascal Perrineau, a professor of political science at Sciences Po. \u201cHe has not been a president who brings people together.\u201dOn Friday though, Mr. Macron began to try.Karl Olive, the mayor of Poissy, a town on the outskirts of the Paris metropolitan area, said Mr. Macron lacked a feel for ordinary people such as those who lived in his town. So he brought a group of mayors from his department, Yvelines, to explain to Mr. Macron how he needed to change.The mayors insisted that Mr. Macron meet with them alone \u2014 and Mr. Olive said the president made a point of taking notes himself. The meeting was scheduled to last two hours, Mr. Olive said, but lasted nearly twice that long. \u201cThe president needs to understand that decisions have to come from the bottom up, the French people do not like it when it is top down,\u201d he said.Mr. Olive said many people in his town are not in the streets but agree with the concerns of the Yellow Vests. Yet, he said, they are open to hearing that Mr. Macron has had a change of heart. \u201cThey are looking for more social justice and a new program. He has to change the goals, but also changing the method is important,\u201d he said.Aurelien Breeden and Elian Peltier contributed reporting from Paris, and Steven Erlanger from Brussels.Advertisement"}

Enough whites did not feel motivated by Mr. Trump\u2019s immigrant bashing to vote for Republicans. On the other hand, millions of Latinos, African-Americans and Asian-Americans were motivated by it to vote for Democrats.Likewise, no real evidence emerged in 2018 of a white base mobilized by attacks on immigrants. This is not to say that millions of white voters do not enthusiastically support Mr. Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant agenda; they do (49 percent said immigrants were a threat to America). But after two years of Mr. Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant policies, their numbers are getting smaller. Nationally, there was no evidence of a surge in white Republican votes for anti-immigrant candidates.As Mr. Trump continues his anti-immigrant agenda in his fight with the likely new House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, it is important not to lose sight of just how thorough the defeat of anti-immigrant candidates was in the midterms. Sure, some anti-immigrant candidates won, but those were mainly in very heavily Republican districts, and even some supposedly safe Republicans lost. Prominent Republicans who championed Mr. Trump\u2019s immigrant bashing lost their election bids, from Kris Kobach in Kansas to Lou Barletta in Pennsylvania, and from Corey Stewart in Virginia to Dana Rohrabacher in California.

{"Headline": "Celebrity Healer in Brazil Is Accused of Sexually Abusing Followers", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byS\u00c3O PAULO, Brazil \u2014 Thousands of Brazilians and foreigners have flocked to the small town of Abadi\u00e2nia in central Brazil for years, lured by tales of a miraculous healer known as John of God who slices into patients without anesthesia and claims to channel spirits of the dead to cure conditions like cancer and chronic depression.In recent days, dozens of women have come forward to accuse the famous medium, whose real name is Jo\u00e3o Teixeira de Faria, of being a serial sexual abuser who preyed on vulnerable patients during would-be healing sessions.Their accounts have upended the image of Mr. Faria, whose global fame exploded after Oprah Winfrey broadcast a profile of him in 2010 and then interviewed him during a visit to his center in 2012.As prosecutors sift through a mounting pile of victim statements, Mr. Faria appears likely to become the first major Brazilian casualty of the #MeToo movement, which so far has reverberated relatively little in Latin America\u2019s largest nation.The scandal began when several women provided similar accounts of unwanted sexual advances in interviews with a Brazilian television show that aired last weekend.On Monday morning, dozens of other women came forward with more reports of uninvited sexual advances to news organizations and to the district attorney\u2019s office in the state of Goi\u00e1s, which set up a task force that includes five prosecutors and two psychologists.In a day and a half, the task force received 78 complaints, said Patr\u00edcia Otoni, one of the prosecutors. \u201cWe have a serious challenge ahead,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to show the victims that they can trust us, that even someone who is famous and internationally admired can be investigated. But we also need to analyze each complaint before rushing to conclusions.\u201dMr. Faria denies the accusations, according to a spokesman, Mario Rosa, who said the mounting accusations had taken on a \u201clynch mob\u201d quality.\u201cIt\u2019s like this person is being turned into a villain for the world to see,\u201d Mr. Rosa said.Mr. Faria\u2019s lawyer, Alberto Toron, expressed skepticism about the number of women making accusations.Mr. Faria\u2019s followers believe he is a medium who channels the spirits of dead doctors and other healers, who guide him to perform what he calls \u201cspiritual surgeries\u201d that cure ailments including sinus infections and paralysis.Ms. Winfrey\u2019s one-on-one interview in 2012, which aired the following year, turbocharged his fame. It is no longer available on her website.\u201cI went to Brazil in 2012 to tape an episode of \u2018Oprah\u2019s Next Chapter\u2019 that explored the controversial healing methods of John of God,\u201d Ms. Winfrey said in a statement. \u201cThe episode aired in 2013. I empathize with the women now coming forward and hope justice is served.\u201dMr. Faria has, in years past, been accused of illegally practicing medicine, but has never been convicted. He faced sexual abuse charges in 2008, but was acquitted.Mr. Faria has not yet been called in for questioning because the investigation is in its early stages, Ms. Otoni said. Yet the accounts gathered so far point to a clear pattern, she said.\u201cThe victims were people in a vulnerable situation who went to him with the hope that he could heal them,\u201d she said. \u201cThe crimes they relate occur behind closed doors and show a similar modus operandi.\u201dThe women interviewed on the program that aired over the weekend said they had been groped and forced to rub Mr. Faria\u2019s penis after being summoned to his private room for individual \u201cspiritual cleansing\u201d sessions.Mr. Faria claims he had his first vision at age 9 and his first experience healing someone when he was 16. Since then, he has performed healing sessions that often include cutting into patients without using anesthesia, confounding doctors who have watched in awe. In video testimonials, followers have said they felt little or no pain during the procedures.As his fame grew, Brazilians and desperate people from around the globe traveled to Abadi\u00e2nia hoping for a miracle.Zahira Lieneke Mous, the only woman who agreed to be identified on the television show, said in the interview that she had traveled to the clinic to heal the trauma from a previous incident of sexual abuse. A Dutch choreographer, she had heard about John of God from a friend and had seen Oprah Winfrey\u2019s documentary.She said she had been summoned for a private consultation with Mr. Faria. Once they were alone, she said, he placed her hands on his penis and instructed her to move them. After that encounter, she said, he invited her to choose a gemstone from his cabinet, and then during a second encounter he forced her to have anal sex.After four years of silence, Ms. Mous went public with her account, posting a long message on Facebook and then appearing on the Brazilian talk show.\u201cI always thought I was the only person \u2014 I was in my own emotional prison,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cWhen I realized I was not alone, I realized it was probably still going on and I had to go public.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Juan Manuel Castro Prieto can still recall \u2014 even a half-century later \u2014 everything his grandfather Pablo taught him about the mysteries of wheat.In those days, Cespedosa de Tormes, the village in western Spain where his parents hailed from, still farmed the age-old ways, requiring the rigor and stamina of an Olympic sport. The crops were sowed by hand, the harvest cut with a sickle and the wheat separated from the chaff \u2014 the grain from the straw \u2014 with the help of a cool wind that arrived, when it arrived, just before dawn. Juan Manuel would join grandfather Pablo, camping out under the stars to await the magic breeze. When it came, it kicked up the light straw, leaving the heavier part of the wheat, the grain, for them to scoop up from the ground.The wheat harvest was just one aspect of life in Cespedosa that captured the young man\u2019s imagination and inspired him to want to become a photographer to savor it forever.He lived for summer and winter holidays spent in Salamanca province, which his parents had left to raise their three children two hours away, in Madrid. Running through the countryside, bathing in the watering holes, climbing ancient, jagged hills, catching fish, traveling by burro, watching the community Christmas pageants \u2014 all of it fired up his artistic soul.\u201cLooking at an indeterminate point in the landscape,\u201d Mr. Castro Prieto said, \u201cI dreamed that when I grew up I would buy a camera to take to Madrid the brightness of the mica in the stones, the acorns between the leaves of the holm oaks and the cows in the meadows.\u201dMr. Castro Prieto\u2019s \u201cCespedosa,\u201d published in 2016 by Auth\u2019 Spirit for Spain\u2019s Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport, is at once a document celebrating a way of life in a particular place, during particular occasions, as it is a portrait of an artist and a homage to our collective humanity. In the soft-color images in this series, where some of the places have long since vanished, he does what he was determined to do as a boy \u2014 save Cespedosa\u2019s memories for the world.The first time he peered through a lens, during a summer rain, Cespedosa\u2019s people, places and things were on the other side. More than 40 years later, as a celebrated 60-year-old photographer (represented by Agency VU), Mr. Castro Prieto travels the world, working on deep-dive projects in Peru, Ethiopia and elsewhere. But his enduring connection to his ancestral village remains an artistic passion and has yielded an extraordinary memoir. Hundreds of images dating from his earliest days as a professional photographer working with a large-format analog camera, to more recent forays into digital color, reveal an elaborate, dreamy exploration of place and time, the details of everyday life amplified by the photographer\u2019s skills.\u201cI have been photographing in Cespedosa for 42 years,\u201d he said. \u201cAt first I couldn\u2019t call it a project \u2014 I photographed in an almost convulsive way, so that no memory would escape. Later I started to work in a methodical way and with clear ideas.\u201dBut the project never ends.\u201cIn reality,\u201d he said, \u201cit is a \u2018project-river\u2019 that receives many moments, many techniques. And that is changing continuously, to the rhythm that I, as a photographer and as a person, I am changing.\u201dAs he always knew, even as a child, the Cespedosa that lives in his soul is slipping away in the real world. \u201cThe threads that joined me to the village are being cut,\u201d he said, \u201cand only the memories that are enclosed in the photograph and in my head remain.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Home Addresses Are Up for Sale. Time to Take Back Your Privacy.", "Date": "2018-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHome addresses have always been public information. But now they\u2019re too easy to search.The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.The ease with which online squabbles can escalate to swatting is made possible by the vast amount of personal information organized by search engines. But just because information is public doesn\u2019t mean it has to be so easy for so many people to get. There are small steps that tech companies and regulators can take to claw back some privacy that Americans have lost to technology. They can begin with the home address.Already, the location of a home is among the most policed speech online. Posting someone\u2019s address is prohibited on mainstream social media sites like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Reddit \u2014\u00a0it\u2019s even banned in more laissez-faire places like 4chan. But search engines put the home addresses of the entire nation a few keystrokes away. And there\u2019s an entirely legal industry that peddles that and other personal information for a price. Search for a name in Google, and you may very well find a number of data brokers offering to sell information for a couple of dollars \u2014 if not offering it up for free.The home address wasn\u2019t always such a sensitive piece of information \u2014\u00a0the once-ubiquitous phone book was considered useful, not dangerous. But times have changed, and the information provided by these new online databases aren\u2019t weaponized only by trolls, but also by stalkers, domestic abusers and criminals. Americans need more control over who knows where they and their families live. Home addresses should not be for sale without the knowledge of and the explicit, meaningful consent of those who live there. And it should be easier to remove information from these databases without having to spend hours tracking it down to every corner of the internet. An intelligent and dedicated pursuer would still be able to track down an address. In many cases, they are public records, after all. But cleaning up the search engines will slow down someone who finds and posts your address in a fit of pique. In the absence of regulation over the sale and purchase of personal data, just a little bit of friction can make a big difference for vulnerable people. Advertisement"}
