{"Headline": "Congress May Have Fallen for Facebook\u2019s Trap, but You Don\u2019t Have To", "Date": "2018-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFacebook has always sold data to advertisers, and it probably always will. Mr. Kosinski is an assistant professor at Stanford University\u2019s Graduate School of Business.As a data scientist, I am shocked that anyone continues to believe this claim. Each time you click on a Facebook ad, Facebook sells data on you to that advertiser. This is such a basic property of online targeted advertising that it would be impossible to avoid, even if Facebook somehow wanted to.Or even better, let Mr. Zuckerberg explain, as he did to the Senate in April: \u201cWhat we allow is for advertisers to tell us who they want to reach, and then we do the placement. So, if an advertiser comes to us and says, \u2018All right, I am a ski shop and I want to sell skis to women\u2019 \u2026 we can show the ads to the right people without that data ever changing hands and going to the advertiser.\u201d Let\u2019s take a closer look at Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s ski shop example. The ski shop pays Facebook to show a targeted ad to women and sends the women to the ski shop\u2019s website if the women click on the ad. Mr. Zuckerberg describes this process as showing \u201cthe ads to the right people without that data ever changing hands and going to the advertiser.\u201d But this isn\u2019t true: If a ski shop pays Facebook to show an ad only to women, then Facebook automatically reveals to the ski shop that all people who clicked on the link must be women. And in practice, the advertisers make requests that are much more nuanced. They may ask Facebook to show their ad to \u201cliberal Latina women without college education who live in San Antonio and recently got married.\u201d And then they might place a separate ad that is shown only to \u201cconservative African-American women with college educations who live in Austin and are single.\u201d When you click on an ad and are sent to an advertiser\u2019s website, the advertiser knows which ad you saw and thus which bucket you fall in.Facebook has a lot of data on their users and is eager to monetize it. The advertisers are encouraged to selectively target people according to a mind-boggling range of personal characteristics. Some, such as age, gender or location, are not overly intimate. Others, such as your political views, family size, education, occupation, marital status or interest in a gay dating app, are highly personal. But Facebook is extremely clever at dodging this issue. When the company argues that it is not selling data, but rather selling targeted advertising, it\u2019s luring you into a semantic trap, encouraging you to imagine that the only way of selling data is to send advertisers a file filled with user information. Congress may have fallen for this trap set up by Mr. Zuckerberg, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to. The fact that your data is not disclosed in an Excel spreadsheet but through a click on a targeted ad is irrelevant. Data still changes hands and goes to the advertiser. Facebook's claiming that it is not selling user data is like a bar\u2019s giving away a free martini with every $12 bag of peanuts and then claiming that it\u2019s not selling drinks. Rich user data is Facebook\u2019s most prized possession, and the company sure isn\u2019t throwing it in for free.Importantly, this problem is not limited to Facebook. Other Big Tech companies, including Google and Amazon, have similar ad platforms. If a platform can be used to target specific users, then it reveals those users\u2019 data. The advertiser could easily create its own data file based on this information, or merge the information with any other data it has on a customer.To address this problem, we need to offer users both transparency and control. Before being directed to an advertiser\u2019s site, users should be told which of their traits were used in targeting them. They should also be warned that, if they continue, these traits will be revealed to the advertiser.Facebook cannot be trusted to fix this problem itself. Would you trust Big Tobacco\u2019s claims about lung cancer? What about Big Sugar\u2019s claims about obesity? Then why would you believe what Big Tech has to say about data privacy? Markets, including the market for consumer data, do not work efficiently when a company like Facebook is allowed to abuse its market position to ignore its users\u2019 rights, needs and wishes. Policymakers have no choice but to step in, restore the balance of power and protect citizens\u2019 privacy.Michal Kosinski is an assistant professor at Stanford University\u2019s Graduate School of Business.

{"Headline": "A.I. as Talent Scout: Unorthodox Hires, and Maybe Lower Pay", "Date": "2018-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne day this fall, Ashutosh Garg, the chief executive of a recruiting service called Eightfold.ai, turned up a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that piqued his interest.It belonged to a prospective data scientist, someone who unearths patterns in data to help businesses make decisions, like how to target ads. But curiously, the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 featured the term \u201cdata science\u201d nowhere.Instead, the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 belonged to an analyst at Barclays who had done graduate work in physics at the University of California, Los Angeles. Though his profile on the social network LinkedIn indicated that he had never worked as a data scientist, Eightfold\u2019s software flagged him as a good fit. He was similar in certain key ways, like his math and computer chops, to four actual data scientists whom Mr. Garg had instructed the software to consider as a model.The idea is not to focus on job titles, but \u201cwhat skills they have,\u201d Mr. Garg said. \u201cYou\u2019re really looking for people who have not done it, but can do it.\u201dThe power of such technology will be immediately apparent to any employer scrambling to fill jobs in a tight labor market \u2014 not least positions for data scientists, whom companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon are competing to attract.Thanks to services like Eightfold, which rely on sophisticated algorithms to match workers and jobs, many employers may soon have access to a universe of prospective workers \u2014 even for hard-to-fill roles \u2014 whom they might not otherwise have come across.And while that could also help some candidates, there\u2019s a potential downside for job seekers: Such algorithms may also lower wages in these fields, said Bo Cowgill, an economist at Columbia University who has studied the use of artificial intelligence in hiring.\u201cYou get the more nontraditional, equally qualified, equally high-performing people,\u201d Mr. Cowgill said. But the employer \u201cdoesn\u2019t seem to have to compete for them as much.\u201dFor years, employers and online intermediaries have used algorithms to help fill job openings, but their methods were often crude. A computer would identify key words on r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, then determine whether those words corresponded to text in job descriptions.While this approach can be more efficient than manually searching a site like LinkedIn, it has drawbacks. Applicants can game the process by larding their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s with terms the machines are likely to be looking for. Conversely, poorly worded job listings could cause computers to overlook qualified candidates.But recent advances in a form of artificial intelligence known as deep learning have made the machines used by some companies, like Eightfold and the online job hub ZipRecruiter, far more powerful. Instead of simply scanning words on a page and matching them to words in a job description, a machine can now identify skills and aptitudes that don\u2019t explicitly appear on a candidate\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9.To illustrate, Mr. Garg points out that about 90 percent of software engineers at the financial software company Intuit in Mountain View, Calif., know the programming language Java, according to data Eightfold has analyzed. That means the machine is on safe ground inferring that an Intuit software engineer knows Java, even if he or she doesn\u2019t list the skill on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9.By performing a similar exercise across an entire r\u00e9sum\u00e9, the company\u2019s software can build a detailed profile of a job applicant. It can extract more than the usual amount of information from categories like education (certain disciplines at less prominent universities, like natural-language processing at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, produce high-achieving workers) and even hobbies (chess players tend to be good at coding, basketball players at sales).Eightfold, which is based in Silicon Valley, also makes a clever trade with clients: to improve its results, Eightfold asks clients to use its human-resources software, which imports employee data in anonymous form. This includes information on how workers with different backgrounds perform in different jobs, and how much they earn.Eightfold can then use this data to better predict performance \u2014 say, how well an Intuit software engineer who plays chess and graduated from the University of Massachusetts might do at Amazon or Microsoft.Intuit did not respond to a request for comment.The software tool can be especially powerful to an employer intent on expanding a search beyond candidates with conventional experience and qualifications. In that case, a recruiter can specify criteria (like industry and location, and even how likely the candidate is to accept an offer) that would turn up less traditional r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.Claudia Villanueva, a recruiting and diversity official at AdRoll Group, which helps clients with digital ads and marketing, said she recently used Eightfold when trying to fill a financial-planning position. The top candidate had experience in industries the tech world often shuns, like manufacturing. But the Eightfold algorithm flagged her as a winner.\u201cThe tech industry sometimes has a hard time moving past tech experience,\u201d Ms. Villanueva said. \u201cWe keep hiring the same people in the industry. To me this is a really interesting example of how we broke that cycle a bit.\u201dIn the case of the Barclays analyst, Eightfold\u2019s software pegged him as a budding data scientist partly because he had a master\u2019s degree in statistics and knew computer programming languages like C++ and Matlab, even though he had no apparent background in data science.\u201cWe have gone ahead and analyzed tens of millions to hundreds of millions of profiles of people to see how people have moved in their career,\u201d Mr. Garg said. \u201cYou can predict what they\u2019re likely to do next very easily.\u201d He conceded that the approach worked less well in new or obscure fields with limited data.Steve Goodman, the chief executive of Restless Bandit, another firm that applies artificial intelligence to recruiting, compared the exercise of finding nontraditional candidates to filling a professional sports roster.Sports franchises tend to pay far more for free agents who leave their previous team than for players they draft out of college or high school, because the free agents have a record. But if computers were able to predict the performance of draft picks with relative precision, this could change their calculus. The price of free agents might drop, and the price of signing a draft pick would rise. This is, in effect, what software can accomplish using artificial intelligence.\u201cWe surface people we think would be good draft picks,\u201d rather than people doing the same jobs, Mr. Goodman said. \u201cThis person is a little more junior, but based on their career track, people who look like them are cheaper and better for you.\u201dMr. Cowgill, the Columbia economist, said this logic was largely correct, but with one key wrinkle: According to his research, the gains to the less obviously qualified candidates unearthed by machines can be so large that they offset smaller losses to conventional candidates.In fields requiring fewer technical skills, on the other hand, wages could fall significantly.Consider, say, senior marketing jobs, for which large companies often require a master\u2019s degree in business administration. If machines can reliably identify less experienced, less credentialed candidates who are likely to excel, it could depress wages.\u201cThat could happen in labor markets with the realization that you don\u2019t need anything special here,\u201d Mr. Horton said.Perhaps the greatest concern is a basic methodological point \u2014 call it the N.B.A. problem. If you were studying National Basketball Association players to figure out what makes one great, you would find almost no correlation between performance and height. Almost everyone in this rarefied world is taller than average. And those who aren\u2019t compensate with other gifts, like unusual speed and athleticism.If, on the other hand, you selected people at random from the general population and gauged their basketball potential, you would find that it was highly correlated with height.The concern is that machines are, in effect, only studying N.B.A. players \u2014 the people who already have jobs at a company, or even the people who sought jobs \u2014 not the general population.Mr. Cowgill believes there are solutions. He wrote a paper showing that seemingly unqualified applicants whom a company accidentally interviews allow a machine to simulate a crude randomized experiment, helping the company learn more about what makes a good employee.But perhaps more telling is that sophisticated technology companies are already using artificial intelligence to help fill jobs. Mr. Garg, who worked as a research scientist at Google for four years, says the company uses such techniques in its recruiting.Google says it uses machines to take a second look at r\u00e9sum\u00e9s in its database that human recruiters may have missed for a limited set of roles.The advantage that a vendor like Eightfold has, Mr. Garg asserted, is access to internal data at dozens of other companies, something even Google can\u2019t claim. \u201cWe now can build much deeper models than these companies can build by themselves,\u201d he said.Cade Metz contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When the Bubble Bursts, Consider the Anti-Bubble", "Date": "2018-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere are nations and industries in sound economic shape that are ignored by investors because they are not all about tech. Maybe that is about to change. Mr. Sharma, the author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is a contributing opinion writer.One answer, in any transition period like this one, is to look to anti-bubbles. Bubbles are driven by hype about the hot new thing and defined by mania, including unusually heavy trading and prices rising at an unusually rapid pace and reaching a level that can\u2019t be justified by underlying growth in the economy or company. Anti-bubbles are the mirror image, taking shape in overlooked corners of the world and defined by light trading, with prices stagnating at low levels despite solid growth in the economy or company.To be clear, anti-bubbles do not include legacy companies like department stores and newspapers whose very existence has been thrown into doubt by competition from tech giants. Anti-bubbles encompass countries and companies that would seem to have bright futures but that struggle to attract the attention of investors.Historically, the biggest stock market returns came in the fastest-growing economies. But that pattern changed in recent years, as investors chased technology at the expense of everything else. The highest returns came in slow-growth countries such as Taiwan. The lowest came in fast-growing economies like the Philippines. The reason: Taiwan is a tech-driven economy, the Philippines is not.But as big tech begins to crack, that behavior is beginning to change. Stock markets from the Philippines to Indonesia have started to emerge from anti-bubbles. And in the United States, sound industries that had been left in the dust by the tech giants are starting to make a comeback among investors, too, including telecommunications, real estate and consumer staples. It is not clear where they go from here, but it is not unusual for stocks caught in an anti-bubble one decade to perform well the next.In the 1980s, Japan was widely predicted to be the next dominant economic superpower. Though it accounted for only 15 percent of global economic output, Japan was sucking in nearly half of all the money invested in stock markets worldwide. The United States, where the economy was almost twice as large and growing robustly, was struggling in vain to escape the shadow cast by Japan. It was trapped in that era\u2019s anti-bubble. By the end of the decade, however, the Japan bubble had popped and the United States was poised to take center stage. The next big bubble rose in the United States during the tech craze of the late 1990s, which generated another series of anti-bubbles, particularly in companies and countries that relied for growth on commodities like oil and iron ore. By the end of the decade, big oil companies and commodity-driven economies from Brazil to Russia, rocked by sinking prices, had fallen off the radar of global investors, and their stock prices were dragging bottom. Though the boom in this period was lifting a particularly broad segment of companies and countries, anti-bubbles were as usual forming in overlooked corners of the world. Tech firms, in particular, had been shunned since the dot-com bust, and their stocks were lagging behind the rest of the market. A decade later, dot-com survivors like Apple and Amazon were at the forefront of a new tech boom. If the mood of a bubble is manic, as overexcited investors drive daily trading volumes skyward, the mood of an anti-bubble is the opposite, marked by little trading at all. In a telling sign of the current anti-bubbles, the markets of the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia together trade less than $1 billion a day, compared with about $6 billion a day for Apple alone.There are many more anti-bubbles. Poland is a high-growth economy with low debt and a small deficit that is also light on technology companies. Yet among emerging markets, Poland continues to stumble along at lows last seen in the early 1990s, when it was struggling to recover from the fall of Communism. Mexico is another economy facing no obvious threat of financial crisis. Yet money has fled its stock market, helping to drive the peso close to lows last seen during the \u201ctequila crisis\u201d of 1994.The bright side of anti-bubbles is that they are very cheap places to go on vacation. In Mexico City, travelers can get a fancy hotel room for the equivalent of $80, a fancy meal for $15.Anti-bubbles share one thing with bubbles: They don\u2019t last. Eventually, people recognize that prices are out of whack, and adjust accordingly. They go back to looking for inexpensive growth stories, and find them among the forgotten countries and companies.Bubbles are compelling drama, in which the lead characters are always racing excitedly toward a sudden fall. Much less has been written about anti-bubbles, which are in their way equally compelling tales of underdogs moving quietly toward surprising comebacks. The big book on anti-bubbles doesn\u2019t yet exist, but this would be a good moment for it to be written.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Markets Tumble, Tech Stocks Hit a Rare and Ominous Milestone", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf Facebook, Apple or Google looked shaky this year \u2014 as investors worried about growth, regulation or mismanagement \u2014 the rest of the market felt it. In recent weeks, as these companies have succumbed to concerns about the global economy, slowing profits or privacy concerns, they have led the decline in stocks.Now, technology companies are dragging stocks into an ominous territory that investors have not seen in nearly a decade: a severe decline known as a bear market.The tech-heavy Nasdaq closed on Friday at 6332.99, down almost 22 percent from its August peak, meaning it has officially entered a bear market. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average, both of which also include the biggest tech companies, are not far behind after falling 17.5 percent and 16.3 percent from their respective highs. After a month of heavy losses, stocks are on track for their worst year since 2008.Bear markets in stocks are rare but have the power to spread gloom through the economy. In the last 20 years, there have been only two \u2014 one that began with the financial crisis in 2007, and the other that started with the dot-com bust in 2000. Market downturns can gather steam even without strong evidence that economic and corporate fundamentals are weakening.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a feedback loop,\u201d said Robert Shiller, a professor of economics at Yale University. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening right now, we\u2019ve seen some declines, and that emboldens some pundit to say, \u2018This is it.\u2019 They get attention, it puts thoughts in people\u2019s minds and they start thinking, \u2018Maybe I should exit.\u2019\u201dThe Nasdaq is not the only group of stocks in such distress. The Russell 2000 index, which tracks shares of smaller companies, entered a bear market earlier this week. Seven of the S&P 500\u2019s 11 industrial sectors are also at the level, led by energy stocks, which are down 28 percent from their highs earlier this year. That\u2019s in large part because oil has been in a bear market since November.If the broader stock market declines by more than 20 percent this year, it would end what was, by some measures, the longest bull run in history. From March 2009 until its peak in September, the S&P 500 surged 333 percent, a rally that provided a silver lining to the lackluster years that followed the financial crisis of 2008. Investors enjoyed trillions of dollars of gains from the stock market.Those profits are not close to being wiped out. The stock market is still well above where it was even at the start of 2017. But the longer bear markets last, the more pessimism they spread.The mood in the markets can change. The most recent bear markets have not lasted as long as some others in the past. During the two previous bear markets, the Federal Reserve acted quickly to stimulate the economy by slashing interest rates. Investors came to believe that corporate profits would recover and dived back into stocks.The current stock plunge is taking place at a time when the central bank is signaling that it will keep raising interest rates because the economy remains strong, with unemployment near 50-year lows. But on Friday, an influential Fed policymaker said the central bank would keep a close eye on financial markets as it set interest rates.\u201cWe\u2019re going to go into the new year with eyes wide open, willing to read the data, listen to what people are saying, and to reassess the economic outlook,\u201d John Williams, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in an interview with CNBC.The sudden downturn in technology stocks has many of the attributes of the sell-offs that periodically smash hot sectors in the stock market. But it also signifies how investors have taken a dimmer view of corporate America and the broader economy.They are far below those levels now. Apple is now worth around $715 billion. Amazon has lost nearly a third of its value since hitting its high, and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, is down 23 percent.Trade tensions and a possible slowdown in the global economy are prompting investors to wonder whether technology companies will grow as fast as expected. Expectations that iPhone sales in China could slow eroded Apple\u2019s value, while Facebook\u2019s slip-ups over data privacy and misinformation have drawn scrutiny from angry governments and made investors nervous.\u201cYou can\u2019t grow at huge percentages forever,\u201d Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said of the tech sell-off. \u201cPlus, I think that whether it\u2019s regulation, whether it\u2019s fear of the global slowdown, those kinds of things have played into it.\u201dAnd there is also the simple fact that they had risen so far so fast. When fear descends on the market, investors often sell the shares that have gone up the most, and at its August high, the Nasdaq was up more than 50 percent from the date on which President Trump was elected.\u201cToo many people had piled on the same side of the boat,\u201d said Lori Calvasina, head of United States equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets in New York. \u201cTypically when that happens, the boat tips over.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Overture to Democrats, Trump Administration May Challenge Peru on Deforestation", "Date": "2018-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration is considering an international challenge to Peru\u2019s deforestation of the Amazon, the first time the United States has prepared to act against a trading partner for violating environmental standards in a trade agreement, according to people with knowledge of the proposed action.The United States could request the convening of an independent tribunal as soon as Friday to decide the case, officials said, but cautioned that the timeline could shift.The forestry agreement was inserted into the 2007 trade agreement by Representative Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat who looks set to reclaim the speakership in January. The language is the basis for enforcement provisions of environmental and labor standards in the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement that the three countries settled on this year.The new action is intended, in part, to show Ms. Pelosi and House Democrats that Mr. Trump is willing to take action to ensure that all provisions of the new North American treaty will be enforced to the fullest extent possible, an administration official said.Mr. Lighthizer met with Ms. Pelosi last week, attempting to reassure her that the administration planned to implement a robust system of inspections at the border to ensure that Mexico was complying with its labor and environmental obligations.\u201cWhile there are positive things in this proposed trade agreement, it is just a list without real enforcement of the labor and environmental protections,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said after the meeting.Mr. Lighthizer has persuaded Mr. Trump to delay his formal request to pull out of Nafta, according to three officials with knowledge of his actions. If he pulls the trigger, Congress would have six months to pass the enabling legislation for the new deal, or face reverting to previous trade agreements that include higher levels of tariffs.Over the past several years, Peru has scaled back environmental enforcement in an attempt to attract foreign investment. In 2016, the Peruvian government fired the forestry organization\u2019s director, Rolando Navarro, after timber industry executives protested the seizure of Amazonian wood by American officials.Last week, the Peruvian government sharply curtailed the authority of the country\u2019s forestry auditor, Organismo de Supervisi\u00f3n de los Recursos Forestales, which was established to comply with the treaty.Over the past 10 years, Congress has sent Peru $90 million in aid intended to beef up enforcement. In 2015, Department of Homeland Security officials in Houston, acting on intelligence from their Peruvian counterparts, seized 1,770 metric tons of Amazon rain forest wood they found in a rusty freighter.House Democrats, including members who forced the Bush administration to insert the rain forest provisions into the treaty a decade ago, have protested Peru\u2019s actions.\u201cWe ask that U.S.T.R. continue to insist that this brazen, bad faith decision be reversed formally by the end of this week. And if it is not, then we urge the U.S.T.R. to take immediate action to enforce the existing Peru trade agreement through any and all appropriate avenues.\u201dTrade officials are to file a complaint with an independent tribunal established under the treaty. If the judges find in favor of the United States, Peru would have to revise its policies or face financial penalties. The action could come as early as Friday.A spokesman for the United States trade representative did not respond to a request for comment.

Sales of hardware, software and accessories in the United States reached $14.6 billion in 2017, an 11 percent increase over 2016, according to NPD.\u201cEverything in gaming has gotten so complicated and tech heavy,\u201d Mr. Piscatella said. \u201cHere\u2019s this $80 device that you can plug into a TV and go.\u201dFor players looking to play the games on a modern device, Nintendo offered 20 classic games to subscribers of its Nintendo Switch Online network, a premium service that went live in September, and has plans to add more.\u201cPeople remember the colors and shape of the console and the feel of the controllers from their childhood, and they have a visceral reaction when they first fire up their favorite NES or Super NES games,\u201d said Reginald Fils-Aim\u00e9, president and chief operating officer of Nintendo of America.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like watching a classic movie versus a remake or a colorized version,\u201d Mr. Lempel said. \u201cThis is the way you remember those games.\u201dSmaller companies are having success licensing games and repackaging them with new hardware. AtGames, a manufacturer in Taiwan, has sold titles from developers like Activision, Atari and Bandai Namco for more than a decade through its Flashback series, which packages games on replicas of the once popular Atari 2600 and Sega Genesis consoles.AtGames\u2019 latest offering, Blast, is a pared-down version with fewer games, a small controller and a dongle that plugs into an HDMI port on a TV. This new product allows the company to move into a lower price point, said PK Hsiung, the company\u2019s chief executive. Nintendo and PlayStation aim for typical technology retailers, he said, but 80 percent of AtGames\u2019 sales come from retailers like CVS, Kroger, Walgreens and Bed Bath & Beyond.\u201cThey are not competing with us,\u201d Mr. Hsiung said of his bigger rivals. \u201cThey are helping us by making retro games mainstream.\u201dThe influx of games and new consoles is starting to make analysts like Mr. Piscatella of NPD wonder how much longer the sales growth can last. Nintendo dominates sales, but it has not announced plans to release other classic consoles. Other publishers may face difficulties, Mr. Piscatella added, like finding the right fit for their games or securing licenses.Rather than license their games to other companies, some video game publishers are releasing them on their own. After finding a hit with a retro Crash Bandicoot package last year, Activision remastered a trilogy of games featuring Spyro the Dragon.\u201cIt\u2019s probably better to say we remade these games,\u201d said Steve Young, executive vice president and chief revenue officer at Activision. Because of advances in the processing power of consoles, studios are able to rebuild games from the ground up with high-definition graphics, he said.Even the music was updated. The publisher invited Stewart Copeland, the former drummer for the Police and the composer of the original Spyro series\u2019 soundtrack, to create a new main theme for the remastered version.Other publishers are reaching deals with accessory makers like Retro-Bit. The company\u2019s Super Retro-Cade console features more than 90 titles from publishers like Capcom, Data East, Irem and Technos.\u201cThis console brings a lot of games released out of Japan that were never released in the U.S.,\u201d said Richard Igros, the marketing manager for Innex, the distributor of Retro-Bit products. The company also repackages hard-to-find classic games on cartridges made for older consoles.One of their biggest sellers, for instance, is a collection that includes an obscure title, Magic Drop. \u201cIt\u2019s not a well-known game,\u201d Mr. Igros admits, \u201cbut it has a cult following.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Illegal Mining, \u2018Worse Than at Any Other Time,\u2019 Threatens Amazon, Study Finds", "Date": "2018-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnalyzing data from six Amazon countries, researchers identified 2,312 illegal mining sites and 245 large-scale areas where miners have established sophisticated infrastructure, tearing down native forests and contaminating rivers with mercury as they dredge for gold and extract diamonds and coltan, which are used to make mobile phones.\u201cThe problem is worse than at any other time in history,\u201d said Alicia Rolla, one of the coordinators at the Amazon Geo-Referenced Socio-Environmental Information Network, known as RAISG, which published the study this week. \u201cWe wanted to give visibility to the enormity of an issue that doesn\u2019t respect borders.\u201dEach site on the map contains details about the material being mined and the mines\u2019 environmental and social impacts, such as how dredging disrupts rivers and how toxic pollutants seep into plants, animals and people. Venezuela had more illegal mines than any other country studied, followed by Brazil and Ecuador, according to the report.The researchers hope to pressure governments to work together to combat the international criminal activity.\u201cWhen Brazilian authorities go after the miners, they flee to Venezuela and vice versa,\u201d Ms. Rolla said. \u201cThere needs to be intergovernmental cooperation.\u201dHowever, she said, Brazil\u2019s recent election of Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right former army captain who has vowed to end the \u201cindustry\u201d of fines imposed on companies that violate environmental laws, and halt the demarcation of indigenous lands, could represent a serious setback.\u201cIf he does all the things he said he would do, things could get worse, not better,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we started working on this project more than a year ago we didn\u2019t imagine such a tragedy.\u201d\u201cWhere there is indigenous land,\u201d he said last year, \u201cthere is wealth underneath it.\u201d\u201cIt was crazy,\u201d said Fany Ricardo, an anthropologist at Brazil\u2019s SocioEnvironmental Institute, one of the groups involved in the research. \u201cDuring the campaign deforestation rates just kept climbing and climbing, even in indigenous lands where it is strictly forbidden. Now there is still monitoring. Afterwards it\u2019s going to be worse,\u201d she added, referring to the administration of Mr. Bolsonaro, who takes office on Jan. 1.The map published by RAISG shows illegal mining sites in 37 indigenous territories \u2014 18 of them in Brazil \u2014 and near or surrounding another 78 indigenous territories.\u201cThere are very serious consequences,\u201d Ms. Ricardo said. \u201cBeyond the pollution, miners are getting close to uncontacted tribes, which could pose a mortal threat in terms of illness and conflict.\u201dMining is illegal inside indigenous territories, but in some cases tribes agree to look the other way in exchange for payment. RAISG members had hoped that exposing the extent of illegal activity would spur a crackdown and encourage governments to support alternative, sustainable forms of income, such as gathering and selling exotic fruits to high-end buyers.\u201cWith our new president-elect, I don\u2019t know what will happen,\u201d Ms. Ricardo said.In the report, the researchers also published case studies, for instance on the devastating toll that mercury, used in gold mining, has had on indigenous tribes and remote fishing communities.The research highlighted a study of hair samples in territory of the Yanomami, an indigenous group whose land straddles Brazil and Venezuela. In the Araca\u00e7\u00e1 community there, where illegal mining is rampant, 92 percent of the hair samples showed high levels of mercury contamination.The map also shows that illegal mining often overlaps with legal mining, and researchers plan to update it as more information becomes available. Ms. Rolla, the RAISG coordinator, stressed that the mining has deep societal consequences that need further documenting.\u201cThe problem isn\u2019t just deforestation and pollution, there is a serious social element that includes disease, prostitution and displacement,\u201d Ms. Rolla said.\u201cWhat we need is more monitoring, not less,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I fear the opposite is going to happen.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "End the Innovation Obsession", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome of our best ideas are in the rearview mirror. Mr. Sax is an author. TORONTO \u2014 A year ago I stepped into the Samcheong Park Library in Seoul, South Korea, and saw the future. The simple building in a forested park had a nice selection of books, a cafe at its center and a small patio. Classical music played while patrons read, reclining on extra-deep window benches that had cushions to sit on and tables that slid over their laps so that they could sip coffee and eat cheesecake while gazing at the leaves changing colors outside. Seoul is one of the most modern cities in the world, a place suffused with the latest inescapable technology. This library was specifically designed as an antidote to that.\u201cWhat\u2019s so innovative about that?\u201d a friend who works for the library here in Toronto asked when I showed her pictures. Innovation to her meant digital technology, from drones and movie-streaming services and 3D printers, which the library was constantly showing off.\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t they both be innovative?\u201d I asked.We are told that innovation is the most important force in our economy, the one thing we must get right or be left behind. But that fear of missing out has led us to foolishly embrace the false trappings of innovation over truly innovative ideas that may be simpler and ultimately more effective. This mind-set equates innovation exclusively with invention and implies that if you just buy the new thing, voil\u00e0! You have innovated! Each year businesses, institutions and individuals run around like broken toy robots, trying to figure out their strategy for the latest buzzword promising salvation.[Discover the most compelling features, reporting and humor writing from The New York Times Opinion section, selected by our editors. Sign up for the Sunday Best newsletter.]True innovation isn\u2019t just some magic carnival of invention, like a Steve Jobs keynote with a pretty toy at the end. It is a continuing process of gradual improvement and assessment that every institution and business experiences in some way. Often that actually means adopting ideas and tools that already exist but make sense in a new context, or even returning to methods that worked in the past. Adapted to the challenges of today, these rearview innovations have proved to be as transformative as novel technologies.Look no farther than the streets of New York, which have been radically redesigned over the past decade to accommodate cyclists and pedestrians with bike lanes and car-free zones. These ideas aren\u2019t new. They were espoused by city planners and activists more than half a century ago, when Robert Moses was crisscrossing the city with expressways, bulldozing neighborhoods in the name of the car\u2019s transformational technology. At the time Jane Jacobs and other advocates of slower, friendlier streets were dismissed as Luddites. It took more than 50 years of evidence, accidents and political courage to realize what a colossal mistake the Moses approach was and to begin to undo that with proven ideas in people-centric urban planning that aim to bring cities back to those who live in them.Perhaps the best examples of rearward innovation are edible. The culinary story of the past several decades is dominated not by the scientific improvements we were promised, but by a return to food and drink\u2019s more delicious past. Traditional cooking, craft beer, heirloom vegetables and grass-fed beef have brought food forward by turning back. We take this as gospel today, but during the 1980s, when pioneering artisan bakers like Nancy Silverton and Jim Lahey were trying to get the world to abandon Wonder bread for traditional sourdough, their ideas were radical and innovative, and ultimately changed the way many of us cook, shop and eat.These innovations aren\u2019t mired in the past. They are solutions firmly focused on the future \u2014 not some technocentric version of it, where we invent our way to utopia, but a human-centric future that reflects where we\u2019ve been, what we\u2019ve learned and how we actually want to live. If that means we build more libraries in parks, then we are moving in the right direction.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sears Is Dying, but Workers\u2019 Loyalty Lives On", "Date": "2018-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAcross the country, legions of former employees gather regularly to celebrate a bygone era of retailing.The annual Christmas luncheon was called for noon, but many members of the Atlanta Sears Family had arrived at the church hall by 10:30 a.m.There was a lot to catch up on: birthdays, illnesses and news of club members who had died over the past few months. There was baked ham, green beans and cherry pie for lunch. There was music \u2014 oldies and Christmas carols mostly. One club member, 84-year-old Herman Atwood, danced to \u201cMy Girl,\u201d twisting and twirling in his Sears Roebuck sweater vest as if he was at a wedding.Martha and W.J. Reid. \u201cWe come to the meeting for the fellowship,\u201d he said.\u201cIt feels like family,\u201d Mattie Hughey said as she sat with three friends she met packing catalog orders in the Sears warehouse in Atlanta 30 years ago. Madison Price, 87, comes every year to the holiday luncheon to see old friends and soak in the music. He grew up working on a farm in Georgia, helping grow cotton and corn. His father split the proceeds from their crops with the man who owned the farm. Mr. Price didn\u2019t finish high school and often missed school because he was needed on the farm.After returning from the Korean War, Mr. Price got a job as a janitor in a store in Atlanta in 1958. When he retired after 34 years, Mr. Price sold the Sears stock the company had granted him over the years and took his pension in a lump sum.He reinvested the money only in things that he uses: shares in Georgia\u2019s power utilities and municipal bonds of DeKalb County and the Atlanta airport. Today, Mr. Price said he drew enough in dividends and interest from his investment portfolio, along with Social Security, to live comfortably. He paid for his son\u2019s college tuition, and his wife, Earnestine, has been able to take trips with her friends. \u201cI am blessed,\u201d Mr. Price said.Many of the retirees at the luncheon said they viewed their time at Sears as being part of something bigger than just working at a successful retailer. They worked for a force in American culture and business. Sears sold everything: feed for chickens, Whirlpool washing machines, as well as the nightgowns, watches and erector sets in the Christmas \u201cwish book.\u201d\u201cOne man came by looking for a wagon for his horse,\u201d said Jerril Parker, who worked in security at Sears in the Atlanta area for 45 years.Sears also had an outsize physical presence. In Atlanta, the company occupied one of the largest buildings in the region \u2014 a store, warehouse and regional office covering over two million square feet. The red brick warehouse on Ponce De Leon Avenue was a precursor to the e-commerce fulfillment centers that shipped thousands of items ordered through the catalog. Mr. Parker recalled hiding in a refrigerator box with small holes cut into the side so he could conduct surveillance on employees unloading merchandise. One day, Mr. Parker said, his security staff caught a young seasonal worker trying to steal seven plaid skirts for his sister and her cheerleading squad by wearing them under his pants. \u201cHe just kept getting bigger and bigger through the day,\u201d Mr. Parker said. Sears workers became experts in their fields \u2014 heating systems, kitchen appliances, cosmetics. And they were proud of what they sold. Elder Penny, who started at Sears after serving as a Navy supply officer in World War II, was a regional buyer of women\u2019s shoes. Mr. Penny, 94, still has the same Kenmore refrigerator he bought at Sears in 1974. \u201cI think I will wear out before it does,\u201d he said. There was also a feeling of camaraderie and support. Decades ago, the Sears headquarters in Illinois were referred to as \u201cparent\u201d \u2014 a telling symbol of the way employees viewed their employer. Experienced workers took new recruits under their wing. When a manager relocated to a new store, other employees there helped him look for a new home. Bill Rudolph, 66, came to the lunch with his friend Dorothy Davis, who he met when he was a manager in a Sears in the Atlanta area. He picked up Ms. Davis, 89, at her home and gave her a ride because she has stopped driving.\u201cIt was a place where people cared for each other,\u201d said Mr. Rudolph, who was overcome with emotion recalling the help he received from the older women. Sears today is nothing like the company many retirees remember. The retailer stopped profit-sharing in the 1970s and more recently hired employees no longer receive pensions. Under its chairman, Mr. Lampert, the company has been selling off many of its most valuable stores and laying off thousands of workers. Retirees warned long ago that Mr. Lampert\u2019s involvement with Sears would end badly. When his hedge fund acquired the company in 2005 by merging it with Kmart, a group of former workers hired a plane to fly over the headquarters in Illinois pulling a banner that read, \u201cSears Unfair to Retirees.\u201d Another retiree on the call reported that her friend successfully had the ice maker in her refrigerator cleaned out by a Sears repairman, whom she noted was \u201cvery precise, very courteous.\u201d The retirees\u2019 pensions are expected to survive the bankruptcy largely intact thanks to a backstop from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. But if Sears goes into a liquidation, which many analysts and investors say is likely, then the retirees would lose most of their life insurance benefits.In the current incarnation of Sears, recruiting new members to the alumni groups has been difficult. Two decades ago, there were 250 clubs, now there are only about 45. More recent retirees, who did not receive pensions or profit-sharing, do not share the same allegiance as older generations. \u201cSears was a great company,\u201d said Ron Olbrysh, who retired from the Sears legal department in the 1990s and is now chairman of the national retiree association \u201cBut I am glad we got out when we did.\u201dAge is another challenge. The Atlanta club regularly updates its 160 members with a \u201cbereavement report\u201d listing local retirees who have died.As the luncheon in Decatur finished, Lynn Walker Capland lingered in the church hall, helping clean off the tables and talking with friends. Ms. Capland, 66, is not only a former employee, she is what she calls a \u201cbyproduct of Sears.\u201d Her mother and father met while working at the Christmas pickup window in the Atlanta store. Ms. Walker left the company before reaching retirement age because she said she wasn\u2019t suited for her final job in the collections department. But she still takes a day off from current work at an accounting firm to attend the luncheon every year.\u201cNo one makes time for these types of things anymore. Everyone is so busy,\u201d she said. \u201cThis way of life is almost gone.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Shopping Gala Built on Musings About Being Single Is Now a Marketing Phenomenon", "Date": null, "News": "China DailyAdvertisementShareNov. 11 annual splurge reflects a significant shift in consumer behavior.In the past decade, Nov. 11 has undergone a dramatic transformation from being just another date on the calendar to becoming the world\u2019s largest single-day discount shopping festival.Also known as Singles Day, it debuted in 2009 as an online antidote to the sentimentality surrounding the Western Valentine\u2019s Day. It takes its name from the way the date is written numerically as 1111, which resembles \u201cbare branches,\u201d a Chinese expression for the unattached.As this year\u2019s shopping gala progressed, milestones from previous years fell one by one.It was no surprise that Alibaba, which created the extravaganza to spur low-season online sales, broke its own record by clocking up sales worth 213.5 billion yuan ($30.8 billion) in just 24 hours, up by 27 percent year-on-year.The number of parcels generated on the day exceeded 1 billion for the first time, in line with estimates from Alibaba\u2019s chairman, Jack Ma.But beyond its huge scale, the gala reflects a paradigm shift in consumer behavior, as more shoppers look to imported goods, which they view as being of higher quality, even though they cost more \u2013 some of which are even designed exclusively for the Chinese market.For instance, it took just over six hours for cross-border online transactions to reach last year\u2019s full-day record on Tmall Global, Alibaba\u2019s dedicated portal for such purchases.While not disclosing the final sales figure, the company said more than 40 percent of items were bought from international brands. Beauty products from Japanese cosmetics specialist Kao and hairdryers from Dyson, which is headquartered in Britain, were among those that saw sales worth 10 million yuan in the first hour of trading during this year\u2019s shopping spree.Cross-border sales were also brisk on other e-commerce platforms. Those on NetEase Kaola, the cross-border portal owned by internet company NetEase, surpassed last year\u2019s total in just 78 minutes.Overseas products from the Amazon Global Store, which covers top destinations among Chinese customers for cross-border shopping and is owned by United States tech giant Amazon, achieved double-digit growth.Xu Lei, chief marketing officer of JD and CEO of JD Mall, which saw the amount of imported fresh food sold double compared with last year, said, \u201cThere has been a noticeable shift in China toward quality over price, which we see in the growing numbers of consumers who are willing to pay more for branded and imported goods.\u201dBefore Nov. 11, consultancy Oliver Wyman had projected that imported goods would be those most in demand at this year\u2019s festival. In a survey released just ahead of Singles Day, it found that 57 percent of customers surveyed said they intended to buy overseas goods, and such sales would constitute one-third of overall spending for the festival.New growth engineThe buying spree has helped to ease any concerns over a slowing economy, as consumption takes center stage in powering the nation\u2019s economic engine. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the contribution of consumption spending to GDP growth reached 78.5 percent in the first half of this year.The overall size of the nation\u2019s online retail sector reached 7.18 trillion yuan last year, a year-on-year rise of nearly 32.2 percent. This figure is projected to exceed 18 trillion yuan by 2025, with the online proportion of retail sales of consumer goods forecast to hit 25 percent, the bureau said.Meanwhile, the retail import penetration rate of China\u2019s cross-border e-commerce sector (consumers buying goods through cross-border e-commerce platforms as a proportion of online consumers) rose from just 1.6 percent in 2014 to 10.2 percent last year, according to research by consultancy Deloitte, the China Chamber of International Commerce and Alibaba\u2019s research arm.Buying imported goods online has become more commonplace, as new users\u2019 average spending per transaction and the average number of product categories bought increases, the study found.For example, the average number of product categories bought by first-time users in 2014 was 1.6, but by last year this had risen to four, while average spending per transaction last year rose to 2.5 times that in 2014.This trend is a vote of confidence for companies such as Chemist Warehouse, an Australian online pharmacy. According to Nancy Jian Fei Fei, its Greater China CEO, it was the only company with origins in Australia and New Zealand to achieve sales of 100 million yuan on Tmall Global on Nov. 11 this year. \u201cOur popularity is in part thanks to the growing disposable income of Chinese consumers and their changing mindset on healthcare,\u201d Jian said. \u201cAlso, our brand awareness has been further strengthened as more foreign manufacturers devote more resources to marketing efforts in China.\u201dWang Ying, 34, a company clerk in Shanghai, bought two bottles of vitamins from Chemist Warehouse during Singles Day this year and enjoyed a discount of 25 percent.\u201cThe maturing cross-border e-commerce setup can circumvent a lot of consumer education work,\u201d she said. \u201cWith the bonded warehouse in place, these imported goods can be delivered within just a couple of days to your doorstep.\u201dHusayn Remtulla, CEO of VIVA Naturals, a Canadian nutrients supplier, said, \u201cDouble 11 is similar to Black Friday (the shopping day held the day after Thanksgiving in the U.S.) or even Amazon Prime Day (a one-day global event exclusively for Prime members), except the scale and magnitude dwarfs anything that happens here in North America.\u201dRemtulla\u2019s company reaped gains from its first Nov. 11 event last year, securing two months\u2019 worth of sales in 24 hours.\u201cIt really sets you up for the next year,\u201d he said. \u201cA successful Double 11 allows us to reinvest in the business, and to learn from our customers in China about what they love and what they are looking for.\u201dCao Lei, director of the China E-Commerce Research Center, said the history of Nov. 11 indicates that this year\u2019s sales peak will be next year\u2019s \u201cnew norm.\u201d\u201cBrisk sales generated on Nov. 11 have reflected the dynamism and resilience of the Chinese economy. The event itself is the best demonstration of the upgrade in consumption, branding, supply chain and even manufacturing,\u201d he said.Chu Yin, a professor at the University of International Relations in Beijing, said that in echoing the country\u2019s opening-up policy and import strategy at a commercial level, the 2018 shopping gala was set to become a natural online extension of this month\u2019s China International Import Expo, serving as an indicator of the latest global business practices.Experience valuedAccording to the import consumption report led by Deloitte, those born after the 1990s constitute 45.2 percent of Chinese consumers who buy imported items online.Unlike those who are older, the younger generation values experience over price and is likely to pursue niche products and brands, said Zhang Tianbing, Deloitte Asia Pacific consumer products and retail industry leader.This requires brands to constantly evolve with changing customer preferences, and win over their hearts and wallets, Zhang said.Joost Vlaanderen, president of Mondelez China, the company behind Oreo cookies, said Nov. 11 has become a test bed for its \u201csupply chain system, new products and even new ideas.\u201dMondelez is among some 80 international brands that have begun to customize offerings and launch product co-creations tailored to the Chinese market.Powering these efforts are data analytics and consumer insights offered by Tmall\u2019s Innovation Center, which can help brands devise new strategies and channels.For example, confectionery maker Mars teamed up with Alibaba to create a chili-infused Snickers bar aimed at satisfying Chinese demand for a tongue-tingling treat.The decision to cash in on the growing popularity of mala, the Chinese term for numbing and spicy, was based on consumer research by both companies to find a new flavor to bring to the market.Wallace Du, head of both digital commerce at Mars and the company\u2019s China Digital Innovation Center, said, \u201cLeveraging the insights we got from the collaboration, we connected a flavor with our chocolate that is loved by 41 percent of Chinese consumers.\u201dFrom its online launch in August last year to mid-March, sales of spicy Snickers bars surpassed 9 million yuan, with 92 percent of consumers giving them positive reviews. The company said the bars had reached the yearly sales target within six months.Jacques Penhirin, partner and head of the Greater China office at Oliver Wyman, said Chinese consumers are now more selective compared with a year ago and are keeping their spending in check as they search for more unique events or offerings.\u201cThe days of breakneck growth seen by tapping new audiences in China cannot continue. Increasing per-head spending will become increasingly vital,\u201d Penhirin said.According to Wang Xiaofeng, senior analyst at U.S. market research company Forrester, gross merchandise volume generated on Nov. 11, although hitting another record high this year, will no longer be the focus as the event evolves from a purely discount one to a testing ground for new commerce initiatives and emerging technologies.Such diversification is providing plenty of opportunities for emerging brands such as Ocean King, an Australian manufacturer of nutrients, skincare and honey products, to capture the huge consumption potential in smaller Chinese cities.\u201cMajor international brands already have a strong presence in key cities like Beijing and Shanghai, making it difficult for us to penetrate,\u201d said Ocean King director William Ma.On the other hand, less established brands might be better received by consumers in smaller cities and townships who are curious to embrace new products, and where operating and marketing costs tend to be lower.Jason Yu, China general manager of shopper behavior specialist Kantar Worldpanel, said, \u201cThe vast population base and the unleashed consumption power from smaller cities, townships and rural areas are magnets for international brands.\u201dHe WeiThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post\u2019s\u00a0creation."}

So her gutsy, free-spirited friend Charlotte hires a dashing male escort (Marc Ruchmann) to woo Elsa, to boost her confidence and to end her, uh, dry spell. Great outfits, great hair. Racy dialogue, racy energy. If you like the kinds of shows in which pals get together in the middle of the workday to have lunch, watch this. (The show is in French, and it is available subtitled or dubbed.)\u201cCorner Gas\u201d is one of the most popular shows in Canadian history, a single-camera, low-concept comedy set in the small town of Dog River, Saskatchewan. Brent Butt created and stars in the show as Brent, the owner of the local gas station and convenience store. \u201cGas\u201d debuted in 2004, so it can feel a little bit slow by contemporary standards. But it\u2019s a richly imagined world with well-defined characters and an easy sense of flow and structure. It is also the most Canadian show I have ever seen, and that\u2019s saying something.This beloved nostalgia series has come and gone from streaming services a few times, but it is currently on Hulu. Fred Savage stars as Kevin Arnold, who is just starting junior high when the series begins. \u201cThe Wonder Years\u201d can be almost unbearably poignant, but it is so unabashed in its earnestness that you can\u2019t begrudge it. What, we\u2019re too good for feelings now? Embrace it. And then freak out when you realize that more time has passed between now and the show\u2019s premiere than had passed between that premiere and 1968.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Bolivia, Morales\u2019s Indigenous Base Backtracks on Support", "Date": "2018-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCARMEN DEL EMERO, Bolivia \u2014 In this remote indigenous village in Bolivia, the rule has been the same for generations: Leaders can be re-elected only once. After that, they must hand power to someone else.So it came as a shock to Nelo Yarari, the leader of Carmen del Emero, a community of indigenous Tacana people in the Bolivian Amazon, when President Evo Morales said he would be running for a fourth term.One thing especially stung for Mr. Yarari: As Bolivia\u2019s first indigenous leader, Mr. Morales had vowed to champion native values from the presidential palace.In seeking for yet another term, Mr. Morales was violating a basic tenet of the Tacanas, power sharing. He was also pushing for oil and gas extraction in protected areas and proposing hydroelectric dams that would displace native communities.\u201cWe don\u2019t consider him indigenous here,\u201d Mr. Yarari said. \u201cHe has turned his back on us.\u201dWith the election set for next year, the issue of a boundless presidency has become a broader concern for a Latin America where threats to democracy are mounting.In Venezuela, President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro now rules as an autocrat, extending his own term this year in an election widely seen as rigged. More than 300 people in Nicaragua have been killed in protests to end President Daniel Ortega\u2019s tenure.And some see an autocratic streak in Mr. Morales\u2019s support for crackdowns by Mr. Maduro and Mr. Ortega and in his own history of attacking the media and stacking the courts with judges who favor him.\u201cEvo is now asking: What can I do to stay in power?\u201d said Marcelo Arequipa, a political-science professor at the Catholic University of Bolivia in La Paz. \u201cThis issue has become so important it sometimes means sidestepping the Constitution.\u201dAt first, many in Carmen del Emero \u2014 a two-day journey by river from the town of Rurrenabaque and more than 250 miles north of the capital \u2014 saw Mr. Morales as the antithesis to a long chain of leaders who did not represent their interests.Mr. Morales promised something different. He preached inclusion of indigenous groups, cut ties to American coca-eradication programs that stung farmers and used the state\u2019s wealth to cut the poverty rate in half by 2012.Yet 12 years after he took office, many indigenous groups are questioning whether it is their interests \u2014 or Mr. Morales\u2019s own political ambitions \u2014 that are behind his unrelenting grip on the presidency.\u201cWe\u2019ll be the first who get displaced by this,\u201d said Felcin Cartagena, a resident of San Miguel, downstream from the site of the dam.The president has even been abandoned by some indigenous coca growers, his early base. In October, a coca growers\u2019 union from the Yungas region endorsed former President Carlos Mesa, Mr. Morales\u2019s main rival in the race, after one of the union\u2019s leaders was arrested on charges of planning an ambush that killed a soldier. The group said Mr. Morales was trying to quash the union by falsely accusing its leader.Mr. Morales has done much to ensure he remains in office, including calling a constitutional assembly during his first term that allowed him to run two more times and pushing the referendum in 2016 that would have allowed him to run for a fourth term.After that narrowly failed, the Constitutional Court, which is largely loyal to Mr. Morales, ruled last year that the president could run again on the grounds that term limits amounted to a human rights violation.Adriana Salvatierra, a lawmaker from Mr. Morales\u2019s party, Movement for Socialism, said the president had neither violated the Constitution nor lost support among native groups. His presidency empowers them by showing \u201cthe indigenous peasant as a revolutionary power,\u201d she said.Ultimately, she said, Mr. Morales needs to stay in power to counter ascendant conservative leaders in neighboring Brazil and Chile who she said were seeking to erase gains made by the poor.\u201cEvo Morales is the only one that can guarantee economic growth, stability, sources of work,\u201d she said.Indeed, Mr. Morales has delivered on many of those fronts, keeping Bolivia\u2019s economy afloat even as Brazil and other nations in the region suffered through a recession when commodity prices slumped. But that is not enough, even for many of Mr. Morales\u2019s erstwhile supporters.\u201cWe have a president violating the Constitution \u2014 whether he\u2019s done good or bad, it\u2019s the Constitution,\u201d Mr. Yarari, the leader of Carmen del Emero, said.The Tacanas greeted Mr. Morales\u2019s first election as their own victory and as evidence that, at last, the national government would begin to have a presence in the distant village, he said. Before long the government began collecting taxes from Carmen del Emero, charging the Tacanas for the caiman crocodiles they hunt and the timber they harvest.But government services did not follow. The village school was built 40 years ago, the health center is 30 years old, and neither has been maintained, Mr. Yarari said. When floodwaters decimated the village in 2014, covering it in mud for months, it was the Red Cross that came to help, the leader said.Further upstream along the Beni River is San Miguel, which is fighting Mr. Morales over the proposed hydroelectric dams. If built, the dams would flood regions around Madidi National Park in Bolivia\u2019s northwest, considered one of the world\u2019s biodiversity hot spots.The Tacanas had spent years fighting previous governments over the project, but they were taken aback when Mr. Morales began pushing for it. In June, the indigenous group sent a small armada of canoes upstream to block the river, in an effort to keep engineers from the site.The dam project would aim to supply electricity to Brazil, but not to Amazonian villages in the area, like San Luis Grande. That angered Triniti Tayo Cori, a leader of the Tsiman\u00e9 people.\u201cThrough our own effort we\u2019ve gotten light to our town: We bought a generator, we bought cables, we bought light bulbs,\u201d Mr. Tayo Cori said, describing a recent effort to install public lighting after years of asking the government to do so.Yerko Ilijic, a Bolivian lawyer and political scientist, said Mr. Morales was making his calculations based on votes: Small groups like the Tacanas and Tsiman\u00e9 aren\u2019t a priority.\u201cWhen you\u2019re a politician, who do you negotiate with?\u201d Mr. Ilijic asked. \u201cYou negotiate with whoever has the biggest numbers.\u201dMr. Ilijic said Mr. Morales appeared to be striking up alliances with some of the very landed interests he once fought. In September, he signed a law to use bioethanol as an additive in Bolivian gasoline, which was seen as a boon for the sugar industry. The farms that produce bioethanol have long angered indigenous groups for advancing deforestation.For some, next month\u2019s election will present a difficult choice between two unsatisfactory candidates: Mr. Morales and Mr. Mesa, who was vice president under Mr. S\u00e1nchez de Lozada, the exiled president who oversaw the Aymara killings that lifted Mr. Morales to power.Rodrigo Quinallata, an activist in the city of El Alto, near La Paz, campaigned against allowing Mr. Morales more terms. An Aymara, he says he will continue that struggle.\u201cWe have to admit that in the end someone who is wearing a poncho can be as corrupt as someone who is wearing a tie,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misstated an action on tax policy taken by Gonz\u00e1lo S\u00e1nchez de Lozada as president of Bolivia. He proposed a tax increase that would have raised taxes on the poor; he did not raise taxes on the poor.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Digital Data Gives Billboard Owners More Reason to \u2018Love a Good Traffic Jam\u2019", "Date": "2018-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdvertisingThe increasingly lengthy commute isn\u2019t just a traffic jam. It\u2019s a captive audience for advertisers.\u201cWe love a good traffic jam,\u201d said John Miller, vice president of sales and sales operations for Lamar Advertising in Baton Rouge, La. \u201cWe are all about eyeballs on billboards, and the increased amount of traffic is helping us.\u201dLamar has 175,000 billboards throughout the United States, Mr. Miller said, adding that slower traffic had helped the company\u2019s data collection program determine who was looking at the board and for how long. Using anonymous data from mobile devices and apps, Lamar has figured out how fast cars are passing by, how much \u201cdwell time\u201d drivers spend paying attention to billboards, what the demographics of the drivers are, and even where they live, travel and shop.Roughly three years ago, Clear Channel Outdoor started its own data collection service, Radar. Using global positioning data from mobile apps that require mapping \u2014 navigation, dating, shopping and restaurant ads \u2014 the service blends third-party demographic data with information about people passing billboards to determine not only where commuters will spend, but how.\u201cNow we\u2019re starting to understand what mobile devices we saw exposed to our billboards, and we look back in time and say, \u2018Where else have we seen those devices?\u2019\u201d said Dan Levi, executive vice president and chief marketing officer for Clear Channel Outdoor. \u201cIn the case of businesses trying to get people into Target, we say, \u2018What are the locations that are the most efficient in getting people whose devices we\u2019ve seen in Target?\u2019\u201dHe noted that a recent analysis of fast-food customers in Southern California had found a strong (and perhaps counterintuitive) correlation with their going to the gym, largely because commuting whittled away time for sit-down meals and other forms of exercise. It also showed that billboards for gyms worked better when placed near a commuter\u2019s workplace than near his or her home.Mr. Miller said that data could also help digital billboards, which make up 2 percent of Lamar\u2019s billboard inventory, change to meet an advertiser\u2019s needs at specific times of the day. That could mean a movie studio\u2019s billboard mocking traffic congestion at the height of rush hour, a Dunkin\u2019 billboard changing from coffee in the morning to sandwiches at night, or sequential billboards telling a story.If advertisers can\u2019t catch commuters\u2019 eyes with billboards, they are also trying to reach them through radio.For instance, iHeartMedia \u2014 which owns Clear Channel Outdoor \u2014 has spent the last three years looking at listener behavior on both its radio stations and its app. Its research has produced data that iHeartMedia now sells to advertisers along with demographic information and specific ad time.However, Robert Pittman, chairman and chief executive officer of iHeartMedia, said commuters were so bombarded with information that advertisers might get them to want a product or service in the moment but not get them to remember once they\u2019re out of their cars.Mr. Pittman said introducing a Taco Bell breakfast menu to commuters when they\u2019re hungry, suggesting they drink Bacardi rum when they get home or pitching a car dealership while they\u2019re stuck in their clunker put those advertisers foremost in a commuter\u2019s mind when they\u2019re most susceptible to persuasion.When 20th Century Fox was preparing to release the Queen biopic \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d this year, iHeartRadio stations used peak commute times to air interviews about the rock band, Mr. Pittman said. On Nov. 1, a day before the film\u2019s release, different versions of the six-minute title song played across all 650 iHeartRadio stations and sites.\u201cThe longer the commute and the more time they\u2019re in the car, the more they\u2019re looking to enjoy the experience in the car or to make it at least more tolerable,\u201d Mr. Pittman said. \u201cWe really try to make the programming that way, and we\u2019re able to bring our advertising partners into it as well.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve seen some amazing ads on my 2 train going back in the morning and coming back in the evening,\u201d Ms. Sarnoff said. \u201cIn this market, I\u2019ve seen advertisers really raise their game, and people\u2019s expectations of what people are going to see when they go into the subway are high.\u201dOutfront Media is rolling out 50,000 digital video boards at subway and rail stations in New York, the Bay Area, Washington and Boston.\u201cBrands like Casper and Seamless have becomes household names by sharing their brand stories with subway riders,\u201d Mr. Male, Outfront\u2019s chief executive, said. \u201cSmart brands like Spotify, StreetEasy and WeWork leverage consumers\u2019 predictable travel paths, frequency and time spent, and in-the-moment-in-time mentality to drive app usage, sales and site visits.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the location of the advertising technology company Intersection.

Apple used it to bring back $252 billion that it had stashed abroad.Mr. Trump, who had chided Apple over various issues in the past, reacted to the January announcement by praising the company while crediting his own policies for getting it to make the investments.In September, though, Mr. Trump took aim at Apple again over jobs after the company told trade officials in a letter that the administration\u2019s tariffs would affect a wide range of products.\u201cMake your products in the United States instead of China,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. \u201cStart building new plants now.\u201dNone of the new positions announced by Apple on Thursday appeared to involve manufacturing.Unlike Amazon, whose competition for a new headquarters was highly publicized, Apple has been relatively quiet about its expansion plans. The company opened its own new $5 billion headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., last year.The new 133-acre campus in Austin will initially employ 5,000 workers in engineering, research and development, operations, finance, sales and customer support. It will ultimately have the capacity for up to 15,000 workers. Apple said it expected that its expanded presence in Austin, where it already employs 6,000 people, would make it the area\u2019s largest private employer.Apple said it had applied for a $25 million grant from Texas, payable over 15 years, as well as property-tax rebates from Williamson County. Those rebates would be in the tens of millions of dollars over 15 years, said a person familiar with the application, who declined to be named because the negotiations are private.Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas hailed Apple\u2019s decision on Thursday as \u201ca testament to the high-quality work force and unmatched economic environment that Texas offers.\u201dCities and states are competing to lure high-paying tech jobs that can improve their economies and generate tax revenue.But tech companies, which rank among the world\u2019s largest by market value, carry downsides like gentrification and higher living costs that can push out longtime residents. Austin, like Seattle and the Bay Area, has experienced those effects in recent years as Apple and other technology companies expand.Arun Sundararajan, a professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business, said the concentration of tech jobs in a few metropolitan areas was widening a gap between big cities and the rest of the country. He said the dynamic was contributing to the nation\u2019s political divide.\u201cThe digitalization of the economy is exaggerating the urban-rural divide,\u201d said Mr. Sundararajan, who studies the technology industry\u2019s role in the economy. \u201cThe part of the digital revolution that I have been waiting for, that I haven\u2019t seen kick in in the United States, is the large platforms enabling opportunities for individuals who may not have high-tech skills.\u201dJack Nicas contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "France, Not Waiting for European Union, to Tax U.S. Tech Firms as \u201919 Starts", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrance has been working with other countries on a European Union-wide digital tax on companies including Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, but some members of the bloc have balked at the proposal.On Monday, he moved up that date.\u201cThe tax will be introduced no matter what on Jan. 1, and it will be for the whole of 2019,\u201d Mr. Le Maire said. A week ago, he urged the public to \u201cfight with me\u201d on the issue in an interview on French radio, during which he said, \u201cIt\u2019s time for these companies to pay the taxes that they owe.\u201dThe tax, Mr. Le Maire said, would most likely cover not only the companies\u2019 direct sales in France, but also revenue from online marketplaces and the resale of private data. He declined to discuss other details, including the means for introducing the tax or the rate of taxation.France\u2019s decision to go its own way for now did not appear to derail the European Commission\u2019s proposal.A commission spokesman noted in a statement that \u201cabout a dozen E.U. countries already have or are considering a form of taxation of digital activities.\u201dThose countries include Britain, where officials recently unveiled a proposal to impose a 2 percent tax on revenue that social media platforms, search engines and online marketplaces earn there. Spain is introducing its own 3 percent tax on online advertising services, brokering services and the resale of personal data.But, the commission spokesman noted, \u201cthe announcement by France does make it even more urgent for the E.U. to agree on a common digital services tax.\u201dMr. Le Maire said he still hoped that a union-wide agreement could be reached by March.Amazon, Apple and Twitter declined to comment. Facebook and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment, although the director general of Google France told reporters this month, \u201cGoogle will pay if a tax on revenue is put in place\u201d in France or in the European Union.Large technology companies have long avoided paying taxes comparable to other businesses in the European countries where they operate.Facebook, for instance, paid corporate taxes of \u20ac1.9 million in 2017 in France on stated revenue of \u20ac55.9 million. The company has more than 34 million users in the country, and much of its revenue was logged in Ireland. Apple paid around \u20ac19 million in 2017 taxes in France.Amazon, too, does business across the union, but has benefited by having its regional headquarters in the low-tax haven of Luxembourg. The European Commission estimates that the online retailer and other companies pay an average effective tax rate of just 9.5 percent, compared with the roughly 23 percent paid by traditional businesses.The big companies are not alone in opposing the commission\u2019s digital tax proposal. European start-ups have said it would handicap an expanding tech sector in the region that has struggled to match the scale of markets in the United States and China.France and Germany responded to such concerns by narrowing the proposal to include only larger technology companies, particularly advertising-focused companies like Facebook and Google. Those changes have not mollified everyone.France\u2019s imposition of a digital tax is one front in a wider campaign in Europe to target American technology companies amid growing concerns about their power and influence in society as well as their business practices.Germany has enacted a law requiring Facebook and Twitter to remove flagged hate speech within 24 hours or face fines. France has passed rules allowing judges to order the removal of misinformation around elections.Regulators at the European Commission have also targeted Google, Apple and Amazon for antitrust violations, imposing billions of euros in fines and orders to return unpaid taxes.The French government sued Google this year for \u20ac1.12 billion in taxes it claims the company avoided paying on advertising revenue earned. A Paris court ruled that the government could not collect because Google had declared that the revenue belonged to an Irish subsidiary. The government is appealing.Amazon reached a settlement in May over a long-running dispute with French tax authorities, who had been seeking nearly \u20ac200 million euros in back taxes, interest and penalties for the 2006 to 2010 fiscal years in relation to \u201cthe allocation of income between foreign jurisdictions.\u201d The government did not disclose the size of the settlement.And last year, the European Union\u2019s commissioner for competition, Margrethe Vestager, ordered Luxembourg to collect around 250 million euros in unpaid taxes from Amazon.Adam Satariano contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

And the Continent as a whole has been slower to curb pollution from cars and trucks.Experts say China submitted a Paris pledge that was relatively easy to meet: overall emissions would peak around 2030 and the country would get 20 percent of its energy from non-fossil sources.But the analysts at Climate Action Tracker rated China\u2019s existing pledge as \u201chighly insufficient\u201d and suggested that the country would have to step up its efforts considerably to help keep the world well below 2 degrees of warming. The country\u2019s coal emissions, for instance, would most likely need to decline significantly by 2030 rather than simply flatten out.India, which has long held that wealthier countries should take the lead on cutting emissions, has a less restrictive Paris pledge than Europe or the United States.The country vowed to install more clean energy and improve its carbon intensity, the amount of carbon dioxide emitted per unit of gross domestic product, while still allowing total emissions to rise through 2030. India\u2019s emissions per person emissions would most likely still be lower than America\u2019s or China\u2019s.Brazil and Indonesia are the world\u2019s seventh- and eighth-largest emitters of greenhouse gases, in large part because farmers in those countries continue to burn and clear away carbon-rich rain forests and peatlands for agriculture.Many of the Paris pledges remain fairly opaque, and nations are often vague on what specific policies they will take to meet them. There is still no official mechanism for quantifying progress. As a result, groups like Climate Action Tracker have had to make rough estimates as to whether countries are on pace to meet their pledges and how much further each country would need to go for the world to stay well below 2 degrees of global warming.The Katowice talks \u201cwill be in many ways the opening bell on that sprint toward 2020,\u201d said Nathan Hultman, director of the Center for Global Sustainability at the University of Maryland and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The \u2018Next America\u2019", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHow do we govern in the age that will begin with the 2020 election? Opinion ColumnistI have this feeling that the 2020 presidential election in the United States will be unlike any in my lifetime \u2014 and not only because it will likely involve Donald Trump running as an incumbent \u2014 he alone is a one-man, three-ring circus \u2014 but also because the huge issue that should have been the focus of the 2016 election will be unavoidable by 2020. That is: How do we govern the \u201cNext America\u2019\u2019?\u201cYou know William Gibson\u2019s line, \u2018The future is already here, it\u2019s just not evenly distributed\u2019? Well, the future is here, and now it\u2019s starting to really get distributed. This is the Next America. But our institutions and political parties have not adapted to it,\u2019\u2019 Gautam Mukunda, a Harvard Kennedy School Research Fellow and the author of \u201cIndispensable: When Leaders Really Matter,\u2019\u2019 remarked in an interview. By 2020, it will be impossible to ignore the Next America. \u201cThe basic premises of how the economy works have shifted under our feet and the government will have to respond.\u2019\u2019This Next America will raise a whole web of new intertwined policy, legal, moral, ethical and privacy issues because of changes in technology, demographics, the environment and globalization that are reaching critical mass.Where do I start? A good place is with 5G \u2014 fifth-generation wireless systems. With the two telecom giants Verizon and AT&T now beginning to deploy 5G technology across the country, the metabolism of business, entertainment, education and health care will dramatically accelerate in the Next America, beginning around \u2026 2020.Getting the most from artificial intelligence and machine learning \u2014 like deploying self-driving vehicles \u2014 requires quickly transmitting massive amounts of data with very low latency. We will have that capacity in the Next America. With 5G, a Hollywood movie that now takes six or seven minutes to download onto your iPad will take six or seven seconds and microsensors in your shirt will gather intelligence and broadcast vital signs to your doctor.As AT&T notes in one of its 5G ads, \u201cThink of this as the next frontier in untethering, giving you the ability to take the ultrafast experience you have in your home or business with you virtually anywhere.\u2019\u2019It could be as revolutionary as the internet. But it will require all kinds of new regulations to govern applications from self-driving cars to drone delivery systems to robots that will work as security guards and home health aides.An Associated Press report on Monday said that the government estimated there were currently \u201cabout 110,000 commercial drones operating in U. S. airspace, and the number is expected to soar to about 450,000 in 2022.\u2019\u2019But in fact, in the Next America, argues McGowan, the right model will be \u201ccontinuous lifelong learning\u2019\u2019 \u2014 because when the pace of change is accelerating, \u201cthe fastest-growing companies and most resilient workers will be those who learn faster than their competition.\u201dThat means that in addition to our traditional big safety nets \u2014 Social Security and Medicare \u2014 we will need new national trampolines.We will need to make some level of postsecondary education free to every American who meets a minimum grade and attendance requirement, so that every adult and every high school graduate can earn an associate degree or technical certificate free of tuition at a community college at any time.Tennessee has already done that.These same technological transformations mean the Next America will require changes in antitrust policy. Since the 1980s, antitrust policy judged if a company was getting too big largely by one question: Was the loss of competition hurting consumers through higher prices or fewer services?\u201cBut that definition is increasingly irrelevant in an age in which the most powerful companies in the world offer products and services for \u2018free\u2019 in exchange for personal data,\u201d Rana Foroohar, the Financial Times technology columnist, noted in a June 24 essay. \u201cThis has provoked calls for a return to the definition of monopoly in the 1890 Sherman Antitrust Act, which emphasizes the need to ensure that the economic power of large companies does not result in the corruption of the political process.\u2019\u2019Just one person \u2014 Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 controls Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram. The fact that he has shown himself to be much more interested in scaling his platforms than combating those who abused them for political and economic gain \u2014 and that his lieutenants were ready to go after their high-profile critics, like George Soros \u2014 should make breaking up or regulating Facebook a front-and-center issue in 2020. But just the raw political weight of behemoths like Facebook, Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Apple needs a closer look.Alas, though, the fiscal tools we need to build the Next America have been weakened by President Trump\u2019s tax cuts. The federal deficit was not supposed to hit $1 trillion until 2020, but the White House now says it will hit that number in 2019. We\u2019ve had deficits this size in response to the 2008 financial crisis, but we\u2019ve never run one so huge during a boom.That means the Next America may have to be built in the face of higher interest rates on more debt, with less fiscal ammunition to stimulate the economy should it slow down or face a crisis. So the Next America may very likely have to raise taxes or trim military spending, or Social Security or Medicare \u2014 just when all the baby boomers are retiring.In sum, the Next America requires addressing each of those issues, and many more \u2014 from climate change to zoning rules \u2014 and how they interact. So the next election must too. The craziness around Trump has delayed much of this discussion. But 2020 won\u2019t let us do that again. The Next America won\u2019t wait.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Data Scandals Stoke Criticism That a Privacy Watchdog Too Rarely Bites", "Date": "2018-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLawmakers, consumer advocates and even former commission officials were clamoring for tough action against Facebook, arguing that it had violated an earlier F.T.C. consent decree barring it from misleading users about how their information was shared.But the enforcement official, James A. Kohm, took a different view. In a previously undisclosed memo in March, Mr. Kohm \u2014 echoing Facebook\u2019s own argument \u2014 cautioned that Facebook was not responsible for the consulting firm\u2019s reported abuses. The social network seemed to have taken reasonable steps to address the problem, he wrote, according to someone who read the memo, and most likely had not broken its promises to the F.T.C.Almost alone among industrialized nations, the United States has no basic consumer privacy law. The F.T.C. serves as the country\u2019s de facto privacy regulator, relying on more limited rules against deceptive trade practices to investigate Google, Twitter and other tech firms accused of misleading people about how their information is used.But many in Washington view the agency as a watchdog that too rarely bites. In more than 40 interviews, former and current F.T.C. officials, lawmakers, Capitol Hill staff members, and consumer advocates said that as evidence of abuses has piled up against tech companies, the F.T.C. has been too cautious. Now, as the Trump administration and Congress debate whether to expand the agency and its authority over privacy violations, the Facebook inquiry looms as a referendum on the F.T.C.\u2019s future.\u201cThey have been asleep at the switch,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut Democrat and ranking member of the subcommittee charged with overseeing the agency. \u201cIt\u2019s a lack of will even more than paucity of resources.\u201dThe agency \u2014 overseen by five commissioners, three of them typically from the president\u2019s party \u2014 is habitually tight-lipped. Joseph J. Simons, the chairman, declined to comment on the Kohm memo.\u201cIf the F.T.C. had reached a conclusion that there was no case, we would have announced it,\u201d Mr. Simons said in a statement. \u201cOur investigation continues and when it is finished, you can be sure that the result of that investigation will be made public.\u201dThe agency\u2019s defenders said it had taken significant action against tech companies in recent years. Consumer advocacy groups, they said, sometimes want the F.T.C. to take on cases that its relatively narrow powers will not permit.As the federal government\u2019s main consumer protection and antitrust authority, the F.T.C. has pursued carmakers, drug companies, illegal robo-callers and bloggers who fail to disclose corporate sponsors.But it is hampered by its relatively small size \u2014 about 1,100 employees, roughly a quarter the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission \u2014 and broad mandate. Guarding consumer privacy online, just one part of its mission, can raise complex technical issues. The agency\u2019s enforcement arm, led by Mr. Kohm, doesn\u2019t have its own tech experts, instead borrowing them from other agency units. The job of chief technologist, an adviser to the F.T.C. chairman, has been vacant since April. And its lawyers are outnumbered by the armies of attorneys employed by tech giants.\u201cThey have considerably less staff than they had in the 1980s, and more responsibility,\u201d said Justin Brookman, a former F.T.C. official under the Obama administration who now works at the Consumers Union.F.T.C. officials said privacy and data security cases had gotten more attention than any others over the last decade.Still, all five commissioners agreed at the November Senate hearing that the agency needed more money and greater regulatory authority to keep up with big tech.Critics said a greater problem was cultural. The F.T.C. is haunted, for example, by a clash with Congress in the 1980s over an attempt by the agency to ban television ads for junk food directed at children, known as \u201cKidVid.\u201d Lawmakers pulled funding and severely weakened the F.T.C.\u2019s power to issue new regulations.Even today, \u201cin just about every meeting I have at the F.T.C., staff mention KidVid,\u201d said Josh Golin, the executive director of Campaign for a Commercial Free Childhood, which has filed complaints against YouTube and Facebook.Fears that Congress could again cripple the F.T.C. have made some career lawyers reluctant to take on politically sensitive cases, according to current and former employees, speaking about their experiences during the Trump and Obama administrations.\u201cThey think of themselves as deal-makers, not cops,\u201d said Matt Stoller, policy director at the Open Markets Institute, who has called for big tech platforms to be broken up and regulated. \u201cThey have an institutional culture of deference.\u201dNor did the F.T.C. penalize Facebook after it began acquiring phone numbers and other data from users of its WhatsApp subsidiary, breaking promises it had made when it acquired the messaging service. By contrast, the European Union\u2019s antitrust chief fined Facebook $122 million last year for making misleading statements about the WhatsApp acquisition.(The social network said it had notified users of the change with new terms of service and allowed them to opt out of aspects of how Facebook used the data.)Former officials say the agency struggles to enforce privacy within its traditional definition of deceptive or abusive business practices.Ashkan Soltani, who was the F.T.C.\u2019s chief technologist from 2014 to 2015, said he raised concerns about a location-tracking company, Nomi Technologies, that collected data on people without their explicit consent. He recalled resistance from Republican commissioners and from some staff members who didn\u2019t see a clear consumer harm, since Nomi\u2019s data could not identify specific individuals.Ms. Ohlhausen\u2019s staff told enforcement officials to slow down on cases, so the White House would not view her as anti-business, according to a former senior official. That official and others interviewed for this article spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe conversations that were private or involved nonpublic F.T.C. investigations.With limited resources, she said, the F.T.C. should \u201cpursue cases where the evidence of actual or likely consumer harms is strongest.\u201dBut that standard is difficult to apply against companies like Facebook and Google, whose services are free, and where it is challenging to prove that privacy lapses cause direct financial or emotional harm.Two former staffers said Mr. Kohm, who has led the enforcement division for more than a decade, had expressed skepticism about proving harm in cases against tech companies.In recent months, F.T.C. employees meeting with Mr. Kohm asked how he viewed news reports that big tech firms had tracked users\u2019 locations without clearly disclosing the practice. Mr. Kohm, whose division prosecutes boiler rooms, advertising scams, and other financial fraud schemes, responded that the tech companies were legitimate businesses offering free services, and it was unclear how they had harmed consumers, recalled one person in the meeting.Mr. Kohm declined to comment for this article. Cathy MacFarlane, an F.T.C. spokeswoman, denied in a statement that he placed a lower priority on privacy cases, saying Mr. Kohm \u201chas dedicated his career to enforcing the orders the commission obtains, not setting his own agenda.\u201dMichael LaForgia contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

There is also an absurdist element. Disenfranchised settlers, driven from their homes into banditry and the mountains, are the good guys; the rapacious bounty hunters sent to kill them on behalf of a malevolent banker are the capitalist villains, depositing their victims\u2019 corpses, for which they receive cash, in the snow \u2014 frozen assets for later retrieval.The movie\u2019s archetypically taciturn hero, played by the French actor Jean-Louis Trintignant between roles in \u201cA Man and a Woman\u201d (1966) and \u201cMy Night at Maud\u2019s\u201d (1969), is totally silent \u2014 rendered mute in childhood when his vocal cords were slashed by mercenary marauders. Silence, as he is called, is a hired gun and potential liberator; the \u00fcber-villain is a bounty hunter gleefully personified by Klaus Kinski camping it up beneath a priest\u2019s flat-brimmed saturno hat and a blond Beatle wig.With tropes like that, you might see the Tarantino oeuvre as a footnote to Corbucci\u2019s.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "5 Ways Facebook Shared Your Data", "Date": "2018-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor years, Facebook gave many large technology companies special access to users\u2019 information. Here\u2019s how it worked.Yahoo said people who opted in to its new features would see their Facebook friends and the articles those friends had read, in a \u201cfacebar\u201d at the top of the Yahoo News site. To accomplish such sharing, the Netflix application had to be able to send Facebook messages. But Netflix was given the ability not only to send private messages but also to read, write and delete them, and to see all participants on a thread. A Netflix spokesman said the company was not aware it had been granted such broad powers and had used the access only for messages sent by the recommendation feature.Netflix deactivated the feature about a year after it was introduced, but documents show that the company still had access to users\u2019 messages in 2017. Spotify, which continues to offer its own similar recommendation feature, also said it was unaware of the special access.Beginning in 2010, if people visited one of those partner sites while logged in to Facebook, a blue bar on the screen would let them know the site was receiving their Facebook data to personalize what they saw. For example, people might see what movies their friends liked, or get tailored search results based on preferences gleaned from Facebook.Facebook eventually wound down instant personalization, but it continued to allow some sites, including Bing and Rotten Tomatoes, access to much of the same data they had been getting for the discontinued feature.The internal documents shed light on a Facebook feature called \u201cPeople You May Know,\u201d a friend-suggestion tool that has long confused and unsettled users. In some deals, Facebook shared information with other companies and in turn received people\u2019s contact details \u2014 data Facebook used to develop complex friend network models and suggest more connections, the documents show. The partners that fed information to the tool included Amazon, Yahoo and the Chinese company Huawei.The tool incorporated Facebook friend lists and allowed people to share articles and make recommendations to other readers. The feature was shut down in 2011, but The Times continued to have access to friend lists until 2017. The Times spokeswoman said they were unaware of the continued access and were not receiving any data for the feature from Facebook.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Sound of Silence", "Date": "2018-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDOMAINSHow many crazy gizmos are needed to achieve your optimum sleep environment?It lulls me to sleep nonetheless, because it blankets the din in my apartment (the ragged snore of a roommate; the clanking of the steam radiator; the cat\u2019s skidding pursuit of something only he can see). It may also soothe because it replicates an early sound environment, probably that of a Manhattan childhood, though perhaps it suggests something much, much older. Some sleep experts note that babies, their ears accustomed to the whisper of the maternal circulatory system and the slosh of the womb, sleep better accompanied by a device that mimics those familiar whooshings.My app is but one note in the mighty chorus of white-noise generators, an exploding industry of mechanical and digital devices; apps and websites, and Sonos and Spotify playlists that grows ever more refined, as if to block out the increased rate of speeding, the wrecks, on the information superhighway. The first so-called domestic white-noise machine may have been built in 1962, by a traveling salesman whose wife grew used to the air-conditioners in the motels they frequented and was unable to sleep at home. But white noise was identified by engineers as early as the 1920s, Dr. Pigeon said, and used as a test signal because, as he put it, \u201cit\u2019s the sum of all the audible frequencies in equal proportion in a single sound. It\u2019s so named because of its analogy to light, which turns white when all visible frequencies are summed up into a single beam.\u201dFred Maher is a veteran music producer and drummer who works as an audio engineer and audio-quality tester. He has what are considered golden ears, meaning he is an expert listener who can spot audio errors in music, film and television content. He also suffers from tinnitus, a condition he soothed for years with machines like the Dohm. (That device is now in the bedroom of his 6-year-old daughter, Ruby.)Sleep is inherently dangerous, said Rafael Pelayo, a clinical professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Stanford Center for Sleep Sciences and Medicine. This is why we are wired to sort sounds as we sleep, he said, to differentiate the threats, or a baby\u2019s cry, from more benign noises. \u201cHow can a mother feed her baby if the ability to wake up is not wired into our brain?\u201d Dr. Pelayo said. \u201cThe thalamus needs to decide if a noise is worth informing the cortex. There\u2019s a concept in sleep called the arousal threshold \u2014 it\u2019s the stimulus you need to go from a deep sleep to awake. It can be a loud noise, like a garbage truck, or something soft, like your partner saying, \u2018Honey, I think there\u2019s a burglar in the house.\u2019 The idea of a noise generator is to raise the background noise so you don\u2019t notice the sounds that aren\u2019t worth your attention: a snoring partner or the hotel elevator.\u201d There is no data that suggests a white-noise machine alters the frequencies of the brain, said Param Dedhia, the director of sleep medicine at the Canyon Ranch in Tucson. \u201cBut we can show that if you make a loud sound, you can affect your response to that with a noise machine. It\u2019s called auditory masking.\u201d Dr. Dedhia described its effects as a sound bubble, \u201ca force field of sound such that a noise has to be much stronger to break through.\u201d Dr. Dedhia has deployed Marpac Dohms in the bedrooms at Canyon Ranch, and also in his home, because the pool there draws an army of bullfrogs after dark. Their nightly chorus drives him bananas. \u201cOh, my friend,\u201d he said, \u201cit sounds like someone dying. I used to get my hose and spray them off the sides of the pool, but they soon were on to me, and after a while just hopped back on. So now I have my humidifier running, and the white noise right next to the bed. It\u2019s my sound bubble. We don\u2019t have to have a bug or pill for every ill if we can soothe ourselves. It\u2019s a skill, it really is. If we could all self-soothe, it would make it easier to handle other chaos.\u201dNoise is terribly subjective. There are those who love the croak of a bullfrog, and are soothed by the snores of their partner because it means they are close. Dr. Pigeon allowed that snoring was particularly tough to mask, given its locality (next to your head) and unpredictability (your ears crane for the next growl or explosive sigh). \u201cYou must convince yourself the sound of snoring is beautiful,\u201d he said. \u201cI have some people who asked me to put snoring on the website because they are used to sleeping with a partner snoring, and when that partner is gone \u2014 traveling or divorced or dead \u2014 they miss that sound.\u201dWorth a try.An insomniac himself, Dr. Pigeon is not soothed by his soundscapes because he knows them by heart and will fret over dissonances only he can perceive. \u201cA particular wave on the Irish Coast that crashes too loudly, or a bird that sings in the wrong place,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a brain that can\u2019t stop working,\u201d he added sadly. \u201cI haven\u2019t found a way to stop its chatter.\u201d\u201cOne man\u2019s castle is usually above another man\u2019s castle,\u201d Mr. Fierstein said. \u201cYou have this huge amount of real-estate appreciation, and people are paying a lot of money and as a result they feel like they can do what they want.\u201d Many co-ops and condominiums are now requiring, he said, that an acoustical consultant like himself attest that a proposed renovation, \u201cwith its media rooms and central air-conditioning, and apartment combinations that put his fancy new kitchen over your son\u2019s bedroom,\u201d will not produce any undue noises.Mr. Fierstein can design noise programs that are perfectly tuned to block the pure tones, as he put it, of outside irritants, like bus noises or building mechanicals, that can be played on any speaker system. (He described a pure tone as any sound that has a specific and constant musical pitch, and then demonstrated by making a high beeping noise into the phone.)\u201cThe way to block a noise is not to be as loud or louder\u201d than the offending sound, he said. \u201cYou also have to produce sound that\u2019s on the same frequency. One of the things that makes noise so unreasonable is the lack of control. You can\u2019t stand your neighbor\u2019s loud music even if it\u2019s your favorite artist. One benefit of masking noise is that you can call it your own.\u201dRecently Mr. Fierstein was called in to mediate a dispute between two neighbors, one of whom was so irked by the sound of the other\u2019s air-conditioner that he positioned eight white-noise machines throughout his studio apartment, the noise of which then annoyed the air-conditioner man. It was the noise-machine man who sent for Mr. Fierstein. His report noted that the air-conditioner, a window unit, was emitting \u201caudible pure tones,\u201d he said, and may have been improperly mounted, shaking the framing of the building. That would be a win for noise-machine man, though the building\u2019s management has yet to weigh in. Mr. Suarez, the technician whose recipe for a roughed-up box fan appeared on Reddit, suggested that the increased racket we hear is more often living in our heads. The noises we use to \u201cquiet\u201d them are a kind of placebo, he said. Mr. Suarez noted the constant commotions of the news cycle and social media, and made the point that we don\u2019t do enough physical activities during the day to dissipate our energies. \u201cEven if you turn off the pings on your phone and turn away from your devices,\u201d he said, speaking from his van as he drove to a job, \u201cyou\u2019re still thinking, \u2018What\u2019s happening with Facebook?

They Used It to Agitate for Change.", "Date": "2018-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Silicon Valley technology firms are known for giving stock to their workers, a form of compensation that often helps employees feel invested in their companies.At Amazon, more than a dozen employees who had received stock grants recently exercised their rights as shareholders. In late November and early December, they filed identical shareholder petitions asking the e-commerce giant to release a comprehensive plan addressing climate change.Their filing appears to be the first time that tech employees have led their own shareholder proposal, according to activist investors. In the proposal, which will be voted on at Amazon\u2019s annual shareholder meeting next spring, employees asked the company\u2019s board to say how it would respond to climate change and reduce its dependence on fossil fuels.\u201cWe realized we could use our position as employees and our power and our rights as shareholders to bring visibility of this issue to the board and the top leaders of this company,\u201d said Eliza Pan, a program manager who has worked at Amazon for five years and is one of the employees who signed on to the proposal.Ms. Pan, who earned Amazon shares as part of her compensation package, said workers must own at least $2,000 in stock for a year to file a shareholder proposal. \u201cWe had this power, and we wanted to leverage that power,\u201d she said.The move by Amazon\u2019s employees builds upon similar activism at Google this year. In March, its workers were part of a shareholder petition by Zevin Asset Management that sought to link executive compensation to diversity and inclusion goals. Google\u2019s employees did not directly file the proposal, but joined Zevin and presented it at the annual shareholder meeting of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company.The proposal was ultimately voted down, but Pat Miguel Tomaino, the director of socially responsible investing at Zevin, said the firm planned to work with Google employees to resubmit it for the 2019 shareholder meeting.\u201cWorkers are looking at who holds power and where changes can be made,\u201d said Yana Calou, an engagement manager at Coworker.org, an organization that allows colleagues to start campaigns together. \u201cWorkers are shareholders themselves, and risks to workers and users are often risks to shareholders, so there is a natural alliance of shared interests.\u201dAmazon declined to comment on its employees\u2019 advocacy, but it said it was taking steps to address climate change.\u201cWe have set a goal to power our global infrastructure with 100 percent renewable energy and are investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency innovations,\u201d said Kara Hurst, director of worldwide sustainability at Amazon. The company, based in Seattle, has installed solar energy systems at 25 of its fulfillment centers and has streamlined its packing process to reduce its use of packing materials, she added.Google declined to comment on its employees\u2019 participation in shareholder proposals.Shareholder proposals have in the past been used largely by activist investment firms and others to advocate for changes.\u201cIt\u2019s fairly unusual to see this, where employees are taking a stand in regard to the company they\u2019re working for,\u201d said Natasha Lamb, a managing partner at Arjuna Capital, a wealth-management fund that focuses on climate issues.Tech employees, more than in many other industries, have a ready-made way to become activist shareholders because of how they are paid. Google, Facebook, Apple and tech start-ups such as Airbnb have all made stock a component of compensation. At privately held companies, tech workers often get stock options, which give them the option to buy shares at a set price. Publicly traded companies tend to grant restricted stock options that automatically transfer shares to employees over a period of time.\u201cBecause so much value is being created, or we hope is going to be created, it\u2019s appealing to employees to receive some potential part of that pop or growth in value,\u201d said Mary Russell, a lawyer and founder of Stock Option Counsel, a legal firm in Palo Alto, Calif., that advises tech employees on their compensation. \u201cThe culture of the companies is that we need to do this to incentivize people to build the value of the company.\u201dBut by paying employees this way, tech companies open themselves up to this kind of shareholder advocacy, she said. \u201cThey are setting themselves up to have quite a large group of stockholders who would of course, like any other stockholder, have the right to bring forward a shareholder proposal,\u201d Ms. Russell said.Employee shareholder proposals may ultimately not be effective since shareholder-led proposals are often shot down. And because tech founders often possess a large chunk of the shares in their companies \u2014 Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder and its largest shareholder, owns 16 percent of the company; the Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin have about 51 percent of voting shares in Alphabet \u2014 the proposals have little chance of passing without founder support.Tech employees said it was worth taking that risk. Shareholder proposals often gain attention because they are distributed to stockholders and are included in annual proxy statements, the employees say, and they give workers a way to raise their grievances directly to the board, rather than just to managers.\u201cBanding together with other shareholders amplifies my voice and makes all of our voices more powerful,\u201d said Ms. Pan of Amazon.\u201cIt\u2019s important to make change and work for change wherever you happen to be, and I happen to be an employee at Amazon,\u201d said Emily Cunningham, a user experience designer who is backing the climate change proposal and who has received Amazon shares as part of her compensation.She said it was important for employees to publicly demand a plan. \u201cIt\u2019s affecting the public, it\u2019s affecting business,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

The 1950s were groundbreaking years for comedy, moving from witticisms and quips to a new brand of self-aware, social commentary, delivered with bite by the likes of Phyllis Diller and Dick Gregory. One of Ephron\u2019s most beloved essay collections, subtitled \u201cSome Things About Women,\u201d is a contrarian confrontation with the feminist revolution and its occasional humorlessness. This 1968 lexicon codified words like \u201ckvetch\u201d and \u201cschlep\u201d in American English (and surely had a place of honor on the Maisel\u2019s own bookshelf). Marjorie\u2019s story \u2014 a young Jewish girl in the 1930s who wants to be an actress \u2014 captured the assimilatory aspirations of American Jews (and was turned into a movie in 1958 starring Natalie Wood). From the cafes of Greenwich Village to Harlem\u2019s jazz scene, New York in the 1950s was a city with creative energy to spare. Wakefield\u2019s history is crammed with the era\u2019s larger than life personalities: Norman Mailer, Thelonious Monk, Jack Kerouac and so many more. The ultimate boundary pusher (and a force in the life of the fictional Midge Maisel), Bruce pulled the tablecloth out from under comedy\u2019s respectable gags and one-liners. Delivered in his inimitable voice, this memoir captures all that was taboo-bursting about Bruce. If Midge is modeled on anyone, it\u2019s Joan Rivers, who broke down boundaries as a brash, crass, unapologetic truth-teller about the degradations women face when they aspire to more. From Elaine May to Chelsea Handler, women have eked out a central role for themselves in comedy. But it has been a fraught, hard road, one that Kohen details from both on stage and behind the scenes.Published in 1958, this novel about the personal and professional struggles of five young women at a New York publishing house was shocking in its time. Why are Jews so funny? Dauber answers this question by looking at the long trajectory of Jewish history.If Midge Maisel is breaking free to experience a new sort of city life, the backdrop for this liberation is the world that John Cheever describes so well, one of stultifying conformity and constant disillusion. An earlier version of this article, misstated the time frame of Herman Wouk's 1955 novel, \"Marjorie Morningstar.\" It was set in the 1930s, not the 1950s.Advertisement"}

He spent weeks searching online for \u201csongs that dads sing to their daughters at their wedding,\u201d but none captured what he really felt in his heart. A couple days later he picked up his guitar and in an hour he had written, \u201cOn Your Wedding Day.\u201dHe still had one critic to win over: his wife.\u201cWhen I told my wife that I wanted to play an original song at Jenna\u2019s wedding, she wasn\u2019t exactly enthused,\u201d Mr. Goldring said. \u201cThen I played her the song and she quickly changed her mind while crying like a baby.\u201dThe surprise performance was a result of months of planning between Mr. Goldring, his wife Gale Goldring, the wedding planner and the music director.On Sept. 15, as guests were awaiting their meals at the wedding reception, the mother of the bride, Ms. Goldring, gave a short speech and then handed the microphone over to Mr. Goldring. As he began to speak, the music director brought out a stool and his guitar, and the father of the bride started to play.\u201cIt took a minute for everyone to figure out what exactly was going on, but by the time I finished the song, there didn\u2019t seem to be a dry eye in the place,\u201d Mr. Goldring said.The performance, as Jenna Goldring said, \u201cbasically had the entire wedding in tears.

{"Headline": "Google Hearing to Preview Democrats\u2019 Strategy on Big Tech", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Democrats and Google executives worked arm in arm for years, particularly during the Obama administration. But when Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, testifies before Congress on Tuesday, some of the toughest questioning is likely to come from Democrats.The hearing will provide an early glimpse of how Democrats plan to approach Silicon Valley giants in the coming year as they assume control of the House of Representatives. And the testimony from Mr. Pichai, who is appearing before lawmakers after initially resisting, may provide clues about how he and the company will approach them.Democratic lawmakers, angry about Russian misinformation online during the 2016 campaign and concerned about the expanding influence of tech\u2019s biggest companies, are expected to target the industry in the next Congress. Some have already raised concerns about potential antitrust and privacy violations, showing more willingness than Republicans to regulate an industry viewed as an engine of economic growth.Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a Democrat, and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, have warned that Amazon and other tech giants aren\u2019t paying fair wages. Two other Democrats, Senators Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, have called for privacy and online ad legislation, saying big tech companies can\u2019t be trusted to regulate themselves.Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island who sits on the House Judiciary Committee, said, \u201cWe need to restore competition and protect our rights online.\u201d He added: \u201cThe promise of an open internet is fundamentally threatened by the ability of a few powerful gatekeepers to bully competitors, cripple innovation and exploit consumers. This must be a top priority going forward.\u201dThe concerns are aimed broadly across the tech industry. On Tuesday, however, they will focus on Google, as Mr. Pichai will be alone in testifying before the House Judiciary Committee.Republicans have accused Google, Twitter and Facebook of secretly placing conservative voices lower in news feed and search rankings. President Trump and his campaign manager, Brad Parscale, have joined the chorus of critics, saying that the liberal views of Silicon Valley leaders and employees have led them to program their services to limit conservative voices.\u201cRecent reports suggest Google might not be wielding its vast power impartially,\u201d said the House Republican leader, Kevin McCarthy of California, who called on Mr. Pichai to meet with members during his September visit. \u201cIts business practices may have been affected by political bias.\u201dSome Democrats warned that Republicans could focus too much on the accusations of anti-conservative bias, arguing that it would distract from more pressing issues like misinformation and the handling of user data.\u201cThe public has voiced grave concerns about privacy, discrimination, lack of diversity and incivility online,\u201d said Representative Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. \u201cUnfortunately, House Republicans are instead choosing to use their final days in the majority to peddle conspiracy theories about conservative bias.\u201dThe prospect of legislation to rein in tech remains slim, because Republicans still control the Senate and have shown no signs of wanting to add regulations. But the harsh criticism from Democrats has put the companies in a defensive crouch.\u201cThe internet companies\u2019 blue wall of protection in Washington seems to be crumbling,\u201d said Paul Gallant, an analyst at the research firm Cowen & Company. \u201cDemocrats now see political gain in taking on tech.\u201dOn Thursday, Mr. Pichai participated in a White House business round table that included Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, Satya Nadella; Oracle\u2019s co-chief executive Safra Catz; Qualcomm\u2019s chief executive, Steve Mollenkopf; and others.While Mr. Trump made a brief appearance, his daughter and special adviser, Ivanka Trump, represented the White House. She was joined by some administration tech advisers. The topics of discussion included artificial intelligence, quantum computing and next-generation 5G wireless networks.Democratic and Republican lawmakers are also expected to press him on Google\u2019s possible plans for re-entering China, a market the company left in 2010 over concerns about censorship and government hacking.Mr. Pichai has kept a relatively low profile since becoming Google\u2019s chief in 2015. A soft-spoken engineer who grew up in Chennai, India, he worked his way up the ranks at the company and is seen as more at home dealing with products and technology than with policy and politics. But like other technology chief executives facing questions about the societal impact of their products and the policies of their companies, Mr. Pichai is being forced to take a more active role in Washington.Mr. Pichai\u2019s political donations also mirror Google\u2019s attempts to foster better relationships with Republicans. After donating mostly to Democratic candidates since 2008, Mr. Pichai, who is one of the highest-paid executives in Silicon Valley, adopted a more bipartisan approach to his donations. In 2017, he donated nearly $34,000 to both the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the National Republican Senatorial Committee.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018White Christmas\u2019 (1954) Review", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMany of the holiday movies we consider classics or cult favorites today did not seem destined for such glory when we first reviewed them. Some we panned. Others were flops. Others just weren\u2019t particularly holiday-focused.It was twelve years ago that Bing Crosby was in a place and a film called \u201cHoliday Inn,\u201d wherein he sang a little number tagged \u201cWhite Christmas,\u201d written\u2014as was all the music in that picture\u2014by Irving Berlin. The occasion was happily historic, for a reason we scarcely need recall: \u201cWhite Christmas\u201d and Mr. Crosby became like \u201cGod Bless America\u201d and Kate Smith\u2014so much so, indeed, that the notion of starring Mr. Crosby in a film that would have the title \u201cWhite Christmas\u201d was broached as long as six years ago.Various obstructions beset it, but the purpose was ultimately achieved. \u201cWhite Christmas,\u201d with Mr. Crosby, opened yesterday at the Music Hall.What\u2019s more, it is in Technicolor and VistaVision, which is Paramount\u2019s new wide-screen device, and it has Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen in addition to its focal star. A new batch of Irving Berlin numbers comprises its musical score. Paramount, to put it simply, has done \u201cWhite Christmas\u201d up brown.But, oddly enough, the confection is not so tasty as one might suppose. The flavoring is largely in the line-up and not in the output of the cooks. Everyone works hard at the business of singing, dancing and cracking jokes, but the stuff that they work with is minor. It doesn\u2019t have the old inspiration and spark. For one thing, the credited scriptwriters\u2014Norman Krasna, Norman Panama and Melvin Frank\u2014have shown very little imagination in putting together what is sometimes called the \u201cbook.\u201dThey have hacked out a way of getting two teams of entertainers\u2014a pair of celebrated male hoofers and a singing sister act\u2014to a ski lodge in New England (reminiscent of the Holiday Inn) which happens to be run by the good old general of the outfit the fellows Were in during the war. And to show their appreciation of the good old general and the difficult circumstances he appears to be in, they provide free entertainment and call in a big rally of comrades for the Christmas holidays.It is a routine accumulation of standard romance and sentiment, blessed by a few funny set-ups that are usually grabbed with most effect by Mr. Kaye.And the music of Mr. Berlir is a good bit less than inspired Outside of the old \u201cWhite Christmas,\u201d which is sung at the beginning and the end, there are only a couple of numbers that have a measure of charm. One of these is \u201cCount Your Blessings,\u201d a song of reassurance that Mr. Crosby and Miss Clooney chant, and another is \u201cThe Best Things Happen While You\u2019re Dancing,\u201d which Mr. Kaye sings and to which he and Vera-Ellen cavort. Three numbers are given over to the admiration of generals and Army life, which seems not alone an extravagance but a reckless audacity.Even the sweetness of Dean Jagger as the old general does not justify the expense. Someone\u2019s nostalgia for the war years and the U. S. O. tours has taken the show awry. Fortunately, the use of VistaVision, which is another process of projecting on a wide, flat screen, has made it possible to endow \u201cWhite Christmas\u201d with a fine pictorial quality. The colors on the big screen are rich and luminous, the images are clear and sharp, and rapid movements are got without blurring\u2014or very little\u2014such as sometimes is seen on other large screens. Director Michael Curtiz has made his picture look good. It is too bad that it doesn\u2019t hit the eardrums and the funnybone with equal force.Running time: 127 minutes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "France\u2019s Yellow Vests Reveal a Crisis of Mobility in All Its Forms", "Date": "2018-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookSENLIS, France \u2014 After more than a month of furious, antigovernment demonstrations across France, it is easy to forget that a gasoline tax set all this off.A few cents per liter at the pump. A pebble in the sea of the French economy. A step to address climate change, according to President Emmanuel Macron.Of course, that\u2019s not how millions of workers who depend on their cars saw it.Mobility is the story of globalization and its inequities. Mobility means more than trains, planes and automobiles, after all. It also includes social and economic mobility \u2014 being too poor to afford a car, being rich enough to transfer money out of the country. These are all inextricably linked. Weeks of protests by the Yellow Vests have made that clear.\u201cAs small businesses have been dying in these smaller cities and towns, people find themselves forced to seek jobs elsewhere and to shop even for basic goods in malls,\u201d said Alexis Spire, a French sociologist. \u201cThey need cars to survive, because regional trains and buses have declined or no longer serve them. Once you begin to unpack the Yellow Vest phenomenon, the uprising is a lot about mobility.\u201dExperts have been drawing parallels between the Yellow Vests and the social rifts exposed by Donald J. Trump\u2019s election in the United States and Britain\u2019s plan to leave the European Union. But there are also larger trends at work in France, involving the evolution of cities, the impact of cars, and the geography of race and class \u2014 trends rooted in the postwar years.In 1947, the book \u201cParis and the French Desert,\u201d by a young geographer named Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Gravier, helped inspire Charles de Gaulle to reorganize the country \u2014 decentralizing resources, redistributing industry, promoting regional cities and creating new towns linked by a nationwide web of publicly funded rail lines.Modern, decentralized France spread a promise of prosperity and mobility. For decades, the promise was kept. Until it wasn\u2019t.As a handful of big cities thrived with globalization, France\u2019s regional governments, saddled with more financial burdens, became caught in a vicious cycle. Capital disappeared along with factories and jobs. Revenues shrank, debts mounted and infrastructure declined.The gasoline tax \u201cexposed a profound cultural fracture,\u201d said Olivier Galland, a director at the National Center for Scientific Research.On a recent morning, I visited a highway roundabout at Senlis, in the northern region of Oise, where two dozen Yellow Vest protesters huddled around a trash-can fire, sipping cups of tomato soup. Passing drivers honked in sympathy.It\u2019s no accident that the movement takes its name from the Day-Glo vests that French motorists are required to keep in their vehicles. Like the fuel tax, the vests are a burden imposed on drivers by the state, and, for a population that has felt ignored, they also are an ideal, ready-made tool for getting noticed.\u201cThe government makes us pay for these ourselves,\u201d Val\u00e9rie Lemaire, one of the protesters at the roundabout, said, pointing to her jacket and stamping her feet in the freezing mud. \u201cWe pay, pay, pay.\u201dOise is peripheral France. It includes Senlis, a pretty, prosperous bedroom community. But it is also an area where deindustrialization and inadequate public transit have taken a toll.Just across the road from the Yellow Vest encampment is a new Amazon depot, which offers warehouse jobs. This area used to have better-paying factories. Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport \u2014 less than an hour\u2019s drive to the south on the highway, depending on traffic \u2014 is the major employer these days. Creil, 15 minutes from Senlis, is a poor city of 35,000 with a largely vacant downtown and blocks of public housing. It is home to many baggage handlers and airport security guards.There\u2019s no direct train to the airport, and buses are infrequent. So people have to drive if they don\u2019t want to trek into the middle of Paris and then back out again. Avoiding the slower regional roads is also costly, even without factoring in gas, because the French government ceded authority over hefty highway tolls to a private company some years ago.A tollbooth is visible from the roundabout. The Yellow Vest protesters stormed it in November \u2014 allowing traffic through without paying. \u201cWe paid to build the roads with our taxes,\u201d Christophe Bartel, a 47-year-old protester, told me. \u201cNow we\u2019re supposed to pay private companies a fortune to use our own roads? It is a scandal. We\u2019re fed up.\u201dThe protesters also blockaded a nearby mall that has been drawing business from city centers like Creil\u2019s.Claude Letranchant, 59, had scrawled a message on the back of his yellow vest: \u201cEcology is only an alibi,\u201d referring to the climate argument for the fuel tax.\u201cI am a strong environmentalist,\u201d Mr. Letranchant said. \u201cEverybody here is.\u201d He waved toward the other protesters warming themselves by the fire. They nodded.\u201cWhat Macron said about the fuel tax was only political,\u201d Mr. Letranchant insisted. \u201cWe don\u2019t care for politics, only for each other.\u201dThere\u2019s no question Mr. Macron has made himself a convenient pi\u00f1ata for the protesters. They saw him cut taxes for companies and the rich. They saw airlines, spewing tons of carbon to move globe-trotters around, paying no tax for fuel. They saw themselves being strapped with a disconnected president\u2019s commitment to meet European Union debt standards.And they have stopped seeing themselves embraced by French intellectuals and heroized in French movies and by labor unions, whose membership has shrunk dramatically. They found themselves out of sight and out of mind in Paris.Which is why it is also impossible to separate the fury over the fuel tax from housing prices, which have skyrocketed in big cities like Paris, driving working people to areas where home prices are lower but public transport much worse.As Mr. Guilluy put it: \u201cMobility is liberty expressed through geography.\u201d\u201cWorking families in small cities and towns who used to send their children to jobs and universities in big cities like Paris don\u2019t have the money to do that now,\u201d he said. \u201cA city like Paris prides itself on being an open society, but to these people it has come to seem more like a medieval castle, a place closed to the disenfranchised, who are made to feel invisible.\u201dAt the shabby train station in Creil, I came across Henri Djonga and his 2-year-old son, Andi, swaddled in a hooded coat. Every morning, Mr. Djonga said, he takes a 5 a.m. train to Paris to work at a minimum-wage job moving boxes. He used to live some miles away in Compi\u00e8gne, he said, but that required an extra two hours\u2019 commute each day, so he and his family settled in Creil, at greater expense.\u201cTrains are frequently delayed,\u201d he told me. \u201cThe system is not reliable. But it\u2019s better than driving.\u201dHe still pays to own a car because his wife and children can\u2019t buy groceries or get to school or pick him up from the station without one. So he supports the Yellow Vests, he said, adding, \u201cWe all do in Creil.\u201dI asked how much of a difference it made that Mr. Macron has postponed the fuel tax and promised an extra 100 euros a month \u2014 about $115 \u2014 for those earning minimum wage.Mr. Djonga shrugged. \u201cNot enough,\u201d he said and headed off with Andi toward the shuttered streets.Pierre Desorgues contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Wedding Guests, a Touch-Up at the Glam Bar", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byField NotesThe women\u2019s bathrooms and lounges at wedding receptions are often filled with guests who are sweaty and sometimes disheveled from a long day and night of activities or a few spins on the dance floor.Wouldn\u2019t it be nice to have a hair and makeup artist on hand to re-pin an updo, touch up eye shadow, or brighten up lips?Some couples are booking beauty companies for their guests and providing other glamour-focused amenities.\u201cIf you think about it, once you\u2019ve been to the church, in the bus, then get to the reception and go to the restroom, that\u2019s a lot, especially if it\u2019s 100 degrees outside,\u201d said Tara Guerard, an event planner and designer based in Charleston, S.C. \u201cIf there\u2019s someone there to fix your hair and take away your sweat, it\u2019s awesome.\u201dMs. Guerard, who runs Tara Gu\u00e9rard Soir\u00e9e, recently started incorporating beauty bars in the ladies\u2019 bathrooms at the receptions of weddings she organizes. Depending on the size of the event, she\u2019ll have two to three hair and makeup artists available, complete with lipsticks, curling irons, hair spray and more to fix any beauty malfunctions. She adds flowers and a \u201cGlam Bar\u201d sign.She collaborates with a local freelance makeup artist and hair stylist, Deidre Outlaw, who actually came up with the idea. Ms. Outlaw frequently heard from brides that they wanted a zhuzh before the reception after their inevitable tears during the ceremony. \u201cI thought this could be a great service to add for the guests of weddings, too,\u201d Ms. Outlaw said.The pair noted that the service is particularly successful in hot summer months or generally warm weather. This past June, Ms. Outlaw hosted a glam bar at a wedding in Adairsville, Ga., where the space exuded charm but lacked air-conditioning \u201cTo say it was a total hit is an understatement,\u201d Ms. Outlaw said of the steady flow of guests looking for touch-ups. \u201cWe did quick five-minute touch-ups to get their frizzy hair off their necks, T-zones de-shined, and a fresh lip.\u201dBrittany Lo, the founder of Beautini, a hair and makeup business in New York City, also offers beauty amenities to guests at weddings and other social events. She will set up in the lounge area of large restrooms at luxury hotels, or private rooms near the reception area if the restroom is small, or stake out a spot next to the photo booth. Even male guests may receive a puff of powder.\u201cPeople run to the bathroom every 10 dances or so to make sure that their makeup is in place and they don\u2019t look like a hot mess,\u201d Ms. Lo said. \u201cThis provides a next-level service for them: Someone else quickly does it, and then the guest runs back out to the dance floor.\u201dMs. Lo says that about 40 percent of the brides she works with opt to keep a makeup artist and hair stylist on hand throughout the day to touch up their look. And since it\u2019s typically an hourly charge, they often keep the stylist on the clock to be at the beauty bar.\u201cThis added experience and element of surprise leaves guests walking away having a better time than they expected when they entered the wedding ceremony that day,\u201d she said.At her wedding earlier this year, Katherine Daugherty-Smillie staffed a Beautini makeup artist throughout the day, from her ceremony at Holy Trinity Catholic Church and photos in Central Park to her reception at the Parker New York. The makeup artist was available to help her and her guests.\u201cIt was easily the best decision I made beauty-wise for our wedding,\u201d said Ms. Daugherty-Smillie, 28, a fund-raiser.It was important, she added, to stay \u201cin the moment\u201d and enjoy her new husband and guests. \u201cHaving it be someone else\u2019s job to make sure I didn\u2019t smear my lipstick, run my eye liner, or smudge my contour, allowed me to savor every second,\u201d Ms. Daugherty-Smillie said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to worry about constantly trying to touch myself up and carrying around a bag of makeup.\u201dSocial media has helped fuel the demand for these services. \u201cHaving these services in general shows how important pictures are these days,\u201d Ms. Lo said, noting most couples have a professional photographer, videographer and a photo booth, plus hashtags for sharing images on Instagram. \u201cCouples know people value looking nice, not shiny, in photos, and these options allow everyone to look great.\u201dThe beauty bar and all-day glam squad doesn\u2019t come cheaply, however. Hourly prices typically range from $100 to $250 per stylist. Depending on the guest count, a couple may want three or four stylists for a touch-up bar, which could easily add up to thousands of dollars for the whole day.But there are less expensive ways to incorporate these ideas. Ms. Guerard likes to hand out cool towels on the dance floor during humid summer months, an idea, she says, she stole from the pool of a Miami hotel more than a decade ago. She simply soaks washcloths in cold water and has the servers pass them out during the reception.She also suggests gifting guests \u201cemergency kits\u201d in their hotel rooms or in baskets at the reception. Ms. Guerard\u2019s kits include Tums, aspirin, eye drops, and other first aid items to help with any hangovers the next day. She orders muslin bags with an emergency cross on it from Etsy or Amazon, then fills them up. \u201cAll the small things are affordable, and people really appreciate the thought,\u201d she said.Some of the fancier hotels and halls may already offer attendants with various toiletries available. But couples can create their own beauty bars in the bathrooms, too, and even without having a pro on staff. They can buy makeup organizers from shops like the Container Store and fill it with lipstick, Q-tips, makeup brushes, nail files and other cosmetics from the drugstore, Ms. Lo noted.She suggests placing these makeup organizers next to an inexpensive frame with \u201cTreat Yourself\u201d signage. \u201cMost weddings don\u2019t have a whole counter display in the bathroom, so the objective is still the same: You have a huge array of really fun makeup that your guests can use,\u201d she said. \u201cThe concept went from being a few thousand dollars to, at most, a few hundred.\u201dAnd then there are those couple who decide to take the beauty-bar concept up a notch or two.At a recent event at the J.W. Marriott Essex House in New York City, Ms. Lo worked with Birch Event Design to deck out an entire powder room, floor to ceiling, in flowers and pampas grass. (Not surprisingly, it also became a popular backdrop for selfies.)\u201cJust remember why you\u2019re doing it,\u201d Ms. Lo said. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting for someone to walk into the bathroom or any space and see that you thought of them. Any of these little details add up to a create a very unique experience.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Stocks Fall Back Into Negative Territory for 2018 as Economic Uncertainty Grips Investors", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStocks on Wall Street dropped again Friday, pushing the S&P 500 into negative territory for the year, as investors continued to fixate on how much the economy and corporate profits could slow next year.Until recently, the American stock market had been something of a standout performer among global markets. The S&P 500 was up 9.6 percent for the year well into September. But over the last few months those gains have disappeared as investors began to assess the potential fallout from a trade war between the United States and China and, rising interest rates.\u201cEssentially there is a scare in the market about the future growth prospects of the global economy,\u201d said Hari Srinivasan, senior research analyst at Neuberger Berman, an asset management firm.While the market initially rose slightly, those gains evaporated as the issue of a trade war resurfaced later Friday morning. Peter Navarro, the director of the White House trade office, said on CNN that the United States would increase tariffs on Chinese imports if the two countries could not reach an agreement on trade by the end of a 90-day negotiating period. President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China had agreed on Saturday to the standstill on new tariffs, but confusion about the nature of the agreement has only added to recent volatility in the stock markets based on widespread expectation that the American economy will likely slow next year.The arrest could mark a risky new phase for many big technology firms, which depend on networks of factories and subcontractors in Asia and have bet on strong demand from Chinese consumers to fuel future growth.Shares of these companies fared particularly poorly on Friday. Companies that make networking equipment and cellphones in China were also sharply lower. The semiconductor maker Advanced Micro Devices fell more than 8 percent, while Apple was down more than 3 percent. Microsoft and Amazon both fell more than 4 percent. And the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell more than 3 percent.Industrial stocks also saw significant losses Friday, with the S&P 500 industrial sector dropping 2.6 percent. Large exporters Boeing and Caterpillar, which ship large amounts of goods to China, fell 2.6 percent and 3.8 percent, respectively.\u201cIt is a slowdown and it is making investors nervous, and it could possibly slow down further,\u201d said Stephen Gallagher, director of research at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale in New York. \u201cAnd the risks are pointed to the downside with the trade tensions just continuing to build.\u201dBut softer market sentiment soon touched the oil markets, where crude prices moderated their gains. After gaining more than 5 percent earlier in the day, Brent crude oil rose 2 percent, to $61.57 a barrel. West Texas crude, the American benchmark, rose 1.9 percent, to $52.48.The S&P 500 energy sector declined by 0.6 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Amazon HQ2 Document We Weren\u2019t Supposed to See", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTimes InsiderFor reporters covering Amazon, like myself, the company\u2019s search for a second headquarters, which it called HQ2, loomed over us for more than a year. The news, in theory, could have broken at any time, and 50,000 jobs were at stake, as were likely billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies.It started late on Dec. 10, when the city gave J. David Goodman, my colleague on the Metro desk who\u2019s been covering the New York side of the process, a look at several key documents the city and state gave to Amazon to be considered for HQ2. The documents were going to be made public on a city website the next morning.Two of the files drew our attention in particular. One, from last year, was New York\u2019s first round bid, all glossy and making big promises. The second, from March, was the response to the long and confidential set of questions Amazon gave the 20 cities it had put on a short list.As we read through the documents, David and I quickly focused on the second, more detailed proposal and shot notes back and forth about what we saw. \u201cI think the questions are very interesting!\u201d I wrote to him. \u201cLike Amazon asked them for the price of goods at Whole Foods, WHICH IT OWNS???\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s very funny,\u201d he wrote back.He pointed out the document showed that by March, Amazon was considering only two locations in New York City \u2014 Midtown West and Long Island City \u2014 and appeared to have dropped the areas around Brooklyn Tech and Lower Manhattan that the city and state had also proposed.The documents contained a few intriguing bits like that, but no bombshells. Much of the content felt very workaday. We decided not to write a breaking news story.The next day, I went back to the city\u2019s website to look at the document again, and the link to that particular file was gone. David asked the city what happened, and a spokeswoman told him it had been taken it down. The city should have checked with its academic partners before posting because the document included proprietary information.That piqued our interest \u2014 what secret information did Amazon get?Neither of us had downloaded the document initially (lesson learned!), but through my browser history, I could find the web address where the city had uploaded the file. And it still worked. While the city had removed a link to the document from its website, the document itself remained online.Reporting usually entails consulting a combination of documents and human sources, and this was no different. I had the document but felt I didn\u2019t have the expertise to fully understand its value, so I called Joe Parilla, a fellow at the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution. He\u2019d been following the HQ2 saga for more than a year and researches economic development. What was valuable? What was unique?We spent almost an hour going through it together. I\u2019d point out a piece of data that caught my eye, and he\u2019d explain if it was readily available or why it could be relevant to a project like HQ2. He kept scrolling down and declaring, \u201cWow!\u201d I\u2019d laugh and ask what he found so exciting. \u201cWe are doing a project right now that, if we had access to Amazon\u2019s database, it would make our life so much easier,\u201d Joe told me.I interviewed some more people, including an Amazon spokesman who said the company has already used the information it got from the HQ2 process to inform other investment decisions. Providing this type of work force and real estate data to attract employers is exactly what local economic development agencies are designed to do, he argued.While the document did contain information that was proprietary, or at least rarely public, in particular around private universities, in the end it became clear that the greatest value for Amazon was that the city and state researched and compiled data from dozens of sources into one place.That even explained the original Whole Foods question \u2014 and why Amazon asked cities about the costs of avocados, milk and bread at one of its own subsidiaries, which surely it knows. \u201cIt\u2019s like, why do the work,\u201d Joe said, \u201cwhen somebody else can do it?\u201dThe price of avocados is important to the schemesof Amazon big cheeses and their monetary dreams.And moo juice by the gallon is an algorithmic trendthat corporations disregard at peril, my good friend.When whole wheat bread is pricey, then Millennials will wilt \u2014and wash away forever like some tide-born murky silt.This is not footling research nor a whimsical pursuit;without this kind of data modern man is but a brute!Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang\u2019 (2005) Review", "Date": "2018-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMany of the holiday movies we consider classics or cult favorites today did not seem destined for such glory when we first reviewed them. Some we panned. Others were flops. Others just weren\u2019t particularly holiday-focused.The opening titles for Shane Black\u2019s \u201cKiss Kiss, Bang Bang\u201d \u2014 based not on Pauline Kael\u2019s collection of essays, but rather, at least in part, on a novel by Brett Halliday \u2014 evoke a bygone age of high pop style. The visuals are a loving tribute to the great graphic designer Saul Bass, while the jazzy sounds of John Ottman\u2019s score summon up the easy heat of Henry Mancini in his prime. The movie itself, however, evokes a rather different era. I could say that its syncopated editing, its switchback chronology, its fourth-wall-breaking voice-over narration and its hectic mixture of humor and violence represent a fresh and exciting twist on sturdy noir conventions. In fact, I would say just that \u2014 if it were 1995 and I were the kind of person whose mind had just been blown by the cinematic possibilities revealed in \u201cPulp Fiction.\u201dNow, don\u2019t get me wrong. I like \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d just fine, and I don\u2019t think \u201cKiss Kiss, Bang Bang\u201d is an altogether bad movie. It\u2019s just a movie with no particular reason for existing, a flashy, trifling throwaway whose surface cleverness masks a self-infatuated credulity. Mr. Black, a longtime screenwriter (most famously of \u201cLethal Weapon\u201d) and first-time director, shows a lot of slick, dexterous self-confidence. As this shaggy-dog crime story hums along, you can almost convince yourself that something interesting is going on. And, in a way, something is, in that the film, as empty stylistic exercises sometimes do, offers its cast the chance to do some inspired, fast-paced riffing.Robert Downey Jr. plays Harry Lockhart, a small-time New York thief who winds up, via a deliciously improbable circumstance, in Los Angeles. Preparing for a screen test, he falls under the tutelage of Perry van Shrike, played by Val Kilmer, a private detective widely known as Gay Perry because of his sexual preference (which is apparently something of a novelty in Southern California). The two of them engage in a lot of pixilated, hard-boiled banter, hurling one-liners, non sequiturs and riddles at each other with impressive speed and agility. Though both are hyperarticulate, Perry is clearly smarter. \u201cDo you know what you\u2019ll find in the dictionary next to the word idiot?\u201d he asks Harry. \u201cMy picture?\u201d \u201cNo. The definition of the word idiot, which is what you are.\u201dTouch\u00e9! Before long, this verbal sparring match becomes a three-way tag-team scrimmage, as Harry meets Harmony, a girl he knew back home in Indiana who has come west to escape some family ugliness. Harmony is played by Michelle Monaghan, who holds her own nicely in fairly intense company. You may find yourself wondering, all the same, about Harmony\u2019s beauty secrets, since while she and Harry are meant to be around the same age, the more-than-10-year gap between Ms. Monaghan and Mr. Downey is glaringly evident.But why trouble yourself with logic and consistency? Mr. Black clearly hasn\u2019t. A plot that is meant to be fiendishly twisty and elaborate just feels overly busy. Harmony is a devotee of a pulp private eye named Jonny Gossamer, and the skein of criminality and double-dealing that she, Perry and Harry unravel is meant to resemble one of the novels in which Gossamer appears. The best detective fiction, of course, gestures toward the seamy realities of power, lust and greed that lie underneath the hectic surface. \u201cKiss Kiss, Bang Bang,\u201d for all its atmospheric talk, has no such subtext, and its glib silliness is never more apparent than when it tries for strong emotions. A subplot involving the sexual abuse of a young child is not particularly upsetting, just crude and contrived.For the most part, though, the picture is content to be sleek, smooth and contrived. Mr. Black can\u2019t quite manage the mixture of mayhem and humor he is attempting, but at least he hops adroitly from one frantic scene to the next. In the end, it\u2019s more exhausting than thrilling. At one point, a villainous smoothie played by Corbin Bernsen looks pityingly at Harry, who has just been subjected to painful torture, and says, \u201cI hope you don\u2019t judge Los Angeles solely based on your experience here tonight.\u201d That would be an apt tag line for this movie\u2019s lobby posters.\u201cKiss Kiss, Bang Bang\u201d is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has lots of obscenity, nudity and graphic violence. Running time: 103 minutes.Advertisement"}

Michael Stiller\u2019s pliant lighting and James Lo\u2019s playful soundscape \u2014 sampling from Prokofiev, Ruth Draper monologues and the soundtrack to \u201cLa Dolce Vita,\u201d among other sources \u2014 also shift abruptly, as if sweeping us through portals, between dimensions.It\u2019s the three other dancers who commune most intimately with the theater, getting close to its architecture as they hold microphones to its worn walls (so much history in there), recline against its radiators and make a racket banging on the floor. Mr. Greenberg credits them with generating the movement, through improvisations recorded on video, then copied verbatim; that process comes through in their comfort with the material and the pleasure it appears to bring them. When Ms. Kleven crosses the stage with quizzical, stuttering steps, or Mr. Ingle balances in a low arabesque, or Ms. Omagbemi sits in a split and, smiling, slaps the ground, each seems to be slipping into something custom-made, for their bodies and the space.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s How.", "Date": "2018-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixProducts that we enjoy continue to create privacy, misinformation and workplace issues. We can do better at getting the industry to do better.It has never felt worse to be a technology consumer. So what can you do about it?That\u2019s the question of the year after many of the biggest tech companies were mired in scandal after scandal or exposed as having committed necessary evils to offer the products and services that we have so blissfully enjoyed.All of this bad behavior circles back to you. We are the buyers, users and supporters of the products and services that help Big Tech thrive.So what do we do at this point to become more ethical consumers?\u201cI think this is an incredibly powerful question to ask,\u201d said Jim Steyer, chief executive of Common Sense Media, a nonprofit that focuses on technology\u2019s impact on families. \u201cIt\u2019s a very important moment where consumer behavior can have a transformational impact.\u201dI talked to a broad range of people \u2014 ethicists, activists, environmentalists and others \u2014 about how to become a more empowered, socially responsible tech consumer. Here\u2019s what they agreed on.First and foremost, when tech does you wrong, one of the most powerful ways to protest is to take your business elsewhere and ask your friends and family to go along.Even so, damage to a brand may have plenty of repercussions because it motivates the company to change its behavior, Mr. Steyer said. Both Uber and Facebook, facing enormous pressure, have modified some of their practices and committed to improvements.\u201cSometimes shame is one of the most important arrows in your quiver,\u201d Mr. Steyer said. We can also take the path less traveled \u2014 that is, take our data and money to products made by more ethical vendors.Pulling the plug on Facebook is a hassle, but not impossible. Taking on the challenge of finding alternatives is an example of how people can give up some convenience in exchange for individual empowerment, said Shahid Buttar, a director of grass-roots advocacy for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights nonprofit.The same approach can be applied to Google if you take issue with its behavior. While Google offers a comprehensive suite of web services, including news, email and maps, you could switch to an alternative for each of those products.A rush shipment could involve multiple vehicles and various facilities before it gets to your door. So pause and ask yourself if you actually need that smartphone or scented candle tomorrow. If you can wait, choose no-rush delivery, which could take about a week.\u201cOne of the things you can do to be more responsible is to take greater ownership of your stuff,\u201d Mr. Lai said.The Cambridge Analytica scandal this year illustrates our responsibility to think about others, not just ourselves, when using technology.In other words, if people had disabled Apps Others Use, Cambridge Analytica most likely couldn\u2019t have collected the data of their friends. More important, if those who took the quiz were aware of the potential of sharing information about their friends, they might have opted not to participate.But how can you be more conscious of your actions when technology is so confusing in the first place?The bottom line is that you are not alone. And if a company makes it too difficult for you and your friends to stay safe while staying connected, you can leave.\u201cIf you\u2019re really uncomfortable with the values of a company, don\u2019t use their product,\u201d Mr. Steyer said.

They came up with a device that slips inside a bag, backpack or suitcase and keeps track of items using radio-frequency identification technology. If a wallet is not returned to the bag, the device sends a cellphone alert. If the cellphone is missing, the device beeps.The school\u2019s graduates and researchers have parlayed their ideas, skills and ambition into more than 50 start-up companies that have raised a total of $60 million from investors and created about 200 jobs. One start-up, Nanit, sells a smart baby monitor online and in stores, while three others have been acquired by companies, including one by Adobe.So far, 534 of the school\u2019s graduates \u2014 of whom, more than 60 percent remain in the city \u2014 have been hired by Google, Bloomberg, Microsoft and other technology companies.\u201cIt really sends a message to the broader tech industry and also the whole world that New York City is serious about tech,\u201d said Julie Samuels, executive director of Tech: NYC, a nonprofit industry group.Citywide, the technology industry employs more than 320,000 people, according to Tech: NYC. Many work in what Ms. Samuels calls an expanding \u201cecosystem\u201d of more than 7,000 small start-up companies. New York\u2019s ascendance as a technology hub was reaffirmed by Google\u2019s announcement on Monday that it would create a $1 billion campus in the West Village that would allow the company to double the size of its 7,000 employee work force in the city.Cornell University and its partner, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, won $100 million and a spot on Roosevelt Island.\u201cThey\u2019re a very prestigious institution that is free-riding off the backs of a working population to function in an environment that they really are not adequately paying for,\u201d said Joyce Short, a writer and longtime resident.All the money and attention showered on Cornell Tech has, at times, overshadowed other schools. New York University, which also took part in the 2010 competition, is creating a $380-million tech hub for emerging media, technology and the arts in the former headquarters of New York City Transit, then known as the New York City Transit Authority. Across the street, its Tandon School of Engineering runs several incubators for start-ups.Josh Hartmann, a former chief technology officer for Travelocity and Amplify who now teaches at Cornell Tech, said technology-focused schools are an integral part of what he called a \u201cvirtuous cycle\u201d that drives the city\u2019s tech industry. The schools attract faculty members and support research, both of which draw more students. The students increase and diversify the talent pool, which in turn brings more companies.On a recent evening, students were huddled together in \u201cthe collaboratory\u201d \u2014 Cornell Tech\u2019s version of a library with tables and smart boards. Downstairs, the school\u2019s \u201cstudio_code:\u201d displayed seven principles for innovation, including \u201cBuild Things That Matter\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Be a Jerk.\u201dEvery student is assigned to a team that works with more than 50 companies, including Amazon and Samsung, on real-life problems that begin with, \u201cHow might we \u2026\u201d Mr. Huttenlocher said that part of the challenge is learning to work together across different backgrounds, interests and programs.In the spring, students team up on their own to develop start-ups and then present them to parents, technology leaders and investors. Last May, four teams were chosen from dozens of entrants. Each team received a $100,000 award, including office space, to pursue its start-up.Ms. Le Cam, 24, who studied computer science, wrote the app for the device, which keeps track of every item marked by a chip-implanted sticker. The prototype started out shaped like an egg, but testers gave that a thumbs down because it would not fit in small bags. It was flattened, and took on a pocket shape.But Cornell Tech\u2019s entrepreneurial culture is contagious, she said. \u201cYou\u2019re in an environment where everyone is thinking about it,\u201d Ms. Moldavskaya said.The school\u2019s operating budget is $50 million annually and is covered partly through student tuition, which starts at $54,584 a year and increases to $102,652 for a master\u2019s in business administration. The school has also raised $815 million in private donations, including $350 million from Atlantic Philanthropies, whose founder is a Cornell graduate, and $100 million from Bloomberg Philanthropies.Jay Jacobson, 82, a retired lawyer who lives on Roosevelt Island, recently worked with Cornell Tech students to address a daily problem for older people: how to carry a shopping bag when holding onto a walker? They came up with a 3-D-printed hinge to attach to a walker.\u201cI\u2019m so glad I\u2019m part of their community,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a delight to have them.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the Downtown Brooklyn building where New York University\u2019s new tech hub is located. The building is the former headquarters of New York City Transit, then known as the New York City Transit Authority.

{"Headline": "Tech Stocks Often Rise and Fall Together. They Shouldn\u2019t.", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThe stock market often acts as though tech stocks were members of a close-knit family that must always travel together.Talking about tech as if it were a monolith isn\u2019t entirely wrong. Tech stocks often do move in a pack \u2014 mainly because investors frequently treat them as a cohesive entity.\u201cWhat we call \u2018tech companies\u2019 really includes a broad range of companies that are at different stages of maturity,\u201d Professor Damodaran said in an interview. \u201cThe aging process for tech companies \u2014 which usually start out as high-growth companies \u2014 is very rapid.\u201cAlso, some companies are more tech at their core. Some are less tech,\u201d he added. \u201cWe should be looking at companies along a kind of a spectrum, along at least two dimensions.\u201dThe problem, then, is twofold.\u25a0 First, Professor Damodaran said, \u201ctech companies live in dog years.\u201d They have accelerated life cycles and behave differently as children and mature adults. A young money-burning company like Tesla and an old cash-generating company like IBM need to be evaluated with different metrics.\u25a0 Second, tech has become ubiquitous. \u201cNearly all big companies today are tech companies, at least to some degree,\u201d he said. In late 2018, simply using advanced technology isn\u2019t a distinguishing characteristic.Even the newspaper industry \u2014 which used linotype machines and pneumatic tubes when I started as a copy boy in the 20th century \u2014 has a lot in common with tech companies. Like Netflix and Spotify, for example, The New York Times and The Washington Post use streaming technology and data analysis to feed information and entertainment to growing armies of digital subscribers.\u201cOn the day that, say, 60 percent of profits and revenues come from digital sources, do we reclassify these companies as tech companies?\u201d Professor Damodaran asked.Similarly, he compared Tesla, which makes electric cars and is widely viewed as a tech company, with Ford and General Motors. Should Ford and G.M. be categorized as tech companies, too, when the bulk of their revenue eventually derives from electric vehicles?Tesla and IBM are at two ends of what Professor Damodaran calls the tech company life cycle.As an infant company, Tesla poses a valuation challenge. Assessing the value of a stock typically starts with an assessment of earnings and cash flow, but that requires imagination with Tesla because it churns out annual losses, not earnings. Yet investors in the stock market collectively say Tesla is worth about $60 billion, more than G.M. or Ford, which make profits.Will Tesla become profitable enough to justify its current price? Professor Damodaran believes its shares are grossly overvalued. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to know with a young company,\u201d he conceded, adding that Tesla is \u201ca risky proposition but not an impossible one.\u201dOld profitable companies like IBM are easier to value. The stock market says it is worth about $110 billion, based on a price-to-earnings ratio of 8.4. That ratio is less than half the level at which the average stock trades, presumably because IBM hasn\u2019t been growing rapidly and, by some metrics, has been shrinking.\u201cAn old company can\u2019t run as fast as a young company can, and usually it shouldn\u2019t try,\u201d he said.Sober analysis is critical to market health. Consider the damage done by bouts of magical thinking about the value of tech stocks.While valuations are generally more subdued today, imprecise thinking about tech stocks abides, with troubling implications.Amazon, for example, trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 109 \u2014 more than five times the valuation of the average stock. That has given its shareholders, including its founder, Jeff Bezos, astonishing wealth. It has allowed the company, which is old in tech years, to behave like an upstart, Professor Damodaran said, plowing profits into new businesses and disrupting entire industries.The answers should be different in each case, because tech stocks really aren\u2019t the same. One day, grouping them together is likely to seem quaint and, possibly, dangerous.Follow Jeff Sommer on Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Would Seattle Drink Coffee From Its Stanley Cup?", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Pro HockeySEATTLE \u2014 Bustling, bruising, big-time hockey in this foggy, tech-loving, latte-sipping city?When you think of professional sports in Seattle, Pete Carroll, Russell Wilson and the Seahawks may come to mind. Or maybe your memory drifts to Ken Griffey Jr. batting for the Mariners.Perhaps, as so many people in this town do, you remember ghosts of the N.B.A.: Gary Payton, Shawn Kemp, Downtown Freddie Brown. But the SuperSonics have been gone for a decade. In 2008, they shuffled off, ignominiously, to Oklahoma City to be reborn as the Thunder.You want to talk about ghosts? The illustrious, if little-known, Seattle Metropolitans were the first American hockey team to hoist the Stanley Cup. But that was in 1917. Hockey, at its highest level, hasn\u2019t been played here for nearly a century.This once brawling seaport has changed a lot since then.When the N.H.L. announced last week that Seattle would get the league\u2019s 32nd franchise, it stuck its fork into an organic salad and popped the top on a craft beer.Seattle\u2019s new hockey team does not have a name yet, but it has deep-pocketed owners who plan to complete a lavish, privately funded, $850 million upgrade of the Sonics\u2019 downtown stadium, Key Arena, in order to begin playing in it in the fall of 2021.Will these hyped early days translate into long-term success?\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d said Tim Pipes, one of the most passionate grass-roots hockey supporters in town. \u201cAll of the elements are here. The whole area is ripe for the greatest game going.\u201dPipes, who grew up in Toronto rooting for the Maple Leafs, is owner and impresario at the Angry Beaver, a cozy, no-frills watering hole north of downtown with a distinctly Canadian atmosphere and a billing as Seattle\u2019s only full-fledged hockey bar.Like many other tried-and-true puck heads here, Pipes, 56, sandy-haired and enthusiastic, is part hockey evangelist and part historian of the sport in his adopted city. Over the years, he said, with nothing more to root for but local minor league and junior teams, the game in Seattle has developed a deeply dedicated following.\u201cComing from Toronto, I really found hockey to be a very quirky thing here,\u201d Pipes told me. His bar was dense with the smell of poutine. Patrons were drinking Molson and watching N.H.L. games on big-screen TVs. \u201cBut quirky \u2014 that\u2019s good. Hockey is an unusual sport. There\u2019s nothing like it. The speed. The power. And it\u2019s a ballet on ice.\u201cSure,\u2019\u2019 he continued, \u201cit\u2019s not as popular in the U.S. as a sport like football, but just like with pro soccer and our Sounders, where they have huge crowds all the time, a sport as exciting and niche as hockey seems like a natural fit in a place like this.\u201dSeattle has long been a city that prides itself on idiosyncrasies.Huge corporations like Boeing, Amazon, Microsoft and Starbucks took root here, of all places, in this drizzly Northwest corner of the continental United States. Few cities have such a dense array of nooks and crannies, of tree-lined lakes and narrow waterways, of tucked-away neighborhoods and quiet cafes.One of Seattle\u2019s most popular annual parades snakes by a 16-foot statue of Vladimir Lenin and features throngs of nude bicyclists. One of the most beloved works of public art is a massive sculpture of a craggy troll who sits in the shadows beneath an old bridge.The city gave birth to grunge rock music in the 1990s. But many people forget that well before then, Seattle had a flourishing African-American jazz scene, where Ray Charles, Ernestine Anderson and Quincy Jones developed their chops. Jimi Hendrix grew up here.Quirky? Bruce Lee honed his martial art in the same neighborhood.New, cool and different have always had a home in Seattle \u2014 so long as new and cool and different were great.Still, as I moved about the city after the N.H.L. announcement, it was hard to gauge much general excitement for Seattle\u2019s new hockey team. That was hardly surprising. Seattle\u2019s culture is politely understated, and opening day is three years off.But at the Angry Beaver, on a weekend night, I could feel enormous energy. Most patrons were watching the Boston Bruins play the Toronto Maple Leafs.\u201cThe Bruins are my favorite team, but the N.H.L. in Seattle is something I\u2019ve been waiting for my whole life,\u201d said Jim Cockrill, a heavy equipment operator wearing a No. 37 Bruins jersey.Cockrill faithfully attended minor league hockey games as a boy, hoping against hope that the N.H.L. would one day come to town. \u201cIt\u2019s like a dream,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone here will say the same.\u201dCockrill was something of an anomaly at the bar: a native of the area. Surrounding him were other Bruins fans \u2014 most of them from Boston or other parts of the East Coast. Across from him were Toronto supporters. All but a few were from Toronto or points far beyond the state of Washington.\u201cThe transplants,\u201d Pipes called them, before proudly noting that he had come to Seattle to be a rock musician, so he was one of them. \u201cThe transplants bring the love of hockey that they learned in places like Boston, New York or Canada. They\u2019re so passionate about the sport!\u201cNow they\u2019re going to be falling in love with a new team.\u201dHis saloon hummed. Clusters of men and women, eyes on the television sets, shouted, cursed and laughed. \u201cAh, my beloved Red Wings,\u201d said Raoul Beacom, 62. He spoke wistfully of growing up in the Midwest and going to Red Wings games with his father. \u201cYou know, I will always back Detroit,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the memories of youth.\u201cBut now I\u2019ll have someone new to root for. Seattle has the longest-suffering fans in hockey. It\u2019s been 101 years since the Metropolitans won the Stanley Cup. After all these years, the game will be back.\u201dHockey in Seattle?You bet. And I\u2019ll have a cappuccino.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Was It Something We Said? U.S. Border Towns Fret as Canadians Stay Home", "Date": "2018-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBLAINE, Wash. \u2014 This town near the border of Canada is home to only 5,500 residents, but it has about 20 mailbox stores \u2014 so many that the town recently banned new ones from being constructed along the main drag. The stores were built on their allure to Canadians, who save in shipping and customs costs by having their waders from L.L. Bean or mock Tiffany lamps from Amazon mailed to the stores, then carry the packages back over the border.But this year, the packages have slowed. The mailbox stores have quieted. And Canadians say politics and pride are keeping them away.\u201cFor a lot of people, your president is not their favorite, and they\u2019ve chosen to stay home instead,\u201d said Colleen Clark, 48, a Canadian who lives just 10 minutes from the border, and has stopped coming. \u201cThe whole Trump idea \u2014 the building the wall, the this and the that. Canadians are a bit more open and inclusive, we\u2019re not into building walls.\u201dWhy did the Canadian cross the border? That\u2019s a complex calculation on America\u2019s northern edge from here in Blaine to the tip of Maine because the variables are always in flux, as currency exchange rates, online shopping trends \u2014 and now the uncertainties of international politics and national pride \u2014 filter into the mix.Rarely have things been so tense. Earlier this year, in the midst of a trade dispute, President Trump called Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, \u201cdishonest and weak,\u201d and threatened punitive action against Canada, one of the United States\u2019 biggest trading partners. Canadian shoppers have not forgotten, according to recent surveys in Canada and interviews with dozens of people on both sides of the border.And the stores of Blaine, only 30 miles from Canada\u2019s third-largest city, Vancouver, have felt the impact.Ms. Clark, for her part, said that hard-nosed economics was reason enough to stay home. She is the executive director of the chamber of commerce in Langley, British Columbia, and said the tense back and forth between the countries over tariffs and the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement have roiled the businesses she represents, which include dairy farmers and manufacturers.Her decision to stop coming to the United States was partly in solidarity with them. \u201cI wanted to put my money where my mouth is,\u201d she said.Recent surveys of Canadians suggest that such feelings run deep, concluding that shoppers intend to keep more of their money at home this year. A study by the Whatcom Council of Governments found that Canadians spent less time in the United States this year than they did five years ago, and of those who did travel there, fewer ventured much past the border.It was too early to know for sure whether the shifting mood was having a tangible effect on the economy of border towns in the northern United States, economists said. Overall, Washington State\u2019s economy has expanded with job and population growth, and some of the strongest growth has occurred north of Seattle, near the Canadian border. Any downturn in visits from Canadians would be muted by that.And the statistics on border crossings have been mixed \u2014 with some months up from 2017 and others down. The most recent figures available, for September, showed 32,000 fewer people in passenger vehicles entering the United States from Canada into Blaine, Wash., a 4.6 percent drop from the same month last year.But Michael LeBlanc, a senior retail adviser at the Retail Council of Canada, a trade group, said Mr. Trump had stirred Canadian pride.\u201cThey were generally insulted by the tone,\u201d he said of Canadians, \u201cand it kind of put steel in their spines, \u2018Well, I\u2019m just not going to shop in America.\u2019\u201dSteve Hagen, who runs a mailbox store in Blaine, said he was closely watching every shift of mood for portents of what may come. At Hagen\u2019s of Blaine, which includes a play area for children who have crossed the border with their parents, Mr. Hagen said October business fell sharply. It picked up after Thanksgiving, though, so the overall picture still seemed unclear.What Canadians think about America as a whole can sometimes be distinct from what they feel about their closest American towns. In towns like Blaine, some Canadian customers live only a few blocks from the cluster of mailbox stores. (Regulations are part of the mix too: Depending on how long Canadians are in the United States and how much money they have spent, they are supposed to declare purchases from other places and pay Canadian taxes.)\u201cFor Canadians, Whatcom County is a kind of near-abroad \u2014 it\u2019s seen as not quite American,\u201d Tom Roehl, a professor of international economics at Western Washington University in Bellingham, said of the county closest to the Canadian border, which includes Blaine. \u201cWe kind of take advantage of that.\u201dShane Miller, a computer programmer from Canada who bought specialty Christmas decorations at Hagen\u2019s on a recent day, said he was traveling across the border less frequently. But he said there were products that cannot be found in Canada, or that carry such huge shipping and customs costs as to make him drive over.\u201cI\u2019m not going to lie,\u201d said Mr. Miller, 45. \u201cA lot of Canadians, myself included, are not huge fans of the political status of the U.S. right now, but I don\u2019t let that stop me \u2014 though I might think twice about taking a long vacation down south or something.\u201dBargains can be alluring, too.\u201cI still like to shop a lot,\u201d said Tina Olexa, 54, a marketing trainer from Surrey, southeast of Vancouver.Ms. Olexa thinks all the bluster about pride and nationhood, on both sides of the border, may fade. \u201cThere are people who say, \u201cWell, I\u2019m not going to support the United States,\u2019 and I think, \u2018Well, how long is that going to last?\u2019\u201d she said.Shannon Newson, who lives 30 minutes from the United States in the suburbs of Vancouver, is still coming.She said the Pacific Northwest still feels a little like Canada to her \u2014 fern-green and wet and not all that friendly to Mr. Trump either. Washington State went strongly for Hillary Clinton in 2016, and Whatcom County delivered one of her most lopsided majorities. \u201cIf I lived somewhere where I had to go into a red state to shop, I might think differently,\u201d Ms. Newson said on a recent morning as she embarked on a two-day shopping trip in the United States.Advertisement"}

Site and Tries to Fend Off Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Supporters", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmazon is trying to quell rising opposition to its plan for offices in New York, hiring well-connected lobbyists to make its case in the corridors of power even as it mounts a block-by-block neighborhood effort against the grass-roots network that helped push Representative-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to victory.Company executives, setting up shop in a hotel in Long Island City, Queens, where Amazon wants to build a new campus, have been walking the streets, sometimes accompanied by city officials, to listen to residents and drum up support.The extent of their reach could be felt at City Hall on Tuesday where two newly hired lobbyists, Mark Weprin, a former Queens city councilman, and Ed Wallace, another former councilman, conferred with city officials in the soaring marble rotunda and made the case for the company. The timing was not coincidental: Amazon executives are expected to face withering questioning before the New York City Council at a public hearing on Wednesday.The packed hearing room in City Hall had the same tensions as on the streets. Lobbyists sat along with Brian Huseman, Amazon\u2019s vice president for public policy, and Holly Sullivan, Amazon\u2019s director of global economic development who lead the search for a new headquarters. Opponents sat in the balcony ready to pounce.Even before the executives spoke, the Council speaker, Corey Johnson, chided the company for seeking to avoid public scrutiny of the deal, appearing before the Council reluctantly and only after having reached an agreement with the city and state.\u201cThis hearing today is fairly atypical,\u2019\u2019 he said, adding that companies usually come to the Council before a development deal for city land is made.\u201cThe city even agreed to Bezo\u2019s damn helipad,\u2019\u2019 said Jimmy Van Bramer, the councilman who represents Long Island City, referring to Amazon winning the right to a helipad for its chief executive, Jeff Bezos.As the Amazon executives were sworn in for testimony, opponents began chanting.\u201cAmazon has got to go!\u201d some shouted.Mr. Johnson quieted the protesters by promising to ask tough questions.Mr. Huseman started with a prepared statement. \u201cAmazon\u2019s mission is to be Earth\u2019s most customer-centric company,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cWe chose New York City for our headquarters because it\u2019s a diverse, innovative city.\u2019\u2019The ground battle comes weeks after Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio, frequent antagonists who teamed up to lure Amazon, presented the deal to bring 25,000 of the company\u2019s workers to Long Island City as a major victory. But they did not anticipate the sustained anger that would greet the news.Critics object to the lack of a public review of the deal, the potential impact on immigrant and low-income areas of Queens that are already facing gentrification and, most of all, the incentives from the state and city that could total $3 billion \u2014 all for one of the world\u2019s richest and ubiquitous companies.Still, while opponents can ratchet up the rhetoric, there is little they can do to unravel the deal: It does not need approval from the City Council. Nonetheless, Amazon, along with the city and state, is making an intensive push to sell the deal.\u201cWe are excited to work with New Yorkers over the coming months and years to bring a new Amazon headquarters to Long Island City and help support the community,\u201d the company said in a statement.For weeks, executives in charge of the company\u2019s public policy have been making frequent flights to New York City from their offices in Washington, D.C. They visited the Queensbridge Houses, the nation\u2019s largest public housing development, a short walk from the future site of the Amazon offices, and have held meetings with community groups.This month, the company hired SKDKnickerbocker, a prominent political consulting and public relations firm that has advised several Democratic campaigns and whose roster includes influential strategists like Anita Dunn, a top White House official in the Obama administration. Devon Puglia, a former spokesman for the city comptroller, is leading the firm\u2019s work on Amazon.Even before the deal, Amazon had a local lobbyist, Yoswein New York, which is led by a former Assembly member.The company\u2019s executives suggest that the negative reaction was not out of the ordinary, and pointed to a poll this month by Quinnipiac University showing support for the deal in Queens.But Amazon, and the incentives it will receive, are a first topic of conversation in many circles in Queens. Neighbors debate the merits of the incentives in person and over text messages. Some are afraid to bring up the subject of Amazon, even among solidly liberal friends, for fear of sparking an argument.Gianna Cerbone, a restaurateur in Long Island City, said she saw a decline in her business after speaking positively of Amazon. \u201cA local person told me, \u2018Well, you shouldn\u2019t have shown so much support,\u2019\u201d she said.\u201cI said, I will stand my ground like a pillar in the community,\u201d said Ms. Cerbone, who agreed to be on an advisory board for the project organized by the city and state. \u201cYou can oppose it \u2014 why can\u2019t I be for it?\u201dYoung volunteers, many fresh off the Ocasio-Cortez campaign, have been knocking on doors around Long Island City and neighboring areas of Queens to generate opposition to the Amazon deal. Hundreds packed a cavernous Episcopal church in Astoria on Monday night, with scores left waiting in a line outside, to rail against the company.\u201cWhen our communities are under attack, what do we do?\u201d one speaker called out.\u201cStand up, fight back!\u201d the room of more than 300 responded in unison.\u201cA lot of people who volunteered for the campaign are now organizing with us against Amazon,\u201d said Aaron Taube, a D.S.A. member and freelance writer who helped direct canvassing on behalf of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. \u201cO.K. the election is over, how do we keep organizing?\u201dMs. Ocasio-Cortez was among the first politicians to pan the deal, saying that a company of Amazon\u2019s size should not \u201creceive hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks at a time when our subway is crumbling and our communities need more investment.\u201dSome New York-based activists have also been sharing notes with democratic socialist counterparts in Seattle over tactics for resisting Amazon. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing unique about Seattle, or Amazon,\u201d said Kshama Sawant, a Socialist city councilwoman in Seattle who has sparred with the company there. \u201cBig business expect to get their way without making big ripples in the news. The best tactic is you build a movement in the streets.\u201dIn Queens, some Amazon opponents are recent arrivals to the borough. Others are long-term residents fearful of being forced out of their homes amid rising rents that, they believe, Amazon will hasten.Thomas Muccioli, 31, knocked on doors on Sunday in Woodside, Queens, a neighborhood where he said his family has lived since the 1930s. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of crazy to be trying to protect your neighborhood that you grew up in,\u201d said Mr. Muccioli, an actor who makes the rent, he said, by working side jobs wherever he can find them.Even some longstanding progressive organizers said they had been struck by the level of uncontrolled outrage over the deal.\u201cWe were surprised,\u201d said Deborah Axt of Make the Road New York, an immigrant advocacy group opposed to the deal. \u201cThis is so far above and beyond a traditional coalition effort \u2014 it\u2019s broader, it\u2019s crazier.\u201dActivists have used chalk to write slogans on the sidewalk and posted stenciled messages around Long Island City. Vandals sprayed \u201cScamazon\u201d in large letters across an abandoned restaurant on the site of the company\u2019s future home. (The city, which owns the land, had the graffiti cleaned up hours after it was discovered.)In response, city and state officials scrambled to rally supporters. In advance of the hearing, Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Cuomo issued a joint statement announcing a 45-member advisory board for the project \u2014 to show local backing and solidify the deal. Like the City Council, the advisory board will not have the power to block the deal, but those who agreed to serve on it said they hoped to shape the process.\u201cI\u2019m going in with my eyes wide open \u2014 I know there are many players involved,\u201d said Meghan Cirrito, 41, of the Gantry Parent Association, who agreed to join the board.Other members of the board, set to meet in January for the first time, include the tenant association presidents of nearby public housing developments, business groups and local civic organizations among others.In making a deal with Amazon, the mayor and the governor negotiated behind closed doors and created a process that prevents the City Council from having any power to amend or torpedo the agreement. City and state officials provided detailed information to the company and agreed to sign a nondisclosure agreement that required them to alert Amazon every time a news reporter made a public information request about the deal.But before then, activists and Amazon are hoping to win over longtime residents like Rose Sullivan, 62. As she walked her dogs on Sunday night, she listened to Mr. Muccioli and two other canvassers explain their opposition.\u201cI have mixed feelings,\u201d Ms. Sullivan said after the canvassers had left. She liked the idea of bringing jobs to the area, but feared the side effects.\u201cWe\u2019re already getting priced out,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to put another strain.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Said Amazon Was Scamming the Post Office. His Administration Disagrees.", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump spent much of last spring accusing Amazon of pulling a \u201cscam\u201d on the American taxpayer and ripping off the United States Postal Service. On Tuesday, his administration delivered its own verdict: Not so much.Commercial package delivery is not profitable enough to offset the revenue losses the Postal Service is suffering, however, as Americans mail fewer and fewer first-class letters, and the Treasury Department task force outlined several recommendations to help shore up its finances.\u201cShould be charging MUCH MORE!\u201d he wrote.But the report did include some recommendations that made online retailers uneasy. One would push the Postal Service to price package delivery to maximize profits, instead of maximizing delivery volume. Another would force the service to create separate accounting books for letters and for packages, which retailers fear could lead to an increase in package rates.It also called for steps to reduce the service\u2019s labor costs, including eliminating collective bargaining over pay for postal employees. And it recommended lifting caps on how much the service can charge for letter delivery and giving it power to reduce the number of days it delivers mail \u2014 which most likely would mean ending letter delivery on Saturdays.The task force also proposed creating a complicated new system of pricing for packages, in which it could cost less to send a box of prescription drugs than to send a board game. It would also allow the postal system to charge other delivery services for access to Americans\u2019 mailboxes; under current law, the Postal Service holds a monopoly on what can actually be delivered to a mailbox.Amazon and many other retailers formed an advocacy group on postal issues this year, called the Package Coalition. Its chairman, the former Army secretary John M. McHugh, said on Tuesday that the coalition was \u201cconcerned that some of the task force recommendations, including the recommendation to create a separate package business, would needlessly reduce efficiency and force the Postal Service to raise prices on American businesses and consumers.\u201dAdministration officials played down the report\u2019s links to Mr. Trump\u2019s frequent Twitter complaints about Amazon. \u201cNone of our findings relate to any one customer of the Postal Service,\u201d a senior administration official said on Tuesday afternoon, in a briefing call with reporters. \u201cWe based our analysis on the needs of all our economy.\u201dInstead, they cast the report as a needed set of reforms for a service that has been losing money for a decade, and is projected to lose tens of billions over the next decade.\u201cWe believe these are the first steps forward,\u201d Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, wrote to Mr. Trump at the beginning of the report, \u201cin creating a sustainable business model under which the U.S.P.S. can continue to provide necessary mail services for all Americans.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Happens When 25,000 Amazon Workers Flush Toilets?", "Date": "2018-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt might seem mundane, but what happens in the bathroom matters: New York, for all its modern conveniences, sits atop a century-old sewage system used by more people than ever before. Every time someone flushes, washes their hands or takes a shower, all that household wastewater (and worse) flows down into 7,500 miles of sewer pipes. Most of these pipes also do double duty, collecting rainwater runoff from rooftops as well as streets.When these sewer pipes get clogged by humans \u2014 flushing baby wipes anyone? \u2014 or simply overloaded with rainwater, it becomes everyone\u2019s problem. The \u201ccombined sewer overflows\u201d are discharged directly into nearby rivers, bays and creeks instead of going to wastewater treatment plants. Raw sewage also backs up in homes, creating a stomach-turning mess.Long Island City residents say these backups and overflows already happen whenever it rains hard \u2014 and 25,000 more Amazon workers will only make the problem worse. But city officials say they are ready to take on whatever comes down the pipes. Here is why.A New Yorker typically uses 100 gallons of water per day, from showering and brushing teeth to washing dishes and clothes, according to the city. All that water goes into the sewer pipes.By that math, 25,000 Amazon workers will produce 2.5 million gallons of wastewater per day. While that sounds like a lot, it is actually not by city standards.For context, about 1.3 billion gallons of wastewater pass daily through the entire sewage system on rainless days. Even when it rains, the system can handle up to 3.8 billion gallons of wastewater per day.Amazon\u2019s wastewater will flow into pipes that are bigger than those found in most residential neighborhoods. Long Island City is a former industrial area, so its pipes once handled the output from factories and businesses.These sewer pipes are also in relatively good shape, said Vincent Sapienza, commissioner of the city\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection. The oldest pipes date to the 1900s, while others were added in the 1920s when construction was planned for the entrance to the Queens-Midtown Tunnel. The rest came decades later.Citywide, the average age of a sewer line is about 80 years old.\u201cI would say Long Island City is middle-aged,\u201d Mr. Sapienza said.Nearly all of Long Island City\u2019s wastewater is whisked away to the Bowery Bay Wastewater Treatment Plant in Astoria, Queens, one of the city\u2019s 14 sewage treatment plants.Currently, the Bowery Bay plant processes about 100 million gallons of wastewater each day. It can handle much more \u2014 up to 150 million gallons a day \u2014 leaving plenty of room for Amazon\u2019s wastewater, city officials said.\u201cEven if there\u2019s an influx of 25,000 people, that\u2019s only 2.5 million gallons more a day,\u201d Mr. Sapienza said.\u201cIt\u2019s not much. In the scheme of things, it\u2019s not a big difference.\u201dHeavy rains, however, can upend the city\u2019s sewage calculations. In Long Island City, as in many other neighborhoods, sewer lines can fill up with so much rainwater runoff that there are combined sewer overflows.Citywide, about 20 billion gallons of combined sewer overflows are discharged annually into local waterways. Still, that is an improvement from nearly 110 billion gallons annually in 1985. The overflows can trigger beach closings and restrictions on recreational water use.\u201cThat\u2019s the No. 1 water pollution problem in New York City,\u201d said Eric A. Goldstein, a senior lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an advocacy group. \u201cIt happens every time it rains \u2014 whether Amazon gets built or not.\u201dBut Amazon \u2014 or any large development \u2014 could exacerbate that existing wet weather pollution problem, Mr. Goldstein added.A 2012 city rule requires new developments to take measures to retain significant amounts of rainwater on site, such as using green roofs and porous pavements. As a result, city officials said, Amazon\u2019s new headquarters would be an improvement over older buildings \u2014 and could actually end up reducing rainwater runoff in the sewage system.Mr. Sapienza said his agency will be monitoring Amazon\u2019s development to see if additional work is needed.An Amazon official said the company has not yet begun to design its buildings and will address infrastructure needs during the environmental review process. In Seattle, where Amazon is based, its buildings have green roofs and low-flow fixtures in the restrooms, and capture rainwater to use to water the landscape.Still, critics worry these efforts will not be enough, especially given all the other development in Long Island City. They also pointed out that climate change could bring more frequent and more severe storms \u2014 and more rainwater runoff.City Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer, a Democrat who represents Long Island City, said sewer lines were built for fewer people, and have not kept up with the recent building boom. In many buildings, residents are asked not to flush during heavy rains, he said.\u201cThis would turn a situation that is untenable into a crisis if Amazon is able to build all of this and bring in all of these people,\u201d he said.Mike Dulong, a senior attorney for Riverkeeper, an environmental group, said Amazon\u2019s headquarters could undermine years of efforts to clean up local waters.\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of people,\u201d Mr. Dulong said. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of toilets and showers and sinks and wastewater going into treatment plants that are already overwhelmed every time there\u2019s a significant amount of rain.\u201dTom Paino, an architect and longtime resident, said that sewage problems have become a constant headache and \u201c$95 million is not enough to even begin to cover what needs to be done.\u201dNo matter how big the sewer pipes are, he said, \u201cThey are not big enough.\u201dAs it is, sewage backs up in homes and businesses. Combined sewer overflows wash up along the waterfront and in parks where children play, residents said, and with rising sea levels could creep farther inland in coming years.\u201cIt\u2019s a health hazard,\u201d said Ernie Brooks,\u201d a musician who lives near the Amazon site, who also complained of an odor from the overflows. \u201cIf you walk around Long Island City after a heavy rain, there\u2019s a lot of standing water \u2014 often at least a foot near where I live.\u201dSheila Lewandowski, the executive director of a nonprofit theater, lives a block away from the East River. Whenever a deluge is possible, she scrambles around her basement getting everything off the floor \u2014 even propping chairs and tables on top of paint cans \u2014 in case the river rises high enough to flood her home.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be cleaning the sewage off my furniture,\u201d she said.\u201cIf we don\u2019t deal with the problems that currently exist in the sewage system, every new building exacerbates each of those problems.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Allies in Conservative Media Put the President \u2018on the Griddle\u2019", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhenever President Trump is in a tight spot, things get tricky for Fox News.The cable network\u2019s most popular hosts have largely supported Mr. Trump and his agenda. The network\u2019s highest-rated host, Sean Hannity, took the stage with him at a rally in Missouri last month. Mr. Trump even hired the former Fox News co-president, Bill Shine, as the head of his communications team, and he has made no secret of the fact that he likes to start the day with the show \u201cFox & Friends.\u201dOn Thursday night and Friday morning, they faced the challenge of filling airtime with talk about the president just as he found himself in the middle of a crisis. And while the nighttime commentators tiptoed around a president in trouble, the morning host Brian Kilmeade was bluntly critical. In not toeing the White House line, he was following the lead of the firebrand writer Ann Coulter and the radio host Rush Limbaugh.The governmental drama also included Mr. Trump\u2019s blowing up a deal that would have allowed the government to avoid a shutdown over his demand of $5 billion for a border wall.\u201cKilling the wall would be a big political win for the left,\u201d Mr. Carlson said on Thursday, \u201cbut there are other considerations, too, like, what about America?\u201dAt the bottom of the screen flashed a chyron: \u201cDems Walk Away From Sensible Wall Debate.\u201dWith the sudden departure of the nation\u2019s military chief having alarmed leaders of both parties \u2014 Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said the loss of Mr. Mattis meant the country was \u201cheaded toward a series of grave policy errors which will endanger our nation\u201d \u2014 Fox News devoted much of its coverage in prime time to what it called, in large onscreen type, the \u201cWall Fight.\u201dAs the House of Representatives voted in favor of legislation that added $5.7 billion for a border wall \u2014 a bill unlikely to pass the Senate \u2014 Mr. Carlson parried with the Democratic strategist Julian Epstein about immigration. That was followed by a segment on a murder in California committed by an immigrant. After that, the host got around to addressing Syria and Mr. Mattis. And when he did, he echoed Mr. Trump\u2019s spin.\u201cIt may seem surprising that the president is breaking with one of his top advisers, but there\u2019s another way to look at it,\u201d Mr. Carlson said. \u201cPresident Trump was told the U.S. could defeat ISIS and then leave Syria once it did. The U.S. did that. Now everyone in Washington is demanding he stay in Syria to counterbalance Russia and Iran.\u201dBut the wall was the main story of the night at Fox News.Substituting for a vacationing Sean Hannity was Dan Bongino, a former Secret Service agent who was until recently a host on the National Rifle Association\u2019s media outlet, NRATV, a streaming service available through Apple, Amazon and Roku. On Fox News, Mr. Bongino, who has been praised by Mr. Trump, spent most of the hour talking through the legislative hurdles for potential wall funding.Guests on Mr. Bongino\u2019s edition of \u201cHannity\u201d included Representative Jody Hice, Republican of Georgia, who labeled the potential government shutdown a \u201cSchumer shutdown\u201d in reference to Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. Representative Tom Garrett, a Republican from Virginia, offered this: \u201cIf the clowns on the other side of the building want to fail, let them.\u201d\u201cThanks for fighting the good fight, guys,\u201d Mr. Bongino said.Conservative media had lasered in on the wall in the days leading up to the Congressional vote on the spending bill, and it seemed to have had a potent effect.Among the conservative commentators pushing Mr. Trump to hold the line was Steve Doocy, a co-host of \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d He rooted against the possible passage of a bill that did not include money for the wall. \u201cHe loses, and the Democrats will win everything they want,\u201d Mr. Doocy said on Wednesday morning.On his radio show Thursday afternoon, Mr. Limbaugh \u2014 who also appeared at the Missouri rally with Mr. Trump \u2014 pressured the president to veto any bill that did not include wall funding. But he was more politic in his language than Ms. Coulter.\u201cVeto this thing and then head down to Mar-a-Lago,\u201d Mr. Limbaugh said, referring to the president\u2019s club in Palm Beach, Fla.After advising Mr. Trump from behind the microphone, the host let his listeners know he had just received word from the White House that the president would indeed stick to his guns. At around that time, Mr. Trump told a gathering of House Republicans that he would not sign a spending measure that did not include the funding.On Friday morning, there was more tough talk from one of Mr. Trump\u2019s media allies.After noting the fall in the stock market and the threat of a government shutdown, Mr. Kilmeade said, \u201cIt was as crazy as any day \u2014 and when James Mattis walks in with that three-page resignation letter with subtle shots at the president, you got to wonder where we go on day two.\u201dMr. Kilmeade didn\u2019t hold back when he addressed the topic that had been played down on Fox News the night before: the president\u2019s decision to take troops out of Syria and Afghanistan.\u201cHe\u2019s giving Russia a big win,\u201d Mr. Kilmeade said during a back-and-forth with the White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. \u201cVladimir Putin praised him. He also is doing exactly what he criticized President Obama for doing \u2014 he said President Obama is the founder of ISIS. He just re-founded ISIS! He\u2019s really on the griddle with this.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption misstated the given name of a morning television host on Fox News. He is Brian Kilmeade, not Bill.An earlier version of a picture caption misstated the location of a rally for President Trump in Missouri. It was in Cape Girardeau, Mo., not Girardeau.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "James Duke, 88, Globe-Trotting Authority on Healing Plants, Is Dead", "Date": "2018-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe life-changing experience for James A. Duke came as he roamed the lush jungles of Panama in the mid-1960s, munching on the plants indigenous peoples used for food and medicine and learning firsthand about them.And what he found there, and ate, excited his imagination and led him to embrace ethnobotany, a then-emerging field that investigates the healing properties of plants that indigenous peoples have used for millenniums.His field work, incorporating botany, natural healing and anthropology, took him to remote corners of the world, often in the company of native guides and even shamans \u2014 worlds away from his early professional success as a standup-bass player in country, bluegrass and jazz bands.His peripatetic research made him a widely acknowledged expert at a time, the 1960s, when interest in traditional cultures was on the rise, in tandem with the burgeoning counterculture in Western countries.Dr. Duke was also a pioneer in identifying phytochemicals, the now familiar, often beneficial chemical constituents of foods like antioxidants in oregano and flavonoids in green tea. He poured the results of his work into a 1997 book, \u201cThe Green Pharmacy: New Discoveries in Herbal Remedies for Common Diseases and Conditions From the World\u2019s Foremost Authority on Healing Herbs,\u201d as well as into an extensive database he compiled for the Agriculture Department.The book has sold more than 1.5 million copies, according to the publisher, Rodale Press.His daughter, Celia Gayle Duke Larsen, said Dr. Duke died at his home on his six-acre herb farm in Fulton, Md. No specific cause was given. In addition to Ms. Larsen, he is survived by his wife, Peggy-Ann K. Duke; a son, John; four grandchildren; and one step-grandchild.In \u201cThe Green Pharmacy,\u201d Dr. Duke wrote that the trip to Panama, his second, involved interviewing local people about the wild plants they ate. The aim was to determine how long they might be displaced from their homes and way of life \u2014 \u201csix days, six months, six years, six centuries or six millennia,\u201d he wryly wrote \u2014 if the local flora were destroyed in building an alternative canal.The local people, Choco and Kuna Indians, knew exactly what was going on, Dr. Duke wrote, and sometimes asked if similar nuclear-based efforts were being used in, say, dredging the Great Lakes. The effort, sponsored by the now-defunct Atomic Energy Commission, sputtered and was allowed to lapse.\u201cThe Green Pharmacy\u201d took a folksy, anecdotal, sometimes whimsical approach to describing the herbs, foods and teas that Dr. Duke recommended for various ailments, arranged alphabetically. He named one tea \u201cDyspepsiKola.\u201dA gentle exhortation often followed a recommendation. After noting that the herb chamomile, which is known to soothe nerves, also has potent anti-inflammatory compounds, he wrote, \u201cIf I had carpal tunnel syndrome, I\u2019d drink several cups of chamomile tea a day.\u201dDr. Duke stressed that the stories he had heard, whether from indigenous peoples or the doctors and other herbalists cited in the book, often reflected empirical and historical findings about healing plants.He was critical of pharmaceutical companies and the doctors who zealously prescribed their products. Skeptical of the high prices and side effects of modern drugs, he championed plant medicines as a viable alternative.Dr. Duke had his own remedies. \u201cTo cure a cold, he mashes up the stems and leaves of forsythia,\u201d Ms. Raver wrote. \u201cTo help strengthen weak capillaries, he makes \u2018rutinade\u2019 from violet and buckwheat flowers, lemongrass and rhubarb stalks, and herbs high in rutin (anise, chamomile, mint, rose hips).\u201d Penobscot Indians up in Maine Had a very pithy sayin\u2019: Rub the root on every day And it will take your warts away! . . . I\u2019ll venture to prognosticate Before my song is sung: This herb will help eradicate Cancer of the lung.James Alan Duke was born on April 4, 1929, in Eastlake, a suburb of Birmingham, Ala., to Robert Edwin and Martha (Truss) Duke. His love of plants, he wrote, came from his mother, an avid gardener, and from spending time in the woods of rural Alabama with \u201ccountry cousins\u201d and an elderly neighbor, who introduced him to edible wild plants, like chestnuts and watercress.His parallel love of music began when he was 5 years old: He was selling magazines to help earn money for his family when he encountered bluegrass musicians in a local college dormitory.His native love of botany kicked in, though, and from 1952 to 1960 he earned bachelor\u2019s, master\u2019s and doctoral degrees in botany at Chapel Hill. He did postdoctoral work as a professor at Washington University in St. Louis and curatorial work at the Missouri Botanical Gardens there.Botany and music continued to be entwined in his life, however. While working, he would pick up gigs at clubs and perform with jazz, blues and country singers.\u201cThe deeper I delved into botanical medicine with its earthy folk roots,\u201d Dr. Duke wrote, \u201cthe more comfortable it \u2018fit\u2019 with the music I played, which also had deep roots in the same earthy folk experience.\u201dHe married Peggy-Ann Wetmore Kessler, a fellow botanist, in 1960. An illustrator as well, she made all the drawings for \u201cThe Green Pharmacy.\u201dDr. Duke\u2019s first work experience in Panama involved identifying plants along the last uncompleted stretch of what would become the Inter-American Highway, reaching from Alaska to Chile. His team collected more than 15,000 specimens in the two and a half years he spent on that trip to Panama.Dr. Duke held various positions at the Agriculture Department. As chief of the Plant Taxonomy Laboratory, he traveled to South America to help the State Department investigate and limit the cultivation of coca, from which cocaine can be extracted. He also visited Vietnam and neighboring Southeastern Asian countries to identify cash crops that might be grown as alternatives to the widely cultivated opium poppy.He got what he called his \u201cdream job\u201d at the department in 1977, as head of the Medicinal Plant Laboratory. In that job he traveled to China, the Middle East and South America to collect specimens for a cancer-screening program being run jointly with the National Cancer Institute. The program, he wrote, analyzed 10 percent of the world\u2019s known plant species for anti-tumor activity.Dr. Duke\u2019s other books include \u201cHandbook of Medicinal Herbs,\u201d an authoritative reference work first published in the late 1980s, and \u201cThe Peterson Field Guide to Medicinal Plants and Herbs of Eastern and Central North America,\u201d which he wrote with the herbalist Steven Foster.In 1991, Herbert Pierson, a fellow Cancer Institute toxicologist, told The Times that Dr. Duke\u2019s strength as an expert in herbal remedies was in his own firsthand experimentation, measuring the effects of plants on himself.\u201cHe actually practices what he preaches,\u201d Dr. Pierson said. \u201cNobody should underestimate his knowledge. He knows from folkloric use that these things aren\u2019t used by chance, that they\u2019ve survived the test of time.\u201dIndeed, in an interview with Ms. Raver in 1992, Dr. Duke spoke about his enthusiasm for dandelion. He liked the roots pickled in old pickle vinegar, and he had eaten every part of the dandelion, from root to seed.\u201cDandelions are extremely rich in beta carotene and ascorbic acid, the flowers in particular,\u201d he said. \u201cI sometimes eat 100 flowers in a day. I was trying to see if I\u2019d turn orange from beta carotene, and it didn\u2019t work.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "With Drone Deliveries on the Horizon, Europe Moves to Set Ground Rules", "Date": "2018-12-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut as e-commerce continues to grow, drones have the potential to reduce the time, cost and energy needed for many everyday deliveries \u2014 assuming they are managed well and used safely.Before a commercial drone industry can thrive, particularly in the crowded urban areas of Europe, different kinds of drones must be able to fly along their delivery routes without crashing into one another \u2014 and under a standardized set of regulations, experts say \u2014 not unlike cars on the road.The path to proving that drones can operate together and be tracked in crowded skies has brought a group of companies to a former military airfield outside Brussels, where they will test their unmanned aviation technology. The project, known as Safir, will help the European authorities devise a set of rules for the commercial use of drones.But Amazon\u2019s ambitions are just one part of the Safir initiative.\u201cIt is about testing 10 drones with different purposes, applications and IT systems,\u201d said Mark Vanlook, the chief executive of DronePort, the recently opened facility where the tests will take place.Other participants produce drones that can assist law enforcement, inspect power lines and monitor wildlife.The overall goal, Mr. Vanlook said, is making sure different drone systems can coexist while in flight. \u201cIf drones can\u2019t account for their surroundings, they will collide \u2014 and hurt people,\u201d he said.\u201cThe technology to build a single drone obviously exists, and now we are playing catch-up with registration, tracking and rule making, all things that will prevent chaotic, ad hoc incidents like the one at Gatwick,\u201d said Ellen Malfliet, an official from Unifly.\u201cThe market is Chinese dominated right now,\u201d said Ulrike Franke, a policy fellow focused on drones at the European Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cAnd if Europe wants to catch up, it first has to unify its rules and regulations, which will incentivize European drone producers to engage not just with their country but the entire European market.\u201dMembers of Safir met in Brussels at the end of November for planning. In the coming year, the group will test products together at DronePort, which provides users with office space and outdoor testing areas, as well as a long runway, a control tower and hangars. They are also planning a live demonstration over Antwerp, Belgium, provided that they pass a series of safety and certification tests, said Robin Garrity, an air-traffic management specialist helping to oversee the project.Participants say the live demonstration, if successful, will send a signal to businesses and consumers alike that a vibrant commercial drone industry is achievable.\u201cRight now, we are at the cusp of an industry that is completely changing, with tons of opportunities,\u201d Ms. Malfliet said. \u201cIt is vital to collaborate, to work together and move as quickly and as far as possible.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A $15 Minimum Wage Seemed Impossible. Now It\u2019s Reality for a Million New Yorkers.", "Date": "2018-12-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySix years after a group of fast-food workers in New York City \u2014 earning as little as $7.25 an hour \u2014 made the seemingly preposterous demand for a $15 minimum wage, more than one million of their peers will get just that starting this week.On Monday, the lowest legal wage at most companies that employ more than 10 workers rose by $2, to $15 an hour. Among those whose pay will increase are all fast-food workers as well as more than 25,000 workers at the city\u2019s two airports.The increase is the latest step in a gradual rise in the minimum wage that labor unions campaigned for and that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo eventually endorsed. New York City joins several other cities on the West Coast where minimum wages have already hit $15, including San Francisco and Seattle.\u201cThe \u2018Fight for 15\u2019 has gone from a rallying cry to facts on the ground in just a few short years,\u201d said Paul Sonn, the state policy program director with the National Employment Law Project, which advocates for low-wage workers. \u201cThis demand was from the fast-food workers who explained that was the minimum they needed for a decent life.\u201dBut the country is now a patchwork quilt of wages, with some states still operating under the federal minimum of $7.25 an hour. Outside New York City, Connecticut\u2019s minimum wage is $10.10, while in New Jersey it is $8.85, though the state\u2019s Democratic governor and the Legislature, which is also controlled by Democrats, want to raise it to $15.For hourly workers, the increase can make a big difference. Rosa Rivera earned just $5.15 an hour and relied on government assistance to pay her rent when she started working at a McDonald\u2019s in Manhattan 18 years ago. Now 53 and a veteran of several rallies for better wages, Ms. Rivera\u2019s eyes teared up as she spoke about attaining one of the main goals the workers had set.\u201cWhen I get my first check with $15, I\u2019m going to be so happy,\u201d said Ms. Rivera, an immigrant from El Salvador with three children. She said she was proud to pay her rent and help support her grandchildren without federal benefits.The \u201cFight for 15\u201d campaign began in 2012, when the minimum wage in New York State was $7.25. Fast-food wages had barely budged for many years, leaving many workers unable to to feed their families and pay bills.The campaign grew out of meetings community organizers convened to discuss the lack of affordable housing in New York, recalled Jonathan Westin, the executive director of New York Communities for Change.Talk quickly turned to the poor pay of so many fast-food and retail jobs, Mr. Westin said.\u201cThey were such temporary jobs and they paid so little,\u201d Mr. Westin said. \u201cThey felt like they really didn\u2019t have anything to lose.\u201dOrganizers thought $10 an hour was a reasonable demand, Mr. Westin said, but workers were unimpressed. Their attitude, he said, was that \u201c$10 is not going to get me anything. We need to go much higher.\u201dIn one of the more contentious confrontations, City Councilman Jumaane Williams of Brooklyn intervened to save the job of Shalonda Montgomery, who worked at a Wendy\u2019s in Downtown Brooklyn. After she joined a walkout, her manager fired her. Mr. Williams said he \u201cbasically staged an impromptu boycott\u201d of the restaurant: \u201cI started telling people why they shouldn\u2019t shop there.\u201dMs. Montgomery soon had her job back. \u201cThis is another one of those great examples of an organized, grass-roots campaign being able to change people\u2019s lives,\u201d said Mr. Williams, who is running for city public advocate. He admitted that even he did not believe a $15 minimum wage was realistic. \u201cI actually thought that, O.K., maybe we\u2019ll get $12,\u201d he said.In early 2015, Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, called for a raise of the hourly minimum wage to $11.50 in New York City and $10.50 for the rest of the state.Mayor Bill de Blasio had an even bolder proposal: raise the city minimum to $13 that year and to $15 by 2019. Mr. Cuomo declared the idea a \u201cnon-starter\u201d with lawmakers in Albany.But pressured by labor leaders like Hector Figueroa, president of 32BJ Service Employees International Union, Mr. Cuomo, who is often mentioned as a possible presidential candidate in 2020, changed his tone. In mid-2015, he convened a panel known as a wage board to consider raising the lowest wages of fast-food workers above the state minimum set by lawmakers in Albany.After several hearings, the wage board put fast-food workers on a track toward a $15 minimum wage. Within a year, Mr. Cuomo had negotiated a budget that included a series of steps to raise the minimum wage at different paces for workers in various parts of the state.That schedule may eventually bring the minimum to $15 an hour statewide. At smaller employers in the city, the minimum increased to $13.50 from $12, and will rise again to $15 on Dec. 31, 2019. On Long Island and in Westchester County, the minimum rose to $13 from $12, and will rise in two more increments to get to $15 in 2021.By then, several other cities across the country will have minimum wages at or near $15, though the effort has met opposition. In 2017, Kansas City residents voted to raise the city\u2019s minimum wage to $15 an hour. But the state legislature blocked the move, later approving a gradual increase of the state\u2019s hourly minimum wage to $12 by 2023, starting with an increase this year to $8.60 from $7.85.Mary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employees International Union, which adopted the Fight for 15 campaign across the country, said there would be more resistance like that encountered in Missouri. But she added: \u201cWe are bound and determined not to stop until all workers get on a path to $15 and also have a seat at the table and a voice in their jobs.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Manhattan Real Estate Slows After Years of Record Activity", "Date": "2018-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cIt\u2019s like we came off the autobahn: It feels very slow relative to the last three to four year years, but historically it\u2019s not.\u201dBut while brokers, developers and industry observers forecast more of the same for 2019, they aren\u2019t too concerned. The overall market remains healthy, they say, as does the local economy. Pamela Liebman, the chief executive of the Corcoran Group, agreed with that assessment. \u201cSince 2009, the market has gone on a very aggressive ride, and I think it\u2019s normal that we see a bit of a slowdown.\u201dComparatively speaking, \u201csales are not low \u2014 they are just not unusually high,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cIt\u2019s like we came off the autobahn: It feels very slow relative to the last three to four years, but historically it\u2019s not.\u201dIndeed, the average price for a condominium in Manhattan has risen 58 percent since 2008, according to CityRealty, which tracks unit sales, and the average price per square foot is 35 percent higher.During 2018, six apartment sales broke the $50 million mark, and nearly three dozen more closed above $25 million (though some were \u201clegacy contracts,\u201d signed during construction when the market was stronger). \u201cThat\u2019s remarkable by any objective measure,\u201d said Daniel Levy, CityRealty\u2019s chief executive.The year\u2019s biggest closings were two similarly configured duplexes at the just-opened 520 Park Avenue tower on 60th Street. The priciest property sold for nearly $74 million to James Dyson, the founder of the British home-electronics maker Dyson. The other duplex at 520 Park sold for $62 million. And downtown (which CityRealty defines as south of 30th Street) posted a record with the $59 million sale of a penthouse at the new Getty building at 503 West 24th Street, in Chelsea.Brokers say demand continued at all price levels, if not quite as insistently at the super high-end. But largely absent were the bidding wars of recent years and the rushed purchases from floor plans. Many buyers became more discerning as inventory, particularly in new developments, expanded. Others were more hesitant because of higher mortgage rates (which hurt the starter market in particular) and uncertainty about the new tax law. By Mr. Miller\u2019s account, there were 12 percent more housing units for sale in Manhattan than there were in 2017.As a result, developers have had to be more strategic to stay competitive. \u201cYou need to build in the right neighborhood for the right buyers, or offer something totally unique and in great demand,\u201d said Kenneth S. Horn, the founder of Alchemy Properties. He said sales at 250 West 81st Street, one of several new projects, have gone especially well because \u201cit was a new condo and there are not many new condos in that area.\u201dIndividual sellers, however, were slower to adapt to the changing marketplace, and saw their properties linger. As of the fourth quarter, it took an average of 152 days for a listing in Manhattan to go into contract, up from 101 days the same period in 2017, according to Garrett Derderian, the director of data and reporting for Stribling & Associates.Over all, the average Manhattan apartment price slid nearly 5 percent from 2017, to $2.06 million from $2.16 million, according to a year-end market report by CityRealty. (The drop would have been steeper without the pricey new-development sales.) Closed transactions for all condos and co-ops were projected to total 10,354, the report said, with sales reaching $21.3 billion. That\u2019s down from the 13,295 transactions and $25.7 billion in sales in 2017.\u201cThe larger story is volume,\u201d Mr. Levy said. \u201cWhile it\u2019s down, it\u2019s not falling off a cliff.\u201d Several luxury condominiums filled up in 2018, though the pace of sales and the average closing price declined significantly from the year before. \u201cPurchasers have more opportunities to select among many properties \u2014 they know they have choices, so they\u2019re taking their time,\u201d said Susan M. de Fran\u00e7a, the chief executive of Douglas Elliman Marketing. Developers also had to contend with fewer international buyers, who in past years were active in the new-construction sector. Some foreign buyers now face tighter restrictions for moving money out of their home countries, particularly in China.Within the Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group\u2019s portfolio of new developments, for instance, about three-quarters of the deals were negotiated, on average, for 7.4 percent below the asking price, said Kelly Kennedy Mack, the group\u2019s president. Less common were purchases during early stages of construction (with the exception of the higher-profile buildings), she added.Developers were also willing to offer more incentives, Ms. de Fran\u00e7a said, absorbing some closing costs or adding in \u201ca storage room or a wine cellar in the top of the market.\u201d In recent weeks, Extell Development even offered to pay three to five years of common charges for purchases made by year\u2019s end.The CityRealty report projected that in 2018, 1,050 units would be sold in Manhattan\u2019s two dozen or so new developments, reaching $5 billion in total sales \u2014 a drop from the 1,848 units and nearly $9 billion in sales in 2017. The average price fell to $4.54 million from $4.79 million in 2017, and a record $5.16 million in 2016. Among the year\u2019s most active developments was 160 Leroy Street in the West Village, where nearly all 57 residences sold. Its priciest sale was to Michael Rubin, the chief executive of the e-commerce company Kynetic. He bought a penthouse for $43.5 million, which was below the $51 million list price. Also, One West End Avenue, on the Upper West Side near 60th Street, saw more than a quarter of its 246 units sell. Notable buyers included the actor Bruce Willis and the New York Yankees pitcher Aroldis Chapman; each acquired a four-bedroom for more than $7 million.While many top sales in 2018 were at brand-new developments, there were several pricey closings at buildings that have been around for a while.A penthouse on the 85th floor of One57, at 157 West 57th Street in Midtown\u2019s Billionaire Row, sold for nearly $54 million \u2014 though below its original $70 million price from 2017.At 432 Park Avenue, also on Billionaires\u2019 Row, between 56th and 57th Streets, two separate buyers, including the prominent art collector Hillel Nahmad, each paid a total of $60 million for pairs of half-floor apartments, presumably to combine them. The building, completed in 2015, remains the city\u2019s most expensive building, with the average price per square foot at nearly $6,000.And at 15 Central Park West, another Robert A.M. Stern limestone condominium, a duplex owned by the British musician Gordon Sumner, a.k.a. Sting, sold for $50 million, after a year on the market and an 11 percent price cut. (Sting and his wife, Trudie Styler, are reportedly buying a place at 220 Central Park South.) Among other celebrity closings: The rocker Jon Bon Jovi sold a duplex at 150 Charles Street for $15 million, and the comedian Seth Meyers sold an apartment at 302 West 12th Street for $4.4 million. Both are in the West Village.For all of Manhattan, the average sale price for an existing condo unit fell to $2.91 million from $3.05 million in 2017, according to CityRealty\u2019s projections (though it\u2019s still more than $1 million above the average 10 years ago). \u201cIn some parts of the market, it is definitely a buyer\u2019s market,\u201d said Steven James, the chief executive of Douglas Elliman New York City. But he noted that sellers still have the upper hand in some neighborhoods, particularly downtown. In the West Village and NoHo, for example, prices per square foot were up around 10 percent from a year ago, according to CityRealty.Co-ops, which make up a major chunk of Manhattan\u2019s housing stock, also saw weakened sales volume in 2018, although average prices were slightly higher than the previous year.A total of 5,838 units were expected to close through the end of the year, according to CityRealty, a 15 percent drop from the 6,267 closings in 2017. The average price was $1.40 million, up from $1.37 million.Kirk Henckels, the director of Stribling Private Brokerage, said co-ops were better positioned in 2018, after price adjustments the previous two years. \u201cThey came down roughly 15 to 20 percent,\u201d during that time, he said. \u201cThey were increasingly a value compared to the condos.\u201dThe year\u2019s most expensive co-op sale was at 995 Fifth Avenue, across from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, at 81st Street. An apartment encompassing the 15th floor was sold for $35 million by Joseph J. Plumeri, the vice chairman of the board of directors at First Data, a financial services company.There were numerous other notable closings. At 1 Fifth Avenue, near Washington Square Park, in Greenwich Village, the Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards sold a $9 million duplex, while the actress Jessica Lange was poised to create one after paying $3.3 million for a unit above her apartment there. On the Upper West Side, Mr. Willis sold a duplex at 271 Central Park West, at 87th Street, for $17.8 million. And across town, the record and film executive David Geffen sold a unit at the Park V, at 785 Fifth Avenue, between 59th and 60th Streets, for $24.5 million.The Beresford, at 211 Central Park West, between 81st and 82nd Streets, also saw plenty of activity. The hedge fund manager William Ackman deeded to his former wife a duplex valued at $15 million, as part of an apparent property settlement. And Bob Weinstein, the younger brother and business partner of the disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, sold a duplex for $20.5 million.Some of the year\u2019s most expensive closings were at townhouses, but like condos and co-ops, many of the transactions came with discounts.The biggest sale, at $40.25 million, was a 36-foot-wide house at 110-112 East 76th Street. The structure, originally listed for $51 million, was the largest of a trio of townhomes created from six brownstones by the developer Joseph Chetrit.Among the many other Upper East Side sales, the former Vanderbilt mansion, at 16 East 69th Street, sold for $39 million. And the six-story mansion at 4 East 74th Street, once home to the pop star Michael Jackson, was sold for nearly $32 million by Marc Lasry, the billionaire hedge fund manager and co-owner of the N.B.A.\u2019s Milwaukee Bucks.And Roman Abramovich, a Russian oligarch who owns the Chelsea Football Club of London, transferred four townhouses on 75th Street to a former wife. He also threw in two co-ops in a deal totaling $92.3 million.Downtown, a Greek Revival house at 37 West 10th Street in Greenwich Village sold for $37.2 million. In the West Village, Harvey Weinstein sold his townhouse at 13 Bank Street for $25.6 million.\u201cBrooklyn has been one of the hottest submarkets in New York,\u201d Ms. de Fran\u00e7a of Douglas Elliman said, adding, \u201cSome people who are priced out of Brooklyn are coming back to Manhattan.\u201dIn Brooklyn Heights, a townhouse sale at 140 Columbia Heights tied the record for the highest price paid for a single residence in the borough, at $15.5 million. The buyers were believed to be the actors Jennifer Connelly and Paul Bettany.A neighborhood record was also set in Bedford-Stuyvesant, where the brownstone at 247 Hancock Street sold for nearly $6.3 million, above the $6 million asking price.Brokers saw strength in new Brooklyn condos, too. Ms. Mack of Corcoran Sunshine noted, for example, that Cobble Hill House, one of several new projects in the Cobble Hill neighborhood, was 60 percent sold just two months after sales began in September.Emerging markets like Bushwick and Greenpoint are also showing strength, added Rory Golod, the New York general manager for Compass, and are likely to rise in value in future years.Looking ahead to the coming year, the market will \u201ccontinue a slow price correction,\u201d said Gregory J. Heym, the chief economist of Terra Holdings, parent of Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead Property. At the same time, he said, New York City should remain fiscally sound with low unemployment, as it enters a 10th consecutive year of economic growth.CityRealty forecasts that average apartment prices in Manhattan will rise slightly in 2019, to around $2.2 million, based on units under contract and anticipated closings in buildings like 220 Central Park South. Several other much-anticipated condominiums will officially open, among them: 15 and 35 Hudson Yards; Waterline Square; One Manhattan Square; and 111 West 57th Street.An earlier version of this article included a photograph that was published in error.

{"Headline": "Chase for Talent Pushes Tech Giants Far Beyond West Coast", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 This generation\u2019s biggest technology companies \u2014 including Apple, Amazon and Google \u2014 have long been tied to their hometowns. Now these giants are increasingly outgrowing their West Coast roots.Driven by a limited pool of skilled workers and the ballooning cost of living in their home bases of Silicon Valley and Seattle, as well as President Trump\u2019s shifting immigration policies, the companies are aggressively taking their talent hunt across the United States and elsewhere. And they are coalescing particularly around a handful of urban areas that are already winners in the new knowledge-based economy, including New York City, Washington, Boston and Austin, Tex.\u201cThey\u2019re expanding out,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cTech talent is in very short supply. So if these tech companies want to grow and flourish, they need to find talent in other parts of the country.\u201dThe chase for tech talent has been global for decades, and Silicon Valley\u2019s older companies have had big offices all over the world for years. Intel, for example, has far more employees in Oregon than it does in California. Hewlett-Packard, which split into two companies three years ago, has had large outposts in Idaho and Oregon.Amazon, Apple and Google are now increasingly adopting the same strategy as they hire for growth and pursue the brightest minds in new technologies, in an effort to outmuscle one another. Over the past two years, Amazon\u2019s work force has doubled to 613,300 employees; Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, has increased its head count by 35 percent, to 94,300; and Apple has grown nearly 14 percent, to 132,000 workers.Like Cambridge, England, some cities in the United States have also become known for a particular area of tech expertise, in what has become a modern remake of the country\u2019s industrial era, when cities came to specialize in the production of cars, steel and coal.The search for talent outside Silicon Valley and Seattle has also been prompted by issues in the companies\u2019 hometowns, which have not built enough housing to keep up with their growing work forces. San Francisco, San Jose, Oakland and Seattle are the four most expensive major cities in the country based on home values, according to data from Zillow. The median home in San Francisco is valued at almost $1.4 million and more than $733,000 in Seattle. Questions also abound over the quality and funding of the areas\u2019 public school systems.\u201cEvery day as a C.E.O., you have employees coming to you saying, \u2018I don\u2019t make enough to buy a house for my family,\u2019 and you already feel like you are paying through the nose,\u201d said Glenn Kelman, chief executive of Redfin, the real estate site based in Seattle. \u201cAlmost everyone is looking at other affordable places where you can open an office.\u201dThat has helped push some tech companies into building major outposts in Canada, particularly in Toronto and Vancouver. Edward Glaeser, a Harvard economics professor, said that even if H-1B workers were to come through in abundance, it would still make sense to put them in cheaper cities, like Austin. He said, \u201c$100,000 goes a lot further in Austin than in Silicon Valley.\u201dMore than 44 percent of all digital-service jobs in the United States were located in just 10 metro areas last year, including Seattle, San Francisco and San Jose, as well as New York, Washington, Los Angeles and Boston, according to research by Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. From 2015 to 2017, only nine metro areas increased their share of the nation\u2019s tech work force, including the West Coast tech hubs, as well as Austin and Denver.\u201cThe tech industry concentrates in very few markets,\u201d said Amy Liu, director of the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution. \u201cOur biggest concern is how do we make sure more cities, particularly midsized cities in the middle of the country, can be players in the tech economy?\u201dAmazon, which has about 45,000 people at its Seattle headquarters, has also opened 16 tech hubs in the United States. About 85 percent of those satellite employees are in six booming, highly educated urban areas \u2014 the Bay Area, Washington region, New York, Boston, Los Angeles and Austin. Each has at least 1,000 workers.(The bulk of Amazon\u2019s North American work force is made up of the more than 250,000 people who are dispersed in the company\u2019s roughly 110 warehouses around Canada and the United States and who make less money than their white-collar colleagues.)Apple, which has been criticized by President Trump for not creating more domestic jobs, said on Thursday that its plans for Austin included a new 133-acre campus that will initially have 5,000 workers in engineering, research and development, operations and other functions. It will ultimately be able to accommodate up to 15,000 workers.Apple already has about 6,000 workers in Austin.

{"Headline": "Why the F.T.C. Is Taking a New Look at Facebook Privacy ", "Date": "2018-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter a yearlong string of news reports that have called Facebook\u2019s data-sharing practices into question, federal regulators are taking a hard look at how the social media company handles the personal information of its users.It is not the first time Facebook has drawn government scrutiny. About seven years ago, after charges were leveled by the Federal Trade Commission, the company made an agreement with the agency to overhaul its privacy practices. That agreement, called a consent decree, provides a road map for how the F.T.C. is likely to scrutinize Facebook over the coming months.In 2007, Facebook introduced Facebook Beacon, a program that broadcast details on users\u2019 online purchases to their friends, initially allowing users to opt out of sharing their purchases only on a case-by-case basis. At the end of 2009, a coalition of nonprofit consumer and privacy groups, led by the Electronic Privacy Information Center, petitioned the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Facebook\u2019s handling of user data. In 2011, the F.T.C. filed charges against Facebook that said the company had deceived consumers about their privacy.The F.T.C.\u2019s complaint charged Facebook with a number of deceptive privacy practices. Among them:\u25a0 Facebook shared users\u2019 personal details with advertisers even though the company had promised not to do so, the agency said.\u25a0 Facebook allowed third-party apps that users had installed to have access to nearly all of their personal data \u2014 even though Facebook had stated the apps could obtain only the personal information they needed to operate, the agency said.\u25a0 The agency said Facebook claimed it certified the security practices of apps participating in its \u201cVerified Apps program,\u201d but the company did not do so.The agency ordered Facebook to put a comprehensive privacy program in place to protect the privacy and confidentiality of users\u2019 information and to manage the risks of existing and new products. It also required Facebook over the next 20 years to undergo biennial audits by an independent third party to certify that the privacy program was properly protecting the information of the company\u2019s users.The voter-profiling company obtained the data from a researcher who had offered a personality survey app on Facebook. Although only about 270,000 Facebook users agreed to share their data to participate in the survey, the Facebook platform enabled the app to improperly harvest the personal details of millions of those users\u2019 friends \u2014 consumers who had not agreed to share their information with the survey app, The Times reported.Privacy experts, law professors and at least one former F.T.C. official have argued that Facebook\u2019s failure to prevent the survey app from obtaining the data of users\u2019 friends violated the federal consent agreement. So did Facebook\u2019s failure to prevent the app developer from sharing both users\u2019 data and the data of users\u2019 friends with Cambridge Analytica, these critics said.They said the Cambridge Analytica episode suggested that Facebook had failed to adequately conduct the risk assessments the agreement required it to do. It also failed to obtain required, explicit consent from users\u2019 friends for the sharing of their data with third parties, the privacy experts said.They also argued that Facebook had failed to operate a comprehensive privacy protection program and take reasonable precautions \u2014 steps the company was obligated to take under the consent decree.Since then, Facebook has made other admissions about privacy problems that experts said could potentially violate the consent agreement or trigger new federal charges of deceptive privacy practices.Facebook said it had developed a privacy program as required by federal regulators and it had not violated the consent decree.\u201cWe are transparent with people about how we use their information and respect people's privacy settings,\u201d Sally Aldous, a Facebook spokeswoman, said in a statement. \u201cWe have a privacy program, which ensures we protect people's information, which we continuously evolve to address the privacy risks of our products and services.\u201dMs. Aldous said the company\u2019s privacy program involved more than three dozen control mechanisms \u2014 including a privacy governance team and security teams that \u201censure privacy risks for product launches and major changes are identified, discussed, and escalated for decisions when necessary.\u201dFacebook said it disagreed with The Times\u2019s characterization of its sharing of user data with Amazon, Apple, Blackberry, Microsoft, Samsung, Yahoo and other companies. The social network said device makers used information from Facebook to integrate certain Facebook features on their platforms and agreed not to use that information for their own purposes. The company also said Spotify and other third-party apps had access to users\u2019 Facebook data only after users signed in with their Facebook account in the third-party apps.Advertisement"}

Ugh,\u201d said Amy Cappellazzo, the chairman and executive vice president of Sotheby\u2019s, having been told of the German artist Gerhard Richter\u2019s long-held desire for his paintings to acquired by public galleries, rather than private collectors. \u201cThat\u2019s a very socialist, democratic way of having to deal with, like, rich people who want them,\u201d added Ms. Cappellazzo. A forthcoming Sotheby\u2019s auction included abstracts by Mr. Richter valued at $20 million to $30 million each.\u201cThe thing about a painting is it\u2019s unique. You have the hand of the artist. You can own it, you can transport it. It can accrue value, it lives in its own world,\u201d said Tom Eccles, director of the Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard College in New York, in a telephone interview. \u201cAnd to display it, you just need a nail.\u201d Other kinds of art works require \u201ca different kind of commitment,\u201d he added.But the commercial dominance of painting has produced a reaction. Judges of some of the most prestigious public awards for contemporary art regard other media as more in tune with our times.\u201c\u2018It\u2019s a video installation. You\u2019re physically required to be in that space,\u201d said Lisa Panting, a co-founder of Hollybush Gardens, the east London dealership that represents Ms. Prodger, who has been chosen to represent Scotland at next year\u2019s Venice Biennale. \u201cIt\u2019s not like watching a video on YouTube,\u201d she added.Ms. Panting said \u201cBridgit\u201d had been produced in an edition of three. Versions have been sold to the Arts Council of England, a public body that funds cultural events, and the Gallery of Modern Art, Glasgow, for less than \u00a350,000 each, according to Ms. Panting. She said she did not know when or where the film could be seen after the show at Tate Britain closes on Jan. 6.In his groundbreaking 1936 essay, \u201cThe Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Production,\u201d the philosopher Walter Benjamin wrote how the \u201caura\u201d of an original work of art \u201cwithers\u201d the more it is reproduced. But now in the digital age, high resolution illustrations have become so accurate and ubiquitous that we feel we \u201cknow\u201d certain artworks, particularly paintings, without seeing them in the original. By contrast, creators of videos or performances can feel their work is diminished by mass reproduction.\u201cToday I work with artists making film-based works who are wondering whether they should distribute them through Amazon Prime or Netflix,\u201d said Mr. Eccles of Bard. \u201cBut then is it an artwork or not?\u201dThe art market and public institutions can seem at times to be far-distant worlds. One fetishizes the historical prestige of painting; the other, multidisciplinary experimentation. But of course the two worlds overlap all the time.The London branch of the international dealership Hauser & Wirth, for example, is currently showing \u201cToast,\u201d a museum-quality selling exhibition of recent works by the British conceptual artist Martin Creed, who won the Turner Prize in 2001.Free to the public, the show includes his trademark numbered works in painting, drawing, sculpture, textile, music, performance and video. \u201cWork No. 3071\u201d is a bronze of a piece of toast spread with gold peanut butter, priced at $35,000. The gallery is periodically darkened for a performance and videos, including the film \u201cDifficult Thoughts,\u201d showing the artist repeatedly bending 90 degrees in a busy London street. Again, these have to be experienced in person in the gallery and can\u2019t be viewed online.The title of Mr. Kahn\u2019s documentary derives from an interview with Mr. Edlis, the collector. Quoting Oscar Wilde, Mr. Edlis said that people in the art market \u201cknow the price of everything, and the value of nothing.\u201dAdvertisement"}

First, Macau\u2019s Gaming Inspection & Coordination Bureau said that gaming revenue for the Chinese gambling center had increased more than expected in November.Wynn could gain because of the thaw. Wynn generated nearly three-quarters of its revenue this year from its casinos in Macau, a special administrative region of China and a gambling haven for Chinese high rollers.Tariffs between China and the United States were unlikely to affect Wynn\u2019s revenue directly, but investors worried it could be hit by any retaliatory measures China took in response to the Trump administration\u2019s policies. Those could include potential restrictions on travel to Macau as well as license renewals.Wynn\u2019s exposure to China also meant that it was susceptible to a slowdown in China\u2019s economy and the impact that might have on wealthy Chinese gamblers. Wynn\u2019s shares tumbled 13 percent in early November after Wynn\u2019s chief executive, Matt Maddox, warned on the company\u2019s third-quarter earnings conference call that it had experienced a recent slowdown in its Macau business.Wynn\u2019s shares slid through the spring and summer as trade tensions between the two countries continued to escalate.

{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Data Sharing and Privacy Rules: 5 Takeaways From Our Investigation", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere are five takeaways from our investigation.\u201cWe don\u2019t sell data to anyone,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s founder, told Congress during a hearing in April. His pledge \u2014 that the torrent of data Facebook collects from its 2.2 billion users will always remain safely in Facebook\u2019s hands \u2014 has been a cornerstone of the company\u2019s defensive strategy this year, as lawmakers, regulators and activists have pummeled the social network over a series of privacy breaches and public relations blunders.While it is true that Facebook hasn't sold users\u2019 data, for years it has struck deals to share the information with dozens of Silicon Valley companies. These partners were given more intrusive access to user data than Facebook has ever disclosed. In turn, the deals helped Facebook bring in new users, encourage them to use the social network more often, and drive up advertising revenue.Internal documents obtained by The Times show that Facebook shared data with more than 150 companies \u2014 most of them tech businesses, but also automakers, media organizations (including The Times) and others. While Facebook users can control what data they share with most of the thousands of apps on Facebook\u2019s platform, some companies had access to users\u2019 data even if they had disabled all sharing. Many of the partners\u2019 applications never even appeared in Facebook\u2019s user application settings. According to Facebook, each of the outside companies acted as an extension of the social network. Any information a user shared with friends on Facebook, the company argues, could be shared with these partner companies without additional consent.The data partnerships date to 2010, at the start of a period of headlong growth and expansion for Facebook. Within a few years, the social network had struck so many of these deals that Facebook employees built a tool to track the different types of access the partners had.Despite this, Facebook appears not to have kept close tabs on how its users\u2019 data flowed out into the world. A Russian social media company, Yandex, that has been accused of having overly close ties to the Kremlin, still had access to Facebook\u2019s unique user IDs for years after Facebook had cut off other applications from the data, citing security concerns.Likewise, Facebook gave Yahoo the ability to display a Facebook user\u2019s news feed \u2014 including friends\u2019 posts \u2014 on the search company\u2019s home page. Yahoo got rid of the feature in 2012. But as of last year, it still had access to data for close to 100,000 people a month. Under the terms of a 2011 consent agreement with the Federal Trade Commission, Facebook was required to strengthen privacy safeguards and disclose data practices more thoroughly. The company hired an independent firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers, to formally assess its privacy procedures and report back to the F.T.C. every two years.Facebook maintains that the partnerships are covered by an exemption to the consent decree. A spokeswoman for the F.T.C., which last spring opened a new investigation into Facebook, declined to say whether the commission agreed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Finally Write Your Nonfiction Book", "Date": "2018-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNo, it will not be easy. Yes, it will be rewarding. (Eventually.)\u201cI\u2019d like to write a book someday.\u201dMost authors would probably agree that writing a book is one of the most difficult challenges of their careers. You spend your summer inside writing while your friends post photos of their beach vacations on Instagram. Once your book is published, the work is far from over: You must now sell it like your career depends on it, because it kind of does. Failure is a constant fear, and impostor syndrome can feel overwhelming. But more often than not, it\u2019s also completely worth it.Before you write your first word, ask yourself: Do I have an audience? And, most important: Does my idea actually appeal to readers?Building an audience isn\u2019t a prerequisite, of course, and it\u2019s certainly not easy, but publishers like authors who come with a built-in market.Many aspiring authors assume that getting started means cranking out tens of thousands of words before you approach an agent or publisher, but it might depend on the book. If you have an idea for a nonfiction book, it\u2019s better to write a couple of chapters and then pitch a book proposal. That way, you can see if there\u2019s any interest before you churn out 80,000 words on a given topic.Even though you might not need to write the entire book before pitching it, it\u2019s likely that if an agent or potential publisher likes the idea, they\u2019ll still want to see at least two sample chapters. In any case, you\u2019re going to want to fully flesh out your idea and write up those sample chapters before reaching out to agents, or, if you\u2019re still building an audience, a few blog posts on your topic. Doing so will give you a deeper sense of what your book is about and what the rest of the writing process will be like \u2014 and this will also help you firm up your ideas of what the rest of the book will be like.With traditional publishing, you\u2019ll put together a book proposal, find an agent and then your agent will send your proposal to publishers. If those publishers like your idea, they could make you an offer. If multiple publishers like your idea your book might even go to auction, which could help you secure a more lucrative deal.Self-publishing also means your book will be available on only the platform you publish with, and it likely will never get on shelves in physical bookstores or libraries.Self-publishing means you have to do all of the work, like designing a cover and proofreading, yourself (or hire people to help).While an agent will likely want to see the completed manuscript of a novel, a nonfiction book typically requires a proposal, which is a detailed outline of what your book is and why it matters. Rather than thinking of your proposal as an introduction to the book, think of it as a business case for why it\u2019s worth a publisher\u2019s time and investment.\u201cIf it\u2019s a big New York publishing house, they\u2019re probably looking for an idea with relevancy or currency in the market, combined with an author who has a platform \u2014 visibility to the intended readership,\u201d Ms. Friedman said.Publishers also like to see numbers. Try to quantify your platform using metrics like your combined social media followers, newsletter subscribers or monthly page views on your blog.\u201cAn agent is a near-requirement if you want to be published by one of the major New York publishing houses,\u201d Ms. Friedman said. While you can approach smaller publishing houses and university presses directly, you\u2019ll still need someone to look over your contract. If not an agent, you\u2019ll need to hire a literary or intellectual property lawyer once you get to that step, she added.You may have to query multiple agents about your idea. Ideally, one of them will bite and want to represent you. Then, you\u2019ll have a helping hand through the rest of the process. The agent will pitch your book proposal or manuscript to publishers, which can lead to getting-to-know-you meetings with publishers and editors, or both. If a publisher loves your idea, your agent will then negotiate the contract and terms with input from you as needed. It sounds simple, but this can take much more time than many writers expect.You\u2019ll want to organize your writing workflow so you\u2019re encouraged to keep up with the habit every day.First figure out how much time you have to write each week, then schedule that writing time into your day. Some writers like to get their words out at night, after everyone has gone to bed. Others prefer to write as their first task of the day. Experiment with different times to find what works for you.\u201cYou will recognize a macro planner from his Post-Its, from those Moleskines he insists on buying. A macro planner makes notes, organizes material, configures a plot and creates a structure \u2014 all before he writes the title page. This structural security gives him a great deal of freedom of movement,\u201d Ms. Smith said in her lecture. Micro managers, on the other hand, have no master plan for their writing and simply figure out the ending when they get there.Again, a little trial and error works well. You can try to just start writing your first draft, and if you find yourself stuck, start again with the outline and work from there. Or you might just try to start writing about something that excites you.The most common question aspiring authors asked when I finished my book: How long did it take? It\u2019s hard to quantify how long it took, but writing a book is an exercise in patience.\u201cI think you should plan for at least one year to write the first draft of a book, and a second year to rewrite it,\u201d Ms. Perhach said. Of course, it can take much longer than this, but most writers can expect at least a couple of years to pen a book.\u201cWriting is like putting together Ikea furniture,\u201d she added. \u201cThere\u2019s a right way to do it, but nobody knows what it is.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ex-Tesco Executives Cleared on Fraud and False Accounting Charges", "Date": "2018-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Two former executives at the supermarket chain Tesco have been acquitted of fraud and false accounting charges after a judge ruled there was not enough evidence for a jury to consider the case against them.The executives, Christopher Bush, who led Tesco\u2019s British division, and John Scouler, an executive in the same unit, had been charged by Britain\u2019s Serious Fraud Office after a 2014 investigation into accounting irregularities at the grocery chain.\u201cWhile I am delighted that my innocence has finally been established, it is troubling that Mr. Scouler and I were ever charged,\u201d Mr. Bush said in a statement. \u201cPut simply, these charges should never have been brought, and serious questions should be asked about the way in which the S.F.O. has conducted this investigation.\u201dIn an emailed statement, the law firm representing Mr. Scouler offered a similar response.\u201cWe have long argued that the S.F.O.\u2019s prosecution of Mr. Scouler was fundamentally flawed, that he should not have been charged and that the S.F.O. should not have proceeded with this trial,\u201d the firm, BCL Solicitors, said in the statement.The inquiry into Tesco\u2019s accounts covered a period of about seven months in 2014. It was opened after the company announced that it had overstated its profits by more than 250 million pounds (about $320 million at current rates).At issue was the booking of profits prematurely and delays in logging expenses to pad out results. Tesco said at the time that it did not believe that any of those implicated had benefited personally, but eight executives were suspended and the chairman, Richard Broadbent, was forced to step down.Another executive, Carl Rogberg, was severed from the trial, and the Serious Fraud Office said it was considering whether to pursue a retrial.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Effort to Reimagine Company Towns", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW ORLEANS \u2014 Steve Case has been on a barnstorming tour of the United States in a red bus that reads \u201cThe Rise of the Rest.\u201d You would be forgiven for thinking he was running for office.The co-founder of AOL has joined forces with J.D. Vance, the author of \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d to promote entrepreneurship across the United States and seed investments in cities often overlooked by venture capital funds. In doing so, the two men have recruited a list of who\u2019s who in business, including Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Charles and David Koch of Koch Industries, to be part of their investment fund.The fund is part of a larger movement to reimagine company towns, and a challenge for venture capital funds to look beyond California, New York and Massachusetts \u2014 the three states that receive 75 percent of venture capital in the United States.\u201cIt takes a set of ingredients, including a comfort with new ideas and diversity,\u201d said Walter Isaacson, the authorized biographer of \u201cSteve Jobs\u201d and a history professor. \u201cIt takes a willingness to take risks and even to fail at times.\u201dThat is the magic of her city, Mayor Jenny Durkan of Seattle said in conversation with Mr. Isaacson and Mr. Case at the Cities for Tomorrow conference. The city reimagined itself from the 1962 World\u2019s Fair and is the home of Amazon, Nordstrom, Microsoft, Starbucks and Costco \u2014 what Ms. Durkan called \u201csmall mom-and-pop companies that stay below the radar until they\u2019re not.\u201dBut on the conference stage, the discussion shifted from the benefits of rising cities to the reality of one rising sector.\u201cEven in the successful cities, the success masks this other part of the city that hasn\u2019t risen,\u201d Ms. Durkan said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve seen that in Seattle, with the huge growth of tech and the new economy, but it masks some real displacement, some real lack of opportunity.\u201dThe elephant in the room was Amazon. Two-hundred-thirty-eight cities across North America applied to be home for the company\u2019s next headquarters, and last month Amazon selected Long Island City, Queens, and Crystal City, Va., for HQ2.Mr. Case pointed to the other 236 cities as ones with real opportunities also awaiting them. Those are the cities that can really rise, he said.\u201cMy hope is that the 236 that lost, if they take half of the energy they put into rallying their community, driving collaboration, and half of the dollars they were putting on the table to lure them, and refocus that on their start-up community, they might create the next Amazon,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Amazon Could Learn From Google in New York City", "Date": "2018-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNot long after Google moved into the Chelsea neighborhood in Manhattan, its billionaire co-founder, Sergey Brin, went on a private tour of the old elevated freight line that would become the celebrated High Line.Mr. Brin looked over the barren landscape that would be filled with lush greenery and made a suggestion: How about a Frisbee golf course?That would not be a good idea, he was politely told during that walk in 2008. Frisbees would probably go flying off and strike people on the street below.It was the kind of small but telling lesson Google had time to learn. The company\u2019s slow expansion over two decades in New York City \u2014 from a single employee in 2000 to more than 7,000 today \u2014 gave the tech giant the chance to adapt its West Coast ideas to the confines of crowded New York City.\u201cThey\u2019re running their own play and it\u2019s a very different play than ours,\u201d said William Floyd, the head of external affairs for Google in New York. \u201cWe\u2019ve been growing steadily for the past 18 years without heralding trumpets, or asking for support from the government. We\u2019ve done it by the dint of our own work.\u201dStill, not all has gone smoothly. Some residents complain that Google\u2019s robust expansion in Chelsea keeps driving up the cost of housing, while small businesses say the company\u2019s free-food-at-work culture has taken money out of the pockets of local eateries. Others say Google has not opened up its wallet as much as it could.But in a city where almost any change is met by fierce resistance, Google has drawn relatively few complaints as it has made itself at home in Chelsea, a neighborhood where public housing projects sit beside luxury buildings, art galleries and trendy restaurants and clubs.Along the way, it has acquired a multibillion-dollar real estate portfolio, including two of the neighborhood\u2019s best-known buildings.Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker and a Chelsea resident, was unequivocal that Google has been \u201ca good neighbor.\u201dIn contrast, Amazon was not off to a good start, he said. \u201cThis is how they want to be a neighbor in Long Island City?\u201d Mr. Johnson asked, referring to the lack of community input on the deal to bring the company to the neighborhood.An Amazon spokeswoman said the company was \u201cexcited to learn more about the Long Island City community, to find out how we can best support residents.\u201d The company has also hired high-powered lobbying firms to help contend with local political unrest.Google made a statement simply by moving in. \u201cIt said to the world: This is where technology meets cool,\u201d said Paul Pariser, the co-chief executive officer of Taconic Investment Partners, which owned and redeveloped the building and still manages it today.Smaller technology companies soon followed in Google\u2019s wake. \u201cThere is a certain brand that comes with being in the area,\u201d said Mike Rudoy, 33, the chief executive of Jetty, an insurance start-up that moved to a nearby Chelsea building in 2017. \u201cIt\u2019s less about customers and more about recruiting. It all comes down to recruiting.\u201dThese newcomers helped accelerate the gentrification sweeping Chelsea, especially after the High Line opened in 2009 and drew tourists and developers alike in what residents have called \u201cthe High Line effect.\u201dThe changes have divided residents of Chelsea, which had long been a hub of gay culture and night life. \u201cThere\u2019s been a massive exodus of gay people from Chelsea,\u201d said Allen Roskoff, a resident and gay rights activist. \u201cWhat caused it? I don\u2019t know, but Google coming in there will further the need for luxury buildings. It will further gentrify the neighborhood.\u201dGoogle is also leasing office space on Pier 57, a commercial hub on the Hudson River. As part of that move, Google said it would pay for the construction of a ferry dock for water taxis or a cross-Hudson ferry.Google workers have generally fit right in. They are typically young and educated and well paid. They favor jeans, shirt and no tie. They pack the Starbucks on the ground floor of the Eighth Avenue building. They browse at the T-Mobile store next door. The morning a new Android phone with a Google operating system was released, a Google employee was waiting by the door to snap up the first one, a T-mobile sales associate said.In recent years, Google\u2019s growing empire has started to attract the attention of its neighbors \u2014 some of whom point out that the company has not contributed as much as it could, given its extraordinary wealth and status.\u201cThey would be much more welcome in this community if they would do their part,\u201d said Pamela Wolff, 83, a Chelsea resident who struggled to name a big-ticket Google project for the entire neighborhood. \u201cI think any business that comes in with such a huge footprint should be offering more.\u201dGoogle\u2019s largess, for the most part, has been directed to specific groups and organizations. It outfitted a youth technology center with new laptops, smartboards and a music studio. Google employees have taught computer science in after-school and summer programs and have helped older immigrants learn to use Google translate.After the email system kept crashing at Hudson Guild, a nonprofit that offers social services, a Google team was dispatched to upgrade it for free. When the Guild needed a meeting place for its 175 employees, Google supplied an auditorium, as well as breakfast and lunch. It again lent space \u2014 and some glamour \u2014 for the Guild\u2019s \u201cfriend-raiser\u201d for potential donors.\u201cWho doesn\u2019t want to go to the Google office?\u201d said Ken Jockers, the Guild\u2019s executive director. \u201cI think they are an engaged and thoughtful neighbor.\u201dBut though Google has been generous with its time and space, it has been less so with its money, according to Brad Hoylman, the local state senator. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense in the local community that they could ramp up their giving,\u201d said Mr. Hoylman, a Democrat. \u201cTechnology hasn\u2019t yet figured out that New York City is their home, too.\u201dGoogle has also given $1 million to build the High Line and another $1.5 million to a cultural preservation project for the Stonewall Inn, a West Village bar and a symbol of the gay rights movement. In addition, the company has provided free Wi-Fi across broad swathes of Chelsea, including inside the subway station below its offices.Increasingly, Google has sought to deepen its community ties, including to two housing projects with more than 4,500 residents. Darlene Waters, the tenant association president for the Elliott-Chelsea Houses, said a Google worker introduced himself this year at an art gallery and told her to call. \u201cGoogle and I, we\u2019re going to be close,\u201d Ms. Waters said.Local residents were invited into the Eighth Avenue building, which came across to some as a giant playground. Google workers whizzed through the halls on scooters with their own docking stations. There were Ping-Pong and pool tables, a rock-climbing wall and a virtual reality room with special glasses. Food pantries were stocked with chips, candy, soda and juice for the taking. Afterward, residents were treated to lunch in a company cafeteria at Chelsea Market, where servers doled out steak, salmon, salads and desserts.\u201cI felt kind of good because they don\u2019t do this for everybody, but they did it for the neighborhood,\u201d said Sam Rosedietcher, 64, a carpenter, who lives at the Fulton Houses.Miguel Acevedo, 58, the president of the Fulton Houses tenant association, said Google supplied 980 turkeys this Thanksgiving. Its workers donated more than 100 dresses and shoes in the spring during a prom-dress drive. He now brags that Google is next door. \u201cWe have Google; you don\u2019t have Google,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody uses Google one way or another.\u201dBut as Google has expanded, it has also replaced smaller companies, including some that have left the neighborhood. Workers from those companies are no longer around to support local restaurants and stores. And Google workers, supplied with free food and entertainment, have not taken their place. As a result, some businesses are not as enthusiastic about Google.\u201cI wish they had given a little consideration and support to the food vendors,\u201d said Howard Nourieli, a co-owner of Bowery Kitchen Supplies in Chelsea Market, who figured that his sandwich counter has lost thousands of dollars a month in sales. \u201cIt would have been the right thing to do. Everyone\u2019s suffering here.\u201dSome residents also worry that Google is taking over too much of their neighborhood. Its purchase of Chelsea Market comes with the right to build additional space on top, which residents said could block sunlight on part of the High Line.Ms. Wolff, a member of Save Chelsea, a preservation group, said she did not object when Google first came to Chelsea, but that now it needs to be \u201cwatched like a hawk.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid of any business that comes into Chelsea and grows exponentially,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re going to be devoured.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Let the Fountain Pens Flow! ", "Date": "2018-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn this coldly pixelated age, old-fashioned writing implements make a small but meaningful comeback. In fact, it quickly became clear that these were nerds. Twenty-first-century pen nerds.Lamy was handing out free Vibrant Pink Al-Stars, a sleek aluminum-bodied pen, and plastic Safaris (each around $40). And then there was the guest of honor: Brian Goulet, of Goulet pens, who had the handsomeness of a 1950s young dad, thick hair like mink, broad shoulders, a warm handshake. \u201cHe\u2019s, like, a rock star in the world of pens,\u201d said Steve Birkhold, the C.E.O. of Universal Luxury Brands, which own the American distribution rights to Lamy. Mr. Birkhold, formerly the C.E.O. of Diesel and Lacoste, has started his own company with a partner, Eli Hollander, to bring niche, design-focused European brands to the United States.Lamy, whose headquarters are in Heidelberg, is still owned by the German family that founded it in the 1930s. Its Lamy 2000, introduced in 1966, a Bauhaus-inspired minimalist steel pen, made the brand\u2019s reputation as the cool pen maker. This year Mr. Birkhold opened the SoHo store and another in the Palace Hotel in San Francisco. \u201cBusiness has already tripled,\u201d he said, since he bought the United States distribution rights in 2017. The office supply and paper company that held them previously, he added, didn\u2019t understand how to take an \u201comni-channel\u201d approach and correctly market the \u201cpen brand for millennials.\u201dThe fountain pen has been imperiled since the rise of disposable ballpoints in the 1960s; by the \u201990s and early aughts the almighty keyboard was positioned to kill it off entirely. Once-stalwart household names like Sheaffer (Sylvia Plath\u2019s preferred brand) were closing American factories to manufacture cheap parts in Asia and seeking corporate buyers. Holdout users were mainly aging collectors, and only a few companies, like Montblanc, which had been acquired in 1988 by Richemont, were flourishing.During his store appearance, he at first was standing by himself. As the evening drew on, and free champagne flowed, attendees edged closer to him, the way children may shyly creep toward a storyteller. Soon they were asking questions eagerly: What was his favorite pen? Favorite nib? Does he think a \u201cdemonstrator\u201d pen that shows its mechanism, by the upstart Taiwanese brand Twsbi, look like a vape? Would he be eating one of the large sugar cookies of his head in icing Lamy had set out for the party from the bakery Cupcake Market? (No, he would be taking them home for his two grade-school children, who will of course be learning cursive.) An avid woodworker, Mr. Goulet originally planned for the website to sell wooden fountain pens he made, but soon noticed that the accessories he sold to go with them, paper and ink, were doing well, without the hours of labor.Generationally at ease with the so-called pivot (he majored in commercial real estate management at Virginia Tech), he gave up on his own pens. The company\u2019s website cannily bottles and sells small ink samples and walks you through how-tos: how to \u201cflush\u201d a pen, how to use a wax seal (there are now flexible ones that can go through the postal machines). There are also reviews of new pens and interviews with pen personalities.Instagram, where illustrators post video demonstrations, has inevitably furthered pen nerd-dom. Fountain-pen ink looks beautiful as it dries, since it often has shading, or color variations, and sometimes shifting iridescence. There are hundreds of new, delicious ink colors and small-batch companies with romantic bottles and names like poems or perfumes (Organics Studio, Nitrogen; Colorverse, Andromeda, DeAtramentis Black, Roses, Pilot Iroshizuku, Kosumosu, Robert Oster Fire & Ice, Monteverde California Teal). Manufacturers like Diamine in England, once almost moribund, have customers again. Then there are the new start-up offices, coffee shops, which lack supply closets. \u201cSomeone might pull out a notebook from CVS and a Bic,\u201d Mr. Birkhold said. \u201cBut someone else has a cool notebook and fountain pen. They personify your personality.\u201dOriginally a straightforward system of organizing your how-to lists (and life) on pages with small points arranged as a grid, bullet journaling has become almost an art form. And it is one that is enhanced by a fountain pen, or so Kara Benz (a.k.a., Boho Berry) demonstrated at the Lamy event, where she was a host. The journaling is perfect for a form of faux calligraphy that involves fattening every down stroke, the rudiments of which anyone can learn in an hour or two.Ms. Benz, who lives in New Jersey and has electric-violet hair, uses shelves of different writing implements to create her impossibly artful rainbow pages of lists that include items like \u201cdeclutter X or Y\u201d or \u201cbook a spa day,\u201d and never \u201cspend all day making this page.\u201d But the company\u2019s customers are not all such obvious free spirits. \u201cA lot of people are administrative professionals who just have normal cubicle office jobs, and they just want interesting tools to make their day more their own,\u201d Mr. Goulet said.\u201cI got into fountain pens about three months ago,\u201d said Jeremy Whelchel, a young man in a puffer jacket during a holiday event at the Manhattan Fountain Pen Hospital downtown. The store is one of the few general pen shops that has survived, because it has the Wall Street crowd\u2019s business. Most of the people piling up to the counters there looked like the sort of 50-and-ups who would of course love a fancy, fusty fountain pen. The old-guard pen scene, like the cigar aficionados, appreciates a certain gaudiness. \u201cEncrusted\u201d might be the defining adjective to apply to the pricey, themed wares (\u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d Samurai) of Montegrappa, an Italian brand. But dotted among the blur of boomers were next-gen fellows like Mr. Whelchel, the sort who comfortably use terms like \u201cEDC\u201d (everyday carry).He had an old fountain pen lying around for years, but it was always dry and scratchy. \u201cI used to associate them with status seekers, with Montblanc, guys with fancy watches,\u201d Mr. Whelchel said. \u201cI\u2019m not into that, I\u2019m into the gadget aspect.\u201d The subreddit is \u201ca great community,\u201d he said, \u201cwith useful instructionals.\u201d He started with one Pilot Metropolitan, then bought a bunch of them to get familiar with the interchangeable nibs and mechanisms. \u201cIt\u2019s like a bike: If you keep them tuned up and take care of them, they\u2019re great.\u201d He is curious to see the Homo Sapiens Evolution, by the Italian brand Visconti. It is made from Mount Etna lava.\u201cI\u2019m not a convert, but it\u2019s nice to mark up a document with one,\u201d said his girlfriend, Hailey DeKraker, a lawyer. \u201cNow that I have my ink guy!\u201dMr. Whelchel doesn\u2019t tend to use the pens for daily correspondence. \u201cMore like notebooks,\u201d he said.Mr. Whelchel is an engineer at Google, and he likes the pens\u2019 through-line to the previous implications of that job title: building bridges, drawing plans on paper. With the same familiar irony that applies across the recent analog revivalism, the engine that was killing the fountain pen (and the pen store) as a necessity has resurrected it as a pure pleasure and a novel way to display personal style.The \u201cdisruption\u201d of the fountain-pen market provides a soothing escape from all the others: Amazon\u2019s unnerving dominion, Facebook\u2019s alleged tainting of democracy itself, and childhood\u2019s fast fade into screens.\u201cPeople describe drawing ink into their pen from an ink bottle and wiping the nib as a Zenlike experience,\u201d said Stephen Brown, 34, a cognitive psychologist from the Netherlands who teaches at a community college in Red Deer, Alberta. \u201cPeople are also reading studies coming out indicating that writing things down helps you remember,\u201d said Jane Andreasen, 27, a pen nerd with a Mia Farrow crop and Fury Road boots. \u201cIt\u2019s an easy step to go from, \u2018I want to write more to, \u2018and now I have a fountain pen,\u2019 to \u2018now I have five, what happened to me?\u2019\u201d Ms. Andreasen is the resident fountain-pen expert at the happening Oakland, Calif., outpost of Flax Art & Design, an art supply store. Nibs recall a time when the act of signing documents promised law and order. A time when Thomas Jefferson used his (up-to-the-minute) metal pen to draft the Declaration of Independence for people who had faith in a \u201cwe the\u201d and the God indicated as the key witness to the ensuing signatures.Considering this, it makes sense that one of the world\u2019s largest pen shows is in Washington, D.C. It also makes sense that there\u2019s some pen political drama, captured by the ink maker Nathan Tardif, whose Noodler\u2019s inks are known for their inventiveness, affordability and the libertarian convictions hidden in their charming illustrated labels.Mr. Tardif follows his ethics of self-sufficiency in the woods of Massachusetts, where he concocts and bottles his inks by himself. His Bernanke Black Ink is fast drying \u2014 an allusion to the Federal Reserve\u2019s act of essentially printing money by lowering interest rates during the financial crisis \u2014 and his Berning Red, also fast drying, a red for lefties, shows Bernie Sanders\u2019s head in front of the state seal of the Soviet Socialist Republic of Azerbaijan. Mr. Tardif\u2019s says his Warden\u2019s ink has properties that make it fraud proof. Mr. Tardif is an eccentric and not representative, Mr. Brown said, but, in his observations, the pre-internet dealers did tend to lean right and male.Mr. Brown\u2019s wife, Aziza Asgarali, runs Gourmet Pens, a pen blog. \u201cJust to reveal how much of a pen nerd I am, we met when we were both guests on a fountain-pen podcast,\u201d Mr. Brown said. But even though the pen world contains a few female luminaries, like Beate Oblau at Lamy (known for riding a Ducati) and Regina Martini, a dealer specializing in vintage collectibles and Pelikan, \u201cfemale enthusiasts are less visible,\u201d Ms. Andreasen said. She knows how to de-rust a vintage ink reservoir and replace ancient cracked bladders, but four years ago she was belittled on the Fountain Pen Network forum by a male commenter who didn\u2019t like a millennial woman disagreeing with him. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to try again because the whole community is changing,\u201d Ms. Andreasen said.Mr. Brown\u2019s subscribers are global, many from India and Asia, where fountain pens are more common. But when Ms. Asgarali, whose parents came to Canada from Trinidad, was featured in a YouTube review with her husband, a commenter wrote: \u201cI used to respect you, but I don\u2019t now that I see you\u2019re married to a half negro.\u201d\u201cI guess this says less about the pen world,\u201d Mr. Brown said with a sigh, \u201cand more about the world.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the name of a pen brand. It is Sheaffer, not Schaeffer.Advertisement"}

They pick oranges in Florida, strawberries in California and vegetables in Ohio. And they have built new subdivisions in Phoenix, Atlanta and Charlotte.For years, policymakers have talked about shutting off the influx of undocumented workers. But the economy has grown to rely on them.Ending illegal immigration, say many of those who have studied the issue, could mean that American workers would lose their jobs, companies would close and the economy would contract.In recent years, though, border security has tightened considerably, a strong economy has driven down unemployment, and many employers, particularly those offering low-paid jobs, say there are few alternatives to hiring workers without legal documents.President Trump, it turns out, is caught on both sides of the balance between border security and economic prosperity.The president has vowed to erect a wall to keep out undocumented immigrants and has ramped up the deportation of those already in the United States. His administration has conducted payroll audits and workplace raids, which have resulted in the arrest of thousands of workers.The Trump Organization has vowed to terminate any undocumented workers it finds on its payroll, and the fate of any of its workers who do not have legal working papers remains unclear. What is clear, however, is that at a time of extremely low unemployment, 3.7 percent nationally, Mr. Trump\u2019s golf club might struggle to recruit legal workers to replace any undocumented workers who are terminated.\u201cOur economy has absorbed these workers and employers would like more of them, given the low unemployment rate,\u201d said Madeline Zavodny, an economist at the University of North Florida who is an expert on the economics of immigration.Undocumented immigrants are overrepresented in low-skilled jobs such as farming, construction and child care.Often, these are jobs their employers have trouble filling with American workers.Anabele Garcia, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico, toils in the vineyards of Sonoma County in California, earning about $15 an hour. When the season ends each year, she finds work cleaning houses and wine estates, earning about $20 an hour. Her husband, Jorge Romero, works in the cow pastures nearby.\u201cWe are here to do any work,\u201d said Ms. Garcia, 39. \u201cThere are no Americans in the fields.\u201dWhat would happen if all the undocumented immigrants went away?Steve Camarota, research director at the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports curbs on immigration, believes that wages would rise and motivate many chronically unemployed Americans to get back to work.But wage rates are not the main issue, some economists say, because there still would not be enough Americans willing to do blue-collar jobs.Expectations and status play a role, said Chris Tilly, a labor economist at the Luskin School of Public Affairs at the University of California, Los Angeles. \u201cNot everybody will do dirty work,\u201d he said.They might prefer to make a low wage working inside an Amazon distribution center to putting shingles on a roof.A survey conducted in late 2017 by the Associated Contractors of America found that 70 percent of construction companies were having difficulty hiring roofers, bricklayers and electricians, among others. The accommodation and food services sector reported a record number of vacancies this October.Historically, the regulation of the border with Mexico, the main source of migration, \u201chas always been driven by the needs of the economy,\u201d Mr. Tilly said.That\u2019s less true now, under the Trump administration, which has sought to check illegal border crossings by all means possible.Giovanni Peri, an economist who studies immigration labor at the University of California, Davis, said that with a true cutoff in illegal immigration, the economy would contract. The impact, he said, would fall not just on immigrants \u2014 because their work sustains sectors that employ many Americans.\u201cSome sectors, like construction, agriculture, housing and personal services would be drastically reduced,\u201d Mr. Peri said. \u201cThere would be companies closing and relocating. There would be jobs lost. There will be towns and cities that would see half their population disappear.\u201d\u201cIt definitely would trigger a recession,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are talking about a lot of job loss.\u201dIt is very unlikely that weak, vulnerable American workers would benefit from jobs previously held by immigrants because some of these jobs themselves would disappear, he said.\u201cVery few of the jobs these immigrants have would be taken by these Americans,\u201d Mr. Peri said. \u201cThe ones who are not employed have complicated circumstances like drug addiction, alcohol addiction or criminal records.\u201dEspecially at a time of low unemployment, he added, \u201cThis would be the worst time to lose them. There are no unemployed Americans ready to do their jobs.\u201dIn some sectors, \u201cthere might be people who would do these jobs at much higher wages,\u201d said Ms. Zavodny, the economist in Florida. \u201cBut it is not clear those jobs would exist at much higher wages.\u201dIn the lettuce fields of California\u2019s Salinas Valley, a new machine plies row after row of romaine lettuce, doing the backbreaking work, long performed by people, of lobbing heads of romaine lettuce from the field. It saves time and human labor.Still, more than half of all field workers are undocumented, according to the Farm Bureau, which has said that their sudden disappearance would deal a catastrophic blow to American agriculture.Since the 1990s, undocumented immigrants from Mexico and Central America have flocked to towns like Dalton, Ga., to work in the carpet mills. Across the South and in fast-growing cities like Denver, hundreds of thousands have been absorbed by the construction industry as roofers, painters and bricklayers.In states like Georgia and North Carolina, their presence has grown rapidly to represent 5.4 percent and 4.5 percent, respectively, of the labor force.In all but four states, service occupations, such as being a waiter, dishwasher or maid, together draw the largest number of undocumented immigrants, the Pew report found.About 31 percent of all undocumented immigrant workers were in service occupations in 2016, according to the estimates, which were based on data gathered by the Census Bureau.Unauthorized immigrants represent about 24 percent of all workers in farming, fishing and forestry and 15 percent of those employed in construction, which is the industry that uses the most undocumented immigrant workers overall, at 1.35 million.Nearly one quarter of restaurant workers in 2016 were foreign-born compared with 18.5 percent for all sectors, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, compiled by the National Restaurant Association. A large share are likely undocumented, economists say.\u201cThese workers are often long-tenured and skilled,\u201d said Craig Regelbrugge, senior vice president of industry advocacy and research at AmericanHort, which represents the nursery industry. \u201cThey are nothing short of vital to farms, businesses, and rural economies.\u201d\u201cEach job they perform sustains two to three jobs in the surrounding economy, so even though few Americans seek this field and farm work, the jobs of many Americans and many communities are sustained by their contributions.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bottleneck at Printers Has Derailed Some Holiday Book Sales", "Date": "2018-12-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks NewsThis year has been, much to everyone\u2019s surprise, a blockbuster for the publishing industry. Despite the relentless news cycle, readers have bought books in droves. Hardcover sales are up, and unit sales at independent bookstores have risen 5 percent. Multiple titles \u2014 Bob Woodward\u2019s \u201cFear,\u201d Bill Clinton and James Patterson\u2019s \u201cThe President Is Missing\u201d and Michelle Obama\u2019s \u201cBecoming\u201d \u2014 have passed the million-copy mark, while there is also a surprisingly strong appetite for literary fiction.But what should be good news for publishers, agents and authors has created headaches during the crucial holiday sales season, as printing presses struggle to keep up with a surge in demand, creating a backlog that has led to stock shortages of popular titles.The industrywide paper jam has been building for months \u2014 a result of shrinking and consolidation among printing companies, the collapse of one of the major printers this summer, global paper shortages and a tightening job market that\u2019s made it difficult for printers to hire additional seasonal workers. But it has become increasingly acute and visible at the industry\u2019s peak sales season, when consumers are shopping for must-read titles to give as gifts, and finding that Amazon\u2019s virtual shelves are bare.For authors whose books have been out of stock in the run up to the holidays, it can be hard to recover the lost royalties and sinking Amazon rankings. In a Facebook message, Ms. Makkai urged readers to shop at independent stores for her novel after Amazon listed it as out of stock and indicated it wouldn\u2019t ship until after Christmas. \u201cThis whole situation is rotten, and my press is doing everything they can, but ugh, this is really, really bad timing,\u201d she wrote.Agents and authors say part of the problem is that publishers and retailers have become more risk averse. Publishers are printing smaller first runs, partly because retailers are ordering fewer copies initially, waiting to see which titles take off to avoid making the wrong bet and getting stuck storing unsold inventory. In the past, it was often easy to get another batch of books printed in a week or two if a title sold unexpectedly well, but these days some publishers say it can take one or two months.On top of that, the seemingly bottomless appetite among readers for a handful of blockbuster titles has tightened the bottleneck at the printing presses, consuming what little slack there was in the system. Mr. Woodward\u2019s \u201cFear\u201d has sold nearly two million copies in all formats, while Mrs. Obama\u2019s \u201cBecoming,\u201d which came out in November, has sold 3.8 million copies.\u201cThe capacity is so tight that if you get a book that takes off like \u2018Becoming,\u2019 you have to stop what they were printing and print more \u2018Becoming,\u2019 then whatever they were printing is late,\u201d said Dennis Abboud, the chief executive of ReaderLink, the main book distributor to Target, Walmart and other outlets. \u201cThen the train is really off the rails.\u201dAt the same time, publishers have been caught off guard by a handful of surprise best sellers, literary titles from lesser-known authors that are now in short supply the week before Christmas, the worst possible time to be out of stock.\u201cAll of the sudden, there\u2019s just no capacity,\u201d said the literary agent Chris Parris-Lamb, who represents Ms. Halliday. \u201cThe books that become outliers, the ones that are actually selling, then they become a victim of their own success.\u201dThe backlog is so severe that it is spilling over into next year, causing publishers to shift the release dates for some January books because they can\u2019t print copies in time. At Penguin Random House, at least a dozen titles scheduled for early 2019 have been pushed back, typically by a few weeks, according to a company executive. Other publishers said that a handful of titles were being delayed because of the backlog at the printers.\u201cIn the macro, business is healthy and there are plenty of books on shelves across America for people to buy,\u201d said Michael Cader, a book industry analyst and the founder of Publishers Marketplace. \u201cBut if it\u2019s your book and there\u2019s demand and it\u2019s out of stock, that\u2019s very painful.\u201dEvery year during the holidays, a handful of unexpected breakout books sell out of stock, frustrating consumers and the authors who wrote them, but leaving the industry as a whole unscathed. But this year the shortages are more widespread, and the factors driving them are more systemic and harder to mitigate.\u201cIt\u2019s more complex than it\u2019s been in the past. You can\u2019t just count on making a phone call to your printer and saying this book is taking off, let\u2019s do a press run this week,\u201d said Adam Rothberg, senior vice president of corporate communications at Simon & Schuster. \u201cThis is the new normal for the foreseeable future.\u201dMadeline McIntosh, the chief executive of Penguin Random House U.S., said that most of the company\u2019s in-demand titles were available through other outlets, despite being out-of-stock at some major retailers, and noted that \u201cat this time of year, we are always working through issues related to spiking holiday demand for hot books.\u201dThe biggest cause of the bottleneck, publishers and agents say, is consolidation and collapse among printing companies. One large printing company, Edward Brothers Malloy, shut down this summer. Next year, two of the largest printers in the United States, Quad Graphics and LSC Communications, are expected to merge, which publishers worry will lead to fewer options for printing services.The printing industry has its own problems, including paper shortages and price increases. And the low unemployment rate has made it harder for printers to hire additional workers. Quad Graphics, which has 55 print-production centers and 22,000 employees worldwide, \u201chas experienced staffing challenges due to record low unemployment,\u201d according to a company spokeswoman.Surprisingly, some of the current chaos has come about because the publishing industry is not only stable but seems to be thriving. After years of declining print sales, hardcover and paperback editions have been rising recently, while e-book sales have fallen. Publishers\u2019 revenues from hardcover sales rose 3.5 percent in the first 10 months of this year, while revenue from digital books fell 3 percent in the same period, according to the Association of American Publishers.Some big publishers have been investing in print infrastructure and inventory management in recent years, expanding their warehouses and improving their ability to refill orders from retailers quickly, but they have little control over the printing presses, where capacity has shrunk.The effects are reverberating across the industry. This fall, W. W. Norton had to scramble to salvage an author\u2019s book tour when they learned that books wouldn\u2019t be available on his October publication date because the printers were overbooked. The author, James M. Scott, had more than a dozen events planned in October to promote his book, \u201cRampage: MacArthur, Yamashita and the Battle of Manila,\u201d but the printer couldn\u2019t deliver books until roughly a month later.Norton was able to get a small batch of books to sell at the events, before the first print run was ready, but at great cost: It involved taking unbound pages, gathering them by hand and having them bound and shipped overnight to the event sites.\u201cIt\u2019s an editor\u2019s nightmare,\u201d said John Glusman, vice president and editor in chief of Norton.Norton also struggled to meet unexpected demand for Mr. Powers\u2019s novel \u201cThe Overstory,\u201d which was released in April with a first printing of 25,000 copies. Sales continued to climb throughout the year, and they got a boost when the novel was a finalist for the Man Booker Prize.In mid-October, worried that stock would run out just before the holidays, Norton ordered a 10th printing of the book, an additional 10,000 copies. A priority rush order typically takes two weeks, but Norton was told that it would take two months. The new editions arrived at the publishers\u2019 warehouse on Dec. 17, but those copies still needed to get to retailers in time for holiday purchases. Norton just ordered an 11th printing, which will bring the total copies in circulation to 115,000.Still, it may be too late for some holiday shoppers.\u201cDemand has delightfully exceeded expectations,\u201d Mr. Glusman said. \u201cIs there such a thing as too much demand?\u201dThe print shortages have left both large and small retailers scrambling, though a huge company like Amazon can more easily absorb the impact of lost sales than a small independent store.Barnes & Noble\u2019s stores have been hit with \u201climited quantities, delays in publication dates, and more just-in-time minute-by-minute delivery that has driven delivery expense,\u201d said Tim Mantel, Barnes & Noble\u2019s chief merchandising officer.Independent bookstores have also been struggling to meet demand for unexpected best sellers, though many placed more robust orders this year in anticipation of holiday shortages.Catherine Bock, the book buyer at Parnassus Books in Nashville, said the store has run out of a handful of popular titles, including \u201cAsymmetry\u201d and \u201cSalt, Fat, Acid, Heat.\u201dRobert Sindelar, the managing partner of Third Place Books in Seattle, said it\u2019s been unusually difficult to restock popular titles this year. His store ran out of the Frederick Douglass biography before Thanksgiving. It sold out of \u201cSalt, Fat, Acid, Heat\u201d about a week ago. It recently got a small shipment of the title, but those were already presold, he said. \u201cWe probably could have sold another 100 of that one,\u201d he said.Ms. Nosrat, whose cookbook came out in April 2017 and has sold nearly 300,000 copies, said she and her agent realized in early December that copies of her book would most likely sell out before the holidays, even after an additional domestic printing this fall of 30,000 copies.\u201cI feel like I got punched in the gut a little bit,\u201d Ms. Nosrat said. \u201cBut I\u2019m aware that this is a rare and lucky problem to have.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The 3 Biggest Challenges for Tech in 2019", "Date": "2018-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHow privacy, security and employee protests will shape the year ahead for Silicon Valley. Ms. Fowler is an editor in the Opinion section.If you thought 2018 was a bad year for tech, 2019 might turn out to be even worse. This year was filled with revelations about privacy, security and cyberwarfare. Next year, the consequences of those revelations will unfold. And we should be very worried about what the future holds. Privacy Is DeadAnd perhaps worse is what the future holds. We most likely aren\u2019t aware of all the companies that hold our personal data and what they are doing with it: the social media companies that know us as well as our friends do, the financial technology companies that sell our bank account transaction data, the messaging apps that hold our private photos and texts.Many of us will delete apps. We will disable as much tracking as we can on our phones. We will delete our Facebook accounts. We will delete our social media histories and old emails and text messages. But it won\u2019t be enough because most people will not care: The trade-off between privacy and convenience will be worth it to them, because the loss of their privacy will have little to no impact on their day-to-day life. Most people will read (or perhaps ignore) the news stories about every new privacy scandal, and they will then go back to their phones. The End of SecurityIt\u2019s not clear that these breaches were a result of poor security practices or corporate negligence. The truth is \u2014 and I say this as someone who has worked in Silicon Valley as an engineer \u2014 the security teams and security practices at Google and Facebook are among the best in the world. It\u2019s not clear that stronger punishments or more regulation will fix the problem or prevent these kinds of data breaches from happening.There\u2019s a lot at stake. The spies from foreign governments hacking into American companies aren\u2019t trying to destroy you, me or any specific individuals living in the United States \u2014 they are trying to destroy the country that we live in.Tech\u2019s Anti-Government StanceAn earlier version of this article incorrectly included Google+ among a series of hacked web services in 2018.

{"Headline": "A Times Arts Critic Reviews His Own Role", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byunderstanding the timesHow we call the hits \u2014 and limit our misses \u2014 on the culture beat.By the end of this year, if recent history is any guide, around 900 movies will have opened in theaters in the United States. Hundreds more will have made their debuts on streaming platforms, along with more than a million hours of serial programming on traditional networks, cable channels and web-based broadcasters like Netflix, Hulu and Amazon. Defying periodic reports of its demise, live theater is flourishing: on Broadway and off, in Brooklyn and Chicago, in London and Louisville. Nearly every week brings new dance recitals, chamber music concerts, pop albums, museum and gallery exhibitions \u2014 am I missing anything?Everyone is always missing something, but the critics who write for The New York Times \u2014 in staff positions and as regular freelancers \u2014 collectively strive to miss as little as possible, and to provide some help to readers faced with the overwhelming abundance of contemporary culture. How to make sense of it all? How to choose?Those are difficult questions, and they aren\u2019t the same question. Part of the critic\u2019s job is to offer consumer advice. You want to know if a given performance or exhibit is worth your time. But criticism doesn\u2019t stop with warnings and recommendations. (The Times doesn\u2019t use stars, thumbs or letter grades, but especially worthy productions are designated Critic\u2019s Picks.) Whether or not we like the thing we\u2019re reviewing, we are interested in what it means, how it works (or doesn\u2019t), why it matters (or doesn\u2019t), and how it reflects and is part of the larger world. We assume that readers are looking not only for advice, but also for ideas, arguments, provocations and the occasional joke. We hope that, even if you skip the movie, give up on the show or can\u2019t get tickets to the opera, you\u2019ll at least find something worth reading.As a practical matter, we begin the critical process with choices of our own, since we can\u2019t cover everything. Some selections are obvious. There\u2019s no way to ignore the latest big Hollywood movies, Broadway shows, premium cable dramas, blockbuster museum retrospectives or whatever Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9 are up to. But we don\u2019t want the shape or scope of our critical coverage to be determined by hype and publicity. At the assigning stage \u2014 as editors and chief critics decide what to review \u2014 we make room for discovery and surprise. We pay significant attention to small triumphs as well as grand ambitions, to interesting failures as well as astonishing successes.To do this we rely on instinct, experience and hard work, though \u201cwork\u201d can sound like an odd way to describe what the rest of the world might call bingeing. Critics don\u2019t wield the authority of experts so much as the credibility of devotees. One thing we share in common is love for the art forms we write about.Another is independence from the people and institutions who make and distribute that art. As the critic Lester Bangs (played by Philip Seymour Hoffman) says to his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in \u201cAlmost Famous,\u201d referring to the rock stars they both idolize: \u201cThose people are not your friends.\u201d Much as we may admire the artists, our allegiance is to the audience. We are spectators, like you.But we do get an early look. Reviews are timed to greet the arrival of the new (on opening day or shortly before), so critics attend press screenings or previews, receive advance copies of albums or TV episodes. This is a convenience and a courtesy, helpful but not essential to the job, and not a favor granted in the expectation of anything in return. In the old days, theater and movie critics raced back to the newsroom on opening night to type out their notices for the next day\u2019s paper. Sometimes, like reporters on a breaking story, they ran to the nearest pay phone to call in the review.Criticism is a kind of news reporting, even if the news is inherently subjective. The raw data may be emotion, experience and opinion \u2014 how did that make us feel? what did we think of it? \u2014 but the resulting story still has to be factual, honest and fair. No reader will agree with a critic all the time, and no critic requires obedience or assent from readers. What we do hope for is trust. We try to earn it through the quality of our writing and the clarity of our thought, and by telling the truth. The truth, in this case, about what we thought about what we saw, read or heard. Some of the time some of our readers might think we\u2019re wrong, but being wrong \u2014 starting an argument about what matters to us \u2014 is one of the ways we can be most useful.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "DealBook Special: The Year on Wall Street", "Date": "2018-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySo approach 2018\u2019s blockbuster M.&.A. numbers with caution, because they\u2019re heavily skewed toward the first half of the year. Here are two examples:This year was the strongest for initial public offerings since 2014. (That was the year Alibaba skewed the numbers with its $25 billion I.P.O.) In all, companies raised $209 billion globally through I.P.O.s, up 6 percent from a year ago, according to Dealogic.The biggest I.P.O.s of the year happened on exchanges in Asia. SoftBank raised $21.3 billion floating shares of its mobile unit in Tokyo. China Tower raised $7.5 billion in Hong Kong, and Xiaomi also sold $5.4 billion worth of stock there.The stock markets were defined in 2018 by record highs followed by steep sell-offs. Investors piled into the biggest tech companies, pushing the market values of Amazon and Apple above $1 trillion. But soon investors were dumping tech shares, sending the Nasdaq into a bear market for the first time since the financial crisis. Companies handed back more than a $1 trillion to investors through buybacks and dividends. But markets were also whipsawed by fears of slowing global economic growth, rising interest rates and trade wars.Despite it all, Wall Street analysts predict that the S&P 500 will rise next year.But there are still reasons to be pessimistic. Here\u2019s what could spook investors next year:A lot went right for banks in 2018. They were big beneficiaries of the tax overhaul enacted at the end of 2017. The Trump administration started what may become a bonanza of deregulation for them. The economy grew. Interest rates increased, bolstering profit from lending. Over all, banks\u2019 earnings are expected to surge 34 percent in 2018. In June, Jamie Dimon, the C.E.O. of JPMorgan Chase, talked about \u201ca golden age of banking.\u201d\u2022 If the Fed raises interest rates by more than expected and the economy slows, banks could be hit hard. Wall Street business would suffer, demand for loans would decline and more borrowers could default, causing losses for banks.\u2022 If the Fed manages to set rates at a level that keeps the economy growing at close to current rates, and inflation is dormant, bank earnings should hold up. But as 2018 has shown, that may not be enough for investors.The short answer: probably. The longer answer: It\u2019s complicated, and opinion is divided over when it might happen.In others words: Keep your wits about you in 2019.Thanks for reading!

The Netflix show released just one episode on Friday, a narrative titled \u201cBandersnatch\u201d during which the viewer decides what will happen next.It begins like this: Should the teenage video game whiz Stefan have Sugar Puffs or Frosties for breakfast? Soon the choices become more consequential. Will Stefan work at a game company, tell his therapist about his mother, take his meds? As so often on \u201cBlack Mirror,\u201d reality is up for grabs.Viewers are voting on more than who lives and dies on one program. If the response to \u201cBandersnatch\u201d is enthusiastic, Netflix will take it as a strong signal that the public is ready for interactive movies and television shows, and a new age of storytelling will commence.Not that the company needs much encouragement. It has already developed software to help organize stories that have endless permutations. It has perfected, or so it hopes, the technical ability to present these tales on multiple platforms around the world simultaneously. And it is calling for producers to submit interactive proposals in genres from horror to romantic comedy while hinting that it already has a few new shows in the works.The idea behind the interactive push is simple: Viewers will care more if they are complicit.\u201cIf bad things happen, you\u2019ll feel even more crestfallen, because you were responsible,\u201d said Todd Yellin, Netflix\u2019s vice president for product. \u201cIf the character is victorious, you\u2019ll feel even more uplifted because you made that choice.\u201dOne problem is that audiences are not clamoring for interactivity. A long time ago, drama was a live, communal experience. Now it comes over all sorts of devices, but almost always is a one-way street. Netflix has an immense hurdle to overcome.\u201cWe\u2019ve learned to press \u2018play,\u2019 drop the remote and just lean on back and let the TV wash over us,\u201d acknowledged Carla Engelbrecht, Netflix\u2019s director of product innovation. \u201cI\u2019ve seen 2-year-olds do this.\u201dGiving lots of options to the viewer while keeping the main character consistent \u201cwas a huge nut to crack,\u201d Brooker said. It was a five-week shoot for about two and a half hours of script, a much longer time than a typical episode requires.Even now, he is uncertain about what he has made.\u201cI think some people will judge it just on a narrative basis, some people will judge it as a game,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not up to us. It\u2019s down to them.\u201dJones disagreed. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t really designed as a game. It was designed as a cinematic experience.\u201d\u201cWith game-y elements,\u201d Brooker persisted. \u201cYou are making decisions. You are actively guiding it.\u201dWhatever its other merits, \u201cBandersnatch\u201d is definitely not funny. Those who wish to encounter it unencumbered by any prior knowledge should employ a primitive method of interactivity and avert their eyes from the next two paragraphs.The year is 1984, the setting London. Stefan (Fionn Whitehead, last seen in \u201cDunkirk\u201d) lost his mother when he was 5. He blames Dad (Craig Parkinson), who hid the boy\u2019s stuffed toy. The ensuing ruckus made Mom take a later train, which derailed.Stefan is hired by a game company. He adapts a choose-your-own-adventure story by a novelist named Jerome F. Davies, who became convinced that he was trapped in a world of multiple realities, with spectacularly unfortunate results. Stefan\u2019s life begins in some ways to mirror Davies\u2019s.Plot choices in \u201cBandersnatch\u201d come thick and fast at the bottom of the screen, with only a few seconds to click one of them. At one point, I refused to do anything, just to see what would happen. The episode went back to the beginning. It was not clear if this was a bug or I was being punished.Watching the episode, it is easy to see how interactivity could be the next step forward in entertainment. It is less easy to see how this could ever be art. It\u2019s hard to lose yourself in a story if you\u2019re constantly being pulled out of it. \u201cBandersnatch\u201d is not linear, which made it feel unresolved even when I was offered the chance after about 70 minutes to go to the credits. I took instead the option to plunge back to the story and tried to make different choices.\u201cI don\u2019t know how many endings there are,\u201d Brooker said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what we\u2019ve created here.\u201dJones, who plays the stern adult to Brooker\u2019s madcap boy genius, shot back: \u201cYes, we do!\u201dBrooker: \u201cSorry. We do.\u201d But he didn\u2019t sound convinced.(A Netflix spokeswoman later clarified that \u201cthere are five main endings with multiple variants of each.\u201d)When making the show, the creative team had endless conversations about good endings versus bad endings or premium endings or five-star endings. Said Brooker: \u201cThere\u2019s a \u2018Groundhog Day\u2019 aspect where it keeps cycling around, deliberately so.\u201d It\u2019s an artist\u2019s dream: a story the audience can never escape.Interactive filmmaking is simple to mock. Are we now going to have \u201cMary Poppins\u201d where the nanny dismembers the children with a hacksaw? Few artists are in favor of letting their fans make the decisions. But the technology is perpetually enticing.In 1993, a 20-minute short called \u201cI\u2019m Your Man\u201d seemed to offer real possibilities. Viewers in a handful of specially equipped theaters used a pistol grip attached to each seat to collectively vote on dozens of scene variations.It was a prediction grounded in reality. Moviegoing was in decline, so multiplex owners were open to new approaches. A generation had grown up with a joystick in its hand and wanted to take control of its entertainment.But the whole effort fizzled. \u201cIt was classic ahead-of-its-time technology,\u201d said Bejan, who now runs experiential marketing at Microsoft.Netflix is not making any predictions. Quite the contrary.\u201cIn five years, 10 years, we\u2019ll either say, \u2018Wow, \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d was a real turning point for interactive content,\u2019 or we\u2019ll be going, \u2018That was another false start,\u2019 \u201d said Yellin, the Netflix executive.Still, he has great hopes. \u201cWe have our eyes and ears wide open to the creative community \u2014 writers, producers, directors \u2014 for more ideas that would leverage this art form,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat are the new storytelling conventions that can be invented? We\u2019re meeting with people now.\u201dNetflix, which has 137 million worldwide subscribers, says \u201cBandersnatch\u201d is available across \u201cmost\u201d newer devices, including TVs, game consoles, web browsers and Android and iOS devices running the latest version of the Netflix app. It won\u2019t work on Chromecast, Apple TV and some legacy devices.Since \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d is always full of tricks, it\u2019s perhaps inevitable that \u201cBandersnatch\u201d undermines the whole notion of interactivity. The viewer is asked whether a murder should be committed, and if the answer is yes, there is a further decision: Bury the body or chop it up? It\u2019s not much of a choice, which is of course the joke.\u201cI\u2019m not in control!\u201d Stefan rages to his therapist. One path the viewer can take develops into a mocking plug for Netflix, which did not exist in 1984. This is about the fourth meta level \u201cBandersnatch\u201d ascends, or descends, to.\u201cYou think you\u2019re choosing your ending, but are you?\u201d said Russell McLean, a \u201cBandersnatch\u201d producer. \u201c\u2018Black Mirror\u2019 is choosing your ending.\u201dBejan, the interactive pioneer, had no knowledge of the existence of \u201cBandersnatch\u201d when he was interviewed. But he said interactive filmmaking was less about the audience\u2019s choices than it seemed.\u201cThere\u2019s a finite amount of media the filmmaker creates, which he slices and dices to give the illusion of control while at the same time guiding the viewer through the underlying blueprint,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s even more megalomaniacal than linear filmmaking.\u201dWhich brings us to the data, where every story in tech ends up. Interactive filmmakers will take your preferences \u2014 I really want this character to commit murder, and that one can kill himself \u2014 and convert them into numbers that will guide the creation of new shows you will be programmed to find irresistible.\u201cWe\u2019ll see what resonates with audiences and what doesn\u2019t,\u201d Netflix\u2019s Yellin said.What Netflix is really building is a voting machine. It\u2019s simple to see how technology like this could be used during, for instance, debates by presidential candidates. Viewers would react to promises being made, with their reactions immediately relayed to the candidates.\u201cBlack Mirror\u201d anticipated this sort of possibility in its very first episode. In 2011, \u201cThe National Anthem\u201d posed the question, What if a British politician were forced to follow the whims of the public in real time? He would end up having sex with a pig on live television, of course.\u201cWhatever path you take, there\u2019s darkness ahead,\u201d observed David Slade, who directed both \u201cMetalhead\u201d and \u201cBandersnatch.\u201dThat is pretty much Brooker\u2019s life philosophy. He began as a game reviewer, then became a TV critic, then a critic on TV. \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d \u2014 named after the shiny objects on our desks, walls and all too often in our hands \u2014 anticipated the tech backlash.As Jones explained to Brooker: \u201cYou are naturally suspicious and paranoid and neurotic.\u201d\u201cI worry about things, basically,\u201d he said.He is trying to dial back on technology. This is not easy or perhaps even desirable, because his confrontations with tech feed the show. That is one reason he got an Amazon Echo: research.\u201cQuite quickly my children, 4 and 6, starting talking to it,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of my kids walked into the room and called me Alexa. \u2018Alexa \u2014 oh, Daddy, where are my shoes?\u2019 I thought, \u2018I have to kill that device.\u2019\u201d\u201cHow would Alexa know where his shoes are?\u201d Jones asked.\u201cAlexa probably does know where his [expletive] shoes are,\u201d Brooker said. \u201cThat\u2019s the tragedy of it.\u201dNow that we\u2019re all suspicious and paranoid and neurotic, at least about technology, \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d is in flux. \u201cWe\u2019re doing more optimistic episodes and stories, rather than just dystopian and negative ones,\u201d Brooker said. \u201cWe want to keep the show interesting for us.\u201d He and Jones were, however, extremely hazy on when the next episodes would arrive. \u201cBandersnatch\u201d consumed all their attention for a year.One thing is clear, though. The new episodes won\u2019t be interactive. Asked if he had any advice for someone who wanted to try the format, Brooker said in a joking-but-not-really tone: \u201cRun away. It\u2019s harder than you think.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Our photographer spent three days behind the scenes. Supported byNeon hues of orange and pink glistened off the wet sidewalks and the fulsome chrome grills of a Buick Super and Ford Customline. Outside a diner, under bluish curls of cigarette smoke, a crowd milled around in the darkness. Men well under the age of 70 unironically wore pants hitched high above their waists. And women accessorized their outfits with pillbox hats and pearls, illuminated by the glow of a storefront window rather than a smartphone. \u201cI love that era. I was born in 1947, so I kind of relate to it. You hold your head up with a hat on and you smile differently, and you carry your handbag differently. You feel good.\u201d \u2014 Carmen Cooper, an extra (below)One of the charms of \u201cMrs. Maisel\u201d is the way it whooshes viewers back to a dream of 1950s New York \u2014 a city of flair and sass. The colors sing; the interiors gleam. But the fantasy is deeply rooted in realism. \u201cWe make sure all the details are just right,\u201d said Bill Groom, the show\u2019s production designer. \u201cThe color palette\u2019s very important, the types of fabric, the technology of the period. We look through electrical catalogs and plumbing catalogs. When we go into a modern location, we change light switches and all sorts of things to make it real. We don\u2019t want anything to pull the viewers out of the story.\u201d\u201cBackground work is a chance to meet people from a whole array of careers. It\u2019s fun! And then you get that extra boost when family and friends say, I saw you on TV, even though it\u2019s four or five seconds and you were blurred.\u201d \u2014 Kevin Barksdale, extra (above, far right)The energy and vitality of \u201cMrs. Maisel\u201d depends on some active and surprisingly inventive camera work. The penultimate episode of the new season includes scenes set at a telethon. David Mullen, the show\u2019s director of photography, couldn\u2019t find working cameras of the period so he had dummy bodies built and inserted small black-and-white surveillance cameras underneath them. \u201cWe actually hired Local 600 camera operators,\u201d Mullen said. \u201cA lot of them had live TV experience \u2014 they\u2019ve worked on various New York shows like \u2018The Tonight Show\u2019 \u2014 so they knew how to use a pedestal camera. I couldn\u2019t use our own camera operators because they were actually shooting the operators shooting the scene! It got quite complex. I had three camera crews shooting the three camera crews shooting the telethon.\u201d\u201cI will say, that\u2019s the largest hat I\u2019ve ever worn, it was so grand. There was a real sense of femininity and luxury.\u201d \u2014 Courtney Leigh Halford, featured extra (above, right)\u201cWhen the assistant put me in the bra and the slip and I looked in the mirror at the very different body silhouette, she said to me, \u2018Welcome to the \u201950s.\u2019\u2019\u2019 \u2014 Kilburg Reedy, extra (below, far left)Donna Zakowska\u2019s title is costume designer, but she\u2019s responsible for much more. Every accessory and ornament \u2014 the hats, the gloves, the shoes, the stockings, the handbags, the jewelry, the ties, the handkerchiefs, the cuff links \u2014 fall under her purview. \u201cIn terms of the men\u2019s clothing, I used a lot of photos of Cary Grant,\u201d she said. \u201cThat look is very classic to America \u2014 there\u2019s a simplicity, a directness, a square, more boxy cut, very elegant. In 2018, some men don\u2019t even know how to tie a tie, forget a bow tie. You also have to tell them, \u2018Please, can you pull up your pants.\u2019 For women, there is much more of an emphasis on clean lines and shape and the contrast between the waist and the hips.\u201d \u201cWe never want to go over the top with accessories, they just have to all work together. Every morning, before Rachel goes on set, we usually have the clothes in place and I have a tray filled with certain jewelry choices. We like to spend a few minutes playing. It\u2019s the last thing, the cherry on the cake.\u201dWhen actors come in off the street, they\u2019re scrubbed clean, then made up in a late-\u201950s style, under the direction of Patricia Regan, the head of the makeup department. \u201cI have to be honest with you, I don\u2019t wear any makeup \u2014 not ever,\u201d she confided. \u201cBut for the show, I have one red lipstick that I absolutely love. It\u2019s YSL 201. It\u2019s the red that Rachel wears when she performs in the black dress. It\u2019s a really rich, flawless, beautiful red. I have tried so many red lipsticks in the past couple of years. I would find beautiful colors, but they wouldn\u2019t stay on, they wouldn\u2019t read, but this lipstick is the perfect lipstick.\u201dMeanwhile, conjuring 1959 Manhattan on the 2018 New York grid is the job of the locations manager Amanda Foley. To recreate B. Altman & Company, the luxury department store where Midge works, Ms. Foley turned to a former bank building that now houses the Williamsburg Art & Historical Center. \u201cA lovely couple who are very into the arts, they rented it to us for two years,\u201d Foley said. \u201cThe bones are there and we were able to have it for the whole first two seasons so we could spend a lot of time in there making it exactly what we needed it to be, this whole beautiful B. Altman department store. The exterior we shot at the original B. Altman department store on 34th Street. It\u2019s now a CUNY library.\u201d When a diner was called for, Foley located the West Village spot La Bonbonniere. The production rechristened it The City Spoon. The interior was the simple part \u2014 once some photos were removed, it could pass for the era. The hard part? The street outside. \u201cWe have to take out the parking signs, we have to take out the bus poles, we have to get permission from the M.T.A. to take those down,\u201d Foley said. \u201cWe have to cover light poles to make them look more 1959. We change light fixtures, we cover signs. We move garbage cans, we move all the cars on the block and replace them with our own cars.\u201d\u201cIt was a really nice chunk of a Manhattan block,\u201d she added. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it was easy for us to turn it into 1959.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He\u2019s also a native New Yorker.Mr. Trump\u2019s time in New York was a big, complicated story we focused on in 2018. Our reporting found evidence of dubious accounting practices, hypocrisy and old-fashioned favor-trading.New York itself \u201ccertainly is an area that caters and allows for tax breaks and tax avoidance more so than others,\u201d Ms. Craig said. \u201cReal estate writ large is open to this sort of abuse.\u201dHere are five stories to help you understand Mr. Trump, and the New York he came from.Among the highlights:The future president was a millionaire by age 8, thanks to his father.The younger Trump said he once got a \u201csmall\u201d loan of $1 million from his father to start his business. It was closer to $60 million at the time, and never repaid.The older Trump repeatedly rescued his son from financial ruin.In a move that seemed designed to avoid gift taxes, the Trumps \u201cgrossly lowered\u201d the value of the property in Fred Trump\u2019s empire.Donald Trump\u2019s father, Fred, built housing for low- and middle-income residents in Brooklyn and Queens.In 1992, he formed a company that purchased equipment for his buildings.State officials are now investigating.In 1968, the athletic, 22-year-old Mr. Trump received a diagnosis of bone spurs in his heels, making him ineligible to serve in Vietnam.The podiatrist who made the diagnosis, Larry Braunstein, rented office space in a Trump building in Queens.Mr. Trump\u2019s signature issue is combating illegal immigration.At his New Jersey golf resort, it was a different story. Two undocumented immigrants who worked there for years said their supervisors knew of their status.Here\u2019s the funny thing about charities. Just because your name is on one doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re the one who is supposed to benefit from it.The foundation, Ms. Underwood said, was \u201cfunctioning as little more than a checkbook to serve Mr. Trump\u2019s business and political interests.\u201d This month, the foundation agreed to shut down and give away its remaining assets under court supervision.\u2014 Iman StevensonBut older siblings losing to their younger kin is not how nature works.

But New York City was our primary destination.An Army friend who had recently been discharged and was living in New Jersey made hotel reservations for us. He also got us tickets to see Barbra Streisand in \u201cFunny Girl\u201d on Broadway.Excited, we arrived early and took our seats. They were great. And then I fell asleep for much of the show. I had a mild cold and had taken an antihistamine.

{"Headline": "Facebook Rebuked for Failing to Disclose Data-Sharing Deals", "Date": "2018-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFacebook and some of the other largest technology firms in the world faced sharp criticism on Wednesday for failing to disclose the extent of the social network\u2019s data-sharing deals, many of which went back to the company\u2019s early years.Lawmakers in the United States and Britain on Wednesday called for greater oversight of Facebook, the world\u2019s dominant social media platform. But critics also focused on statements that Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, had made in recent months while defending the company.Senator John Kennedy, the Louisiana Republican, said the revelations made him question Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s decision making. \u201cI know he\u2019s smart, but sometimes I think he\u2019s got no sense,\u201d Mr. Kennedy told Fox News, adding that the disclosures were cause to consider stricter privacy laws. \u201cCongress is going to have to regulate them and stop this, and I hate to do it, but by God I will if they can\u2019t clean up their act.\u201dFacebook officials said the deals did not violate user privacy \u2014 or a 2011 consent agreement with the Federal Trade Commission that barred it from sharing data without permission \u2014 because the companies were acting on Facebook\u2019s behalf.In a post published on Facebook on Tuesday, Konstantinos Papamiltiadis, the company\u2019s director of developer platforms and programs, defended the partnerships, saying the company entered into the agreements to let users interact with Facebook friends across devices and popular websites.\u201cNone of these partnerships or features gave companies access to information without people\u2019s permission,\u201d Mr. Papamiltiadis wrote, asserting that most partners did not have to seek consent before obtaining users\u2019 data because they were serving as extensions of Facebook.But he also acknowledged that Facebook had made mistakes in managing some of the deals. \u201cWe recognize that we\u2019ve needed tighter management over how partners and developers can access information,\u201d he wrote.Facebook was already dealing with fallout from reports that a political consulting company, Cambridge Analytica, obtained the personal data of tens of millions of Facebook users. Cambridge used the information to build tools later deployed in President Trump\u2019s election campaign. The F.T.C. launched an inquiry into Facebook\u2019s practices after the data leak became public, and the Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission are also investigating the social network.News of the deals on Wednesday further roiled the technology industry as policymakers and privacy advocates directed anger at Facebook\u2019s leaders and its partners.Senator Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat, attacked Mr. Zuckerberg for not disclosing the full scope of the agreements during a Senate hearing in the spring, when Mr. Zuckerberg assured officials that users had complete control of their data.\u201cMark Zuckerberg had a lot of chutzpah telling Congress that Americans could control their data, when seemingly every other week Facebook faces a new privacy scandal for abusing our personal information,\u201d Mr. Wyden said.Senator Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut Democrat, called for the F.T.C. to police the company more aggressively. \u201cFacebook\u2019s seemingly unrestrained sharing of user data is the privacy equivalent of the BP oil spill,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal wrote on Twitter. \u201cOngoing, uncontained & toxic. We will be paying the price for decades.\u201dDamian Collins, a British lawmaker whose parliamentary committee is investigating online disinformation, said Facebook officials should answer for why they had not been more forthcoming. \u201cI feel that we have been given misleading responses by the company when we have asked these questions during previous evidence sessions.\u201dAnd Barbara Underwood, the New York attorney general, said her office would examine the deals as part of a continuing investigation into Facebook. \u201cThe news that Facebook struck data-sharing partnerships with other corporations reflects the many unanswered questions to which New Yorkers deserve clear answers,\u201d said Amy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for Ms. Underwood\u2019s office.Facebook has sought to contain the damage in part by winding down many of its data-sharing partnerships. Facebook said on Wednesday that it had brought more than 60 of its agreements to a close.But deals with two giants of the technology world \u2014 Amazon and Apple \u2014 remain in place. Facebook officials said the deals must continue because of contracts the social network signed with the companies.Records obtained by The Times showed that the social network granted Apple devices broad access to people\u2019s personal data, even when users had disabled sharing. Facebook gave Amazon access users\u2019 email addresses without permission, among other things, the records revealed.An Amazon spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. An Apple spokesman said that the company stopped integrating Facebook into its operating systems earlier this year, but that the access continued to accommodate users of older systems.In addition to those partnerships, Facebook will continue allowing special access for Tobii Technology, a company that makes devices allowing people with neuromuscular diseases to use the social network, a Facebook spokeswoman said.Facebook also had a deal to share the data of users\u2019 friends with Microsoft, and agreements that gave Spotify and Netflix full access to users\u2019 private messages. Users were especially incensed at the Spotify and Netflix deals, which appeared to go far beyond what the companies required for their integrations.Spotify\u2019s Facebook feature, still active, allowed users to share music with friends; Netflix\u2019s integration, discontinued in 2015, let users share movie and TV recommendations. A Netflix spokesman on Wednesday said the company did not view personal messages for any other reason.\u201cThe total lack of respect for user wishes is the infinitely repeating scandal of 2018,\u201d she added.An earlier version of this article misattributed a statement made to Fox News about Facebook. The statement was made by Senator John Kennedy, the Louisiana Republican, not Senator Roy Blunt, the Missouri Republican.Matthew Rosenberg contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

He despises what Jeff Bezos built, but he can\u2019t quit it. Ms. Willis Aronowitz is a writer and critic.Sharing an Amazon Prime account with loved ones is surprisingly intimate. You\u2019re privy to one another\u2019s impulse buys, fondness for corny \u201990s comedies and preferred brands of vaginal suppositories. Like many families, mine shares a login for the ubiquitous delivery behemoth. Every time my dad or my sister orders an item, I see a cheerful red badge pop up on my app: \u201cYour Amazon.com shipment is on its way!\u201dLately, those red badges have started coming several times a week. In 2018 alone, my family has spent nearly $7,000 on Amazon.My dad, a former professor with an impressive library, used to buy only books on the site. Now nearly everything he needs comes from Amazon: physical therapy balls, elevated toilet seats, a better wheelchair than Medicare can cover, cheap tubs of protein powder, even staples like kitty litter and T-shirts.My sister Kim faces this irony, too. Last year, just before her 60th birthday, she found out she had breast cancer. The chemo wreaked havoc on her immune system, and she took a seven-month leave from work. Afraid of making her health worse during a historic flu season, she barely left the house and started ordering the most prosaic products on Amazon Prime in bulk: tissues, a fleece jacket, a lemon squeezer, dinner forks, deodorant. As her cancer treatment ramped up, the red badges signaled other items: wig caps, pill organizer, the Book of Common Prayer, a St. Peregrine patron saint of cancer medal. When her chemo resulted in a raging case of hemorrhoids, she was grateful not to have to ask our brother, who was caring for her, to fetch her sitz bath salts and witch hazel pads. After her reduced disability pay began to catch up with her, she used Amazon for the discounts. She once ordered 27 rolls of toilet paper for just $16.97.My sister spends her days as a social worker in hospice, giving her a front-row seat to the travesty of end-of-life care in the United States. A bleeding-heart liberal, she\u2019d been known for fierce Facebook posts on things like President Trump and gay marriage. When she was going through treatment, her heart was bled dry. \u201cWhen I was in survival mode, I couldn\u2019t think of anything else but feeling better,\u201d Kim told me. \u201cI really wasn\u2019t thinking globally.\u201dIf I wanted to quit the service forever because it offends my values, I could probably do that without upending my life. But even for someone like me, who isn\u2019t sick or disabled or poor or living in a rural area, Amazon Prime helps alleviate the pressures of a sped-up economy. I don\u2019t use it just because I\u2019m lazy and love to stream \u201cTransparent.\u201d I use it (and other timesaving apps like Seamless and Uber) because I\u2019m overworked and one-click ordering spares me time. Yet, as Kim observed, it\u2019s hard to care about the big picture when you\u2019re simply putting one foot in front of the other. Because of seemingly remote forces \u2014 an inaccessible elder care system, insufficient health coverage, stagnant wages, long work hours \u2014 those of us who see corporate monopolies as detrimental to this country nevertheless rely on them for anything from dish soap to our paychecks.The Libertarian presidential candidate Harry Browne famously warned that the government will break your legs, then hand you crutches. Mr. Browne, an ardent fan of the free market, could have been describing the economy of cheap convenience. Amazon is the clearest example of a corporation exploiting the precariousness created by capitalism \u2014 precisely by soothing some of its pain.Nona Willis Aronowitz is a writer and editor.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spying on the Dog (or Cat) ", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe FixDo you really want to know what your pets are doing while you\u2019re away?Ever since our labradoodle, Rocket, arrived on the scene earlier this year, our furniture has taken a beating. Sofa corners have been gnawed, throw pillows have been destroyed and sisal baskets have become chew toys. And this all happened while someone was at home to supervise him.Contemplating the prospect of leaving Rocket alone, outside his dog crate, was nerve-racking. So like other pet owners before me, I turned to technology for peace of mind.Surely a pet cam was the answer.To find out if pet cams are really all they\u2019re cracked up to be \u2014 and to see what our dog would do when left on his own \u2014 I installed a few in the living room.One thing I discovered immediately is that they\u2019re highly addictive; it was hard to resist constantly spying on the dog, though he spent most of the time sleeping on the sofa.Here\u2019s what else I learned.This sleek, cube-shaped camera was the most compact and attractive of the bunch. And setup was easy: Just plug it in, download the app and follow a few prompts.When Rocket barked or moved around, a push alert popped up on my iPhone screen. Opening the app allowed me to see what he was up to: usually nothing more interesting than looking out the window or sleeping. But the images from the wide-angle, high-definition (1080p) video camera were always sharp, and could have been recorded, were I so inclined.The device also offers digital zoom and two-way audio \u2014 so I could listen to Rocket and reprimand him, if necessary \u2014 with very little lag time. But if you want a multiday video history or more advanced alerts, including 30-second video clips, you have to pay a monthly fee that starts at $3.Petcube Play comes with a laser-pointer game that seemed promising, although we were initially concerned about the long list of warnings that accompanied it, cautioning us to avoid \u201cprolonged direct eye contact with the laser beam,\u201d among other things. That didn\u2019t turn out to be the problem, though.The game is supposed to be controlled remotely via the app, by dragging your finger across the phone screen. Rocket was unimpressed; he either didn\u2019t see the laser dot or ignored it.But when we were home and could point at the dot darting back and forth across the rug, Rocket obsessively chased it. We were also able to link the device to our Amazon Echo Dot and ask Alexa, the digital assistant, to play with him. Her version of fun, however, involved encouraging the dog to chase the laser across the sofa and over the kitchen counter. (Not a chance, Alexa.)Petcube also allows you to give your friends remote access to your pets; they just need to download the app. We weren\u2019t that keen on the idea of sharing Rocket (or an inside view of our home), but we did enjoy scrolling through the photos and videos posted by others on the app.The device was fairly glitch-free. I did lose the connection a couple of times while trying to connect to the camera remotely, but refreshing the app resolved the issue. For good measure, I also had David Templeton, an analyst on The New York Times\u2019s information security team, check out the camera to see if it could be easily hacked, and he reported no red flags.Your dog comes when you call him, but are you ready to come when he calls you?In addition to live video-streaming, motion-detection alerts, two-way audio and a built-in treat dispenser, PetChatz has an LCD screen so your pet can see you. For an additional $99, you can buy a PawCall button, which allows your pet to get in touch with you. A light on the paw-shaped button tells the animal when you\u2019re available, and he or she can then press the button to dispense a treat and send you a text message to initiate a call.Don\u2019t expect the dog to be able to do this on the first \u2014 or even the fifth \u2014 try. Rocket and I went through PawCall\u2019s training routine several times, which involved repeatedly taking his paw and touching it to the button, then allowing him to eat a treat. According to the directions, there is \u201cno verbal affirmation required\u201d because \u201cthe treat dispense sound\u201d \u2014 a little noise the PetChatz device emits whenever it releases a treat \u2014 \u201cis the pet\u2019s audible affirmation.\u201dThat may be sufficient for some dogs, but after repeating these steps 10 times and then taking a break and doing it all over again a couple of hours later, Rocket still hadn\u2019t gotten the hang of it. He had eaten a lot of treats, though.In fact, he seemed more interested in the treats than in my face, which popped up on the PetChatz LCD screen anytime I wanted to talk to him remotely. And I couldn\u2019t see his face very well, either.The device, which is a fairly bulky 11 inches tall, is affixed to the wall with screws on top of an electrical outlet, so no cords are exposed. (Alternatively, you could pay $60 for a portable mounting stand or get some zip ties and attach it to a dog crate.) But because the camera was positioned at the electrical-outlet level, I had a hard time seeing the dog\u2019s face remotely whenever he came up close to get a treat. Instead, I caught glimpses of random body parts.Lisa Lavin, PetChatz\u2019s founder, said she had the same issue with her standard poodle, Hattie, and dealt with it by training the dog to lie down before the treat was released, a trick Rocket and I haven\u2019t mastered.When I asked Mr. Templeton, of The Times\u2019s information security team, to test PetChatz for hacking vulnerabilities, one potential weakness emerged: \u201cCustomers are vulnerable to someone nearby sniffing their Wi-Fi password during the initial device setup,\u201d he said.In an email response, the PetChatz security team acknowledged this, but pointed out that the window is narrow and the potential hacker would have to be close by: \u201cWhile it is possible that the password would be susceptible during the time in which it\u2019s entered (say 60 seconds),\u201d they wrote in an email sent through a publicist, \u201cthe individual or system aiming to access the information during this time would also need to be inside the same residence/home or yard of the Wi-Fi being accessed.\u201dLike the other devices, Furbo has a wide-angle, high-definition video camera with night vision, two-way audio, and recording capabilities, and the setup is easy. Unlike the others, it has no laser games or video screens. But if your dog is like mine, the treat-tossing feature more than makes up for that.Before flinging the treat into the air, the device makes a clicking sound to elicit a Pavlovian response, so I was able to get Rocket\u2019s attention and reward him remotely. It also connected with Alexa, allowing me to schedule treats ahead of time by saying, for instance, \u201cAlexa, ask Furbo to toss a treat every hour between 3 and 5 p.m.\u201dRocket became so obsessed with the treats, however, that he nearly knocked the device off our TV console. And while double-sided tape is included to allow you to stick the device to a tabletop, I wasn\u2019t willing to risk damaging the veneer. I also wasn\u2019t sure the tape would be any match for our energetic dog. Moving the device to a higher shelf solved the problem, although the view was slightly obscured.Furbo, like its competitors, will send push notifications to your smartphone when it detects barking. But you can only record videos if you are watching the live stream. That means you might miss the chance to record your pet begging for treats (or destroying the sofa) if you happen to be in a meeting when you get the motion alert.Victor Chang, who founded Furbo\u2019s manufacturer, Tomofun, with his wife, Maggie Cheung, said the company is testing a \u201cdog nanny\u201d service that it hopes will provide a workaround. For a paid subscription, the service will automatically record and save short snippets of video; it will also snap photos whenever the animal faces the camera and will create a highlight video of the animal\u2019s daily activities, among other things.Of more concern, though, was our hacking test, which uncovered several vulnerabilities.\u201cThe iOS and Android apps both do not verify HTTPS certificates during account login,\u201d Mr. Templeton told me. That means a remote attacker (or whoever runs your Wi-Fi service) could break your secure connection, and identify and extract your user name and password. In other words, he said, \u201cI would be able to log into your account and watch your live video, and feed your dog treats.\u201dThe company said it is currently investigating the issue. \u201cAny vulnerabilities will be addressed immediately via firmware and/or app updates, and we will continue doing so for all devices in perpetuity,\u201d Ms. Cheung said. \u201cThe security and privacy of Furbo users\u2019 data is a first-order priority for Tomofun.\u201d To protect users\u2019 privacy, the company releases monthly app and firmware updates and performs regular security audits, she said, adding that there have been \u201cno known breaches to date.\u201dBut \u201cthis only works if the outlet and camera are from different development teams,\u201d he cautioned, \u201cand you normally keep the outlet off.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "It Doesn\u2019t Matter if Ecuador Can Afford This Dam. China Still Gets Paid.", "Date": "2018-12-24", "News": "A giant dam was supposed to help lift Ecuador out of poverty. Instead, it\u2019s part of a national scandal, and a future tethered to China.Supported byREVENTADOR, Ecuador \u2014 The dam sits under the glare of an active volcano, with columns of ash spewing toward the sky.Officials had warned against the dam for decades. Geologists said an earthquake could wipe it away.Now, only two years after opening, thousands of cracks are splintering the dam\u2019s machinery. Its reservoir is clogged with silt, sand and trees. And the only time engineers tried to throttle up the facility completely, it shook violently and shorted out the national electricity grid.This giant dam in the jungle, financed and built by China, was supposed to christen Ecuador\u2019s vast ambitions, solve its energy needs and help lift the small South American country out of poverty.Instead, it has become part of a national scandal engulfing the country in corruption, perilous amounts of debt \u2014 and a future tethered to China.Nearly every top Ecuadorean official involved in the dam\u2019s construction is either imprisoned or sentenced on bribery charges. That includes a former vice president, a former electricity minister and even the former anti-corruption official monitoring the project, who was caught on tape talking about Chinese bribes.It doesn\u2019t matter whether Ecuador can afford them.China gets paid either way.To settle the bill, China gets to keep 80 percent of Ecuador\u2019s most valuable export \u2014 oil \u2014 because many of the contracts are repaid in petroleum, not dollars. In fact, China gets the oil at a discount, then sells it for an additional profit.Pumping enough oil to repay China has become such an imperative for Ecuador that it is drilling deeper in the Amazon, threatening more deforestation.But that is not enough. Hobbled by the debts, President Len\u00edn Moreno has slashed social spending, gasoline subsidies, several government agencies and more than 1,000 public jobs. Most economists expect the country to slide into recession, stirring outrage.\u201cChina took advantage of Ecuador,\u201d said Ecuador\u2019s energy minister, Carlos P\u00e9rez. \u201cThe strategy of China is clear. They take economic control of countries.\u201dThe story of how the dam got built brings together two natural allies, both eager to change the course of the hemisphere and displace the United States as the unrivaled power in the region.Still, as the giant dam in Ecuador shows, the two sides were hardly equal partners.Both nations were willing to overlook deep design flaws, questionable economics and independent warnings that the technical studies for the dam were decades out of date.The gamble was all Ecuador\u2019s, and now the country is looking for new loans to plug its many gaps, including more money from China.Just this month, Mr. Moreno flew to China to renegotiate some of his country\u2019s debt \u2014 and borrow another $900 million.\u201cThe Chinese put the hook in,\u201d said Steve Hanke, a Johns Hopkins economist. \u201cAt the end of the day, what do these countries have? A pig in a poke.\u201dWhen Fernando Santos, an energy minister in the 1980s, found out that the Coca Codo Sinclair dam was actually being built, he could hardly believe it.During his time in government, officials had rejected a much smaller version of the project. The whole idea was doomed, he said, because of the volcano nearby. A major earthquake had decimated oil infrastructure in the area in 1987.\u201cThe volcano has been erupting since the time the Spanish came to Ecuador in the 16th century,\u201d Mr. Santos said, adding that investing so much money \u201cin such a risky location was nonsense.\u201dThere were other alarm bells.An independent review of the project in 2010, prepared by a Mexican government agency and obtained by The New York Times, warned that the amount of water in the region to power the dam had not been studied for nearly 30 years.Since that time, Ecuador had suffered punishing droughts, and there were concerns that its glaciers were melting because of climate change.Despite the advice, Luciano Cepeda, the dam\u2019s former general manager, said top Ecuadorean officials pressed ahead anyway because \u201ca new study would have taken several years\u201d and they didn\u2019t want to slow down.Even a Chinese diplomat in Ecuador, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said he had his doubts about the project.\u201cWe didn\u2019t give sufficient attention to the environmental reporting,\u201d the diplomat said.China\u2019s record offered both encouragement and cause for concern. Its massive Three Gorges Dam, which cuts the Yangtze River and rises 600 feet high, was the largest hydroelectric project in the world, designed to produce 20 times the power of the Hoover Dam.But inadequate safety measures led to the deaths of 100 workers, the dam displaced more than one million people, and the environmental damage was considerable, including the destruction of forests.Elected in 2006 under a surge that brought leftists to power across Latin America, Mr. Correa took aim at the United States with fiery, anti-imperialist speeches. In 2008, he refused to renew a lease that allowed American anti-narcotics surveillance flights to operate from an Ecuadorean air force base.Soon, Western financial institutions fell in Mr. Correa\u2019s cross hairs. He denounced the International Monetary Fund, saying it put restrictions on his spending. Then in 2008, he defaulted on $3.2 billion of his country\u2019s foreign debt and invited China to fill in the breach.\u201cCorrea wanted to get away from Western banks and institutions,\u201d said Diego Borja, Mr. Correa\u2019s former minister of economic coordination. \u201cWe knew this relationship wouldn\u2019t be an easy one with China.\u201dMr. Borja and other officials were staggered by the terms on Chinese loans. Most came from a large state-owned lender, the Chinese Export-Import Bank, which had high interest rates and required Ecuador to use Chinese companies in construction, effectively eliminating competition.China seemed particularly interested in oil from Ecuador, one of OPEC\u2019s smallest members. In one deal in 2009, China lent Ecuador $1 billion, to be repaid in oil shipments to the state oil company PetroChina.\u201cBut we didn\u2019t have other options,\u201d Mr. Borja recalled. \u201cThe doors were closed to the West.\u201dMr. Correa suddenly had access to money, but a new crisis emerged: The country was running out of power. A drought was depleting the nation\u2019s reservoirs, paralyzing its dams. Rather than look for another source, Mr. Correa doubled down on hydro power.Officials say it was Mr. Correa\u2019s electricity minister, Aleksey Mosquera, who first mentioned Coca Codo Sinclair: a megaproject that was supposed to provide a third of the country\u2019s electricity and represent the single largest investment in Ecuador\u2019s history.It ended up being built right under the Reventador volcano \u2014 and nearly twice the size of the proposed dam that had been rejected decades before.When it finally opened in late 2016, China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, flew to Ecuador to celebrate.Yet only two days before the visit, the dam was in chaos.Engineers had tried to generate the project\u2019s full 1500 megawatts, but neither the facility nor Ecuador\u2019s electrical grid could handle it. The equipment shuddered dangerously, and blackouts spread across the country, officials said.Ecuadoreans were never told about the failure, and a full power test has not been attempted since.Today, the dam typically runs at half capacity. Experts say that given its design \u2014 and the cycle of wet and dry seasons in Ecuador \u2014 it would be able to generate the full amount of electricity for only a few hours a day, six months out of the year.That is, if everything worked perfectly.Ecuador still has to pay back the debt, though. The $1.7 billion loan from China\u2019s Export-Import Bank is lucrative for China: 7 percent interest over 15 years. In interest alone, Ecuador owes $125 million a year.Now, many Ecuadoreans say the burden falls on them.Under the constant hum of the dam\u2019s transmission towers, residents in the town of Cuyuja worry that the towers will topple in the constant mudslides. Geologists say the tower foundations weren\u2019t built into bedrock by the Chinese.Another complaint is the bill. Maria Esther Tello paid $60 last month to keep the lights on in her home, a shock given the government\u2019s promises electricity prices would go down.\u201cWhere have my old mother\u2019s taxes gone?\u201d asked her daughter, Isbela Nole, as she helped harvest and peel fava beans to pay the government.At an entrance to the dam is an inscription, in marble.\u201cJorge Glas Espinel, vice president of the republic,\u201d it says. \u201cFor having forged and envisioned this monumental project.\u201dMr. Glas now sits in a cell in Ecuador, sentenced to six years in prison.Now Ecuadorean officials are investigating whether the Chinese also made payments to Mr. Glas and others around him.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that all the same people managed all these projects,\u201d said Mr. P\u00e9rez, the energy minister.The officials include Mr. Mosquera, the former electricity minister, who is serving a five-year sentence for taking $1 million from Odebrecht; and Carlos P\u00f3lit, the former anti-corruption official, who was charged with receiving millions in bribes from the company. Ricardo Rivera, another close associate of Mr. Glas, was also convicted of receiving payments from the Brazilians.But evidence has emerged suggesting that officials took bribes from China as well.Ecuadorean law enforcement officials say they have confirmed a secret tape recorded by an Odebrecht executive, given to Brazilian prosecutors and leaked to the Brazilian news media. In the recording, made at the house of Mr. P\u00f3lit, the anti-corruption official, the two men discuss a bribe.The executive can be heard saying that Mr. Glas, Ecuador\u2019s vice president, was \u201casking for a lot of money.\u201dThe executive then explained that he was told \u201cit was an obligation because the Chinese had already paid.\u201dThe recording has set off an investigation, particularly around Mr. Rivera, who presented himself as the vice president\u2019s representative during multiple visits to China, according to Ecuadorean law enforcement officials.They say they are examining 13 bank transfers worth $17.4 million authorized by Mr. Rivera to an HSBC account in Hong Kong. Law enforcement officials say they consider the bank transfers authentic \u2014 and want to know how Mr. Rivera deposited so much money in China.Until recently, Attorney General Pa\u00fal P\u00e9rez was leading an investigation into corruption by the Chinese, and traveled to China in November to ask for help.But Mr. P\u00e9rez abruptly resigned on Nov. 13, shortly after returning. He did not respond to interview requests.A lawyer for Mr. Glas denied that his client had been involved in corruption with Coca Coda Sinclair, calling Mr. Glas \u201can honorable, honest man\u201d and describing the dam\u2019s problems as \u201csmall imperfections.\u201dMr. Correa, the former president, is in exile in Belgium, wanted for organizing the kidnapping of a rival. Many of his lieutenants have been sentenced for corruption or are on the run as well.Mr. P\u00f3lit and a lawyer for Mr. Rivera did not respond to requests for comment; nor did Sinohydro, the Chinese state-owned construction giant that built the dam.Mr. Polit did not respond to repeated requests for comment, but after publication his lawyer said that his client denied any wrongdoing.When you approach Coca Codo Sinclair along the Quijos River, it\u2019s hard to tell you\u2019re nearing a dam at all.Much of the reservoir containing the project\u2019s water supply has filled up with small trees and bushes. Boats sometimes get grounded because the sediment is so thick.Workers at the dam say the silting, a consequence of design flaws, is only the latest problem.As early as 2014, technicians noticed cracks in the Chinese-made stainless steel equipment. That December, 13 workers were killed when a tunnel flooded and collapsed.A senior engineer sent records to Mr. Correa, the president, asking to brief him on the problems, according to documents viewed by The Times. The engineer was fired days later, according to former officials.Mr. P\u00f3lit, the anti-corruption official, performed audits. But they resulted in only mild criticism like work delays, with minor fines against the Chinese.Ecuadorean law enforcement officials say they are investigating whether Mr. P\u00f3lit and other officials were paid by the Chinese to overlook the problems. It was part of Mr. P\u00e9rez\u2019s inquiry before his resignation, they say.Now, 7,648 cracks have developed in the dam\u2019s machinery, according to the government, because of substandard steel and inadequate welding by Sinohydro. Sand and silt are also big concerns because they can damage vital equipment.On a recent visit, an engineer looked on nervously as readouts showed sand flowing into the dam. But workers say they\u2019re sometimes confused because of shoddy translations.One sign in Chinese reads correctly: \u201cDirect-Current (DC) Pumping Group.\u201dThe Spanish does not: \u201cPressure Group from Washington, D.C.\u201dThe communication problems extend downriver.The heavy sedimentation means engineers sporadically release large amounts of water to clear out the system, causing flash floods where Carlos Usam\u00e1, a sugar cane farmer, lives. No one warns him, he says.In December, he said, his brother and a friend were fishing near another Chinese-built dam when a similar flood washed them away.The bodies were found two days later, he said.The piles of debt have led the country\u2019s new leaders to rail against China much as they did against the United States.\u201cWe are not going to pay,\u201d Mr. P\u00e9rez, the energy minister, said of the possible billion-dollar price tag to fix Coca Codo Sinclair.But escaping China\u2019s orbit will be difficult, said Risa Grais-Targow, an analyst at Eurasia Group, a consulting company.\u201cThey know they don\u2019t have too many financing sources, so they are going back to knocking on China\u2019s door,\u201d she said.China has already made some concessions to Ecuador, like paying 92 cents more per barrel of oil. The share of Ecuador\u2019s oil going to the Chinese has also dropped \u2014 to 80 percent, from 90 percent.But the government still needs $11.7 billion to finance its debt, and it is billions short, analysts say.Beyond China, the new government is going back to the institutions Mr. Correa demonized: the World Bank and the I.M.F. Some worry that Ecuador is simply seeking another set of financial masters.\u201cWe are addicted to loans,\u201d said Mr. Santos, the former energy minister.Leopoldo G\u00f3mez, who works at a water treatment facility built under Mr. Correa, agrees.\u201cNow we realize,\u201d he said, \u201cthere\u2019s things we didn\u2019t need \u2014 like the dam.\u201dNicholas Casey reported from Reventador, and Clifford Krauss from Quito, Ecuador.

{"Headline": "Trump to Steer More Money to \u2018Opportunity Zones\u2019", "Date": "2018-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump directed federal agencies on Wednesday to steer spending toward certain distressed communities across the country \u2014 part of his administration\u2019s push to turn a tax break included in last year\u2019s $1.5 trillion tax package into a broader effort to combat poverty and geographic inequality.Mr. Trump told attendees at the meeting that the zones would receive \u201cmassive incentives\u201d for private-sector investment. He said the goal of the order was to help \u201cdraw investment into neglected and underserved communities of America so that all Americans regardless of ZIP code have access to the American dream.\u201dThe zones are urban, rural and suburban census tracts, designated by governors and approved by the Treasury Department, that either are high in poverty or border high-poverty areas. They are intended to bolster investment in areas that might otherwise lack interest by offering tax breaks to lure funding for start-ups, housing developments and other economic activity. Investors who fund projects in areas deemed opportunity zones can reduce \u2014 and in certain cases eliminate \u2014 taxes on investment gains.Mr. Trump\u2019s order seeks to encourage development in the zones and reassure investors that they are viable places for investment. It will create a White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council, covering 13 federal agencies and led by Ben Carson, the Housing and Urban Development secretary. The council will work to prioritize opportunity zones in a variety of federal efforts, including grant funding, loan guarantees, infrastructure spending and crime prevention.The zones have come under criticism from consumer advocates, who warn that they may not drive investment to truly distressed areas. The official communities designated as zones include some census tracts that are rapidly gentrifying \u2014 which could end up delivering large benefits to wealthy developers who would have invested in those areas without the Trump administration\u2019s tax advantage.A White House official said that the 13 federal agencies included in the new council had already drawn up a list of at least 150 potential actions they could take to support investment in opportunity zones. Projects could include the Agriculture Department targeting water infrastructure and rural broadband spending in certain zones, or the Small Business Administration focusing certain loan programs in designated tracts. The Justice Department could also shepherd spending on anti-crime efforts \u2014 such as mentoring and gang-prevention initiatives \u2014 to the zones.The investment initiative was adopted from a proposal by the Economic Innovation Group, a think tank started by the Silicon Valley mogul Sean Parker. Senator Tim Scott, Republican of South Carolina, championed the zones in the tax debate, as did Kevin Hassett, the chairman of Mr. Trump\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers.Mr. Hassett said that the administration \u201cwants to create a race\u201d for investors to pour money into the zones most in need of economic revitalization. He said the concept had helped energize philanthropists and investment professionals who worry about parts of the country being left behind economically and may need some incentive to direct their dollars there.\u201cIf you talk about geographic inequality, and if you ask people in whatever audience you\u2019re in, who here wants to try to help these places, everybody sticks their hand up,\u201d he added. \u201cBut if you ask who has an idea how to help, no one does.\u201dThe zones, and the administration\u2019s commitment of public support for them, will give those people \u201ca device to help the places they care about, maybe for the first time,\u201d Mr. Hassett said.Officials said the new council would need to decide whether to prioritize the hardest-hit opportunity zones for federal aid, or to keep the focus broadly on all zones, including those that may have pockets of economic success.Administration officials still must finish what is expected to be two more rounds of regulations that will govern the zones and the funds that invest in them. Investors have warned that those regulations could unfairly narrow or expand the types of projects that will be incentivized by the zones.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Die Hard\u2019 (1988) Review", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMany of the holiday movies we consider classics or cult favorites today did not seem destined for such glory when we first reviewed them. Some we panned. Others were flops. Others just weren\u2019t particularly holiday-focused.\u201cDie Hard,\u201d the movie that gambles a $5 million salary on Bruce Willis, has to be the most excessive film around. It piles every known element of the action genre onto the flimsy story of a New York cop who rescues hostages from a Los Angeles office tower on Christmas Eve. Partly an interracial buddy movie, partly the sentimental tale of a ruptured marriage, the film is largely a special-effects carnival full of machine-gun fire, roaring helicopters and an exploding tank. It also has a villain fresh from the Royal Shakespeare Company, a thug from the Bolshoi Ballet and a hero who carries with him the smirks and wisecracks that helped make \u201cMoonlighting\u201d a television hit. The strange thing is, it works: \u201cDie Hard\u201d is exceedingly stupid, but escapist fun.The film\u2019s producers and director were also responsible for the Arnold Schwarzenegger hit \u201cPredator.\u201d Here they graft the Schwarzenegger-style comic hero onto Mr. Willis\u2019s boyish, mischievous \u201cMoonlighting\u201d persona, and send this new creature sauntering into \u201cThe Towering Inferno.\u201dThere is a slow half-hour at the start, when John McClane (Mr. Willis) lands in Los Angeles to visit his estranged wife (Bonnie Bedelia) and goes to her office Christmas party. Minutes later, a group of terrorists shows up, planning to steal $6 million in bonds. The terrorists have to crack a difficult computer code before getting into the vault, so there is plenty of time for McClane to play hero.Mr. Willis\u2019s true expertise is in banter, so the director, John McTiernan, shrewdly blends bursts of action with comic dialogue. McClane races up and down elevator shafts. He kills one terrorist, taking his machine gun and citizens\u2019 band radio. Now he can have a running conversation with Al, the sympathetic black cop who arrives first at the scene. Al (played by Reginald Veljohnson) becomes part of the only buddy film where the friends don\u2019t meet until the story is over.Meanwhile, back in the executive suite, there is Hans, the ruthless terrorist leader in a very well-tailored suit. He is the film\u2019s best surprise, played by Alan Rickman, who was recently the seductive, manipulative Valmont in the Royal Shakespeare Company\u2019s stage production of \u201cLes Liaisons Dangereuses.\u201d Here, he makes Hans a perfect snake. \u201cWho are you?\u201d he superciliously asks McClane via radio. \u201cAre you just another American who saw too many movies as a child?\u201dWell, yes, he did. McClane is a movie maverick, who asks to be called Roy, because he always liked Roy Rogers\u2019s fancy shirts. Here, he walks around in a sleeveless undershirt, a tattoo on his left bicep, getting sweatier and dirtier and bloodier by the minute. A great part of the film\u2019s appeal is in watching the down-and-dirty cop match wits with the aloof master criminal. The film makers even have the wit to play the \u201cOde to Joy\u201d when Hans finally walks into the opened vault.\u201cDie Hard,\u201d which opens today at the Baronet and Criterion Center, has more than its share of bloody moments and blasted bodies, and it has some abysmal scenes as well. The former ballet star Alexander Godunov is a conspicuous terrorist, jumping around the set in a basic black costume and flowing blond hair. As the brother of McClane\u2019s first victim, he gets to say things like \u201cI want blood!\u201d And when McClane realizes he has been too hard on his wife, he radios an unintentionally funny message to Al: \u201cTell her that she is the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Look at Competition in Business Urges Us to Think Small", "Date": "2018-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks of The TimesWu, a professor at Columbia Law School and a contributing opinion writer for The New York Times, argues that the M&A arcana that lawyers and economists haggle over have effects that spill far beyond their rarefied areas of expertise. \u201cExtreme economic concentration yields gross inequality and material suffering, feeding an appetite for nationalistic and extremist leadership,\u201d he writes, by way of introduction and warning. \u201cThe road to fascism and dictatorship is paved with failures of economic policy to serve the needs of the general public.\u201dUnlike Wu\u2019s previous books, \u201cThe Master Switch\u201d (2010) and \u201cThe Attention Merchants\u201d (2016), \u201cThe Curse of Bigness\u201d is skinny, more of a dip with a snorkel than a deep dive. But the pithiness of this new volume is ideally suited to its subject. Wu doesn\u2019t want to get into all the intricacies of antitrust law; if anything, an enormous book on the problem of enormity would only fool us into believing that the subject is more impenetrable than it really is \u2014 and stoke the confusion and apathy that have allowed decades of corporate consolidation to flourish in the first place.Wu\u2019s point is simple. Giant corporations, seeking to protect their advantage, try to turn their outsize economic power into political power. So to break their grip on American democracy, the government needs to break them up in turn. That this proposal might sound outrageously radical to certain ears is, Wu says, just one sign of how unprepared we are for our current moment. To show how busting up big businesses into smaller parts was once a veritable American tradition, he charts how antitrust law emerged in response to the grotesque inequality of the 19th-century Gilded Age.When the Sherman Antitrust Act was signed into law in 1890, it had unanimous support in the House, though the language it deployed was both sweeping and severe, stating bluntly that \u201cevery person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize\u201d any area of business \u201cshall be deemed guilty of a felony.\u201dEnforcing the law turned out to be another matter. A decade later, J .P. Morgan \u2014 \u201chistory\u2019s greatest monopolizer,\u201d as Wu calls him \u2014 created the behemoth U. S. Steel by merging hundreds of smaller firms, even buying out his fellow tycoon Andrew Carnegie in 1901 for an exorbitant sum ($480 million back then) that would make Carnegie the richest man in the world.Wu is an able guide through the history \u2014 from Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s campaign against \u201cbad trusts\u201d all the way to the expansive bloat of AT&T and Microsoft\u2019s competition-crushing ambitions of more recent memory \u2014 but it\u2019s on the level of ideas that his book comes into its own. Similar to the tech moguls of today, the monopolists of a century ago \u201cliked to portray themselves as part of a progressive movement, striving toward a better age,\u201d Wu writes, even if the endgame they were pursuing \u2014 essentially \u201cpure economic autocracy\u201d \u2014 was a direct rebuke to the foundational values of the republic.But then competition can feel menacing \u2014 a grueling free-for-all that anyone with grand ambitions in business would prefer to do without. The venture capitalist Peter Thiel said as much in the pages of The Wall Street Journal in 2014, in an article with the piquant title \u201cCompetition Is for Losers.\u201d \u201cCapitalism and competition are opposites,\u201d Thiel declared. \u201cOnly one thing can allow a business to transcend the daily brute struggle for survival: monopoly profits.\u201dWu, who advised the Federal Trade Commission on competition issues during the Obama administration, doesn\u2019t buy all the piety; nor should he or anyone have to, he says. Trying to distinguish between gigantic corporations that bring value to consumers from gigantic corporations that don\u2019t is ultimately a mug\u2019s game. Competition is a process, and the process should be protected; to fixate too much on the other stuff is to expect the legal system to make distinctions it isn\u2019t equipped to make \u2014 pushing up the standard of proof and allowing enforcement to go slack.Against Bork\u2019s strictly minimalist idea, Wu advances another, more complex one, which was proposed in the early 20th century by the lawyer and eventual Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis. Worrying about the tendency of giant corporations to \u201cexterminate\u201d the competition in their inexorable march toward domination, Brandeis believed that the economy, and the businesses that are part of it, needed to operate at a human scale.\u201cWhat Brandeis really cared about was the economic conditions under which life is lived,\u201d Wu writes, \u201cand the effects of the economy on one\u2019s character and on the nation\u2019s soul.\u201d It\u2019s a big idea for a little book, but Wu knows how to keep everything concise and contained. \u201cThe Curse of Bigness\u201d moves nimbly through the thicket, embracing the boons of being small.Advertisement"}

Reruns of Joey\u2019s thespian trials, Chandler\u2019s hapless sarcasm, Monica\u2019s compulsive cleanliness, Phoebe\u2019s feline riffs and the seemingly permanent courtship of Ross and Rachel will be available to watch on Netflix for at least another year, the streaming service has announced.But it will come at a steep price: The company will pay around $100 million to continue licensing the program from its owner, WarnerMedia, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss details of the deal.That\u2019s a significant jump from the $30 million a year that Netflix had paid previously to stream the show. But the new amount reflects the thirst for content in the streaming age. Online viewing is the future of entertainment, and the industry\u2019s biggest players \u2014 including WarnerMedia\u2019s parent, AT&T; the Walt Disney Company; Comcast\u2019s NBCUniversal; Viacom; CBS; and Discovery \u2014 are retooling their streaming operations to take on services like Netflix and Amazon.WarnerMedia and Netflix declined to comment.For Netflix, paying big money for hit content is necessary to expanding its customer base, now 57 million in the United States and 130 million worldwide.At an investor conference in New York on Monday, Ted Sarandos, head of Netflix\u2019s content division, said the show\u2019s departure \u201cis a rumor.\u201dThe deal to keep \u201cFriends\u201d on Netflix was due to expire by the end of the year, but both Netflix and AT&T had been negotiating for at least a few months to extend it, the people with direct knowledge of the matter said.\u201cThat\u2019s content we definitely want on our platform,\u201d AT&T\u2019s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, said of \u201cFriends\u201d at an investor conference on Tuesday. \u201cAnd clearly it\u2019s important to Netflix as well.\u201dHe added that the new agreement between the two is nonexclusive, meaning \u201cFriends\u201d is likely to appear on AT&T\u2019s coming service by 2020. The sides are currently negotiating rates for after 2019 that would be significantly lower than $100 million, since the show would no longer stream exclusively on Netflix, the people with knowledge of the matter said. It\u2019s also possible that \u201cFriends\u201d could leave Netflix after next year, they added.To attract new streaming customers, AT&T will likely have to keep some of its shows and films off other services like Netflix and have them available only on AT&T\u2019s offering. Disney, which plans to debut its own streaming service by the end of next year, will start pulling some of its films from Netflix after next year.Companies like Netflix \u201cshould expect their libraries are going to get a lot thinner,\u201d he said.\u201cThat\u2019s going to make it exciting for us,\u201d the Netflix chief executive, Reed Hastings, said on the company\u2019s earnings call in October of the forthcoming competition. \u201cIt\u2019s great for consumers. Incredible for producers. I mean there\u2019s never been so much TV and movies being created around the world. So the game is on.\u201dThe market will support two or three on-demand streaming services, including Netflix, Mr. Stephenson said on Tuesday, \u201cand we want to be one of the two or three.\u201dThe entrance of AT&T and Disney into streaming could lead to a situation where studios hold off licensing their shows and films, or at least drastically cut back on such deals, to help stoke subscriptions to their own streaming services.\u201cFriends\u201d ran for 10 seasons from 1994 through 2004 on NBC\u2019s once-mighty Thursday night lineup that dominated television.Whether it is or not, Netflix has decided it\u2019s worth $100 million.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "India Curbs Power of Amazon and Walmart to Sell Products Online", "Date": "2018-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Indian government dealt a surprise blow on Wednesday to the e-commerce ambitions of Amazon and Walmart, effectively barring the American companies from selling products supplied by affiliated companies on their Indian shopping sites and from offering their customers special discounts or exclusive products.\u201cUltimately, the customer is going to suffer because Indian sellers are not at the scale where they can provide a good experience to customers,\u201d said Satish Meena, a senior forecaster in New Delhi for Forrester, a global technology research firm. \u201cThis is a very regressive strategy by the government.\u201dThe new e-commerce rules seemed to be an attempt by Mr. Modi to placate small traders, who have been hurt by his tax and financial policies, ahead of national elections next May, analysts said. The changes would also help Paytm, a local payments company that operates a digital mall, and Reliance Industries, an Indian conglomerate with online retail ambitions that is controlled by Mukesh Ambani, India\u2019s richest man and a political patron of Mr. Modi.The new policies appear to close that loophole. They also prevent the online platforms from striking deals to sell products exclusively, which they frequently do now for hot items like new phone models.Salman Waris, a lawyer at TechLegis in New Delhi who specializes in international technology law, said the actual impact of the policy changes remained to be seen, because the language was vague and in some cases contradictory.Amazon, which operates through a maze of interrelated entities in India, has also been deft at finding ways to structure its operations to comply with the letter of the law while retaining maximum flexibility to run its business as it sees fit.Still, the new policy is set to drive up costs for Amazon and Walmart in India and may affirm many investors\u2019 fears that Walmart\u2019s costly acquisition of Flipkart was misguided.At the time of the deal in May, Walmart\u2019s chief executive, Doug McMillon, said India offered a unique opportunity for the retailer to tap into a young, growing and digitally savvy market. But analysts have been concerned about the amount of money Walmart will need to spend to help Flipkart grow and eventually become profitable.Amazon and its investors have long hoped the company could replicate its domestic success in fast-growing emerging markets like India, particularly as the growth of its core e-commerce business in the United States has slowed. The Seattle company has invested more than $7 billion in India, according to Morgan Stanley.After Prime and Alexa, India was the third most frequently mentioned term in Amazon\u2019s shareholder letters in the last few years, according to the research firm Gartner L2. Amazon\u2019s international operations lost about $2.4 billion over the past four quarters, although profit margins have improved.Karen Weise and Michael Corkery contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lothar Baumgarten Dies at 74; Artist Explored Collision of Cultures", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Marian Goodman Gallery in New York, which represented him, announced his death without specifying a cause.\u201cThe breadth of his work was really enormous,\u201d Ms. Goodman said in a telephone interview.In the late 1970s, Mr. Baumgarten spent months at a time on repeated occasions living with the Yanomami in a remote region on the border of Venezuela and Brazil, immersing himself in their way of life. His experiences formed the basis of numerous exhibitions for decades afterward, including, in 1993, \u201cAmerica: Invention,\u201d in which he transformed the famed spiral at the Guggenheim Museum into a study of threatened and lost cultures.On the floor he emblazoned the words \u201cBorrowed Land for Sale,\u201d and up the spiral he displayed the names of North and South American tribes, some familiar, others a fading memory. The piece also incorporated adjectives associated with ethnographic displays of such peoples, like \u201clost\u201d and \u201csubtitled.\u201dThe work, Roberta Smith wrote in a review in The New York Times, created \u201ca kind of linguistic monument\u201d to those tribes, with Mr. Baumgarten \u201ctransforming the spiral\u2019s space into something akin to a giant word-map or an inside-out globe.\u201dBut though he used the tools of ethnography, he did not view himself as merely documenting. As an artist, his journey did not really begin until he got home.\u201cThat\u2019s when I really saw,\u201d he told The Times in 1988, when another installation based on his time with the Yanomami, \u201cTerra Incognita,\u201d was on display at the Goodman gallery, which showed his work for decades.\u201cYou cannot reflect your own society unless you know a society that is remote from it,\u201d he added. \u201cTo know that society, you don\u2019t want to walk into it, get a Ph.D. and turn the page. You have to jump into the bushes, almost naked, as I did.\u201dLothar Baumgarten was born on Oct. 5, 1944, in Rheinsberg, Germany. His father Kurt, was an anthropologist, and his mother, Johanna, was an executive secretary at a bank.He became interested in photography as a child.\u201cWhen I was 5,\u201d he told Mousse Magazine in 2016, \u201cI found that I couldn\u2019t express myself clearly enough verbally to my father. I said to him, \u2018I\u2019d like to give you a picture from what I see.\u2019 \u201d So his father gave him an Agfa box camera.He graduated from the State Academy of Fine Arts Karlsruhe in 1968, and from 1969 to 1971 he studied at the Academy of Arts in D\u00fcsseldorf, where his teachers included Joseph Beuys.Mr. Baumgarten began making photographic studies of displays at ethnography museums throughout Europe. Then came his stay in the Amazon, which he drew upon for several exhibitions in the 1980s, including one for the 1984 Venice Biennale, in which he embedded the topography of the Amazon River system into the floor of the German Pavilion.In the late 1960s or early \u201970s, he had a serendipitous encounter that ultimately helped bring him to attention in the United States as well. Ms. Goodman and a colleague were participating in an art fair in D\u00fcsseldorf when the colleague became ill, leaving Ms. Goodman, who was then early in her career as a gallerist, with 40 pictures to hang. The colleague called a local gallery and asked the owner whether someone was available to help.\u201cShe sent over a young man, and he did a great job of hanging the work,\u201d Ms. Goodman said. Only when he mentioned that he had a film showing nearby did she realize that he was an artist, not just a gallery assistant. It was, of course, Mr. Baumgarten, and she was soon presenting him in the United States.His many exhibitions at the gallery included an installation in 1987 that focused on a hunting trip he had gone on while living with the Yanomami.Mr. Baumgarten was known for immersing himself in whatever subject he might tackle.\u201cHe was very demanding of himself, that he did his best and understood the subject,\u201d Ms. Goodman said. \u201cHe was always in for every project, all the way.\u201dFor \u201cCarbon,\u201d an installation that examined American railroads and their role in opening up the West and disrupting Native American cultures, he rode the rails for four and a half months in 1989. His commitment of time and attention extended to individual elements of that work as well, like a photograph of cows in a field.\u201cIt took me 20 minutes to establish communication with the cow in the middle,\u201d Mr. Baumgarten told The Dallas Morning News in 2004 when \u201cCarbon\u201d was at the Dallas Museum of Art.In 1999 he married Nobuko Sugai, who survives him, as does a son, Moritz.\u201cIt is a variation on this warning \u2014 that we ignore the natural and our place within its order at the risk of great peril to ourselves and others,\u201d Chris Wiley wrote in reviewing the work for Daylight Magazine in 2008. That warning, he added, \u201cacts as subterranean thread connecting Baumgarten\u2019s work, whether he is in the jungles of South America, the manicured parks of Europe, or the tangled woodlands of upstate New York.\u201d\u201cIf we listen closely to the sounds of Denning\u2019s Point,\u201d Mr. Wiley wrote, \u201cwe can hear echoes of the wild noises that will haunt our future ruins, unless we are careful.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Here, a highly subjective (and in some cases exaggerated) list of who and what seemed to morph into someone or something else.When Bill de Blasio Became Donald Trump (*Wait, what?)When an Unknown Bartender Became a Che Guevara T-shirtAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez rose from obscurity over the summer to defeat longtime incumbent Joseph Crowley in the Democratic primary to represent the city\u2019s 14th Congressional district. But that is easily the dullest and least relevant way to describe her change of fortune. On the left she has become a symbol of working-class grievance, of an urban youth class mired in student debt and locked out of domestic comforts by a national housing crisis. On the right she has become a lightning rod for those who fear and loathe a rising progressive energy. Is she weak on policy? Does it matter? She is leading an emotionally charged movement.When Andrew Cuomo Became the Bartender Who Became the Che Guevara T-shirtWhen the New York City Housing Authority Became the Ultimate SlumlordIn June the federal government delivered a brutal rebuke to the nation\u2019s biggest public housing authority, accusing it of gross mismanagement and failure to provide a safe living environment for residents, especially children who had been exposed to lead paint. The city was supposed to move quickly making repairs; it didn\u2019t. Reports of squalid conditions continue, and in one complex, thousands of residents didn\u2019t have heat or hot water on Thanksgiving.When Amazon Became Philip MorrisSo it turned out that Amazon was more or less just kidding when it solicited proposals from cities around the country hoping to be home to the company\u2019s second headquarters. The company affirmed its elitist commitments when it chose to locate in New York and suburban Washington over, say, Detroit or Pittsburgh. And while that was maddening enough to plenty of urbanists, many New Yorkers have greeted the impending arrival of Amazon with a rage toward the company that was not necessarily foreseeable. Amazon\u2019s encroachment into Queens, where the terror is that it will drive housing prices up even further and deny jobs to the people who really need them, has made the retailer the brightest new emblem of corporate malevolence.When Sheryl Sandberg Became Ayn RandMany women in New York\u2019s pop intellectual and publishing communities embraced Sheryl Sandberg\u2019s book \u201cLean In\u2019\u2019 when it came out a few years ago. Its simple advice for female empowerment: Women need to just buck up and assert themselves if they wanted more from the patriarchy.

Above, in the Syrian town of Derik.\u201cAt this time, we continue to work by, with and through our partners in the region,\u201d a Pentagon spokesman said in a short statement._____2. The Fed raised interest rates. The Fed chairman emphasized that the national economy was relatively healthy, while saying the choppy global economy and the recent sell-off in stocks had gotten officials\u2019 attention._____3. Facebook shared more about you than you know.Facebook let Spotify and Netflix read, write and delete users\u2019 private messages. It permitted Amazon to obtain users\u2019 names and contact information through their friends. In all, Facebook shared data with more than 150 companies, including The Times. Above, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive._____Illinois dioceses have publicly identified 185 clergy members as having been \u201ccredibly\u201d accused of child sexual abuse, the attorney general said. But her investigation found that the Catholic Church had withheld the names of more than 500 additional priests and clergy members who had been accused. Above, Cardinal Blase Cupich, the archbishop of Chicago.The investigation found that allegations \u201cfrequently have not been adequately investigated by the dioceses or not investigated at all.\u201dThe report concluded that the Catholic dioceses in Illinois were incapable of investigating themselves and \u201cwill not resolve the clergy sexual abuse crisis on their own.\u201d_____It would also push a fight with President Trump, above, over billions of dollars for a border wall, to the New Year and a divided Congress.The interim measure could pass the Senate as soon as tonight, before being taken up by the House on Thursday and sent to President Trump ahead of the midnight Friday deadline \u2014 when funding is set to lapse for nine federal departments.Democratic leaders in both houses said the party would support the compromise. Mr. Trump has publicly embraced shutting down the government over the wall, but White House officials signaled a softer position in the last couple days.6. Climate change is ravaging the natural laboratory that inspired Charles Darwin. Not only do the islands sit at the intersection of three ocean currents, they are in the cross hairs of one of the world\u2019s most destructive weather patterns, El Ni\u00f1o, which causes rapid, extreme ocean heating across the Eastern Pacific tropics. Above, a marine iguana feeding on algae.A Times correspondent and photographer traveled 600 miles off the coast of Ecuador to the islands, where warming waters are threatening native creatures with starvation and death._____7.

Farther north, the Mendocino County sheriff\u2019s deputy says the stench is the No. 1 complaint. And in Santa Barbara County, growers are installing odor-control systems designed for garbage dumps. Above, a grower in Santa Rosa, Calif.\u201cIf someone is saying, \u2018Is it really that bad?\u2019 I\u2019ll go find a bunch of skunks and every evening I\u2019ll put them outside your window,\u201d one man said. \u201cIt\u2019s just brutal.\u201d_____8. We have a reading list for tomorrow\u2019s feminists.Children absorb stereotypes by the time they are ready for preschool. But when they read books that break gender assumptions, research has found, they reach for less stereotypical toys and broaden their future goals.One encourages boys to help around the house and promises: \u201cIf you learn to work hard, you can do something cool \u2014 fight fires, bake cakes, fly a spaceship, teach school.\u201dAnother is the true story of woman who followed her dream of becoming a shark scientist, ignoring the people who told her to be a secretary or a housewife._____Marshall was also the first woman to direct a feature film that grossed more than $100 million: the 1988 comedy \u201cBig,\u201d about a 12-year-old boy who magically turns into an adult, played by Tom Hanks, and then has to navigate the grown-up world.

{"Headline": "The Best Movies and TV Shows New to Netflix, Amazon and More in December", "Date": "2018-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe holidays can be a stressful time, even in the best of families. So in this month\u2019s roundup, we\u2019ve looked for the most soothing and crowd-pleasing TV series and movies coming to the major streaming services in December, with special favor bestowed upon anything nostalgic or mouthwatering. Below are the most interesting of what we\u2019ve found, followed by a roundup of all the best new titles in all genres. (Streaming services occasionally change schedules without giving notice.)What if you suddenly had a chance to be the president? It happens to an ordinary man named Dave Kovic (a versatile Kevin Kline) \u2014 but only because of his uncanny resemblance to Bill Mitchell, the actual U.S. President (also Kline). When Mitchell has a medical emergency, Dave finds himself in the Oval Office. Naturally, high jinks ensue. (It\u2019s particularly satisfying to watch him balance the budget). A fun romp for political junkies on both sides of the aisle.Despite being set in early February, \u201cGroundhog Day\u201d is an existential holiday movie in the same vein as \u201cA Christmas Carol\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life\u201d: A smug protagonist is compelled to rethink his mortal sojourn \u2014 how he has spent his days, how he has treated people \u2014 and to realize the error of his ways. Here, the case study is condescending TV weatherman Phil Connors (a wonderfully grouchy Bill Murray) who makes an annual trek to cover the big Groundhog Day festival in Punxsutawney, Penn. \u2014 only to find himself mysteriously condemned to relive the day over and over again. Is he in purgatory? A makeshift parallel universe? He doesn\u2019t know and can\u2019t escape, so he learns to make the best of it, ultimately connecting with his fellow human beings (including WrestleMania fan Michael Shannon). Like Phil\u2019s day, this movie becomes better with endless repeat viewings.The director and motion-capture master Andy Serkis\u2019s take on \u201cThe Jungle Book\u201d is for those who prefer their anthropomorphized animals to look like they actually live in a jungle \u2014 in other words, less cute and cuddly and more scruffy and muddy. Adopted by wolves, Mowgli (Rohan Chand) struggles with his precarious place in the pack; if he can\u2019t keep up, he will be cast out. But might this wild child be able to adapt to the human world? A colonial hunter (Matthew Rhys) takes Mowgli under his wing, and Mowgli is befriended by a village woman (Freida Pinto) during Holi festivities. As Mowgli straddles the two worlds \u2014 belonging to both and to neither \u2014 the story turns dark. And no one, animal or human, gets off easy. Major plus: the stellar voice work by Benedict Cumberbatch (as the tiger Shere Khan) and Christian Bale (as the panther Bagheera).Some baking shows you watch to marvel at the artistry, but not \u201cNailed It!\u201d This American series is for the barely-able-to-bake set, people who consider it a win if their pathetic attempt at patisserie resembles anything in the vicinity of say, a cake pop, a doughnut or an elaborate exercise in excess fondant. (Seriously, what is the deal with fondant, \u201cNailed It!\u201d?) These holiday episodes are a mad chef\u2019s laboratory for dreidel-shaped cake pops, polar animal confections and edible nativity scenes. \u201cThis baby Jesus is the most delicious baby I\u2019ve ever eaten,\u201d host Nicole Byer quips at one point. And later: \u201cI can\u2019t wait to eat Santa.\u201d OK, maybe you can.In the beginning, there are only splashes of water rushing across stone tiles, then receding. Eventually we realize we are watching Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio, in her first role), a live-in domestic worker for a middle-class family in Mexico City, scrub the household driveway. The movie, shot in gorgeous black-and-white, is a moving, semi-autobiographical interpretation of the Oscar-winning director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s own childhood in the 1970s. Cleo is modeled after his family\u2019s live-in housekeeper, Liboria Rodriguez, and Cuar\u00f3n imagines the world through her eyes, noting, with intimate deal, the conflicted status of servants who are both quasi-family members and, inevitably, perpetual outsiders. A must-see.The story of a boy and his dog, basically. But since this is a Wes Anderson film, and it\u2019s made in painstaking stop-motion animation, there\u2019s a bit more to it than that. The boy is Atari (voiced by Koyu Rankin), and he\u2019s on a mission to rescue his loyal canine Spots (Liev Schreiber) from Trash Island, where the dogs of Megasaki have been quarantined by a cat-loving, dog-phobic mayor (Kunichi Nomura, who co-wrote the script). Anderson\u2019s whimsy is relentless as always, but depending on your reading of its usage, the movie is either a sincere tribute to, or plunders, Japanese art, cinema and music. On another level, it\u2019s also a parable about bigotry, propaganda, the rise of authoritarian regimes and the need, everywhere and always, for compassion.If the 1978 animated adaptation of Richard Adams\u2019s novel left you with emotional scars as a child, be assured that this limited series is a gentler viewing. Which isn\u2019t to say there\u2019s no danger or pain involved as a group of refugee rabbits set out in search of a new home when one of their own, the nervous Fiver (voiced by Nicholas Hoult), has visions of \u201csomething bad\u201d coming. Something bad is always coming for rabbits, of course \u2014 they are preyed-upon creatures, after all \u2014 but the destruction of their natural world forces them to confront their concept of mortality and to reassess established power structures, as well as the price they are willing to pay for peace. It\u2019s easy to love these little guys and girls (there are more female rabbits this time around) and as we spend more time with Fiver, his brother Hazel (voiced by James McAvoy) and their pal Bigwig (John Boyega), we become invested in their fates. Prepare yourself for the usual \u201cWatership\u201d waterworks.Audrey Hepburn\u2019s Holly Golightly is vividly remembered for her sleek dawn-of-the-sixties styles \u2014 the little black dress, the big sunglasses, the jaunty cigarette holder. In Blake Edwards\u2019s celebrated movie version of Truman Capote\u2019s novella, she still casts a spell, and not just over the men passing through her breezy New York life \u2014 has the city ever seemed more emblematic? \u2014 but over us, too. (Just skip over Mickey Rooney\u2019s offensive caricature of a Japanese landlord \u2014 Edwards should have.)Also Arriving This Month:Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Best TV Shows of 2018", "Date": "2018-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJames PoniewozikTV gets better and better, but it does not necessarily do so in a straight line. The first several months of 2018, I worried I might have a hard time filling this list. The last half of the year, though, came on with a burst of creativity that kept me adding and subtracting to the last minute. This is one reason I don\u2019t rank it in order. I\u2019d be lying if I told you I liked my No. 7 show measurably better than No. 8, and you could make a solid Top 10 out of my near-misses (\u201cBabylon Berlin,\u201d \u201cCrazy Ex-Girlfriend\u201d and \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d among them).[Why I love this opening of \u201cThe Good Fight.\u201d]Mike HaleThe magic number that\u2019s used to scare us these days with regard to the excessive population of scripted television shows is 500. But my research \u2014 consisting of poring over my own obsessively maintained lists \u2014 indicates that in 2018, the number of new seasons of international shows alone was more than 600.Chinese soap operas and Korean romantic comedies, British conspiracy thrillers, Indian gangster sagas, moody Scandinavian ghost stories, Mexican melodramas, Spanish crime capers, French children\u2019s shows and Japanese anime \u2014 the only bar to entry is how many TV and streaming subscriptions you\u2019re willing to spring for.The other issue is time, of course. The shows on the following list are my 10 favorites among the relatively small share of international series I was able to sample. Please use the comments to fill in the gaps with your own picks. (Before you ask, \u201cThe Crown\u201d didn\u2019t have a new season in 2018.)Margaret LyonsTop debuts included addictive thrillers and nihilistic satires.Even though Peak TV shows no real signs of actually peaking, this wasn\u2019t a banner year for new shows \u2014 most of the year\u2019s standouts were veteran series. There were hundreds of premieres, which often felt like thousands of premieres, which is why no one person can possibly watch it all. I know I\u2019ve missed some great shows in the last 12 months. All I can say is I\u2019ve caught some great ones, too, and these were the freshmen that stood out.The dreamy-surfy \u201cLodge 49\u201d has arguably the best casting of any series on this list. A show this gentle and diffuse only works if all the performances have a strong gravitational pull, and the show lives and dies on Wyatt Russell\u2019s ability to give the dopey but loyal Dud enough grounding. Luckily Russell\u2019s terrific, as is the rest of the cast \u2014 especially Brent Jennings as Ernie, Dud\u2019s mentor in the show\u2019s fictional fraternal order, and Sonya Cassidy as Liz, Dud\u2019s twin sister who\u2019s been handling the family\u2019s affairs since their dad died. \u201cLodge 49\u201d has a radiant internal decency, one that respects its characters\u2019 sometimes silly quests because it\u2019s a series that knows trying new things is hard but worth it.Ryan Murphy\u2019s ensemble drama set within the drag world of 1980s New York knows how to balance its sad side with its soapy side with its fun side with its human side. It\u2019s a show about allegiance and community, about characters who have found one another on the fringes and made a life and a world for themselves.Advertisement"}

It did not seem unusual given the plethora of double-parked cars on the block.Rather than straighten out and begin to drive forward, the car continued in reverse through the intersection. And then it turned right.This was the rare part. Because Madison Avenue runs north, the only legal turn at 80th Street would be a left.I called 911.\u201cThere\u2019s a car going the wrong way down Madison,\u201d I said. \u201cHe might hit someone.\u201dThe woman at the other end of the line said she would notify the local police precinct and that they would call me.Three minutes later, the police called. Did I know where the car was?Yes, I said, I was looking at it. It was in front of a hydrant facing the wrong way.Had I gotten the license plate number?You bet.The caller said they would \u201cget the guy,\u201d but I heard no sirens and saw no flashing lights, except those of the car lighting up storefronts as it slowly made a U-turn. The driver even stopped at the light.Then it went on its way. As did I.

Though the broadcast networks and basic cable channels actually aired fewer series this year, the total number of shows grew because of the explosive growth of online services like Netflix, Amazon, Facebook and Hulu. This year, there were 160 original series from digital companies, up from 33 in 2014.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon Sees in Brazil Continent-Size Profits and Problems", "Date": "2018-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byExpansion south, into the nation where Amazon\u2019s namesake river ends, may prove a little harder.\u201cAmazon is still kind of irrelevant here,\u201d said Raul Prado, a vendor in the rural town of Guaipava, Brazil, who has relied on online retail sites to build up his business. Less than 1 percent of his sales are through Amazon.Brazil, home to more than 200 million people and the world\u2019s eighth-largest economy, is in many ways an obvious target for Amazon\u2019s next major expansion. Google and Facebook have done well in Brazil, but their digital services \u2014 search, social media and advertising \u2014 do not have to overcome the hurdles of selling goods and making deliveries.As a retail behemoth wading into the market, Amazon has found itself playing catch-up with local rivals that know how to navigate Brazil\u2019s distinct challenges: a complicated tax structure, high import costs and the headache of moving goods across a continent-size country.\u201cBrazil is really kind of the natural next country in terms of sheer size,\u201d said Cooper Smith, who was the director of Amazon research at Gartner L2, a business intelligence and research company, but has since left. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge opportunity, and they are laying the groundwork for that today.\u201dNext year, he said, \u201cAmazon is going to be all about Brazil.\u201d His prediction came with a caveat: \u201cBut it\u2019s no small undertaking.\u201dAmazon has been present in Brazil\u2019s online retail market since 2012, but until recently it focused on selling books and its Kindle e-reader. A little over a year ago, Amazon made a splash when it expanded to let third-party brands sell electronics directly to consumers on its marketplace.Shares in local competitors tanked following the news, but they later rebounded when it became apparent that Amazon wasn\u2019t on the cusp of rolling out the services that have helped make it a market leader in the United States: first-party sales, by which brands supply Amazon with products and Amazon is the retailer; and its fulfillment service, which packages and ships products from the company\u2019s warehouses.\u201cAmazon arrived a little late to the game,\u201d said Marcel Motta, the Brazil director of the global research company Euromonitor International. Local, established companies, he said, \u201cknow how to get around the obstacles.\u201dMercadoLibre, for instance, the e-commerce leader that first began in Argentina and modeled itself after eBay, has been in Brazil for 19 years.\u201cWe helped build e-commerce in this region,\u201d said Cristina Farjallat, the head of MercadoLibre\u2019s third-party marketplace. \u201cWe have portfolios of sellers and portfolios of consumers that no one else has.\u201dShe said the company had lured more sellers to its site than any other online retailer by working with vendors to create the tools they need. MercadoLibre has a roster of 12 million vendors and its own fulfillment service, and is rolling out a payment service to bypass banks and credit cards.The company helped Mr. Prado, the vendor, turn a modest business venture \u2014 selling satellite antennas door-to-door in his remote village, where cellphone coverage was virtually nonexistent \u2014 into a national enterprise, with 20 employees.\u201cHonestly, I had no idea what I was doing when I started, but MercadoLibre is the first site people open when they go on the internet,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have the brand name, their own payment plan, the logistics infrastructure and they even offer loans to sellers.\u201dMr. Prado, who created his company, Lojas Mineiras, in 2008, now offers his satellite and telephone products through nearly a dozen online retail sites. More than half of his sales are made through MercadoLibre.That doesn\u2019t mean it will stay that way.This year, Amazon broadened its catalog of products, offering sporting goods, fashion and home accessories, and signed up some major brands \u2014 but all remain independently sold and delivered.As of November, Amazon had just under 1 percent of the market share in Brazil, and was ranked 10th behind online retailers that offer both first- and third-party sales, according to Euromonitor\u2019s research. MercadoLibre had 19 percent of the market share.Experts say the window for Amazon to establish itself as a major player in Brazil is closing, which is why they expect the company to make a significant push in the next year. The question is whether it\u2019s too late.Mr. Smith said he had heard from industry sources, including investors, that Amazon had acquired a lease on a large warehouse outside S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\u2019s biggest city; advertised more than 100 jobs, many of them high level; and started negotiations to sell American brands on its Brazilian site. Amazon declined to comment.\u201cJeff Bezos has always harped on the idea that as Amazon saturates the U.S. market, he can go to emerging markets around the globe,\u201d Mr. Smith said, referring to the company\u2019s chief executive. \u201cClearly, it\u2019s coming. Amazon wants to have boots on the ground in Brazil.\u201dAmazon appears to be moving cautiously in Brazil: It has not had a new platform up and working in the country in time for the Christmas shopping season.\u201cAmazon wants all the pieces of its ecosystem in place first,\u201d Mr. Smith said.One of the major pieces is transportation. Brazil is larger than the continental United States, but its roads are poorly maintained and often flood during rainy season, and the state postal service is widely seen as inefficient and unreliable.Magazine Luiza, one of Brazil\u2019s top e-commerce companies, which began as a mom-and-pop store selling televisions, has said it had overcome these problems by leveraging its pre-existing and growing presence: It has 900 stores across the country.Those stores, which now sell appliances, electronics and furniture to working-class Brazilians, are being converted into mini-distribution centers for Magazine Luiza, and help educate shoppers about the ease of online retail.\u201cPhysical stores are a fundamental part of our platform. We have succeeded in cutting delivery time and price,\u201d said Eduardo Galanternick, the executive director of e-commerce at Magazine Luiza. \u201cWhen you go deep into the interior of Brazil, Magazine Luiza is often the only department store around.\u201dFor example, thousands of rural families use the Magazine Luiza store in Graja\u00fa, a city in northern Brazil\u2019s soybean country, to order appliances and pick up online orders like diapers and brand-name cosmetics.In addition to difficult competitors and terrain, Amazon will face thickets of regulation. Brazil\u2019s convoluted tax structure can make delivering goods across state borders a costly affair, while high import tariffs have priced many foreign-made goods out of reach for all but the wealthiest Brazilians.Nonetheless, the potential for growth \u2014 Brazil represents just 1.1 percent of global sales in online retail \u2014 is expected to attract major investments from Amazon and other companies.Euromonitor forecasts that the Brazilian market will nearly double over the next five years to $35 billion, and some competitors will be squeezed out as obstacles to online retail are eliminated.\u201cIt\u2019s a question of Amazon conforming to our market,\u201d Mr. Prado said. \u201cRight now, they can\u2019t compete. But you never know. I\u2019ll keep offering my products on Amazon, just in case.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Scrooged\u2019 (1988) Review", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMany of the holiday movies we consider classics or cult favorites today did not seem destined for such glory when we first reviewed them. Some we panned. Others were flops. Others just weren\u2019t particularly holiday-focused.Locked deep inside Bill Murray there is a small, hyperactive misanthrope fighting to be heard through the large heavy body that contains him. The misanthrope never sleeps. He\u2019s a busy demon, peering out through Mr. Murray\u2019s squinty eyes, seeing all and remaining actively unimpressed. By the time his nastiest observations fight their way to the surface, however, much of their sting has been absorbed by flesh, leaving a sometimes revivifying but thoroughly domesticated skepticism.Because Mr. Murray is funniest when the big, laid-back, good-natured slob gives in to the furious mini-misanthrope, \u201cScrooged,\u201d an updated variation on Dickens\u2019s \u201cChristmas Carol,\u201d is best when Mr. Murray is allowed to be his secret self.As Frank Cross, the ratings-mad program chief of the IBC television network, Mr. Murray\u2019s contemporary Scrooge is a joy as long as he\u2019s making life miserable for everyone around him. When, finally, Frank sees the error of his ways, the movie succumbs to its heart of jelly. This may well be the secret of Mr. Murray\u2019s enormous popularity in a series of similarly second-rate comedies, including \u201cGhostbusters.\u201d In the end Mr. Murray must always deny what has appeared to be, until then, his redeeming offensiveness.\u201cScrooged,\u201d which opens today at Loew\u2019s Astor Plaza and other theaters, has some very funny things in it, including snippets from IBC\u2019s big Christmas show, an adaptation of \u201cA Christmas Carol\u201d with a lot of leggy, scantily clad showgirls and a boozy actor (Buddy Hackett) playing a conventional Scrooge.The actor has trouble with his lines. Standing in the middle of a set representing a Christmas card\u2019s vision of 19th-century London, this Scrooge barks out, \u201cWhy must I be molested by sea urchins!\u201d The show-within-the-show promises a lot, but it is never allowed to attain the sublime bad taste of the \u201cSpringtime for Hitler\u201d number in Mel Brooks\u2019s \u201cProducers.\u201dThat is not Mr. Murray\u2019s style. In spite of the jokes at the expense of television-network censors, there\u2019s very little in the film, aside from naughty words, that wouldn\u2019t be perfectly acceptable on prime-time television. \u201cScrooged,\u201d written by Mitch Glazer and Michael O\u2019Donoghue and directed by Richard Donner, exemplifies the kind of lazily executed comedies Mr. Murray seems always to make.\u201cScrooged\u201d works in fits and starts. The mundane demands of the sentimental story keep interrupting what are, essentially, revue sketches, a few of which are hilarious.Frank stuns a network staff meeting when he tosses out the Christmas show\u2019s trailer, which features an avuncular John Houseman reading from Dickens, and substitutes his own. This is an action-packed montage of clips of freeway killers, airplane terrorists and A-bomb detonations. Says one aide, \u201cIt looks like \u2018The Manson Family Christmas Special.\u2019 \u201c Frank dismisses the man on the spot.When the newspapers report that an old lady has died of a heart attack watching the trailer, Frank says, \u201cYou can\u2019t buy publicity like this.\u201d A production assistant complains that he is unable to fasten a pair of tiny antlers to the head of a mouse. Frank\u2019s solution: \u201cStaple them.\u201d John Forsythe appears in an amusing turn as the movie\u2019s Marley, Frank\u2019s predecessor at the network who died seven years before on the golf course, which explains why the ghost is wearing rotting sports clothes. After Mr. Murray (at least when he\u2019s being all-out mean), Carol Kane gives the film\u2019s funniest performance, as the Ghost of Christmas Present. Looking like Billie Burke\u2019s Glinda in \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d she\u2019s a pretty, diaphanous creature who alternately reasons with Frank and punches him in the stomach with the force of Muhammad Ali.No expense has been spared in the film\u2019s physical production and casting. The movie looks as if it cost a lot even when it\u2019s not necessary; the classiness of the supporting cast, however, is. Robert Mitchum is cool and comic as the network president. He warns Frank to prepare for the day when cats and dogs will be a significant portion of the viewing audience. Karen Allen is charming as the girl Frank leaves behind in his ruthless climb to the top, and John Glover is the ever-smiling, patronizing new boy at the network who, if things go wrong, will be Frank\u2019s successor.\u201cScrooged\u201d is nothing if not contemporary. Frank Cross\u2019s passionately delivered final speech, in which he endorses the power of love and the importance of old-fashioned family values, might have come out of the recent Presidential campaign.\u201cScrooged,\u201d which has been rated PG-13 (\u201cSpecial Parental Guidance Suggested for Those Younger Than 13\u201d), contains vulgar language and sexual references. Running time: 115 minutes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Paris Accord Promised a Climate Solution. Here\u2019s Where We Are Now.", "Date": "2018-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWorld leaders struck an agreement three years ago in Paris to avert the worst effects of climate change, accepting not only that greenhouse gases were dangerously heating the planet, but also that every single country needed to do its part to curtail emissions.Now, emissions are rising in the United States and China, the world\u2019s two largest economies. Other countries are backsliding on their commitments. The world as a whole is not meeting its targets under the Paris pact. As diplomats meet in Katowice, Poland, this week to bring the deal into effect, the world\u2019s 7.6 billion people face mounting risks from more severe and more frequent floods, droughts and wildfires. The Paris Agreement, it seems, is only as good as the willingness of national leaders to keep their word. \u201cWe have the ways,\u201d Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the United Nations secretary general, said this week in Katowice. \u201cWhat we need is the political will to move forward.\u201d Champions of the accord point out that the diplomatic process is alive and well and that all of the world\u2019s 195 countries are still in the deal, including the United States, which can exit only at the end of 2020. The science is sharper than before on the dangers of unchecked emissions, and a great many countries, including the poorest, are pushing for more ambitious targets. \u201cTo waste this opportunity in Katowice would compromise our last best chance to stop runaway climate change,\u201d Mr. Guterres said. \u201cIt would not only be immoral, it would be suicidal.\u201d How did we get here? In August, an effort in Australia to transition away from coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, resulted in the ouster of the prime minister. The man who succeeded him, Scott Morrison, endeared himself to the industry by bringing a lump of coal into Parliament.In November, Brazilians elected Jair Bolsonaro, who had pledged to promote agribusiness interests in the Amazon forest, the world\u2019s largest carbon sink. \u201cThe I.P.C.C. has sounded many alarms, and the world just keeps smashing the alarm and keeps on sleeping,\u201d said Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, founder of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, on the sidelines of the talks in Katowice. The world as a whole is not on track to meet the broad goal it set for itself in Paris: to keep the increase in global temperatures \u201cwell below\u201d 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, over preindustrial levels. Under the agreement, each country put forward a voluntary pledge to curtail its own emissions. So far, those voluntary pledges have not been sufficient. New data made public in Poland this week by the group Climate Action Tracker estimated that current climate policies put the world on pace for somewhere around 3.3 degrees Celsius. \u201cIf we are serious about the Paris Agreement, we need to see different numbers,\u201d Petteri Taalas, head of the World Meteorological Organization, told the delegates in Katowice this week. He noted that global emissions had risen in 2018.The negotiations in Katowice are aimed at setting out the rules by which countries will regularly update their emissions-reductions pledges and assess one another\u2019s progress. But even those technical discussions about the rule book have been bogged down by intense political differences.For its part, even though the United States has said it intends to withdraw from the Paris deal, the country has still sent a delegation to the negotiations. \u201cThese global energy and environmental policies will have an impact on U.S. interests, and we want to make sure we protect those so they\u2019re not hamstringing economic growth, innovation, entrepreneurship in the U.S.,\u201d said Wells Griffith, Mr. Trump\u2019s international energy and climate adviser.To be sure, the Paris pact, and the growing scientific clarity about global warming, has spurred countries and businesses to reorient themselves. From shipping to fast food to insurance, companies are setting their own targets to reduce carbon footprints. Solar and wind energy is expanding rapidly. Within the United States, a number of cities and states have dissented from the Trump administration\u2019s planned exit and created their own local plans to green their economies.Christiana Figueres, the former United Nations climate chief who led the Paris negotiations to their conclusion in December 2015, argued that the pact had set into motion a fundamental transformation of the global economy away from fossil fuels. It would be na\u00efve, she said, to not expect pushback.Brad Plumer contributed reporting from Katowice, Poland. Advertisement"}

European markets were also unsettled.Stocks in Asia have been buffeted by signs of trouble in the United States and by the slowing of the Chinese economy, the region\u2019s main driver of growth.After the Asian markets closed on Friday, a top Chinese policy committee, the Central Economic Work Conference, pledged to \u201cimplement active fiscal policies,\u201d a signal that Beijing might increase government spending to hasten growth.Without including details, the committee also reiterated recent promises by President Xi Jinping that taxes for business would be cut, among other measures.There were some bright spots in trading on Friday. Most stocks did not fall as far as the S&P 500 had on Thursday, when it ended the day down 1.6 percent.

{"Headline": " Luxury Comes to Expedition Cruising", "Date": "2018-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUpdateNew small ships built for adventure are also offering a full range of amenities, from saunas and fine dining to solariums and luxury suites.Generally associated with small ships bound for remote locales, expedition cruising has historically focused on the destination rather than the conveyance. Ships were strictly base camps for Zodiac trips to view the icebergs of Antarctica or hike game trails in remote Alaska.Now the vessels themselves are getting an upgrade from Lindblad and several other lines, freeing passengers from choosing between adventure and comfort.While visiting Antarctica, the ship is designed to keep guests toasty, from heated storage in the cabins meant to dry wet parkas quickly to a two-story solarium with a swimming pool and hot tub. Among amenities, there will be six restaurants, including one from the celebrated chef Nobu Matsuhisa, a pair of helicopters for excursions, and a three-person submersible. Its 17-day inaugural journey from Japan to Russia\u2019s Kamchatka Peninsula starts at $24,949 a person.\u201cThere are people who just want the basics, but there\u2019s a whole group of people who might not have gone to those places until the luxury is there,\u201d said Marcella Rappoport, a cruise specialist at Ovation Travel in New York.Smaller ships make it possible to pull into smaller or shallower ports, such as the French Iles des Saintes in the Caribbean, and many expedition ships, such as the new Lindblad ship, are built to navigate polar ice.\u201cThese new expedition cruises will attract a more adventurous person who may not be looking for a cruise but now sees this as an easy way to get to outer islands or parts of Japan without flying around a lot,\u201d Ms. Rappoport said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Version of YouTube Takes Shape With Pranksters, Magicians and Cartoons", "Date": "2018-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe tech giant sees Facebook Watch, with its rising number of videos from internet stars, as a key to future growth. A 20-something magician performing on the streets of Thailand and Jamaica. Three Australian brothers who shock bystanders with devious pranks. A conservative commentator in Mississippi who rants about America\u2019s priorities from his car. These are some of the video makers who in recent months have started making serious money from Facebook Watch, the tech giant\u2019s answer to YouTube. Julius Dein, the magician, said his videos had attracted revenue in the \u201csix figures\u201d since July, when he became able to run ads on them. The prankster brothers, known as the Jalals, said they had earned more than $500,000 since August. But creating a space that can attract that money has been a challenge for Facebook. Since beginning Watch in August 2017, the company had limited the number of pages that could run video ads to a tightly curated set of entities, including well-known publishers, TV networks and celebrities like Jada Pinkett Smith and Tom Brady. That has now changed. At the end of August, Facebook started to allow more pages to run ads on videos that were at least three minutes long. The number of Facebook pages that can run video ads has gone from about 3,700 on Aug. 1 to more than 23,000 this month, according to data shared with The New York Times by OpenSlate, an analytics firm that helps advertisers assess online video content. While Facebook has invested in plenty of original programming and established shows like \u201cBuffy the Vampire Slayer\u201d this year, it has also opened up Watch to much more do-it-yourself content from comedians, video bloggers and other digital entertainers. In other words, the YouTube crowd \u2014 though the number of videos on Watch is a small fraction what\u2019s available on YouTube.\u201cThey need premium, hit, intellectual-property-driven stuff to fuel the idea that this is TV-style content,\u201d said Ben Lerer, the chief executive of Group Nine Media, which oversees brands with popular Watch shows like \u201cThe Dodo\u201d and \u201cNowThis.\u201d \u201cBut then they need the volume that comes from News Feed content coming into Watch. That\u2019s a balance that\u2019s really delicate.\u201dWith more pages showing video ads, there are more places for advertisers to run their messages, and more opportunities for Facebook users to get access to videos on the platform. Among the most popular of these pages are entries from mainstream companies like Disney, BuzzFeed and Vice, according to OpenSlate. But in October and December, the most popular pages included a provocative group of bare-chested performers known as Magic Men Live, and others with names like \u201cInsane Stunts,\u201d \u201cJesus Today\u201d and \u201cNurse Blake.\u201d There was little in the way of news and politics. Facebook said on Thursday that more than 75 million people around the world spent at least one minute on Watch every day, and that those users then spent at least 20 minutes there on average. Ms. Pinkett Smith\u2019s \u201cRed Table Talk\u201d is its most-followed show and has the most active Facebook group, according to the company. Fidji Simo, who leads Facebook\u2019s video efforts, said that most users were getting access to Watch by clicking into it from the platform\u2019s main site rather than through videos on their News Feed.  \u201cSeeing how many people are coming in and watching for an average of more than 20 minutes has definitely been encouraging,\u201d Ms. Simo said. \u201cWe\u2019re really seeing this content create communities and social engagement on the platform.\u201d\u201cOne\u2019s a more lean-forward experience, and one\u2019s a more lean-back experience,\u201d said George Manas, who leads performance marketing across Omnicom Media Group agencies. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned that because it\u2019s running across both environments, it\u2019s creating challenges in measurement and, frankly, just in quality control because the user experience just isn\u2019t the same.\u201d Graham Allen, the 31-year-old host of \u201cRant Nation With Graham Allen,\u201d a Watch show from Conservative Review\u2019s CRTV (which recently merged with TheBlaze to form Blaze Media), said the viewership had made up for a sharp drop in traffic to his personal page after Facebook shifted its algorithms to favor its video offering.\u201cMost people don\u2019t even realize that the majority of videos they\u2019re watching now on their News Feeds are from Watch pages,\u201d Mr. Allen said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that was intentional from Facebook, to make it a seamless transition, or they just didn\u2019t think it through enough, like, \u2018Wow, people might not be able to know the difference.\u2019\u201d He added, \u201cAs far as video content goes, if you don\u2019t have a Watch page, you\u2019re kind of dead in the water right this second.\u201d The ad revenue has been welcome, he said, noting that he was previously more reliant on outside deals with sponsors. Mr. Dein, a 24-year-old magician from London who posts videos of street performances around the world, was able to start running video ads on his page in July. He said Facebook\u2019s rules affected the kind of videos that performed well, noting that ads can run after a minute as long as the video is at least three minutes long. \u201cWith me, since I\u2019m magic, I\u2019ll make sure the ad is on an exciting moment of the video,\u201d Mr. Dein said. \u201cIf I\u2019m about to cut my finger open for a magic trick, the ad plays just as the knife goes down.\u201d Mr. Dein said he had found it harder to produce \u201csuper-viral videos,\u201d like one he posted last year about homeless people reacting to magic, which he said had been watched more than 200 million times. But he said it made sense for Facebook to mimic YouTube and adopt longer-form content to appeal to advertisers. \u201cIf someone\u2019s watching a vlogger like Logan Paul and tuned into that person, they\u2019re paying more attention to the ad, whereas if someone is watching a seven-second clip, they don\u2019t care about the video or the ad,\u201d he said. \u201cNews content tends to be on the shorter side, so we\u2019ve seen a lot of news partners have a lot of one-minute videos,\u201d she said.

{"Headline": "Cuba\u2019s Slow Rebirth", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTurning Points\u201cIt was yours,\u201d my mother announced. She held out a girl\u2019s blue school uniform.She\u2019s 82 now and still surprises me with mementos she took from Cuba and has kept packed away since the \u201860s.A star was sewn onto the front and it had a thick hem to be let out as I grew.\u201cDon\u2019t you remember?\u201dI shook my head.\u201cYou wore it when you were 4 years old. You went to the same Jewish day school in Havana that I went to. Classes were in Spanish and Yiddish. Wasn\u2019t that amazing? Then Castro came.\u201dI grew up, as did so many children of Cuban exiles, traumatized by what my parents had lost in the revolution of 1959 led by Fidel Castro. They had believed in the social reforms Castro envisioned \u2014 equal rights for women and Afro-Cubans, free day care, land for farmers, housing for the poor, health care for all and education for every child \u2014 and felt betrayed by his turn to authoritarianism and communism.There are also the children who stayed, the generation raised by revolutionaries, who tried to build a just society through volunteer work and communal sacrifice. They struggled through periods of profound scarcity and now face the decline of Cuba\u2019s national welfare system. A friend who supports her parents with her Airbnb business wondered who she might have been, what she might have attained, had they left.\u201cYou\u2019re lucky your parents took you away when you were little,\u201d she told me.But as Cuba approaches the 60th anniversary of its revolution, a new generation, both in and out of Cuba, the grandchild generation, is shedding the traumas of the past.Young Cubans today are individualists who would have been labeled \u201cideological diversionists\u201d by elders who cut sugarcane for the good of the nation. Although they\u2019ve grown up hearing about the horrors of American imperialism and the ongoing trade embargo, they sport tattoos that declare, \u201cAll You Need is Love\u201d or \u201cLive Hard.\u201dA surprising number of young Cubans can afford to spend $28 \u2014 close to the island\u2019s average monthly salary \u2014 on a Clandestina T-shirt, but their ambitions can only go so far. They work in private restaurants, fix up rooms to rent to tourists, give an old Chevy a second life as a hot-pink taxi. They want Cuba to become an \u201cordinary\u201d country. Meanwhile, almost all transactions are still in cash, no one has a credit card and money is kept under the bed.Reopening the island to the capitalist world has also brought growing inequality. In the early 1990s, when I started returning to Cuba, I noticed dark curtains hiding the goods in tourist shops to prevent Cubans from desiring things they couldn\u2019t afford. Now, everything is in plain view \u2014 including Chanel.In the past, emigration was a way to escape. But countries around the world are closing their borders, and the United States no longer offers Cubans a fast route to citizenship.Young Cubans now dream not of emigrating but of traveling.The grandson of my Afro-Cuban childhood nanny wants to visit Guant\u00e1namo, where his father is from. Yet earning the equivalent of $12 a month, he finds even saving for a bus fare from Havana to Guant\u00e1namo, about 600 miles, to be prohibitively expensive.His brother-in-law chimed in during our conversation, \u201cMy dream is to travel the world and then return to Cuba.\u201d He laughed, yet there was no sense he yearned for political change. \u201cCuba doesn\u2019t have gangs or guns. It\u2019s a safe country.\u201dBut Cuba is on an uncertain threshold as it moves into a post-Castro future. While it can be proud of constitutional reforms that include proposing to legalize gay marriage, a primal demographic issue haunts the country.Birthrates in Cuba have dropped alarmingly, and the population is the oldest in all of Latin America. A woman I know used to say, \u201cI\u2019d never bear a child for Fidel Castro.\u201d Others say it is economic conditions, particularly a severe housing shortage, that has made the decision to have children especially complex.Our former neighbors in Havana still live in the same modest two-bedroom apartment. Their granddaughter has slept all her life in the same bedroom with them, her now 90-year-old grandparents, who are walking advertisements for Cuba\u2019s excellent health care, while her parents occupy the other bedroom. She\u2019s 37 and her boyfriend of more than a decade has lived in his grandparents\u2019 apartment his whole life.\u201cWe can\u2019t get married because we don\u2019t have anywhere to live,\u201d she told me. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have children. I\u2019m getting old. Anyway, we don\u2019t earn enough to support a child.\u201dI imagined what her daughter might look like, wearing the school uniform and red kerchief of a young pioneer, and I remembered the uniform my mother kept, clinging to the memory of my interrupted childhood in Cuba.Her grandmother was, in Cuban grandmotherly fashion, listening in. Years ago she sold her wedding ring to buy an electric fan, but she lives without regrets. Smiling at her granddaughter, she said, \u201cYou never know what might happen. Aqu\u00ed vivimos de la esperanza.\u201dHere we live from hope.I know her granddaughter no longer believes in utopian dreams of what might be. She is determined to live her life in the present, like other Cubans of the new generation.But she kindly smiled back at her grandmother and said, \u201cI know, abuela.\u201dRuth Behar, a professor of anthropology at the University of Michigan, is the author of \u201cLucky Broken Girl,\u201d a novel for young readers, and \u201cEverything I Kept,\u201d a book of poems.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Last-Minute Shoppers Increasingly Trust Only Amazon to Deliver", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 Olivia Zimmermann started her holiday shopping early this year, buying a Bluetooth speaker from Best Buy for her sister. It was supposed to arrive by Dec. 10, two weeks before Christmas.The speaker never showed up \u2014 and the post office said it had delivered the package to a different town. Best Buy apologized and offered to reship it. But Ms. Zimmermann, who works in marketing in Chicago, was over it.\u201cI just want a refund,\u201d she told the retailer, and then added: \u201cAt this point, I have already ordered from Amazon because I know for a fact it will be here when they say it will.\u201dAmazon is far and away the leader in e-commerce, outpacing competitors like Walmart, Target and eBay. But its dominance is never more pronounced than in the nail-biter last-minute sprint before Christmas.The company, based in Seattle, has had a two-decade-long obsession with shrinking the time from click to doorstep. It has built warehouses in more than 30 states and a sophisticated web of delivery methods, giving it a logistical advantage.Amazon has used that edge to lead people to expect near instant gratification that, for a while, only it could deliver. The company built trust in its delivery speed with its Prime membership, which costs $119 a year and includes two-day shipping. This year, in the days leading up to Christmas, Amazon\u2019s share of online sales will increase by almost 50 percent \u2014 to about half of all digital sales \u2014 while most rivals fade, according to the market research firm Rakuten Intelligence.\u201cAmazon\u2019s ability to fulfill more quickly and effectively than competitors has been a key differentiator back to the earliest days,\u201d said Kenneth Cassar, an analyst with Rakuten Intelligence, which is an independent subsidiary of the Japanese e-retailer Rakuten.Traditional retailers still enjoy strong sales when the holiday season begins around Thanksgiving. They advertise widely, luring shoppers with doorbuster deals. The promotions also drive sales to their websites instead of Amazon. Around Thanksgiving, Amazon\u2019s share of online sales can dip to as low as 20 percent in the United States, according to Rakuten.But as November turns to December, and then into Christmas crunchtime, shoppers\u2019 preferences change. Last year, Walmart and Target had their busiest online traffic of the month on Dec. 10. Amazon\u2019s was eight days later, on Dec. 18, according to an analysis by Griffin Carlborg, a researcher at the digital intelligence firm Gartner L2.Amazon\u2019s share of e-commerce sales tends to drop around Thanksgiving, and usually peaks about one week before Christmas \u2014 just enough time for packages to be delivered before the holiday. Amazon\u2019s quick delivery times may contribute to its popularity at Christmastime.Share of all e-commerce salesDec. 16Dec. 16Dec. 1650%20162017201840Amazon30CHRISTMASCHRISTMASCYBERMONDAYCYBERMONDAYCYBERMONDAY20THANKSGIVINGTHANKSGIVINGTHANKSGIVING10Best BuyTargetWalmart0CostcoNOV.DEC.NOV.DEC.NOV.DEC.Average delivery time from click to doorWEEK OF DEC. 2, 2018Amazon3.4daysCostco3.6Best Buy4.6Target4.6Walmart5.5Share of all e-commerce salesDec. 16Dec. 16Dec. 1620162017201850%40Amazon30CHRISTMASCHRISTMASCYBERMONDAYCYBERMONDAYCYBERMONDAY20THANKSGIVINGTHANKSGIVINGTHANKSGIVING10Best BuyTargetWalmart0CostcoNOV.DEC.NOV.DEC.NOV.DEC.Average delivery time from click to doorWEEK OF DEC. 2, 2018Amazon3.4daysCostco3.6Best Buy4.6Target4.6Walmart5.5Share of all e-commerce salesDec. 16Dec. 1650%2017201840Amazon30CHRISTMASCYBERMONDAYCYBERMONDAY20THANKSGIVINGTHANKSGIVINGBest Buy10TargetWalmartCostco0NOV.DEC.NOV.DEC.Average delivery time from click to doorWEEK OF DEC. 2, 2018Amazon3.4daysCostco3.6Best Buy4.6Target4.6Walmart5.5Share of all e-commerce salesDec. 16Dec. 1650%20172018CHRISTMAS40Amazon3020THANKSGIVINGTHANKSGIVINGBest Buy10TargetWalmart0CostcoNOV.DEC.NOV.DEC.Average delivery time from click to doorWEEK OF DEC. 2, 2018Amazon3.4Costco3.6Best Buy4.6Target4.6Walmart5.5Note: E-commerce includes all companies with the exception of Amazon Fresh, Ebay, Etsy, Instacart and Tesla.By: The New York Times | Source: Rakuten Intelligence\u201cAmazon has just built up its reputation around rapid fulfillment incredibly well,\u201d Mr. Carlborg said. \u201cCustomers really trust Amazon\u2019s fulfillment offerings.\u201dThose shoppers include Carissa Vinovskis, 26, who puts in 12-hour days researching diabetes at Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado. She used to shop for Christmas gifts in stores, but as she got busy with graduate school and later her job, she had less time and patience.Panic set in fast in the middle of this month when Ms. Vinovskis realized she had just six days to get presents before visiting her parents. She found a few cute things on Etsy \u2014 \u201cbeautiful, handcrafted gifts,\u201d she said \u2014 and then realized they would take about four weeks to arrive.\u201cI was like, welp, Amazon Prime it is!\u201d she said.An Amazon spokeswoman pointed to a statement in which the vice president who runs Prime, Cem Sibay, said, \u201cWe keep working to add faster and even more convenient delivery options.\u201dMr. Bezos saw that quick delivery could change how people buy things. Price and selection have always been important in retailing, but delivery would surpass store location as another critical factor.In 2005, Amazon began offering free two-day shipping for Prime members, which Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimates covers more than two-thirds of households in the United States. Almost a decade later, it started Prime Now, which delivers goods in as little as an hour in 30 cities.Amazon now has over 110 fulfillment centers in North America, more than 250,000 warehouse employees and dozens of its own planes. It is setting up warehouses that hold tens of millions of items closer to major cities, letting it offer free same-day and one-day shipping on more products.These traditional retailers are leveraging their physical stores \u2014 a key advantage they have over Amazon \u2014 and providing ways for people to order online and pick up in person. That is particularly powerful in the final days before Christmas, when shoppers return to stores.For some Walmart purchases, customers don\u2019t need to leave their car to get their order \u2014 an employee will drop it into their trunk. Best Buy said more than 40 percent of its online revenue is from orders that are now picked up in stores. And on Christmas Eve, people can order products online from store inventory as late as 5 p.m. and pick them up just an hour later.Marshal Cohen, who advises retailers for the NPD Group, a market research firm, said three years ago, retailers rushed to match Amazon, offering free two-day shipping until just before Christmas \u2014 but didn\u2019t have their delivery partners sufficiently prepared for the rush.\u201cThey just clogged the system so badly and really disappointed a lot of consumers,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. \u201cThat memory was pretty strong in a lot of consumers\u2019 minds when it comes to thinking about shopping online.\u201dAmazon is faster than every major competitor, though other retailers are speeding up. In 2016, Old Navy, which is owned by Gap, took about 10 days to deliver a package ordered during the week after Thanksgiving, Rakuten data shows. This year its packages showed up about three days faster. Walmart cut its delivery time from more than a week to six days over the same period. And Best Buy said 80 percent of its small packages now arrive in two days or under.(Rakuten\u2019s data excludes eBay and Etsy because the formats of their electronic receipts are harder to track.)Yet most retailers still have to work to win people\u2019s trust. Jessica Palazzo, who runs after-school programs near Hartford, Conn., bought her mother pajamas from Old Navy two years ago that were guaranteed to arrive before Christmas, but which didn\u2019t appear until January. Old Navy offered her 10 percent off her next order.This year on Black Friday, she put a pair of Gap pajamas into her online shopping cart \u2014 but then had a change of heart.\u201cThat\u2019s embarrassing if you come on Christmas and have nothing for somebody,\u201d Ms. Palazzo said. She ended up buying running socks and a running ear warmer for her mother from Amazon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: \u2018The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u2019 Takes Its Time, as Fast as It Can", "Date": "2018-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe show\u2019s delightful, exhausting spirit is turbocharged by the dialogue of the creator, Amy Sherman-Palladino, and embodied by its protagonist, Midge (Rachel Brosnahan), an uptown Manhattan housewife who launches a secret career as a comedian after her marriage falls apart. Brosnahan, infectiously brassy and confident, takes the scripts\u2019 energy, torques it, and sends it careening like a top.But also like a top, the first half of the new season, arriving in full Wednesday, covers a lot of ground while spinning back, narratively, to where it\u2019s already been.The art direction reflects the show\u2019s sensibility. The series\u2019s personal conflicts are well-grounded, but the details \u2014 the upscale Jewish New York milieu, the fashions, the repartee \u2014 are idealized. (As is parenthood; single mom Midge benefits from a wealth of convenient child care.) \u201cMrs. Maisel\u201d takes place less in the 1950s than in a 2018 idea of a 1950s movie\u2019s idea of the 1950s.Fortunately, \u201cMrs. Maisel\u201d details its characters as precisely as its scenery. Alex Borstein owns the screen as Midge\u2019s wrecking-ball manager, Susie; Shalhoub finds both comedy and depth in the scatterbrained academic Abe. Midge\u2019s ex, Joel (Michael Zegen), becomes more interesting as he tries to build a life without Midge, while Zachary Levi (\u201cChuck\u201d), as a new love interest, adapts to the show\u2019s conversational pace as if nimbly leaping on a moving train.But Midge\u2019s larger arc often seems stalled. The season repeats many of the conflicts of the first \u2014 just how over Midge\u2019s marriage really is, just how willing she is to change her comfortable life. There is a lot of movement here, but not necessarily a lot of progress.There is still comedy; as in Season 1, most episodes manage to get Midge on stage for a standup set. (In Paris, that takes place in a drag club, with a French patron providing machine-gun translation.) But even as she fights to get placed in the prestigious, male-dominated Midtown comedy clubs, you get the sense that this is still half a hobby for her; she seems more concerned about getting back on the makeup counter at her department-store day job.It\u2019s not clear how much of this is Midge not being committed to a future as a comedian \u2014 which would mean coming clean to her family and maybe losing that art-directed good life \u2014 and how much is the series itself not knowing how to move on with her story, because it enjoys the status quo (a common second-season issue). This in turn makes it hard to know just what the stakes are: How badly does Midge need to be a comic?Some of the season\u2019s best early scenes come when Susie presses this point with her whirligig client. When Midge announces that she\u2019s vacationing in the Catskills for two months, missing a summer\u2019s worth of gigs, Susie is aghast.For Susie, the comedy biz isn\u2019t a lark; it\u2019s the difference between paying the bills and being on the street, and the contrast between her and her privileged client is the splash of cold water this show sometimes needs. When Midge describes a day at her summer resort, Susie asks, \u201cWhat are you, the lost Gabor sister?\u201dAmazon showed critics five episodes out of 10, and by the season\u2019s midpoint, it seems as if Midge may be at a juncture where she has to decide how serious she is. In the fifth episode, she sits down with her friend and consigliere, Lenny Bruce (Luke Kirby), who asks her, \u201cDo you really think you can go back to making Jell-O molds again?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "10 Classic Christmas Movies That Our Critics Didn\u2019t See Coming", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrom as far back as Frank Capra\u2019s \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life,\u201d which struggled to find its footing in the end-of-the-year glut of late December 1946, predicting the canon of Christmas movie future has never been easy. Some of today\u2019s favorites had to survive a critical drubbing, or a ho-hum box office. Others needed a push from cable TV. And still others just didn\u2019t seem like holiday movies, becoming classics almost accidentally thanks to reclassification or cult followings.The holidays have given us an occasion to dig through the archives to see if New York Times critics were on the right side of history when they first reviewed these films, or if they missed an annual tradition in the making. Here\u2019s a sample of 10 that are currently available to stream \u2014 some established favorites, others quirky upstarts \u2014 along with excerpts from what our critics first thought of them and links to their full reviews.Frank Capra\u2019s classic tear-jerker about Christmas Eve as a dark night of the soul has been a Yuletide standard-bearer for so long that it\u2019s easy to forget what a ho-hum reception it got at the time. A best picture nomination was the sole consolation prize for a film about a small-town family man (James Stewart) that neither critics nor audiences fully embraced until the mid-1970s, when its revival as an annual television staple commenced. Sentiments like these, from Bosley Crowther\u2019s review, were common:Indeed, the weakness of this picture, from this reviewer\u2019s point of view, is the sentimentality of it \u2014 its illusory concept of life. Mr. Capra\u2019s nice people are charming, his small town is a quite beguiling place and his pattern for solving problems is most optimistic and facile. But somehow they all resemble theatrical attitudes rather than average realities. And Mr. Capra\u2019s \u201cturkey dinners\u201d philosophy, while emotionally gratifying, doesn\u2019t fill the hungry paunch.Irving Berlin won an Oscar for the song \u201cWhite Christmas,\u201d but not for the movie \u201cWhite Christmas,\u201d which wasn\u2019t produced until a decade after \u201cHoliday Inn,\u201d the Bing Crosby-Fred Astaire musical in which the song first appeared. Christmas was but one of the occasions for mirth in \u201cHoliday Inn,\u201d but here it is the VistaVision payoff to the team-up of two different song-and-dance acts. Crowther was unimpressed:\u201cThe colors on the big screen are rich and luminous, the images are clear and sharp, and rapid movements are got without blurring \u2014 or very little \u2014 such as sometimes is seen on other large screens. Director Michael Curtiz has made his picture look good. It is too bad that it doesn\u2019t hit the eardrums and the funny bone with equal force.\u201dBefore taking a decidedly warmer view of the holiday season with \u201cA Christmas Story,\u201d the director Bob Clark offered this nasty piece of counterprogramming, a proto-\u201cHalloween\u201d slasher film with big scares and boozy wit, much of it coming from Margot Kidder. \u201cBlack Christmas\u201d proved to be vastly influential, particularly in its use of first-person camera, but contemporaneous reviews, like A.H. Weiler\u2019s, were dismissive:This moody depiction of the Christmas slayings of university sorority sisters and their housemother, among others, is as murky as the script, which dotes largely on obscenities that are no more pointed than the violence, dull direction and pedestrian performances.Clark\u2019s nostalgia-soaked comedy about a put-upon nine-year-old (Peter Billingsley) in the 1940s and his disaster-prone Midwestern family owes its popularity to Turner broadcasting, which turned a modest hit into a phenomenon by airing it relentlessly on TBS and TNT. Cherished details like the \u201cLittle Orphan Annie\u201d decoder ring, a triple-dog dare on the schoolyard and the Red Ryder Carbine Action 200-shot Range Model air rifle were lost on Vincent Canby at the time:There are a number of small, unexpectedly funny moments in \u201cA Christmas Story,\u201d but you have to possess the stamina of a pearl diver to find them.Chaos and malevolence come to a Capra-esque small town in Joe Dante\u2019s anarchic comedy about an exotic pet from Chinatown that turns out to be a troublemaking Christmas present. Dante\u2019s Looney Tunes-style upending of its wholesome holiday setting pushed its PG rating far enough to help trigger the development of PG-13, and the kiddie-movie violence left Canby shaken:[Dante and the screenwriter Chris Columbus] attack their young audience as mercilessly as the creatures attack the characters. One minute they\u2019re fondly recalling Frank Capra\u2019s sentimental classic, \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life,\u201d and the next minute they\u2019re subjecting this Capraesque Smalltown, U.S.A., to a devastation that makes the original \u2018Invasion of the Body Snatchers\u2019 look benign.Charles Dickens\u2019s \u201cA Christmas Carol\u201d had been adapted so many times to heartwarming effect \u2014 as drama, in the Reginald Owen and Alastair Sim standards from 1938 and 1951; as a musical, with Albert Finney in 1970; and with Muppets in 1992 \u2014 that it needed Bill Murray to drop a few coals in the stocking. The film\u2019s spiked nog of cynicism and sentimentality wasn\u2019t easy for some to swallow, including Canby:As Frank Cross, the ratings-mad program chief of the IBC television network, Mr. Murray\u2019s contemporary Scrooge is a joy as long as he\u2019s making life miserable for everyone around him. When, finally, Frank sees the error of his ways, the movie succumbs to its heart of jelly.The question of whether \u201cDie Hard\u201d is a true Christmas movie, rather than merely the template for the last 30 years of action cinema, has been a perennial debate for a long time now. But in 1988, critics like Caryn James were mostly coming to terms with its blockbuster excess:Partly an interracial buddy movie, partly the sentimental tale of a ruptured marriage, the film is largely a special-effects carnival full of machine-gun fire, roaring helicopters and an exploding tank. It also has a villain fresh from the Royal Shakespeare Company, a thug from the Bolshoi Ballet and a hero who carries with him the smirks and wisecracks that helped make \u2018Moonlighting\u2019 a television hit. The strange thing is, it works: \u2018Die Hard\u2019 is exceedingly stupid, but escapist fun.Fatigue is in the air. This third look at the quintessentially middle-American Griswold family, led by Clark (Mr. Chase) and the very patient Ellen (Beverly D\u2019Angelo) is only a weary shadow of the original \u2018National Lampoon\u2019s Vacation,\u2019 which found a lot to laugh at as it followed the dopey paterfamilias Clark and his quarrelsome brood on a hellish cross-country journey in their station wagon.Christmas seems like the only occasion big enough to accommodate this oversized mistletoe from Richard Curtis, the screenwriter of \u201cFour Weddings and a Funeral\u201d and \u201cNotting Hill,\u201d who combines about half a dozen rom-coms into one mega-rom-com. The film\u2019s too-muchness is an annual indulgence for fans, but A.O. Scott, in one of his most blistering reviews, is not one of them:A romantic comedy swollen to the length of an Oscar-trawling epic \u2014 nearly two and a quarter hours of cheekiness, diffidence and high-tone smirking \u2014 it is more like a record label\u2019s greatest-hits compilation or a \u201cvery special\u201d sitcom clip-reel show than an actual movie.Starting with his breakthrough script for \u201cLethal Weapon,\u201d Shane Black has set six of his films over Christmas in Los Angeles, but \u201cKiss Kiss Bang Bang,\u201d his directorial debut, is especially keen about finding evidence of the holiday in a city where it isn\u2019t so obvious. This neo-noir buddy picture about a thief posing as an actor (Robert Downey Jr.) who joins forces with a private eye (Val Kilmer) on a murder case is Yuletide fun for smart-alecks, but not for A.O. Scott:I don\u2019t think \u201cKiss Kiss, Bang Bang\u201d is an altogether bad movie. It\u2019s just a movie with no particular reason for existing, a flashy, trifling throwaway whose surface cleverness masks a self-infatuated credulity.An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of the character played by Chevy Chase in \u201cNational Lampoon\u2019s Christmas Vacation.\u201d He is Clark Griswold, not Griswald. An earlier version of this article also misspelled the surname of an actor. He is Alastair Sim, not Sims.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Declare the Strand Bookstore a City Landmark? No Thanks, the Strand Says", "Date": "2018-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySince it opened in 1927, the Strand bookstore has managed to survive by beating back the many challenges \u2014 soaring rents, book superstores, Amazon, e-books \u2014 that have doomed scores of independent bookshops in Manhattan.With its \u201c18 Miles of Books\u201d slogan, film appearances and celebrity customers, the bibliophile\u2019s haven has become a cultural landmark.Now New York City wants to make it official by declaring the Strand\u2019s building, at the corner of Broadway and 12th Street in Greenwich Village, a city landmark.There\u2019s only one problem: The Strand does not want the designation.Nancy Bass Wyden, who owns the Strand and its building at 826 Broadway, said landmarking could deal a death blow to the business her family has owned for 91 years, one of the largest book stores in the world.Like many building owners in New York, Ms. Wyden argues that the increased restrictions and regulations required of landmarked buildings can be cumbersome and drive up renovation and maintenance costs.\u201cBy landmarking the Strand, you can also destroy a piece of New York history,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re operating on very thin margins here, and this would just cost us a lot more, with this landmarking, and be a lot more hassle.\u201dThat the Strand could be threatened by its own preservation seems like a plot twist worthy of one of its books, she said: The very agency entrusted with preserving the city\u2019s treasures is endangering one of them.\u201cThe richest man in America, who\u2019s a direct competitor, has just been handed $3 billion in subsidies. I\u2019m not asking for money or a tax rebate,\u201d Ms. Wyden said. \u201cJust leave me alone.\u201dThe commission\u2019s case for landmarking the 1902 building calls the Strand \u201ca center of literary life in Lower Manhattan\u201d and \u201can internationally recognized bookstore and destination.\u201d The commission\u2019s designation report also cites the building\u2019s Renaissance Revival facade and its prominent architect, William H. Birkmire.The building is one of seven in the area being considered for landmarking. Zodet Negron, a spokeswoman for the commission, described the seven structures as \u201cvery intact and architecturally significant buildings that represent an important era in the commercial development of the area south of Union Square.\u201dWhile most buildings considered by the landmarks commission wind up getting approved, Ms. Negron said, \u201cIt is not a given, and the public hearing, a critical part of the process, is an opportunity for the commission to hear other opinions.\u201dOwners of buildings with landmark status are in many cases barred from using plans, materials and even paint colors that vary from the original design without the commission\u2019s approval.Of the many prominent writers who frequent the Strand, several have sided with Ms. Wyden, including Art Spiegelman, Fran Lebowitz and Gary Shteyngart, who plans on speaking at Tuesday\u2019s hearing.Ms. Lebowitz said she supported Ms. Wyden partly because \u201cI could never not be on the side of a bookstore.\u201d\u201cUsually I\u2019m on the side of the preservationists, but in this case, I agree with Nancy, because I know the Strand is a store, but it\u2019s really a cultural institution that\u2019s essential to the city,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd to put that\u201d \u2014 meaning, landmark restrictions \u2014 \u201con top of a bookstore is just not fair.\u201dBut Peg Breen, the president of the New York Landmarks Conservancy, an advocacy group, said she believed the Strand\u2019s concerns were unfounded.\u201cNo one is doing this to hurt the Strand, or add difficulties,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re doing it to honor the building.\u201dMs. Breen wants more buildings in the area to be landmarked, and hopes that designating the Strand\u2019s building and the other six would pave the way, especially as a $250 million, 21-story tech training center is being developed near the Strand.Worried that the project will ignite a wave of local development, preservationists have called for the landmarking of roughly 200 buildings south of Union Square.Ms. Wyden \u2014 who is married to Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, whom she met at the similarly renowned Powell\u2019s book store in Portland \u2014 is a third-generation owner of the Strand, which stocks roughly 2.5 million used, rare and new books and employs 230 people.The family moved the Strand to its current location in 1957 and rented space for decades before buying the building in 1996 for $8.2 million to ensure survival amid rising rents, Ms. Wyden said. The city assessed the building\u2019s value at over $31 million in January.Though landmark designation is often used to protect buildings from demolition or significant alteration, Ms. Wyden said she has no intention of selling to a developer, and is already restricted by existing zoning from further developing the building.Of the building\u2019s 11 floors, five are occupied by the Strand\u2019s retail and office operations, with the other floors rented by business tenants, Ms. Wyden said.While she would not divulge the bookstore\u2019s finances, she said that she could make more money renting out the Strand\u2019s five floors, but she loves the family business too much.She accused city officials of trying to hurry the landmarking process, leaving her little time to prepare a defense, especially during the holiday rush.\u201cIt\u2019s our busiest time of year, and we should be focused on customers and Christmas, which is where we make our most money,\u201d Ms. Wyden said. \u201cBut they have no sympathy for that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sister Wendy Beckett, Nun Who Became a BBC Star, Dies at 88", "Date": "2018-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySister Wendy Beckett, a Roman Catholic nun who interrupted a cloistered life of prayer in England in 1991 and soared to international stardom with lyrical BBC documentaries that made her one of the most improbable art critics in television history, died on Wednesday in the village of East Harling, England. She was 88.Her death was confirmed by the Carmelite Monastery in Quidenham, England, where she had lived in a trailer for decades, though not as a member of the Carmelite order.Bending backward in her black habit in the Vatican\u2019s Sistine Chapel, gazing up through large eyeglasses at Michelangelo\u2019s \u201cThe Creation of Adam,\u201d Sister Wendy spoke with a storyteller\u2019s wonder at the solemn, sensuous moment on the ceiling as two fingertips near the touch that begat the creation of life.\u201cAdam\u2019s sprawled there in his naked male glory, but he\u2019s not alive,\u201d she told viewers in 1996. \u201cAll he can do is lift up a flaccid finger, and out of the clouds whirls down the God of Power. In his great flying cloak there\u2019s a world. Whether that\u2019s Eve or not, there\u2019s a human face there looking straight at Adam with the eyes daring him to respond to the challenge. And God\u2019s finger touches that of Man.\u201dIt was a magical moment of television, too. Sister Wendy was small and stooped, with a plain face, buck teeth and a slight speech impediment that rendered R\u2019s as W\u2019s. But her insightful, unscripted commentaries \u2014 a blend of history, criticism and observations on Leonardo da Vinci, van Gogh, Botticelli, Rembrandt, Monet and other Western masters \u2014 connected emotionally with millions in Britain and America.By 1997, as she marked 50 years as a nun, the Oxford-educated Sister Wendy had made three television series, the most successful BBC arts programs since \u201cCivilisation,\u201d the art historian Kenneth Clark\u2019s landmark 1969 documentaries. She had also written 15 books on art and religion, and was a celebrity on both sides of the Atlantic, featured in articles and mobbed by fans.She had acquired all the star trappings but a wardrobe adviser \u2014 a publicist, an agent to negotiate fees and contracts, promotional interviews with Charlie Rose and Bill Moyers, and visits with dignitaries like Prime Minister John Major at 10 Downing Street and Pope John Paul II, who commended her for broadcasting a positive image of the church.For all her success, she remained a nun with commitments to prayer, solitude (when possible) and vows of poverty. She assigned all her earnings to a Carmelite order that had sheltered her for decades, and she attended Mass daily, even when traveling.Until she was 61, she had been a model of worldly renunciation: a hermit living in a windowless trailer on the grounds of the Carmelite Monastery in East Anglia, subsisting mainly on skim milk and rarely speaking to anyone. She prayed seven hours a day and went out only to morning Mass or to a mobile library van for books.In her passion for self-denial, she had not seen a movie since 1945, visited a museum or even seen a great painting, only reproductions in books. Still, she was spellbound by art: She read about it voraciously, and began writing about it. Her first book, \u201cContemporary Women Artists,\u201d was published in 1988.In 1991, a BBC producer, Nicholas Rossiter, persuaded her to do a stand-up documentary about Britain\u2019s National Gallery, talking about its paintings. It seemed to her a modest venture. \u201cThere was no big \u2018Should I give up the caravan to do television?\u2019 or \u2018Am I spoiling my hermit life?\u2019 \u201d she recalled in her book \u201cSister Wendy on Prayer\u201d (2006). \u201cI really didn\u2019t think it was anything. I thought it was just a weekend here or there.\u201dShe was a hit, a natural if eccentric personality with a gift for drama that made art accessible to the general public. Following up in 1992, the BBC produced the six-part \u201cSister Wendy\u2019s Odyssey,\u201d with a wider focus on museums across England and Scotland. It drew 3.5 million viewers, and it secured her stardom.She was ambivalent about celebrity. She liked \u201cwonderful sweet people\u201d who thanked her for helping them understand paintings, she told The New York Times in 1997. But, she added: \u201cNothing is more humiliating than being on television. You make such a fool of yourself.\u201dSome art critics agreed, calling her amateurish. But audiences were captivated by her richly human tales, which brought art to life. At the British Museum, standing beside a Greek wine jar painted 2,500 years ago, she embroidered the portrayal of Achilles slaying Penthesilea, the Amazon queen, at the fall of Troy.\u201cAs he drove his spear through her throat,\u201d she said, \u201ctheir eyes met, and he saw how young she was and how lovely and brave. He fell in love \u2014 but he killed her.\u201dFor a 10-part 1994 BBC series, \u201cSister Wendy\u2019s Grand Tour,\u201d she crossed Europe and for the first time swooned over Matisse and C\u00e9zanne at the Louvre in Paris, Michelangelo\u2019s Piet\u00e0 in Rome, the canvases of Rembrandt and van Gogh in Amsterdam, and the art treasures of Madrid, Florence, Venice and Berlin.Her most ambitious series, \u201cSister Wendy\u2019s Story of Painting,\u201d took her 30,000 miles through Europe, the Middle East and the United States, to survey works ranging from prehistoric cave paintings in France to the masterpieces of Picasso and the Pop Art of Andy Warhol. Filmed in 100 days, the series was broadcast in Britain by the BBC in 1996 and in the United States by PBS in 1997.Viewers were astonished and delighted, especially by some of her uninhibited expressions of rapture. Of a postcoital self-portrait by Sir Stanley Spencer with Patricia Preece, Sister Wendy confessed, \u201cI love all those glistening strands of hair, and her pubic hair is so soft and fluffy.\u201dIt was a sensation, widely quoted. Frank Bruni, in The Times, said, \u201cThe incongruity of such passionate and often sensuous statements coming from a hunched, bespectacled, 67-year-old nun is the secret to much of Sister Wendy\u2019s charm and success.\u201dWendy Mary Beckett was born in Johannesburg on Feb. 25, 1930, to Aubrey and Dorothy (Sheehan) Beckett. Her father was a physician. She is survived by a brother, Wendell.From an early age she intended to become a nun, and at 16 she joined the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur, a teaching order, as Sister Michael of St. Peter. She became Sister Wendy after Vatican reforms relaxed formalities.She studied literature at Oxford in the early 1950s, living in a convent and observing its strict code of silence for four years. She graduated at the top of her class. Returning to South Africa, she taught for 15 years at a Cape Town convent and later lectured at Johannesburg\u2019s University of Witwatersrand.After suffering three grand mal seizures and learning that she had a form of epilepsy, she received Vatican consent to give up teaching for a life of solitude. In 1970, she returned to England and moved into the trailer at the Carmelite Monastery.Sister Wendy eventually wrote some 25 books, including collections of poetry and meditations, and made a dozen documentaries, many released on DVD. She always returned to the austere seclusion that was her home for nearly a half-century, although her trailer was upgraded in 1994.\u201cThe sisters worried about the lack of insulation, so they put up a small mobile home, which has a lavatory, bathroom and light fittings,\u201d she told The Telegraph of London in 2010. \u201cI have an electric kettle, fridge, warming oven and night storage heater, so my life is as comfortable as it needs to be.\u201dPalko Karasz contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}

Molly kept me buoyed by her unwavering faith in my vision for this book.\u201dMs. Stern is widely regarded within the publishing world for having an eye for both best-selling commercial fiction and award-winning literary fiction and nonfiction. Under her direction at Crown, the company published blockbusters like Gillian Flynn\u2019s \u201cGone Girl,\u201d Andy Weir\u2019s \u201cThe Martian\u201d and Ernest Cline\u2019s \u201cReady Player One,\u201d as well as acclaimed nonfiction by best-selling authors such as Susan Cain, Erik Larson and Matthew Desmond, who won the Pulitzer Prize for \u201cEvicted.\u201d Ms. Stern, who realized the book-selling power of social media very early, asked Sarah Jessica Parker to start an imprint at Hogarth, which is part of Crown.Following the announced exit of Maya Mavjee, Crown\u2019s president and publisher, who will leave the company at the end of the year, Ms. Stern is the most prominent executive to leave as a result of the reorganization.David Drake, Crown\u2019s executive vice president and deputy publisher, will replace Ms. Stern.

Last month, Hachette Book Group announced that Hachette Books would move into the Perseus division, and that Hachette Books\u2019 publisher, Mauro DiPreta, would be leaving the company.When Penguin Random House announced the merger of Crown and Random House in October, many authors and agents wondered what would become of each division\u2019s many imprints, which include Hogarth, Tim Duggan Books, Broadway Books, Ballantine Bantam Dell, Delacorte Press and Spiegel & Grau.In a company memo, Madeline McIntosh, the chief executive of Penguin Random House U.S., assured employees that Crown and Random House \u201cwill retain their distinct editorial identities.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018A Christmas Story\u2019 (1983) Review", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMany of the holiday movies we consider classics or cult favorites today did not seem destined for such glory when we first reviewed them. Some we panned. Others were flops. Others just weren\u2019t particularly holiday-focused.There are a number of small, unexpectedly funny moments in \u201cA Christmas Story,\u201d but you have to possess the stamina of a pearl diver to find them.The film, which opens today at the Guild and other theaters, is about growing up in the early 1940\u2019s in a middle-size city in Indiana. In particular it\u2019s about 9-year-old Ralphie Parker (Peter Billingsley) who, more than anything else in the world, wants to own a genuine Red Ryder air rifle, one that comes complete with a shockproof compass and a sundial set into its stock.\u201cA Christmas Story\u201d tells how Ralphie fares in his campaign to win such a Christmas present from his father and mother (Darren McGavin and Melinda Dillon) and a good deal of what it was like to be young in pre- World War II Indiana.Just about everything that is good about \u201cA Christmas Story\u201d can be attributed to Jean Shepherd, the novelist and radio-television humorist who wrote the book \u201cIn God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash,\u201d from which the screenplay was adapted by him, by his wife, Leigh Brown, and by Bob Clark, the director. The best thing to be said about Mr. Clark as a director is that he admires Mr. Shepherd\u2019s wildly hyperbolic humor, though he doesn\u2019t have much of a gift for translating it to film.Mr. Shepherd is a most engaging raconteur who transforms small stories of everyday life into tall tales of fantastic adventure. In his words, an after-school encounter between Ralphie and a neighborhood bully named Scot Farkus becomes a collision of Olympian deities. Mr. Shepherd himself reads the sometimes very funny voice-over commentaries on the screen action and, you may be sure, is responsible for the bits and pieces of 1940s trivia we see. These include the sight of Ralphie\u2019s younger brother so bundled up in a pre-miracle-fabric snowsuit that he can\u2019t even move his arms. Those were the days.Mr. Clark, the director of \u201cPorky\u2019s\u201d and \u201cTribute,\u201d does not have a light touch. However, his heavy touch is not quite the same thing as Mr. Shepherd\u2019s habit of finding humor through the exaggeration of language. The movie\u2019s big comic pieces tend only to be exceedingly busy. Though Mr. Billingsley, Mr. Gavin, Miss Dillon and the actress who plays Ralphie\u2019s school teacher (Tedde Moore) are all very able, they are less funny than actors in a television situation comedy that one has chosen to watch with the sound turned off.Most of the period details are good and accurate. However, I\u2019m not at all sure that the curriculum at the Warren G. Harding Public School, which Ralphie attends, would require that 9-year-olds read \u201cSilas Marner.\u201d\u201cA Christmas Story,\u201d which has been rated PG (\u201cparental guidance suggested\u201d), contains some vulgar language, though not one particular word that Mr. Shepherd, talking on the soundtrack, describes as \u201cthe queen-mother of dirty words.\u201d Running time: 98 minutes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Drag Queens on the Screen: There to Prove a Woman\u2019s Authenticity", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookAs gender norms become more elastic, drag has burst like a glitter cannon into the mainstream. Think \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d on TV or \u201cHedwig and the Angry Inch\u201d on Broadway. Drag queens are appearing more frequently onscreen to \u201cpull the wig down from the shelf,\u201d as Hedwig might put it.But in three recent films and shows \u2014 \u201cA Star Is Born,\u201d \u201cDumplin\u2019\u201d and \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d \u2014 drag queens play second fiddle to the straight women who take center stage. They prod these films and shows, which are all about performers and performances, to work out what \u201creal\u201d and \u201cauthentic\u201d mean, sometimes at the cost of the drag stars.The movie\u2019s distinction is clear: what the drag queens do is artifice, predicated on a kind of fakery. What Ally does is real, daring to look the audience in the eye as she pauses her performance of \u201cLa Vie en Rose\u201d to gaze at Jackson, who gazes at her, because, unlike the other women performing that night, she has truth in her.It\u2019s that truth that Jackson wants to foster. Ally can accentuate qualities of femininity and female aesthetics for her drag persona, but Jackson sees her talent in spite of the drag, not the drag as an augmentation of her talent. Fittingly, then, the pop star Ally will eventually become is just another kind of drag queen, all about flashy costumes (orange hair, prismatic colors), her modified persona reliant on what the film sees as soulless excess. While \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d is fond of its drag queens, it ultimately condescends to them. For Jackson, and for the film, the artifice of drag (or pop stardom) is an obstacle to authenticity, not another path to it.Conversely, the drag queens in the Netflix movie \u201cDumplin\u2019\u201d encourage Willowdean \u201cDumplin\u2019\u201d Dickson (Danielle Macdonald) to use the illusion of drag as a way to express her true self. Willowdean is an alienated, overweight high school student and Dolly Parton fan whose mother\u2019s former glories as a pageant queen have dogged her all her life. Spurred by the discovery that her late aunt almost competed for the crown but decided not to, Willowdean signs up for the pageant that made her mother (Jennifer Aniston) famous. But she struggles to really understand why she\u2019s doing it and who she might be if she does enter. Then she learns that her aunt was a beloved patron of a Dolly Parton-themed drag bar.In the film\u2019s effort to upend notions that a pageant is a one-dimensional showcase of beauty, one scene is especially striking: Willowdean is finally able to connect with her hitherto neglectful mother, Rosie (Jennifer Aniston), in a backstage dressing room; they\u2019re both in their own kind of drag, Rosie in the dress and tiara she wore when she won Miss Teen Bluebonnet, and Willowdean in Dolly-as-magician regalia, including ferocious red lipstick, for the competition\u2019s talent section. For them, the performance of beauty can be as honest a place of vulnerability as something more conventional without ornamentation.So, too, does Midge Maisel (Rachel Brosnahan) find comfort, catharsis and truth in performing as a stand-up comic in the Amazon show \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\u201d created by Amy Sherman-Palladino. In the Season 2 premiere, her mother has fled to France, frustrated by her marriage and her life in New York. Midge ruminates about her own complicated marriage as she drifts through the streets of Paris, only to end up in a drag bar, where her incisive comedy style, exposing herself in a bracing, sarcastic manner, is juxtaposed against the drag performances, including a trio singing a song about gay Paree.She\u2019s mesmerized and entirely shocked that they are, in fact, drag queens, blithely unaware of their existence outside this club, never mind in New York, or in the Village where she often performs. She loudly exclaims at how \u201creal\u201d they seem, quipping, \u201cDammit, your waist is small, smaller than mine.\u201d With an impromptu translator at hand, she delivers a set about her tempestuous marriage, which, even across a language barrier, turns tragic, leaving the crowd in tears. But that\u2019s what makes her brilliant, her husband argues on the phone later: \u201cIt\u2019s real, it\u2019s authentic\u201d \u2014 no matter how constructed.As much as I enjoy seeing drag queens sashay across the screen with more frequency, it\u2019s hard to get around the fact that they are, in all three works, primarily playthings or props. It\u2019s not just the condescension in \u201cA Star Is Born.\u201d In \u201cDumplin\u2019\u201d (directed by Anne Fletcher), Lee is essentially a \u201cmagical Negro,\u201d the racist trope of a black character who, without agency of his or her own, doles out wisdom to the main white character. The drag queens in \u201cMrs. Maisel\u201d are something for her to gawk at and use in her comedy. Because all of these projects are about straight women, the way they depict drag queens feels little more progressive than the convention of the gay best friend, popular in 1990s romantic comedies like \u201cMy Best Friend\u2019s Wedding\u201d: neutered, a sidekick existing solely to catalyze change in the main character.During her set, Midge Maisel riffs on what makes a woman, poking fun at her drag queen props and the ideals that they would have to live up to. Imagine if the actual queens got to express that themselves.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Willy Wonka and the Medical Software Factory", "Date": "2018-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe engineers at Epic Systems work on a campus full of childish whimsy but also sit in on open-heart surgery. Is this the indulgence of an oddball founder, or a better way to run an I.T. company?Epic Systems is a health care services provider with $2.7 billion in annual revenue. Its mathematician chief executive, Judy Faulkner, is a billionaire recluse who hosts P.T. Barnum-esque gatherings for clients. Those clients \u2014 big hospitals and health systems around the United States and more than a dozen overseas markets \u2014 are served by customer-service representatives known as BFFs. Every month, employees are compelled to gather in a subterranean chamber for two-and-a-half-hour staff meetings that have been likened to a megachurch experience. Workers are discouraged from ordering business materials on Amazon or living more than 45 minutes away from the office, in order to shorten commutes and keep Epic\u2019s wealth in the local economy.Epic\u2019s software is ubiquitous in doctors\u2019 offices and operating rooms, and companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet regularly hoover up its young engineers. Yet most people outside of the Madison environs, I\u2019d be confident to say, have never heard of the company.I certainly hadn\u2019t. I cover Wall Street, not health care or technology, and when I came across the privately held Epic this year I was consumed with questions. Who was this publicity-shy yet spectacle-loving C.E.O., and how did her theme-park sensibility coexist with the mundanity of health care billing protocols? Was Epic\u2019s odd culture a magnet for talent and clients, or was it an indulgence that kept the company from growing even bigger? In August, I traveled to Wisconsin to see what this 1,100-acre Midwestern behemoth might be hiding.When I arrived in Epic\u2019s hometown, Verona, two beaming receptionists at the Fairfield Inn tried to offer me something called the \u201cEpic discount.\u201d When I said I couldn\u2019t accept anything of value from the company, they clarified that the special rate was a gesture of gratefulness from the hotel, on account of the huge proportion of guests who come to do business with Epic. It is by far the dominant player in Verona, where the population of 10,600 is comparable to the company\u2019s head count of 9,800.Epic\u2019s headquarters were a short drive away, down a meandering road through countryside dotted with Queen Anne\u2019s lace and farm equipment. I drove past a giant Tin Man, the first indication of the campus\u2019s fairy-tale aesthetic, and into guest parking, in one of the campus\u2019s few aboveground lots.The design theme was childish even by the standards of technology start-ups, where ball pits and scooters are common. I paused at the Cavey Den, a hollowed-out treehouse with stumps for seats and children\u2019s books, then rocked on a rocking horse and ate a cookie from a jar, wondering what time was set aside for naps. There was a long series of clay slabs with handprint impressions from longtime employees, and walls and walls of art sourced from Wisconsin-area artists: a dragon perched in an iron bird cage; expanses of blue and purple stained glass; a clock featuring manicured poodles and Cupid; an old-timey circus ad painted on canvas.The diversions went beyond art. At the Black Dragon cafe, which was next to an informal band-practice area, a sandwich board advertised oatmeal for 75 cents and bacon for $1. Along the Indiana Jones tunnel, decorated with vines and a golden idol, the sound of dripping water and roaring animals played in a constant loop. A conference room named after a Star Wars planet was reached via a rickety swinging bridge. All around me, young workers in shorts and band T-shirts hurried past. (The company\u2019s dress code is that when visitors are on campus, wear clothes.)The next morning, I woke up feeling off: a throat infection I\u2019d been treating with antibiotics seemed to be getting worse. Verona, while long on breweries, day cares, artisanal pizza and jumbo mortgages, lacks an urgent-care clinic, so I drove into nearby west Madison for some attention.The clinic I found was, naturally, running on an Epic system that logged me in, took my information and tracked my health statistics. The nurse\u2019s assistant who saw me had visited Epic during her training, as do many medical professionals who work with its technology as part of their jobs.Once you know what Epic does in health care, you see it everywhere. When I left the urgent-care center, diagnosed with a gnarly case of strep, the summary printout I was given was branded on one corner with Epic\u2019s insignia.The next day, back at company headquarters, I sat in one of the less Montessori-style conference rooms with Steve Dickmann, 72, the chief administrative officer. He became animated when explaining some of the more functional, less fantastical features of the space. \u201cThe whole campus is designed to promote productivity, creativity, comfort,\u201d he said.There was a philosophy behind everything. All employees have offices, because studies show that workers in open floor plans get interrupted frequently. Stairs promote socialization, but buildings can\u2019t be more than three stories, because workers are reluctant to climb more than a flight or two. Every conference room must have windows so that visitors don\u2019t feel hemmed in during days and days of training.The overriding mission, Mr. Dickmann said, was to ensure the safety of patients at facilities that use Epic software. If health care programmers make mistakes, he said, \u201cbad things can happen.\u201dEpic\u2019s coders often leave campus to embed in operating and recovery rooms, where they watch nurses ripping the tops off blood bags and surgeons opening up people\u2019s chest cavities. It\u2019s an experience that young engineers are unlikely to get at, say, Facebook or Snap, working on algorithms that tailor ads to demographic groups or insert rainbow vomit into photographs.Programmers regularly faint at the sight of beating hearts, scalpels and bodily fluids. \u201cThere were people that would pass out in the hallway\u201d of hospitals, said Aaron Webb, who worked at Epic for 10 years as a software developer. He watched \u201chundreds\u201d of surgeries, often with his team in tow, before moving to Seattle, where he now works for a business that matches companies with storage space. \u201cBut if you can\u2019t understand what your users are going through, you\u2019re not going to design a good system.\u201dEpic works its more than 5,000 programmers hard. Middle-of-the-night technical crises, stress-related illness and employees weeping from exhaustion in airport lounges are not uncommon, say former employees. Long hours are expected. One piece of company lore has it that during a construction project, Ms. Faulkner questioned a plan to install motion-activated light switches, noting that employees might be sitting still at their desks for such long stretches that they\u2019d frequently find themselves in the dark. (The sensors were installed, and she was proved correct.)This combination of chaotic, stressful client visits and isolating, mundane office work might explain the company\u2019s Disney dimension. Epic is a place where wedding music plays on a campuswide public-announcement system when new clients are signed. Dry-cleaning services are found at the \u201cNew York Sock Exchange.\u201d Employees can hurtle down an \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d slide into a room with miniature furniture. They are encouraged to visit a conference room encased by waterfalls and a shark pond when in need of inspiration. (The shark is fake.) Internal awards for outstanding work are named after Jack Bauer and MacGyver.A few hours after my sit-down with Mr. Dickmann, I was granted an audience with Ms. Faulkner herself. We met in her personal conference room, a place of warm earth tones, steaming hot tea and personal memorabilia, including a copy of the prayer \u201cDesiderata\u201d with faux-burned margins mounted on a wall. \u201cI think we save many, many, many lives a year,\u201d she told me.Born in 1943, Ms. Faulkner said she taught herself to code in a week, using a Fortran textbook, during her undergraduate years at Dickinson College. As a graduate student in computer science at the University of Wisconsin, she conceived a prototype for Epic while sitting in her living room one day in the mid-1970s.\u201cThe sun was shining, I was disattentive, I was just sitting there and suddenly it all came to me: Here\u2019s how you build it,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I remember running into the kitchen, grabbing a pad of paper and just writing code, code, code, code,\u201d she said. While she went on to teach computer science for a period, she kept coming back to the idea, and in 1979, in a Madison basement, she founded what would become Epic: a start-up called Human Services Computing. Today, some of Epic\u2019s foundational programming still bears Ms. Faulkner\u2019s initials.Ms. Faulkner is now 75, and over the last four years, the company she built has grown an average of 14 percent a year, according to revenue figures it shared with The Times. She has instructed her heirs (she has three children) and stock-holding employees, who together constitute a majority of the company\u2019s equity holders, that they must always vote their shares in favor of keeping Epic private. They must also ensure that Epic is run by an executive who already works for the company, and that that person is a software developer.That decision-making may not occur for a while. It\u2019s \u201cmore likely that I\u2019d die than that I\u2019d retire,\u201d she said.\u201cI look at our financial information maybe for a minute a month,\u201d she said.One criticism that has dogged Epic is that its software sometimes won\u2019t connect with that of competitors, meaning that patient information can\u2019t move around as seamlessly as it should. The company has chipped away at the problem in recent years, but much remains to be done.\u201cThe problem isn\u2019t the lack of effort, it\u2019s the lack of standards,\u201d said Jim Turnbull, the chief information officer for the University of Utah system and a longtime Epic client. \u201cUntil the federal government and all the vendors recognize that we have too many standards, I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be possible to completely interoperate,\u201d he said, using the industry term for connectivity.The day after meeting with Ms. Faulkner, I took a final tour of Epic with its head of media relations, Meghan Roh, who was hired in 2017 as the first person ever to occupy that position. We went down a slide connecting the ground floor of a building called Heaven, with a white interior, to a lower level with an elevator whose floors were marked Devil, Satan, Lucifer, Beelzebub and Mephistopheles. (When you press a button, you hear audio of an imaginary demon saying, \u201cPlease come in. It\u2019s nice and toasty in here.\u201d)Underground is also where you\u2019ll find Epic\u2019s auditorium. Built partly to preserve the sightlines on campus and minimize water and waste runoff, the gathering place hosts the Verona high school\u2019s annual graduation ceremony as well as Epic\u2019s monthly staff meetings, at which attendance is required. On the way in, employees are served popcorn and coffee, an homage to an earlier point when the company used movie theaters for large meetings, and shown a reel of pictures of recent staff weddings, newborn babies and beloved pets. Then they hear presentations on new products and priorities, matters of company philosophy, and new \u201carmies\u201d being formed for employees to brainstorm software-based solutions to epidemics like the opioid crisis and maternal morbidity.Workers who fully commit to Epic \u2014 who survive the long hours and grisly sights \u2014 are treated to a remarkable perk. After five years, they get a sabbatical, including round-trip airfare for two to travel somewhere they\u2019ve never been for a month, plus a per diem for meals and lodging. (They get another sabbatical after 10 years, 15, and so on.)Epic is constantly scanning the undergraduate ranks for new hires. Rather than sticking to engineer incubator schools like M.I.T. or Stanford, it scouts institutions like Carleton College in Minnesota and Clemson University in South Carolina. Candidates take online tests to gauge their problem-solving skills and, if they pass muster, are whisked to Madison for an on-campus interview and tour of the area.Once on board, employees take a multiweek training course that includes basic business etiquette as well as Epic-specific skill building. Officials preach a flat structure in which it\u2019s never O.K. to turn down colleagues for help. They also teach a tactic called \u201cbadgering\u201d \u2014 remember, it\u2019s Wisconsin \u2014 or the art of being persistent but not maddening.Epic\u2019s broad recruiting strategy and perks help draw people in, but over time, it\u2019s the cultures of both Wisconsin and Epic that help keep people there.\u201cThe only reason I left Epic was so that my family could move out West,\u201d said Mr. Webb, the former Epic programmer. \u201cEvery day was different. And it was fun. And just being able to go see the impact you were having, that was really, really cool.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated how patients' medical records are handled. They are accessed by software that runs on Epic servers; they are not stored on Epic servers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "El Chapo Speaks: Jury Hears Secretly Recorded Phone Call Detailing Drug Deal", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor more than a month, Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n Loera, the Mexican drug lord known as El Chapo, has sat in a Brooklyn courtroom, mostly stone-faced, sometimes smiling, but never saying a word.On Thursday, however, the jurors at his drug conspiracy trial finally heard him engaging in the business that led to his indictment. Prosecutors played an intercepted phone call of the kingpin striking a deal with Colombian guerrillas to move six tons of cocaine from Ecuador to Mexico.In the secretly recorded conversation, Mr. Guzm\u00e1n was negotiating with a member of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, about the cocaine shipment \u2014 most of which he asked to buy on credit. In the recording, Mr. Guzm\u00e1n haggled over pricing and insisted on dispatching a \u201ctechnician\u201d to inspect the product\u2019s quality before sending the guerrillas their initial payment of $50,000.Appearing at the trial as a witness for the government, Mr. Cifuentes in three days of testimony has described not only the various cocaine deals he hatched with the defendant in Ecuador, but also his own remarkable life of crime, which began when he was 4 and started helping his father move illegal cigarettes and whiskey through the port in Medell\u00edn.On Tuesday, his first day on the stand, Mr. Cifuentes recalled how he met Mr. Guzm\u00e1n in 2003 at a mescal-soaked party at the kingpin\u2019s hide-out in the Sierra Madre mountains; it was a celebration of the second anniversary of his first escape from prison. Getting to the party required a harrowing landing on a steeply inclined covert airstrip. Once he was safely on the ground \u2014 and after he had said a few prayers \u2014 Mr. Cifuentes resolved, he told jurors, to buy Mr. Guzm\u00e1n a helicopter so he could \u201cfly in a more civilized way.\u201dThat same year, he started sending Mr. Guzm\u00e1n shipments of cocaine in carbon-fiber airplanes that were specially designed to frustrate radar. In 2007, after his brother \u2014 a former pilot for the Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar \u2014 was killed, Mr. Cifuentes fled to Ecuador, where he began arranging drug deals with the FARC for Mr. Guzm\u00e1n and protecting their investment by bribing a local military officer.The officer was not the only person Mr. Cifuentes has acknowledged paying off. He testified that he routinely bribed the Ecuadorean Navy (for information about American naval ships) and the Colombian police (\u201cwhenever it was needed\u201d). Early in his career, he told the jurors, he once paid off Colombian officials to expunge his prison record.By his own admission, Mr. Cifuentes was also a prodigious liar and cheater. As a teenager, he said, he lied about his age on his first driver\u2019s license, and later, in Key Biscayne, Fla., he lied about his name while buying a $4 million mansion. He once bought a fake diploma, he confessed, \u201cto impress my colleagues at work,\u201d adding that he meant his \u201cdrug trafficking work.\u201d When the helicopter he gave to Mr. Guzm\u00e1n crashed, he said he pushed it off a cliff in an insurance scam.But Mr. Cifuentes\u2019s grandest fraud involved creating a foundation to preserve some seven million hectares of jungle in the Amazon on behalf of what he called the region\u2019s \u201cindigenous people.\u201d Under questioning by prosecutors, he grudgingly acknowledged that he did not have \u201ccompletely noble motives\u201d in the venture. In reality, he said, the foundation was mostly a way to funnel up to $1.5 billion in environmental contracts to companies he owned.The Cifuentes family has, for decades, been famous in Colombia for working in the cocaine trade. Aside from the oldest brother \u2014 the pilot who was killed before he could be arrested \u2014 Mr. Cifuentes\u2019s younger brother, Alexander, and two of his sisters, Dolly and Lucia, were convicted of drug trafficking charges.Even his mother, Carlina, was involved. Before prosecutors played Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s call with the guerrillas, they let the jurors hear recorded conversations in which Mr. Cifuentes and his mother could be heard discussing drug deals.And yet on cross-examination Thursday afternoon, Mr. Cifuentes claimed he and his relatives were normal people who had \u201cconflicts like any other family.\u201dJeffrey Lichtman, one of Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s lawyers, was skeptical.\u201cConflicts like any other family?\u201d he repeated. \u201cLike the time your brother Alex ordered the murder of your nephew?\u201dMr. Cifuentes will be back in court on Monday to finish cross-examination.Advertisement"}

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.Federal, state and local governments have gotten into the habit of providing corporations with incentives to move, incentives to stay, bailouts to stave off failure and tax benefits to build on success and create more jobs. All are based on promises about job creation and economic development that more often than not prove hollow. By paying incentives, governors, mayors and other politicians feel they\u2019re \u201cwinning\u201d jobs from competitors. As New York City mayor, Bill DeBlasio, put it, at the end of the day, 25,000 jobs are going somewhere. Why shouldn\u2019t the city have them?In leaving metropolitan New York for Charlotte, Honeywell cited the ability to recruit talent, which is, oddly enough, the same reason Amazon cited to choose metropolitan New York, in the form of Queens, for its HQ2. That, and as much as $3 billion in incentives.Of course it will, until a better offer comes along. And that\u2019s exactly the problem with our corporate welfare system. Companies like G.M. know that if they dangle a new plant like a piece of meat \u2014 perhaps the one that will make autonomous vehicles \u2014 the political and economic development dogs will come running. And they will always find lawmakers ready to provide tax breaks with a wispy hope that they will make everyone\u2019s life better. Like G.M., they\u2019ll behave as if the Lordstown plant never existed. And soon, it might not.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Love Actually\u2019 (2003) Review", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMany of the holiday movies we consider classics or cult favorites today did not seem destined for such glory when we first reviewed them. Some we panned. Others were flops. Others just weren\u2019t particularly holiday-focused.\u201cLove Actually,\u201d which opens today nationwide, is an indigestible Christmas pudding from the British whimsy factory responsible for such reasonably palatable confections as \u201cFour Weddings and a Funeral,\u201d \u201cNotting Hill\u201d and \u201cBridget Jones\u2019s Diary.\u201d A romantic comedy swollen to the length of an Oscar-trawling epic \u2014 nearly two and a quarter hours of cheekiness, diffidence and high-tone smirking \u2014 it is more like a record label\u2019s greatest-hits compilation or a \u201cvery special\u201d sitcom clip-reel show than an actual movie.The air is thick with bad pop songs, which those plucky, ironical Britons seem to love in spite of their badness. A sparkling British-American cast of newly minted and long familiar stars chirp, swoon, pine, quip and shed the odd tear. Presiding over it all is the new prime minister, a twinkly bachelor with a tonsorial resemblance to Tony Blair, who is played by none other than Hugh Grant. As he did in the far superior \u201cAbout a Boy,\u201d Mr. Grant makes a climactic onstage appearance at a school talent show. He also sings \u201cGood King Wenceslas\u201d and disco-dances around 10 Downing Street in his shirt sleeves.In his opening voice-over, Mr. Grant establishes a new standard for bad taste masquerading as its opposite when he introduces this fluffy farrago, written and directed by Richard Curtis, with a reference to the World Trade Center attacks. The phone calls made from the towers, he suggests, show that however perilous the state of the world, \u201clove is all around.\u201d Further support for this thesis is gleaned from the arrival gate at Heathrow, where people tend to hug and kiss each other a lot.Like much else in \u201cLove Actually,\u201d you almost buy this moment of banal sentiment, because it is so prettily shot and smartly spoken. But the film\u2019s governing idea of love is both shallow and dishonest, and its sweet, chipper demeanor masks a sour cynicism about human emotions that is all the more sleazy for remaining unacknowledged. It has the calloused, leering soul of an early-60\u2019s rat-pack comedy, but without the suave, seductive bravado. The worst kind of cad is the one who thinks he\u2019s really a sensitive guy deep down.Most of the picture\u2019s half-dozen or so romantic subplots \u2014 which lie scattered about like torn wrapping paper on Christmas morning \u2014 involve workplace dalliances of one kind or another. The ones with the best chances of success all involve an older male boss and a young female subordinate. Jamie (Colin Firth), a writer cuckolded by his own brother, retreats to a villa in the South of France and falls for his Portuguese housekeeper, Aurelia, who speaks no English and who obligingly strips down to her underwear to rescue manuscript pages that have blown into the lake.Harry (Alan Rickman), the head of a nonprofit organization, is besotted with his secretary, Mia (Heike Makatsh), who makes no secret of her attraction to him. The prime minister, moral exemplar of the nation, develops a crush on Natalie (Martine McCutcheon), a member of the Downing Street household staff. When the goatish president of the United States, in London for a state visit, puts the moves on her, the P.M.\u2019s jealousy precipitates a chill in British-American relations (and also makes him a national hero).The funniest and most winning on-the-job romance bubbles up between two people (Martin Freeman and Joanna Page) who work as body doubles on a movie set, miming explicit sex scenes in the absence of the prudish stars. As their naked bodies go through the motions, the two of them chat mildly about traffic and the weather, and their mutual attraction is sealed, on the first date, by a chaste kiss on the cheek.The other genuine comic spark comes from Bill Nighy, playing a washed-up, dissolute rock star named Billy Mack, who is trying for a comeback with a treacly Christmas record. Billy says shocking, hilarious things in television and radio interviews, and his casual indifference to proper decorum makes him the most honest character in the film.The problem is that the movie, more than any of the characters in it, is a mess of crossed signals, swerving between cynicism and sincerity without quite knowing the difference between them. It is most grotesque when it tries for earnest drama, parading the grief of a widower (Liam Neeson) and the humiliation of a middle-aged wife (Emma Thompson) before us when it thinks our throats need lumping.It is disturbing to see Ms. Thompson\u2019s range and subtlety so shamelessly trashed, and to see Laura Linney\u2019s intelligence similarly abused as a lonely, frustrated do-gooder. The fate of their characters suggests that women who are not young, pert secretaries or household workers have no real hope of sexual fulfillment and can find only a compromised, damaged form of love. Perhaps Mr. Curtis wishes to offer this as an insight into contemporary social arrangements; if so, his indifference to the cruelty of those arrangements is truly breathtaking.But it is unlikely that any particular insight was intended. Instead, \u201cLove Actually\u201d is a patchwork of contrived naughtiness and forced pathos, ending as it began, with hugging and kissing at the airport (where returning passengers are perhaps expressing their relief at being delivered from an in-flight movie like this one). The loose ends are neatly tied up, as they are when you seal a bag of garbage \u2014 or if you prefer, rubbish.\u201cLove Actually\u201d is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sex, nudity and profanity. Running time: 128 minutes.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Stocks Bounce Back From Edge of Bear Market", "Date": "2018-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThroughout Wall Street\u2019s December meltdown, analysts have been saying that markets were plunging despite plenty of evidence that the United States economy remains strong and corporate profit growth is healthy.A substantial rise in crude oil prices added to the lighter mood, as did efforts from the White House to ease up on criticism of the Federal Reserve.The rally continued in Asia, led by Japan, where stocks on Thursday opened 3.7 percent higher.The rebound in the United States offered investors a much-needed reprieve from a decline that had picked up speed in December. Stocks had fallen for four consecutive days through Monday, and the drop had pushed the S&P 500 to within just a few points of a bear market \u2014 defined as a 20 percent retreat from its high.Still, the S&P 500 is on pace for its worst annual performance since the financial crisis a decade ago and is only back to where it stood on Dec. 20. Plus, the move in prices Wednesday was most likely heightened by lighter-than-average trading volume during a holiday week.But to some traders, the move upward finally made sense.\u201cFundamentally you\u2019ve got good growth here in the States, you have reasonable growth overseas, you\u2019re going to have record earnings in 2019 and possibly in 2020 as well, you\u2019ve got low inflation,\u201d said Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute. Before Wednesday\u2019s steep rise, the market had fallen too far, Mr. Wren said, and it was ready to climb thanks to the underlying strength of the American economy.The rally was broad-based. Only one stock in the S&P 500, Newmont Mining, fell.Oil prices, too, were on the move after Russia\u2019s energy minister, Alexander Novak, told a Russian newspaper that the country would benefit from continuing to cooperate with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries on regulating production. American crude, the benchmark for oil prices, rose almost 9 percent to over $46 a barrel, and shares of large energy producers also climbed.After leading Wall Street\u2019s recent slide, technology stocks rebounded as well. Tech investors have had plenty of causes for concern. A slowing global economy could hurt sales, tensions are rising with China on manufacturing of devices, and privacy concerns are bringing the potential for regulation. Apple shares rose 7 percent, while stock in the semiconductor maker Advanced Micro Devices gained 7.5 percent and Facebook added more than 8 percent.Bank stocks, which have taken the brunt of recent selling as worries grew that the United States economy was weakening, rose significantly.The rally doesn\u2019t mean that this year\u2019s precipitous decline in stock prices is over. Signs of economic health that encouraged the buying are doing little to address one of stock investors\u2019 primary concerns. They\u2019re worried that the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to continue raising interest rates, even if at a slightly slower pace, will hurt the economy and corporate profits. Higher interest rates on bonds or even savings accounts make stock investments less appealing as an alternative.The Fed announced an interest-rate increase last week and said it would continue to withdraw the support it had offered the economy in the wake of the financial crisis.\u201cThe Fed is making a monumental mistake,\u201d said Barry Bannister, the head of institutional equity strategy at the broker Stifel. \u201cThey do not realize how long and by how much they\u2019ve tightened already, and until they back off the market\u2019s going to have a very weak floor under it.\u201dAdding to volatility has been the possibility that President Trump would consider firing the central bank\u2019s chairman, Jerome H. Powell, because he disagreed with Fed policy. Mr. Trump, who previously sought to hitch his political success to a rising stock market, has blamed interest-rate increases for the downturn on Wall Street.White House officials insisted again that the president had no plans to fire Mr. Powell, news that reassured investors.Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, told reporters Wednesday morning that Mr. Powell\u2019s job was \u201c100 percent\u201d safe. He echoed remarks by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Trump\u2019s incoming chief of staff, both of whom spent the weekend trying to persuade investors that the president did not plan to fire Mr. Powell. Those efforts had mostly backfired, in part because Mr. Trump continued to criticize his handpicked Fed chairman.It also helped matters on Wednesday that Mr. Trump refrained from offering new criticism of the Fed, a marked difference from the days leading up to the Christmas holiday, when he railed against the central bank on Twitter and vowed to keep the government shut down for an extended period. In fact, for the first trading session in many days, Mr. Trump posted just one tweet: It was about his trip to Iraq.Matthew Goldstein and Alexandra Stevenson contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Seattle\u2019s team also will have an instant rivalry with the Vancouver Canucks, who play about three hours by car to the north. To make room for Seattle, the Arizona Coyotes will move from the Pacific Division to the Central Division.Investors in Seattle had sought a new N.B.A. team to replace the SuperSonics, who moved to Oklahoma City after the 2008 season. Plans to build a new arena in Seattle fell apart repeatedly. Instead, the city landed a hockey team in part because its City Council in September approved a $700 million plan to refurbish KeyArena, just north of downtown.Tod Leiweke, the team\u2019s president, said the team would break ground on the arena, which will have 17,000 seats, on Wednesday.\u201cIt will be one of the finest arenas in the world,\u201d he said.Enthusiasm is running high. Well before the league made clear it would put a team in Seattle, more than 33,000 fans placed deposits for season tickets, leading the ownership group to create a waiting list.The effort to get an N.H.L. team has gone on several years, though the league insisted Seattle would not be considered until it had a viable arena.The N.H.L. is attracted to Seattle\u2019s growing stature. The region is home to corporate giants like Amazon and Microsoft, and the Pacific Northwest is a relatively untapped area for the N.H.L.The Seattle Metropolitans, founded by Frank and Lester Patrick, played in the Pacific Coast Hockey Association. At the time, the winner of the P.C.H.A. played the winner of the National Hockey Association, the precursor to the N.H.L., for the Stanley Cup. In 1917, the Metropolitans beat the Montreal Canadiens in a best-of-five series.The Metropolitans again played for the Cup in 1919 and 1920 before folding in 1924.Since then, Seattle has had multiple minor league and junior hockey teams, including the Thunderbirds of Western Hockey League, who play in Kent, Wash.Seattle was awarded an N.H.L. franchise in 1974, but the offer was rescinded because the ownership group ran into financial troubles. Another bid fell through in 1990.Now that the N.H.L. has awarded Seattle a team, the ownership group must start work on the redevelopment of the arena, open a practice facility and hire front-office employees and a coach.

{"Headline": "Unrest in France Hinders Macron\u2019s Push to Revive Economy", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The need to accelerate growth has long been visible in almost every corner of the French economy, from dreary unemployment offices packed with job seekers to businesses whose financially stretched customers struggle to make do.President Emmanuel Macron came into office pledging to change all that by improving the country\u2019s long-term prospects. But his halting response to a month of violent demonstrations by the so-called Yellow Vest movement over social inequality has clouded his efforts for a revival.The same day, the country\u2019s central bank trimmed its growth forecast for the fourth quarter to 0.2 percent from 0.4 percent, well off the sluggish pace expected for the year. Businesses have sustained more than 10 billion euros, about $11.4 billion, in damage and lost sales, a figure that will probably grow.\u201cIt\u2019s a catastrophe for business,\u201d Bruno Le Maire, the finance minister, said Sunday as he toured Paris businesses smashed up by rioters. \u201cIt\u2019s a catastrophe for our economy,\u201d he added, a point he pressed again on Tuesday in a briefing with a small group of reporters.He pledged tax cuts and financial support for those having trouble getting by, urged businesses to give employees year-end bonuses and said the government would help minimum-wage earners with a \u20ac100 monthly supplement starting next year.Mr. Macron\u2019s speech, a recorded message just 13 minutes long, was also notable for what he left out.\u201cWe know how important it is for us to be as attractive as possible for foreign investors,\u201d Mr. Le Maire told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cThe key point is to make clear that we will remain strong on structural reforms.\u201dWhile foreign investment in France has risen since Mr. Macron came to office, \u201cthere will be a mark left by this episode,\u201d said Olivier Marchal, the chairman of Bain & Company France. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not a given that this will succeed in calming the dissatisfaction of a part of the population.\u201dMany of those protesting understand that improving the economy is a long-term project, but their concerns are focused on their monthly efforts to make ends meet. On social networks, some protesters said Mr. Macron\u2019s offer fell short.Mr. Macron has lectured leaders of other eurozone countries \u2014 especially Italy \u2014 about the need to balance their books. Now he must follow his own advice. French ministries have been ordered to find cuts in their budgets, and the government could delay some tax cuts for companies that had been scheduled to kick in next year, Mr. Le Maire said.Mr. Macron also refuses to end a tax break for wealthy citizens that he granted upon taking office. He says the measure was intended to lure money into France, where it can be invested in French companies. The move has drained more than \u20ac3 billion from France\u2019s coffers this year, but Mr. Le Maire said Tuesday that there was no data yet to show whether it was having the promised stimulus effect.Mr. Le Maire has suggested another way to make up the shortfall: pursuing the taxes that he said Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google had avoided paying in France for years. The European Union is considering a plan to impose such taxes. If the union does not reach an accord on doing so by March, Mr. Le Maire said Tuesday, France will move to collect $500 million in back taxes from the tech giants.Patrick Artus, chief economist at Natixis Bank, which is based in Paris, said that even if the tax cuts and spending increases Mr. Macron had proposed increased France\u2019s budget deficit, \u201cmarkets will accept that\u201d as a price for restoring social stability.Still, the slowdown in growth caused by a month of disruption will make it harder for Mr. Macron to address several major problems.Retailers, including supermarkets and sellers of luxury goods, have collectively lost more than \u20ac1 billion, while small and medium-size companies have lost at least \u20ac10 billion, according to France\u2019s main retail and business associations.The agriculture sector is facing over \u20ac13 billion in losses, said ANIA, the main industry group, citing four weekends of protests that blocked roads, causing delivery delays and often preventing groceries from reaching stores.Tourism has also been affected, with hotels recording cancellation rates as high as 25 percent since the protests started last month. American and Japanese tour operators have been advising customers not to travel to France, according to the National Federation of Tourist Offices.Some companies have paused hiring plans. Auchan, a large supermarket chain, said it might not hire 4,000 temporary workers it had planned to employ across France for the holiday season.Stores that need to make up for lost revenue will be allowed to open on Sundays, something that has been prohibited in most of France by decades-old laws requiring that Sunday be a day of rest.In the end, the main issue for France is not the short-term cost from the demonstrations, said Mr. Artus, the economist.\u201cIt\u2019s whether Macron will keep the reforms going,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is to maintain the attractiveness of France.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the name of the bank where Patrick Artus is the chief economist. It is Natixis Bank, not Natexis.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe city and state sent loads of data to Amazon during its search for a new headquarters, offering a peek into the valuable information the company collected during the process.An avocado at Whole Foods costs $1.25. Columbia University handed out 724 graduate degrees in computer science over the past three years. And 10 potential land parcels in Long Island City are zoned M1-4, for light manufacturing. New York provided all of these data points, and thousands more, to Amazon as part of its successful bid to woo the tech giant to town.In the end, Amazon chose Long Island City in Queens and Arlington, Va., for two new headquarters. But more than 200 cities put in initial bids for the project, and 20 of them provided Amazon with more information when they made Amazon\u2019s shortlist. Each submitted valuable research that the company can mine in the future for picking satellite offices, warehouse locations or research hubs.When Joseph Parilla, a fellow at the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution, first scrolled through New York\u2019s submission, which The Times asked him to review, one word kept flying out his mouth: \u201cWow.\u201d Mr. Parilla, who researches economic development, was amazed at the level of detail and hard-to-find data the city had provided. \u201cWe are doing a project right now that, if we had access to Amazon\u2019s database, it would make our life so much easier,\u201d Mr. Parilla said. An Amazon spokesman, Adam Sedo, said that most of the information the company received was publicly available, and that economic development offices regularly provided such data to companies looking to locate in an area.Here is a look at what Amazon obtained, and how the company did it.After Amazon announced its shortlist in January, it gave cities a 29-page request for information that required far more precision and was more about practicalities than flash. It asked cities to respond by early March with a huge text document punctuated only with a few maps.The unique information in the first round of submissions was the details on available real estate sites and incentive programs, said Richard Florida, a professor at the University of Toronto. The data, while not flashy, is core to the ability to understand where the best pool of potential employees live and could be developed, which drove the search for the new headquarters. \u201cDuring the process it became clear to us that the overriding criteria was going to be the ability to find and attract talent,\u201d Jay Carney, a senior vice president at Amazon, said in an interview immediately after the company announced its plans for New York and Virginia. Most of it \u2014 but the company got the city and state to pull it all together. While that information is public, it is spread across dozens of sources, and can be time-consuming to compile. The New York response has tables from federal census reports, published studies, city databases and news articles. Amazon also asked cities to provide the costs of a \u201cgallon of 2% milk, loaf of whole wheat bread, and an avocado\u201d at a local Whole Foods, the organic grocer that Amazon owns.As Mr. Parilla said, \u201cIt\u2019s like why do the work when somebody else can do it?\u201dHaving that information, compiled in one place, can let Amazon move quickly in the future, Mr. Florida said. The company can go back to cities and say, \u201cWe didn\u2019t put HQ2 in your neighborhood but we have this really good idea for an R&D hub,\u201d Mr. Florida said. \u201cYou have this great site here, and you told us what incentives you would have,\u201d and push them to act.Mr. Sedo, the Amazon spokesman, said the company had already used information gleaned from the first round as it looks to future growth. For example, Amazon learned about a program in New Orleans that lets companies inform classes taught at community colleges, which made Amazon think it could be a good place to build a fulfillment center with robotics that require specialized skills to maintain and operate. He said real estate information, while valuable, can change quickly as cities develop.\u201cYou now have this database that you can go back to,\u201d Mr. Parilla said. \u201cYou have so much more information.\u201dJ.

The median age is 43, seven years older than city dwellers. Its productivity, defined as output per worker, is lower than urban America\u2019s. Its families have lower incomes. And its share of the population is shrinking: the United States has grown by 75 million people since 1990, but this has mostly occurred in cities and suburbs. Rural areas have lost some 3 million people. Since the 1990s, problems such as crime and opioid abuse, once associated with urban areas, are increasingly rural phenomena.These days, economic growth bypasses rural economies. In the first four years of the recovery after the 2008 recession, counties with fewer than 100,000 people lost 17,500 businesses, according to the Economic Innovation Group. By contrast, counties with more than 1 million residents added, altogether, 99,000 firms. By 2017, the largest metropolitan areas had almost 10 percent more jobs than they did at the start of the financial crisis. Rural areas still had fewer.I\u2019ve lived most of my life in big cities. I don\u2019t pretend to understand what it\u2019s like to live in a small town or on a family farm, or how it feels when all the jobs in a community seem to be fading away. I do spend a lot of time thinking about how the economic changes of the last several decades have undercut many American workers. One thing seems clear to me: nobody \u2014 not experts or policymakers or people in these communities \u2014 seems to know quite how to pick rural America up.There are 1,888 counties in America in which more than half the population is rural, according to the Census Bureau, and they stretch from coast to coast.New York County, N.Y.73,475 people per square milePopulation density by countySan Francisco County, Calif.Urban countiesRural counties18,871 people per square mileLexington City, Va.2,843 people per square mileSource: Brookings analysis of Census Bureau dataPopulation density by countyUrban countiesRural countiesNew York County, N.Y.73,475 people per square mileSan Francisco County, Calif.18,871 people per square mileLexington City, Va.2,843 people per square mileSource: Brookings analysis of Census Bureau dataPopulation density by countyUrban countiesRural countiesNew York County, N.Y.73,475 people per square mileSan Francisco County, Calif.18,871 people per square mileLexington City, Va.2,843 people per square mileSource: Brookings analysis of Census Bureau dataIn Comanche County, a land of cattle, farming, oil and gas on the plains of southwestern Kansas, 1,790 people live in a sparsely settled area of nearly 800 square miles. In Perry County \u2014 home to some 26,500 people in the Appalachian Mountains of Eastern Kentucky \u2014 so far no other industry has replaced once-mighty coal. Essex County in New York\u2019s Adirondacks is three-quarters rural, by the census definition. So is Calaveras County in California.After World War II, small town prosperity relied on its contribution to the industrial economy. The census considers Price County, Wis., to be 100 percent rural. Still, over a third of the jobs there are in manufacturing, from building industrial machines to assembling trucks. Auto parts manufacturers in West Point, Ga., draw workers from all over Troup County. Overall, manufacturing employs about one in eight workers in the country\u2019s 704 entirely rural counties. That\u2019s more than agriculture, forestry, fishing and mining combined and second only to education, health care and social assistance, which includes teachers, doctors, nurses and social service counselors. Most of those jobs are government funded.But factory jobs can no longer keep small-town America afloat. Even after a robust eight-year growth spell, there are fewer than 13 million workers in manufacturing across the entire economy. Robots and workers in China put together most of the manufactured goods that Americans buy, and the high-tech industries powering the economy today don\u2019t have much need for the cheap labor that rural communities contributed to America\u2019s industrial past. They mostly need highly educated workers. They find those most easily in big cities, not in small towns.Consider Lake County, in Tennessee. Some 7,500 people live there, about 500 fewer than in 2000. Lake County is betting on a new industrial park on Cates Landing on the Mississippi River. But it will be tough to reverse years of declining employment. Between 2013 and 2017, the county averaged fewer than 250 manufacturing jobs, according to the Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey. That\u2019s half as many as it had in 2000.Wisely, they suggest that any federal government effort must choose its targets carefully. Better to focus on middle-sized places that are near big tech hubs and have some critical infrastructure, rather than scatter assistance all over the landscape.Share of digital and technology jobs by countyUrban countiesRural counties1 million+ people<50K people not adjacent to metro areaKing County, Wash.15%Fairfax County, Va.27%Osceola County, Mich.10%Source: Brookings analysis of Emsi dataShare of digital and technology jobs by countyUrban countiesRural counties1 million+ people<50K people not adjacent to metro areaOsceola County, Mich.10%Fairfax County, Va.27%King County, Wash.15%Source: Brookings analysis of Emsi dataShare of digital and technology jobs by countyUrban countiesRural counties1 million+ people<50K people not adjacent to metro areaFairfax County, King County, Source: Brookings analysis of Emsi dataSound as these ideas may be, however, even the authors concede that they may not be up to the task. \u201cI don\u2019t know if these ideas are going to work,\u201d Mr. Galston acknowledged when I pressed him on the issue. \u201cBut it is worth making the effort.\u201dThis is the inescapable reality of agglomeration, one of the most powerful forces shaping the American economy over the last three decades. Innovative companies choose to locate where other successful, innovative companies are. That\u2019s where they can find lots of highly skilled workers. The more densely packed these pools of talent are, the more workers can learn from each other and the more productive they become. This dynamic feeds on itself, drawing more high-tech firms and highly skilled workers to where they already are.\u201cWe have a spatial reorganization of the economy,\u201d said Mr. Muro. \u201cWe have an archipelago of superstars in an ocean of low-productivity sectors.\u201dAfter examining a range of potential policy interventions, they conclude that a targeted employment subsidy, such as the earned-income tax credit, is probably the most powerful tool available to revive employment. But they, too, are not sure it will work. \u201cOur call for a wage subsidy is us saying, \u2018We can\u2019t figure this out, and we hope the private sector will,\u2019\u2009\u201d Mr. Glaeser told me.There are, to be sure, some rural communities with productivity as high as some big cities. But they rely on heavily mechanized and automated industries that support few jobs: oil extraction or large-scale agriculture, in which tractors talk to satellites and no drivers are involved. The livestock business on the vast pastures of Sioux County, Neb., for example, supports an economy worth $306,000 per worker, according to data from Mr. Muro and Jacob Whiton of Brookings. But only 1,200 people live there.In the Southeast Fairbanks area of Alaska, it is all about oil and gas. Output per worker is $203,000. But its population doesn\u2019t quite reach 7,000.Excluding these places, the United States is still left with 50 to 55 million people living in rural communities that no longer have much to offer them economically.What if nothing really works? Is there really no option but to do nothing and, as some have suggested, return depopulated parts of rural America to the bison?Instead of so-called place-based policies to revitalize small towns, why not help their residents take advantage of opportunities where the opportunities are? Geographic mobility hit a historical low in 2017, when only 11 percent of Americans picked up shop and moved \u2014 half the rate of 1951. One of the key reasons is that housing in the prosperous cities that offer the most opportunities has become too expensive.The most helpful policy for people in small towns could be to relax zoning rules in dense cities like New York and San Francisco, so that more affordable housing could be built to receive newcomers from rural Wisconsin or Kentucky, and they wouldn\u2019t need the income of an investment banker or a computer scientist to afford to live there.Still, there are compelling reasons to try to help rural economies rebound. Even if moving people might prove more efficient on paper than restoring places, many people \u2014 especially older people and the family members who care for them \u2014 may choose to remain in rural areas. What\u2019s more, the costs of rural poverty are looming over American society. Think of the opioid addiction taking over rural America, of the spike in crime, of the wasted human resources in places where only a third of adults hold a job.And if today\u2019s polarized politics are noxious, what might they look like in a country perpetually divided between diverse, prosperous liberal cities and a largely white rural America in decline? As Mr. Galston warned: \u201cThink through the political consequences of saying to a substantial portion of Americans, which is even more substantial in political terms, \u2018We think you\u2019re toast.\u2019\u2009\u201dThe distress of 50 million Americans should concern everyone. Powerful economic forces are arrayed against rural America and, so far, efforts to turn it around have failed. Not every small town can be a tech hub, nor should it be. But that can\u2019t be the only answer.An earlier version of a map showing population density by county omitted New York County, which covers Manhattan.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wall St. Tumbles, Bothered by the Fed and Government Shutdown Fears", "Date": "2018-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStocks tumbled yet again on Thursday, a day after the Federal Reserve pushed forward with another interest-rate increase and offered few signs that it would sharply slow the pace of monetary tightening as many had hoped.The S&P 500-stock index declined 1.6 percent, and the Dow Jones industrial index fell 2 percent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite fell 1.6 percent, pushing it 19.5 percent below its late-August peak. A decline of 20 percent marks the start of a bear market.On its own, the broader S&P 500 is down more than 15 percent from its peak, close to entering a bear market and ending the long bull rally that began in early 2009.\u201cThere\u2019s just a constant selling pressure,\u201d said Paul Hickey, a founder of the Bespoke Investment Group, a financial market research firm in Harrison, N.Y. \u201cIt\u2019s just any excuse is an excuse to sell.\u201dOn Thursday, investors had their pick of excuses.Tensions between the United States and China flared as the Justice Department unveiled new indictments of Chinese nationals accused of hacking government and corporate targets on behalf of Chinese intelligence agencies.Shares of technology companies, increasingly the epicenter of the confrontation between China and the United States over trade, security and technology, fell sharply. Apple, Amazon and Microsoft were all down more than 2 percent.Elsewhere, President Trump again raised the specter of a federal government shutdown if he didn\u2019t receive funding for his promised border wall.And crude oil extended its slump, sending energy stocks sharply lower. The S&P energy sector led the declines in the S&P 500, with the energy giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron dropping 3.1 percent and 2.7 percent.American benchmark crude oil prices tumbled 4 percent more, pushing the price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude to nearly $46 a barrel.Initially, the sharp slump in crude oil prices \u2014 they\u2019re down more than 23 percent this year \u2014 was seen as a result of a global supply glut that was expected to be transitory. But as the sell-off has persisted, the decline has raised questions among investors about the strength of global demand and economic health.\u201cWhen prices move in a sustained way it\u2019s telling you something about demand,\u201d said Julia Coronado, president of MacroPolicy Perspectives, an economic consulting firm.Asian markets followed Wall Street lower in Friday morning trading, with Japan\u2019s 1.8 percent drop leading the way. Futures markets, however, suggested Wall Street could open higher on Friday.The global economy does appear to be slowing. Official figures in China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, show it is growing at its slowest pace in a decade. The world\u2019s No. 3 and 4 economies, Japan and Germany, both contracted during the third quarter.At the same time, the world\u2019s largest economy, the United States, had one of its strongest years of economic growth since 2005. That was due in part to a jolt of fiscal stimulus in the form of a deep cut to corporate tax rates.But for financial markets, the books are already closed on 2018. And asset prices are painting a much more dour picture of the economic outlook.The S&P 500 is now down nearly 16 percent from its Sept. 20 peak, as investors have grown increasingly uncertain about the outlook for the economy and corporate profits.Many had hoped that the right mutterings from the Federal Reserve as part of Wednesday\u2019s decision on interest rates could offer a lifeline to a market rally that began in the economic wreckage of the financial crisis in March 2009.By some measures, that bull market is the longest on record, having pulled the stock market up more than 250 percent.\u201cEverything points to the Fed needing to stop,\u201d said Barry Bannister, chief equity strategist at the brokerage and investment banking firm Stifel Nicolaus in Baltimore. \u201cAnd until they do, it\u2019s kind of hard to put a floor under stocks.\u201dAlan Rappeport contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Then, as City Council speaker, he will hold hearings about the 311 data.He said he plans to add interactive maps, created by the Council\u2019s data team, to the public advocate\u2019s website to help pair students with schools. He has scheduled a survey of subway riders \u2014 online and in person \u2014 and will be making appearances at train stations in all five boroughs to query passengers over five days in January.The subject of mayoral control of the subways, he said, may come up. Mr. Johnson, in an interview, compared the idea to former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg\u2019s successful effort to control the city\u2019s public schools in 2002.Eric F. Phillips, the mayor\u2019s press secretary, said the proposal was nothing new. \u201cLots of people have fantasized over it through the years \u2014 and with good reason,\u201d he said. \u201cThe mayor doesn\u2019t oppose the conversation, he\u2019s just more focused on things that will help the subways now.\u201dMr. Johnson\u2019s eagerness to seize his additional clout is perhaps no surprise: For much of his first year as Council speaker, he has unabashedly embraced the spotlight while leading a body that is itching to assert its power vis-\u00e0-vis the mayor.Mr. Phillips dismissed the attention Mr. Johnson\u2019s temporary role is likely to garner. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a big city to run and I don\u2019t think anyone paid any attention to it, to be honest,\u201d Mr. Phillips wrote in an email, referring to the article in City and State. \u201cBut it sounds like a great story for him.\u201d\u201cThey are both progressives, but stylistically they\u2019re very different,\u201d said Joseph P. Viteritti, a professor of public policy at Hunter College who wrote a book about Mr. de Blasio. \u201cCorey is a rough-and-tumble street politician. De Blasio is intellectual about things. He\u2019s not comfortable with the press. He\u2019s not a glad hander. It\u2019s a very different style than Corey\u2019s.\u201d\u201cThis is a kind of rare bird,\u201d Mark J. Green, the first to fill the public advocate role, said of Mr. Johnson\u2019s abbreviated tenure. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of like him putting on a costume for New Year\u2019s Eve or Halloween and trying it on for size.\u201dFor that reason, more than a dozen declared and all-but-declared candidates will be running in the nonpartisan special election in late February.\u201cWith the support of a speaker like Corey Johnson, who is interested in using every tool he\u2019s got to stand up to the mayor and who will soon be our next public advocate, I look forward to what can be accomplished in 45 days and thereafter,\u201d Mr. Kallos said.As for the more contentious issue of city control over the subway system, Mr. Johnson hinted that he had a plan, and that it would likely be unveiled within the next two months.\u201cI\u2019m going to soon have more to say in a very detailed way about what we think that should look like,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s a conversation that we have to start having now if we want to accomplish it, hopefully a couple of years from now.\u201dHe added: \u201cStay tuned!\u201dAdvertisement"}

But Facebook also assumed extraordinary power over the personal information of its 2.2 billion users \u2014 control it has wielded with little transparency or outside oversight.Facebook allowed Microsoft\u2019s Bing search engine to see the names of virtually all Facebook users\u2019 friends without consent, the records show, and gave Netflix and Spotify the ability to read Facebook users\u2019 private messages.The social network permitted Amazon to obtain users\u2019 names and contact information through their friends, and it let Yahoo view streams of friends\u2019 posts as recently as this summer, despite public statements that it had stopped that type of sharing years earlier.But the documents, as well as interviews with about 50 former employees of Facebook and its corporate partners, reveal that Facebook allowed certain companies access to data despite those protections. They also raise questions about whether Facebook ran afoul of a 2011 consent agreement with the Federal Trade Commission that barred the social network from sharing user data without explicit permission.In all, the deals described in the documents benefited more than 150 companies \u2014 most of them tech businesses, including online retailers and entertainment sites, but also automakers and media organizations. Their applications sought the data of hundreds of millions of people a month, the records show. The deals, the oldest of which date to 2010, were all active in 2017. Some were still in effect this year.In an interview, Steve Satterfield, Facebook\u2019s director of privacy and public policy, said none of the partnerships violated users\u2019 privacy or the F.T.C. agreement. Contracts required the companies to abide by Facebook policies, he added.Still, Facebook executives have acknowledged missteps over the past year. \u201cWe know we\u2019ve got work to do to regain people\u2019s trust,\u201d Mr. Satterfield said. \u201cProtecting people\u2019s information requires stronger teams, better technology and clearer policies, and that\u2019s where we\u2019ve been focused for most of 2018.\u201d He said that the partnerships were \u201cone area of focus\u201d and that Facebook was in the process of winding many of them down.Facebook has found no evidence of abuse by its partners, a spokeswoman said. Some of the largest partners, including Amazon, Microsoft and Yahoo, said they had used the data appropriately, but declined to discuss the sharing deals in detail. Facebook did say that it had mismanaged some of its partnerships, allowing certain companies\u2019 access to continue long after they had shut down the features that required the data.Data privacy experts disputed Facebook\u2019s assertion that most partnerships were exempted from the regulatory requirements, expressing skepticism that businesses as varied as device makers, retailers and search companies would be viewed alike by the agency. \u201cThe only common theme is that they are partnerships that would benefit the company in terms of development or growth into an area that they otherwise could not get access to,\u201d said Ashkan Soltani, former chief technologist at the F.T.C.Mr. Soltani and three former employees of the F.T.C.\u2019s consumer protection division, which brought the case that led to the consent decree, said in interviews that its data-sharing deals had probably violated the agreement.\u201cThis is just giving third parties permission to harvest data without you being informed of it or giving consent to it,\u201d said David Vladeck, who formerly ran the F.T.C.\u2019s consumer protection bureau. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how this unconsented-to data harvesting can at all be justified under the consent decree.\u201dFacebook\u2019s stock price has fallen, and a group of shareholders has called for Mr. Zuckerberg to step aside as chairman. Shareholders also have filed a lawsuit alleging that executives failed to impose effective privacy safeguards. Angry users started a #DeleteFacebook movement.\u201cI don\u2019t believe it is legitimate to enter into data-sharing partnerships where there is not prior informed consent from the user,\u201d said Roger McNamee, an early investor in Facebook. \u201cNo one should trust Facebook until they change their business model.\u201dPersonal data is the oil of the 21st century, a resource worth billions to those who can most effectively extract and refine it. American companies alone are expected to spend close to $20 billion by the end of 2018 to acquire and process consumer data, according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau.Few companies have better data than Facebook and its rival, Google, whose popular products give them an intimate view into the daily lives of billions of people \u2014 and allow them to dominate the digital advertising market.Facebook has never sold its user data, fearful of user backlash and wary of handing would-be competitors a way to duplicate its most prized asset. Instead, internal documents show, it did the next best thing: granting other companies access to parts of the social network in ways that advanced its own interests.Facebook began forming data partnerships when it was still a relatively young company. Mr. Zuckerberg was determined to weave Facebook\u2019s services into other sites and platforms, believing it would stave off obsolescence and insulate Facebook from competition. Every corporate partner that integrated Facebook data into its online products helped drive the platform\u2019s expansion, bringing in new users, spurring them to spend more time on Facebook and driving up advertising revenue. At the same time, Facebook got critical data back from its partners.The partnerships were so important that decisions about forming them were vetted at high levels, sometimes by Mr. Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer, Facebook officials said. While many of the partnerships were announced publicly, the details of the sharing arrangements typically were confidential.By 2013, Facebook had entered into more such partnerships than its midlevel employees could easily track, according to interviews with two former employees. (Like the more than 30 other former employees interviewed for this article, they spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements or still maintained relationships with top Facebook officials.)So they built a tool that did the technical work of turning special access on and off and also kept records on what are known internally as \u201ccapabilities\u201d \u2014 the special privileges enabling companies to obtain data, in some cases without asking permission.The Times reviewed more than 270 pages of reports generated by the system \u2014 records that reflect just a portion of Facebook\u2019s wide-ranging deals. Among the revelations was that Facebook obtained data from multiple partners for a controversial friend-suggestion tool called \u201cPeople You May Know.\u201dFacebook, in turn, used contact lists from the partners, including Amazon, Yahoo and the Chinese company Huawei \u2014 which has been flagged as a security threat by American intelligence officials \u2014 to gain deeper insight into people\u2019s relationships and suggest more connections, the records show.Some of the access deals described in the documents were limited to sharing non-identifying information with research firms or enabling game makers to accommodate huge numbers of players. These raised no privacy concerns. But agreements with about a dozen companies did. Some enabled partners to see users\u2019 contact information through their friends \u2014 even after the social network, responding to complaints, said in 2014 that it was stripping all applications of that power.As of 2017, Sony, Microsoft, Amazon and others could obtain users\u2019 email addresses through their friends.Facebook also allowed Spotify, Netflix and the Royal Bank of Canada to read, write and delete users\u2019 private messages, and to see all participants on a thread \u2014 privileges that appeared to go beyond what the companies needed to integrate Facebook into their systems, the records show. Facebook acknowledged that it did not consider any of those three companies to be service providers. Spokespeople for Spotify and Netflix said those companies were unaware of the broad powers Facebook had granted them. A spokesman for Netflix said Wednesday that it had used the access only to enable customers to recommend TV shows and movies to their friends.\u201cBeyond these recommendations, we never accessed anyone\u2019s personal messages and would never do that,\u201d he said.Spotify, which could view messages of more than 70 million users a month, still offers the option to share music through Facebook Messenger. But Netflix and the Canadian bank no longer needed access to messages because they had deactivated features that incorporated it.These were not the only companies that had special access longer than they needed it. Yahoo, The Times and others could still get Facebook users\u2019 personal information in 2017.Yahoo could view real-time feeds of friends\u2019 posts for a feature that the company had ended in 2012. A Yahoo spokesman declined to discuss the partnership in detail but said the company did not use the information for advertising. The Times \u2014 one of nine media companies named in the documents \u2014 had access to users\u2019 friend lists for an article-sharing application it had discontinued in 2011. A spokeswoman for the news organization said it was not obtaining any data.Facebook empowered Apple to hide from Facebook users all indicators that its devices were asking for data. Apple devices also had access to the contact numbers and calendar entries of people who had changed their account settings to disable all sharing, the records show.Apple officials said they were not aware that Facebook had granted its devices any special access. They added that any shared data remained on the devices and was not available to anyone other than the users.Facebook officials said the company had disclosed its sharing deals in its privacy policy since 2010. But the language in the policy about its service providers does not specify what data Facebook shares, and with which companies. Mr. Satterfield, Facebook\u2019s privacy director, also said its partners were subject to \u201crigorous controls.\u201dPam Dixon, executive director of the World Privacy Forum, a nonprofit privacy research group, said that Facebook would have little power over what happens to users\u2019 information after sharing it broadly. \u201cIt travels,\u201d Ms. Dixon said. \u201cIt could be customized. It could be fed into an algorithm and decisions could be made about you based on that data.\u201dBesides Facebook, the F.T.C. has consent agreements with Google and Twitter stemming from alleged privacy violations.Facebook\u2019s agreement with regulators is a result of the company\u2019s early experiments with data sharing. In late 2009, it changed the privacy settings of the 400 million people then using the service, making some of their information accessible to all of the internet. Then it shared that information, including users\u2019 locations and religious and political leanings, with Microsoft and other partners.Facebook called this \u201cinstant personalization\u201d and promoted it as a step toward a better internet, where other companies would use the information to customize what people saw on sites like Bing. But the feature drew complaints from privacy advocates and many Facebook users that the social network had shared the information without permission.The F.T.C. investigated and in 2011 cited the privacy changes as a deceptive practice. Caught off guard, Facebook officials stopped mentioning instant personalization in public and entered into the consent agreement.Under the decree, the social network introduced a \u201ccomprehensive privacy program\u201d charged with reviewing new products and features. It was initially overseen by two chief privacy officers, their lofty title an apparent sign of Facebook\u2019s commitment. The company also hired PricewaterhouseCoopers to assess its privacy practices every two years.But the privacy program faced some internal resistance from the start, according to four former Facebook employees with direct knowledge of the company\u2019s efforts. Some engineers and executives, they said, considered the privacy reviews an impediment to quick innovation and growth. And the core team responsible for coordinating the reviews \u2014 numbering about a dozen people by 2016 \u2014 was moved around within Facebook\u2019s sprawling organization, sending mixed signals about how seriously the company took it, the ex-employees said.Critically, many of Facebook\u2019s special sharing partnerships were not subject to extensive privacy program reviews, two of the former employees said. Executives believed that because the partnerships were governed by business contracts requiring them to follow Facebook data policies, they did not require the same level of scrutiny. The privacy team had limited ability to review or suggest changes to some of those data-sharing agreements, which had been negotiated by more senior officials at the company.Facebook officials said that members of the privacy team had been consulted on the sharing agreements, but that the level of review \u201cdepended on the specific partnership and the time it was created.\u201dIn 2014, Facebook ended instant personalization and walled off access to friends\u2019 information. But in a previously unreported agreement, the social network\u2019s engineers continued allowing Bing; Pandora, the music streaming service; and Rotten Tomatoes, the movie and television review site, access to much of the data they had gotten for the discontinued feature. Bing had access to the information through last year, the records show, and the two other companies did as of late summer, according to tests by The Times.Facebook officials said the data sharing did not violate users\u2019 privacy because it allowed access only to public data \u2014 though that included data that the social network had made public in 2009. They added that the social network made a mistake in allowing the access to continue for the three companies, but declined to elaborate. Spokeswomen for Pandora and Rotten Tomatoes said the businesses were not aware of any special access.Facebook also declined to discuss the other capabilities Bing was given, including the ability to see all users\u2019 friends.Microsoft officials said that Bing was using the data to build profiles of Facebook users on Microsoft servers. They declined to provide details, other than to say the information was used in \u201cfeature development\u201d and not for advertising. Microsoft has since deleted the data, the officials said.For some advocates, the torrent of user data flowing out of Facebook has called into question not only Facebook\u2019s compliance with the F.T.C. agreement, but also the agency\u2019s approach to privacy regulation.\u201cThere has been an endless barrage of how Facebook has ignored users\u2019 privacy settings, and we truly believed that in 2011 we had solved this problem,\u201d said Marc Rotenberg, head of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, an online privacy group that filed one of the first complaints about Facebook with federal regulators. \u201cWe brought Facebook under the regulatory authority of the F.T.C. after a tremendous amount of work. The F.T.C. has failed to act.\u201dAccording to Facebook, most of its data partnerships fall under an exemption to the F.T.C. agreement. The company argues that the partner companies are service providers \u2014 companies that use the data only \u201cfor and at the direction of\u201d Facebook and function as an extension of the social network.But Mr. Vladeck and other former F.T.C. officials said that Facebook was interpreting the exemption too broadly. They said the provision was intended to allow Facebook to perform the same everyday functions as other companies, such as sending and receiving information over the internet or processing credit card transactions, without violating the consent decree.When The Times reported last summer on the partnerships with device makers, Facebook used the term \u201cintegration partners\u201d to describe BlackBerry, Huawei and other manufacturers that pulled Facebook data to provide social-media-style features on smartphones. All such integration partners, Facebook asserted, were covered by the service provider exemption.Since then, as the social network has disclosed its data sharing deals with other kinds of businesses \u2014 including internet companies such as Yahoo \u2014 Facebook has labeled them integration partners, too.Facebook even recategorized one company, the Russian search giant Yandex, as an integration partner.Facebook records show Yandex had access in 2017 to Facebook\u2019s unique user IDs even after the social network stopped sharing them with other applications, citing privacy risks. A spokeswoman for Yandex, which was accused last year by Ukraine\u2019s security service of funneling its user data to the Kremlin, said the company was unaware of the access and did not know why Facebook had allowed it to continue. She added that the Ukrainian allegations \u201chave no merit.\u201dIn October, Facebook said Yandex was not an integration partner. But in early December, as The Times was preparing to publish this article, Facebook told congressional lawmakers that it was.An F.T.C. spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the commission agreed with Facebook\u2019s interpretation of the service provider exception, which is likely to figure in the F.T.C.\u2019s ongoing Facebook investigation. She also declined to say whether the commission had ever received a complete list of partners that Facebook considered service providers.The first assessment, sent to the F.T.C. in 2013, found only \u201climited\u201d evidence that Facebook had monitored those partners\u2019 use of data. The finding was redacted from a public copy of the assessment, which gave Facebook\u2019s privacy program a passing grade over all.Mr. Wyden and other critics have questioned whether the assessments \u2014 in which the F.T.C. essentially outsources much of its day-to-day oversight to companies like PricewaterhouseCoopers \u2014 are effective. As with other businesses under consent agreements with the F.T.C., Facebook pays for and largely dictated the scope of its assessments, which are limited mostly to documenting that Facebook has conducted the internal privacy reviews it claims it had.How closely Facebook monitored its data partners is uncertain. Most of Facebook\u2019s partners declined to discuss what kind of reviews or audits Facebook subjected them to. Two former Facebook partners, whose deals with the social network dated to 2010, said they could find no evidence that Facebook had ever audited them. One was BlackBerry. The other was Yandex.Facebook officials said that while the social network audited partners only rarely, it managed them closely.\u201cThese were high-touch relationships,\u201d Mr. Satterfield said.An earlier version of this article misstated the year that Yahoo ended a feature on its website that incorporated Facebook user data. The feature was discontinued in 2012, not 2011.Matthew Rosenberg contributed reporting. Research was contributed by Grace Ashford, Susan C.

{"Headline": "\u2018It\u2019s a Wonderful Life\u2019 (1946) Review", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe late and beloved Dexter Fellows, who was a circus press agent for many years, had an interesting theory on the theatre which suited his stimulating trade. He held that the final curtain of every drama, no matter what, should benignly fall upon the whole cast sitting down to a turkey dinner and feeling fine. Mr. Fellows should be among us to see Frank Capra\u2019s \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life,\u201d which opened on Saturday at the Globe Theatre. He would find it very much to his taste.For a turkey dinner, with Christmas trimmings, is precisely what\u2019s cooking at the end of this quaint and engaging modern parable on virtue being its own reward. And a whole slew of cozy small-town characters who have gone through a lot in the past two hours are waiting around to eat it\u2014or, at least, to watch James Stewart gobble it up. For it is really Mr. Stewart, who does most of the heavy suffering in this film, and it is he who, in the end, is most deserving of the white meat and the stuffing.That is because Mr. Capra, back from the war, has resumed with a will his previously manifest penchant for portraying folks of simple, homely worth. And in this picture about a young fellow who wants to break away from his small-town life and responsibilities but is never able to do so because slowly they close in upon him, Mr. Capra has gone all out to show that it is really a family, friends and honest toil that make the \u201cwonderful life.\u201dHis hero is a personable fellow who wants to travel and do big things but ultimately finds himself running a building-and-loan association in a one-horse town, married and locked in constant struggle with the greedy old banker of the town. And when it finally looks as though the banker is about to drive him to ruin, he makes what appears a brash endeavor to take his own baffled life. Whereupon a heavenly messenger providentially intercedes and shows him, in fanciful fashion, what the town would have been like without him. The vision is so distressing that he returns to his lot with boundless joy \u2014 and is saved, also providentialy, by the financial assistance of his friends.In composing this moralistic fable, Mr. Capra and his writers have tossed in a great abundance of colloquial incidents and emotional tangles of a mistful, humorous sort. The boyhood of his hero, the frolic at a high school dance, the clumsy pursuit of a courtship\u2014all are shown in an entertaining way, despite the too frequent inclinations of every one to act juvenile and coy. And the heavier sections of the drama are managed in a tense, precipitate style.As the hero, Mr. Stewart does a warmly appealing job, indicating that he has grown in spiritual stature as well as in talent during the years he was in the war. And Donna Reed is remarkably poised and gracious as his adoring sweet-heart and wife. Thomas Mitchell, Beulah Bondi, H. B. Warner and Samuel S. Hinds stand out among the group of assorted small-town characters who give the picture variety and verve. But Lionel Barrymore\u2019s banker is almost a caricature of Scrooge, and Henry Travers\u2019 \u201cheavenly messenger\u201d is a little too sticky for our taste.Indeed, the weakness of this picture, from this reviewer\u2019s point of view, is the sentimentality of it \u2014 its illusory concept of life. Mr. Capra\u2019s nice people are charming, his small town is a quite beguiling place and his pattern for solving problems is most optimistic and facile. But somehow they all resemble theatrical attitudes rather than average realities. And Mr. Capra\u2019s \u201cturkey dinners\u201d philosophy, while emotionally gratifying, doesn\u2019t fill the hungry paunch.Running time: 103 minutes.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Are the Keys to Economic Recovery?", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW ORLEANS \u2014 As Mayor Mike Duggan was trying to revive Detroit, he traveled to other parts of the country and talked with planners and officials in flourishing urban areas. He had vacant buildings, left behind in the early 2000s, as jobs had dried up and 260,000 people left the financially stagnant city. Mr. Duggan heard about the downside of prosperity, including gentrification. So he asked, \u201cIf you were in Brooklyn and you could rewind the clock, what would you do differently?\u201dLeaders of other cities told him that instead of displacing existing residents, they would work harder to keep them in place as rents and property values increased. Mr. Duggan returned to Detroit and worked to help carry out an ordinance requiring developers who buy discounted city-owned land or receive a certain level of municipal support to include a minimum of 20 percent of permanent affordable-housing units in their buildings.Ms. Wylde said that Amazon was bringing 150,000 jobs to New York because the city\u2019s universities had worked hard to develop skills within the city\u2019s work force.\u201cThey are not coming because of the incentives we offered,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re coming for talent; they need a talent pipeline that is very big and that they can tap.\u201dMr. Duggan also required developers who received subsidies to ensure that 51 percent of their employees were Detroit residents. Those who did not meet that requirement paid a penalty that went into a fund to help train local residents to be plumbers, carpenters and electricians.In four years, developers who had started out with 6 percent local residents have risen to about 30 percent, he said.When Mr. Tubbs took office, he talked to his staff about Stockton\u2019s high poverty rates \u2014 22 percent of its residents were under the poverty line in 2017. \u201cThe crux of all our issues is poverty,\u201d he told staff members. \u201cLet\u2019s find the most radical intervention for poverty. Give me a policy.\u201dAfter extensive research, his staff came back and told him, \u201cGive out a basic income; give people money.\u201dAt first, they had conversations about \u201cthe dignity of work,\u201d Mr. Tubbs said. \u201cWork has dignity,\u201d he said. But he added that it was \u201cinherently undignified\u201d for people working 14 hours a day or driving lengthy Uber shifts to try to pay their bills.\u201cI started out as a skeptic,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now I\u2019m 100 percent resolved.

{"Headline": "\u2018This Was Our Road\u2019: Nostalgia Flows in Seattle as an Old Highway Nears Its End", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "Seattle plans to tear down the Alaskan Way Viaduct, the hulking, elevated road through downtown. The mayor anticipates \u201ca collective gasp.\u201dSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 Kurt Cobain performed in a grubby club underneath it. Drivers called it a road of kings, four wide open lanes far above the pedestrian horde. And generations of Seattle residents felt a shiver of romance in the moody shadows it cast over a waterfront already famous for gray skies and gloom.Now, the Alaskan Way Viaduct is going away.The viaduct, the last remaining 1.4-mile stretch of this city\u2019s elevated highway through downtown, has been a sublimely ugly and stoutly utilitarian force of engineering since 1953. After years of planning for an alternative, the viaduct will be demolished and hauled away early next year.Seattle has been made and remade in transformational moments \u2014 the 1890s Klondike Gold Rush, the 1962 World\u2019s Fair, the explosive rise of Amazon \u2014 and the demise of the viaduct will open up a whole new waterfront. Where there was hulking concrete, there will be a view of Puget Sound. Where there was a roar of traffic, there will be relative quiet.\u201cIt will transform the city in ways people don\u2019t even anticipate,\u201d said Jenny A. Durkan, the mayor of Seattle. \u201cWhen the viaduct is removed, there will be a collective gasp.\u201dIn truth, the end of the viaduct is less a moment of change for the city than a recognition that it already has changed. Seattle\u2019s gritty, freight-hauling waterfront of another era has long since moved to the city\u2019s margins, leaving this downtown section with a growing number of tourists, apartments and cruise ships.No one wanted to be anywhere near the working waterfront of the 1920s when planning for the viaduct, four stories above ground, began as a way to move cars quickly through the area. But this part of Seattle is now the focal point of growth in one of the nation\u2019s fastest growing big cities.Once the viaduct is gone, there are plans for a 20-acre waterfront park, borrowing from New York\u2019s High Line along the Hudson River, Chicago\u2019s Millennium Park on Lake Michigan, and the Harbor Promenade in Oslo. Seattle has never had a central park. The viaduct will be replaced with a tunnel under downtown for cars, as part of a $3.3 billion overhaul.\u201cThe viaduct coming down gives us arguably our only opportunity to really create breathing room for the heart of the city again,\u201d said Marshall Foster, the director of the city\u2019s office of the waterfront and civic projects. \u201cFundamentally it\u2019s about reclaiming that waterfront, where the city started, as the front porch.\u201dThere were plenty of reasons to tear down the structure, including safety concerns revealed in 2001 after an earthquake. The new two-mile tunnel is expected to remove the street noise from vehicles and encourage the city\u2019s growing public transit system.\u201cO, Viaduct, you\u2019re outta luck, we put you up and we let you down,\u201d the song goes. \u201cThey said you\u2019d fall and kill us all, but you were tried and true.\u201dTony de Lapp, 35, a car enthusiast who works in a salmon processing plant, has organized a memorial drive along the Alaskan Way Viaduct, and underneath it, past its 400 concrete columns.\u201cThis was our road, our way of getting around,\u201d Mr. de Lapp said.Besides, he added, \u201cI don\u2019t like tunnels.\u201dTrevor Boone, who co-owns a guitar store a block from the viaduct in Seattle\u2019s oldest neighborhood, Pioneer Square, wonders what the place will sound like when the roar of the traffic overhead \u2014 90,000 vehicles a day \u2014 suddenly vanishes on January 11.\u201cWhen it\u2019s silent, I might miss it a little bit \u2014 it\u2019s like that friendly white noise,\u201d said Mr. Boone, 29. \u201cYou hear it all the time and it\u2019s like a totally subliminal thing now.\u201dSome corners of the city, including the Pioneer Square neighborhood, have wrestled with rising crime and homelessness lately, and the prospect of more upheaval seemed daunting. A sparkling new waterfront would mean more change, but no one seemed certain how far the economic growth would spread and what it might mean for their block.\u201cI want to be optimistic, I want to be just pro-everything because it\u2019s happening whether I want it to or not,\u201d said Cynthia Hope, the owner of Hands of the World, a shop selling folk art and jewelry. But Ms. Hope said she already sees the chemistry shifting. \u201cOld and funky and market traditional businesses are not faring well,\u201d she said. \u201cYou come down on a Friday or Saturday night and say, \u2018Where is everybody drinking beer?\u2019 and it\u2019s not in the market, it\u2019s in the newer places.\u201dIn an interview, Ms. Durkan, the mayor, said that given the pace of growth in her city, she understood residents\u2019 worries. Of 725,000 Seattle residents, 115,000 arrived just since 2010. Zoning has changed, allowing denser housing. Few neighborhoods have been untouched.\u201cWe have this moment where get to make that change intentional, and get to decide what it\u2019s going to be,\u201d Ms. Durkan said of the transportation overhaul. \u201cYou don\u2019t get that opportunity many times in an already built city.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Another Headache for California From the D.M.V., This Time Involving \u2018Real ID\u2019", "Date": "2018-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 The California Department of Motor Vehicles is under renewed scrutiny after a federal government warning that its Real ID protocols do not comply with security standards, the latest in a series of missteps by a state agency struggling to maintain public trust.The Department of Homeland Security notified officials at the California D.M.V. in November that its process for verifying residency before issuing identification cards \u2014 including driver\u2019s licenses \u2014 did not meet federal requirements. California has already issued cards to 2.3 million individuals so far. The D.M.V., which did not immediately disclose that notification to the public, is now seeking to ease confusion among those affected.The agency has said that Californians who received an ID this year do not have to have their cards reissued. But new applicants will need to show two forms of residency verification \u2014 instead of one \u2014 beginning this spring in order to receive a Real ID card.\u201cAs far as we know, anyone holding a Real ID currently, as long as it\u2019s valid, the feds will accept it and honor it,\u201d said Jaime Garza, a D.M.V. spokesman. \u201cWe basically have told Californians: \u2018If you\u2019ve got the card, don\u2019t worry about it.\u2019\u201dThe confusion over the state\u2019s Real ID application process has come at a critical moment for the agency, which has been embroiled in a series of controversies this year. The D.M.V. announced earlier this month that as many as 589 people were unable to vote in the November midterm election because the agency failed to file hundreds of voter registration forms and change-of-address requests as part of its Motor Voter program. In September, the department announced it had mishandled 23,000 voter registrations. In October, it announced it had mistakenly registered 1,500 individuals to vote.California Secretary of State Alex Padilla issued a sharp rebuke of the D.M.V. director, Jean Shiomoto, this month over the voter registration mistakes. \u201cThe director of D.M.V. has lost my confidence and trust,\u201d he wrote in a letter to Gov. Jerry Brown and governor-elect Gavin Newsom. \u201cI urge you to promptly appoint new leadership to D.M.V.\u201dMs. Shiomoto recently announced that she intends to retire at the end of the year. Mr. Brown has appointed Bill Davidson, deputy director of the D.M.V., as her acting replacement as of Dec. 31.Jim Patterson, a Republican state assemblyman from Fresno, said the agency needed a radical overhaul to regain the trust of the public. He expressed concern that the agency will not be able to handle the coming rush of California residents seeking Real IDs ahead of the October 2020 deadline.\u201cThe D.M.V. is failing in its fundamental mission in respect to driver\u2019s licenses and registrations,\u201d said Mr. Patterson, who has become one of the agency\u2019s most vocal critics. \u201cBetween now and 2020, you\u2019re going to get hundreds of thousands of people rushing through the D.M.V. to get their ID by the deadline, going through a system that is totally broken. The infrastructure of the D.M.V. is simply unable to cope.\u201dMr. Patterson urged Mr. Newsom and the State Legislature to prioritize fixing the D.M.V. in the upcoming year. He also said he intended to push for an audit of the agency when the Legislature reconvenes in January, adding that he would like to see Elaine Howell, the state auditor, take an approach similar to her audit of the state\u2019s High Speed Rail Authority.\u201cWe won\u2019t get to the solutions if we\u2019re too scared to find the problems,\u201d Mr. Patterson said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we get to the reforms we need unless the next governor and the Legislature put their heads together.\u201dThe state D.M.V. modeled its Real ID residency verification system after one used in Wisconsin, which required individuals to provide one form of proof in person at the D.M.V., such as a utility bill or a lease. An identification card would then be mailed to the primary address listed by the individual seeking the ID; receipt of the card was considered sufficient secondary proof of residency.But in November, the D.M.V. was told in a letter from the Department of Homeland Security that its system was not compliant with federal requirements. Beginning in April, individuals will have to provide two forms of proof of identity in person.D.M.V. officials said they were previously assured by D.H.S. that such a system was in line with federal guidelines.\u201cWe have been following the guidelines from Homeland Security from the beginning in terms of how we handled this,\u201d said Jaime Garza, a D.M.V. spokesman.Mr. Patterson tried to take a positive stance, saying he believed that \u201cfrom monumental failure could come a real monumental improvement.\u201d He said he would like to see state leadership draw from the experience of top managers in Silicon Valley, particularly business executives who have run large bureaucracies.\u201cIf Amazon can develop the technology to deliver a Christmas present in a single day, I think there\u2019s a way to get improvements at the D.M.V.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon Went to City Hall. Things Got Loud, Quickly.", "Date": "2018-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was variously described as a rite of passage, a take-your-medicine moment and a very New York-style welcome: Two Amazon executives raised their right hands and then faced more than three hours of public grilling by the New York City Council.But if the ritual of barbed questions and evasive answers was not unusual, the circumstances of Wednesday\u2019s hearing were: Amazon does not need the Council\u2019s approval to locate new offices in Long Island City, Queens. Still, the appearance marked the company\u2019s first major foray into New York\u2019s public spotlight since announcing the deal.Council members took advantage of the executives sitting before them to vent their anger at the terms of the agreement, as well as at Amazon\u2019s business practices, treatment of labor unions and work on behalf of federal immigration officials.They were backed up, with applause, shouts and jeers, by a spectrum of liberal opponents who packed the Council\u2019s chambers, unfurling an anti-Amazon banner from the balcony at the start of the hearing. Several times the crowd drowned out the two executives as they attempted to explain the merits of the deal struck with the company last month by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio.\u201cWe believe this project will be a positive economic impact for the city and the state,\u201d said Brian Huseman, vice president of public policy for Amazon. Repeatedly, his remarks were met by guffaws from the audience of antagonists.Lobbyists for Amazon, hired to navigate an increasingly hostile political landscape, sat in a row near the front, and could be seen occasionally huddling with a de Blasio official on the sideline.At the Council on Wednesday, opponents of the deal, which would bring an estimated 25,000 jobs to Long Island City, in exchange for as much as $3 billion in state and city incentives, strongly outnumbered supporters. None of the Council members in the overwhelmingly Democratic body spoke up in favor of the deal, and they vented their frustration at having been left out of the closed-door negotiations that preceded the announcement of the deal.\u201cJames, you disrespected this body with how you handled this process,\u201d Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer, who represents Long Island City, said to James Patchett, the president of the city\u2019s Economic Development Corporation, during a particularly aggressive exchange.\u201cWe got played,\u201d the Council speaker, Corey Johnson, said to Mr. Patchett at another point, speaking of Amazon\u2019s nationwide competition. \u201cThey were able to pit city after city against each other.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know who I\u2019m more angry at: the administration or Amazon,\u201d said Jumaane Williams, a councilman from Brooklyn who is a candidate for public advocate.But the rhetorical points they scored over the course of the often testy hearing remained symbolic: By design, the agreement between the city, the state and Amazon does not give the City Council the power to veto it. Instead, the company\u2019s development of new offices along the East River will be subject to a state planning process.The company appeared before the Council voluntarily; representatives of the state agency that negotiated the deal declined an invitation to attend.By the time it was over Mr. Huseman and another Amazon executive, Holly Sullivan, looked as though they may have regretted coming.Throughout the hearing, Ms. Sullivan and Mr. Huseman, who kept his hands folded on the table in front of him, tried to maintain an even tone and a posture of listening even when the questions were witheringly direct.\u201cAmazon is a 1 trillion dollar company is that accurate?\u201d Mr. Johnson asked.\u201cI think it\u2019s close to that,\u201d Mr. Huseman said.\u201cSo why should we give you that money?\u201d Mr. Johnson said of the incentives.Mr. Huseman responded that the incentives in the deal were based on performance. The company, he said, made its decision to come to Queens and open another large office in a Virginia suburb of Washington a day before it was publicly announced in November.He and Ms. Sullivan characterized their presence at the Council as part of an effort to learn about New York City and the needs of the Queens community. Explaining why the company preferred a state process rather than the city\u2019s more lengthy one, Mr. Huseman said that Amazon\u2019s goal \u201cis to hire workers quickly.\u201d\u201cTalent was the primary driver for our location decision,\u201d Ms. Sullivan said at one point.Mr. Patchett showed more frustration with the Council, sparring at several points with Mr. Van Bramer, who pressed him to discuss Mr. de Blasio\u2019s involvement in the negotiations.\u201cI certainly spoke with him or met with him in person over 10 times,\u201d Mr. Patchett said of his interactions with the mayor.\u201cSo the mayor cannot meet with many of his own commissioners about everyday city business and how the city functions,\u201d Mr. Van Bramer said, \u201cbut he can meet with you 10 times at least in the last year just on this Amazon deal?\u201dMr. de Blasio, who has described himself as being from the same wing of the Democratic Party as Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, defended the deal at an unrelated news conference after the hearing, even as he professed a connection with the activists opposing it in the streets.\u201cI totally feel solidarity with them,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m in their wing of the party and I\u2019m honored to be in the same wing with them. It doesn\u2019t mean we agree on everything.\u201dThe hearing ended with a harangue by Mr. Johnson after the Amazon executives at first refused to commit the company to attend future Council hearings.\u201cSorry sir, I\u2019m humbled and grateful,\u201d Mr. Huseman stumbled as Mr. Johnson chastised him for delivering the same comment several times about wanting a dialogue. \u201cBut you\u2019re asking me to commit to a specific hearing.\u201dFinally, he agreed: \u201cAbsolutely we\u2019ll come.\u201dStill, that was not enough.\u201cIt is insulting,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Johnson said, \u201cfor you not to say right away.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Legalized Pot Isn\u2019t Going to Save Us", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBig CityEarlier this week, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced that he would push to make pot smoking \u2014 for fun \u2014 legal in New York State. It was quite a statement for a governor who had repeatedly questioned the wisdom before, calling it an enabler of more pernicious habits.The governor made his argument deploying the progressive rhetoric he has turned to increasingly as his neoliberal leanings have become less politically expedient. That rhetoric rightly maintains that legalization of the drug is essential to redressing injustices in a criminal justice system that has overwhelmingly penalized young men of color for carrying or smoking pot.Two days after Mr. Cuomo made his commitments known, in fact, Brooklyn\u2019s district attorney, Eric Gonzalez, asked a judge to obliterate more than two dozen past marijuana convictions; his office vacated open warrants for more than 1,400 people who had missed court dates for possession cases. In the absence of such erasures on a broad scale, merely legalizing the drug would do nothing to remediate the damage inflicted on thousands of people ensnared in a legal universe that so severely handicaps them for doing what white people pull off with impunity. This is why mayor Bill de Blasio followed the governor\u2019s announcement with his own endorsements of legalization \u2014 this too a reversal \u2014 recommending that convictions for marijuana-related crimes be expunged automatically.In previous eras, decriminalization had been championed largely by libertarians, who saw a lot of government waste in a system that needlessly locked people up, and by hippies, who just wanted to be left alone to get stoned.Of course, lawmakers in New York are not primarily motivated by the desire to make our daily chores less of a drag. They quickly suggested that taxing marijuana could fix the transit system, in need of $60 billion worth of repairs. They invited us to envision a world in which pot really was a gateway \u2014 to more efficient infrastructure!The enthusiasm for revising the legal status of pot around the country has for the most part obscured any debate about consequences to public health. That pot is regarded as relatively harmless is troubling, because much of what we know about it is based on studies conducted nearly 50 years ago at a time when what was consumed was much less potent than it is now.Mr. Caulkins\u2019s research also shows us who is likely to bear these health burdens to a disproportionate degree \u2014 and it is not snowboarders in Vail. Looking at a decade\u2019s worth of federal surveys on drug use, he and a partner determined that Americans with a household income of less than $20,000 accounted for close to 30 percent of all marijuana use, even though they make up less than 20 percent of the population.One fantasy that advocates of legalization have is that changes in the law will energize a redistribution of wealth, not only because tax revenue from pot sales can be funneled to various worthy causes but also because the poor will reap new entrepreneurial opportunities \u2014 in every neighborhood a Stringer Bell.Mr. de Blasio has made a big point of saying that a legalized pot industry should not be overly corporate, and that retailers in parts of the city that have been so adversely affected by punishing drug laws get licenses and the chance to make money. But this is the same mayor, who during five years of presiding over the city, has been wholly unable to stop the onslaught of chain stores in New York, wholly unable to preserve the fortunes of a longstanding local merchant class.I asked Mark Kleiman, of the Marron Institute at New York University and one of the most sought-after experts on drug policy in the country, what the future looked like. He foresaw a world in which pot, legal in ever more states and eventually at the national level, will get cheaper and cheaper. The expected tax windfalls would become less likely, unless pot is taxed at the level of potency rather than sale price. The trend toward vaping means there will be greater demand for oil, and if you can melt everything down for oil, pot will be less expensive to produce, because at that point you can grow it like corn.\u201cYou can produce all the intoxicant used in a year on 40,000 acres,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Kleiman said. \u201cThat\u2019s 20 family farms in Iowa.\u201d Eventually a joint could cost a nickel; Nabisco will take over edibles. \u201cYou will have pot grown in Iowa, processed by Cargill and sold by Amazon,\u201d Mr. Kleiman said. \u201cNo one will make money except Jeff Bezos, who always makes money.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Some we panned. Others were flops. Others just weren\u2019t particularly holiday-focused.When Chevy Chase finds a good way to hurt himself in \u201cNational Lampoon\u2019s Christmas Vacation,\u201d he generally tries it more than once. The board that whacks him in the chin is liable to strike again. Floors will collapse, ladders fall, Christmas trees come hurtling through windows. The film\u2019s penchant for breakage jokes is rivaled only by its taste for gross-out humor, and for the kinds of double-entendres best appreciated by 7-year-old boys. One extended comedy routine involves the panic caused by a runaway squirrel.Fatigue is in the air. This third look at the quintessentially middle-American Griswold family, led by Clark (Mr. Chase) and the very patient Ellen (Beverly D\u2019Angelo) is only a weary shadow of the original \u201cNational Lampoon\u2019s Vacation,\u201d which found a lot to laugh at as it followed the dopey paterfamilias Clark and his quarrelsome brood on a hellish cross-country journey in their station wagon. The new film does little more than reintroduce these familiar characters (with new actors playing the children, who would otherwise be college age by now) and let them get on one another\u2019s nerves in earnest.The screenplay for \u201cNational Lampoon\u2019s Christmas Vacation,\u201d by John Hughes, makes no pretense at being anything other than a disjointed collection of running gags; if it weren\u2019t for a calendar that marks the approach of Christmas Day, the film would have no forward momentum at all. The film also looks tacky, what with flimsy props and occasionally blurry cinematography, and the direction by Jeremiah S. Chechik displays comic timing that is uncertain at best. In spite of all this, however, the Griswolds do occasionally have their moments.The best thing the new film does is to bring back Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid), the wily, scene-stealing slob whose disgusting habits are a source of considerable amusement. There is also a good deal of funny seasonal kitsch, like the reindeer cups (complete with antlers) from which Clark and Eddie quaff their eggnog. Also on hand are a number of curious actors, like William Hickey and Mae Questel as a pair of elderly relatives, who don\u2019t do much but make the film more interesting than it otherwise might be. Miss Questel, the model for Betty Boop, provides a very Booplike rendition of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner.\u201d\u201cNational Lampoon\u2019s Christmas Vacation\u201d is rated PG-13 (\u201cSpecial Parental Guidance Suggested for Those Younger Than 13\u201d).

Ng, 38, has become a singular force of literary activism, championing the careers of fellow writers who need a boost.\u201cCeleste has written a collection of modern women (and men) whose characters embody so many of the struggles and complexities of this time we are living in,\u201d Washington wrote in an email.Witherspoon, a fan of \u201cEverything I Never Told You,\u201d first heard about \u201cLittle Fires Everywhere\u201d \u2014 which she called, by email, \u201can incredible mystery that unravels with real character exploration\u201d \u2014 when she met Ng at a cocktail party in Southern California in 2016. She subsequently made \u201cLittle Fires Everywhere\u201d her September 2017 book club pick.\u201cI haven\u2019t surveyed exactly who she\u2019s blurbed,\u201d Kwon continued, \u201cbut I have especially noticed her name on the books of Asian-American women who are coming out with their first books. And that just seems like a very intentionally generous thing that she\u2019s doing.\u201dNg\u2019s strategic benevolence is aimed at promoting her peers, of course, but also at fixing skewed, reductive notions of representation.\u201cOne of my longstanding irritations with the way that we view the world,\u201d she said, \u201cis like, who\u2019s going to be the next Jhumpa Lahiri? Who\u2019s going to be the next Amy Tan?

Though she always thought it would be \u201con the side.\u201dThe irony is that nearly 20 years ago Ng had a semi-pro sideline as a crafter. Around 2000 she set up a website to sell her meticulously sculpted clay miniatures to collectors. One of her most unusual commissions? A plucked turkey, its head positioned to dangle off a tiny table.Ng\u2019s more conventional professional plans shifted after her graduation from Harvard University in 2002. A sobering brush with textbook publishing and an inspiring fiction writing class at the Harvard Extension School clarified Ng\u2019s determination to pursue a writing career. At graduate school at the University of Michigan, she met her agent Julie Barer and left school with most of a short story collection and two nascent chapters of \u201cEverything I Never Told You.\u201dIn the six years between the end of graduate school and the 2012 sale of her first novel, Ng started keeping a color-coded document detailing each time she submitted a story to a literary magazine. She referred to it as the Spreadsheet of Shame. The file is still active but marks an era when Ng was mired in the struggle to tame the multiple timelines and points of view in her first novel.\u201cThere was a period of time where I was like, I am never going to write again,\u201d Ng said. \u201cI hadn\u2019t finished my book when we had our son,\u201d she added. \u201cThe first four months were really hard. I was dealing with postpartum depression.\u201dThen she won a Pushcart Prize for her story \u201cGirls, at Play,\u201d published in the Bellevue Literary Review. \u201cIt was this huge boost of confidence. It was a story that I had submitted, and it had been rejected like 17 times.\u201dAfter the years Ng spent laboring over \u201cEverything I Never Told You\u201d \u2014 part of her fastidious process included making a panoramic chart on the walls of her office with index cards and color-coded string \u2014 the sale of her debut moved swiftly: \u201cThe whole thing, start to finish, took just under two weeks. I basically thought I was going to throw up the entire time,\u201d she said. The six-figure advance was \u201c10 times more than I expected. That part is sort of like the magic dream-come-true part,\u201d she said, though she still wondered, \u201cIs anyone who\u2019s not Asian going to want to read this book?\u201dAlmost five months after publication Amazon helped provide the answer.\u201cWe picked this book out of relative obscurity and watched with enormous pleasure as it became the mega seller that it is,\u201d said Sara Nelson, the former editorial director at Amazon and now executive editor at Harper, an imprint of HarperCollins.In 2017, under the editorial direction of Sarah Harrison Smith, Amazon picked \u201cLittle Fires Everywhere\u201d as their No. 2 book of the year, but publishing had already bought into Ng\u2019s vision: \u201cLittle Fires Everywhere\u201d sold for seven figures.As her success has grown so has the currency of her imprimatur.\u201cMy agent and my editor both were like, \u2018oh my God you know Celeste,\u2019\u201d Ms. Lee said \u201c\u2018That\u2019s so great.

{"Headline": "Best Movies of 2018", "Date": "2018-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOur chief film critics choose the films that moved them this year.Manohla DargisThe more I watched these films from the beginning of the 20th century, the more I began to think about the movie world \u2014 the Hollywood \u2014 that could have been. By the late 1920s, women were largely shut out of directing in the American industry until the mid-1960s. If film pioneers like Lois Weber and Alice Guy Blach\u00e9 had continued, it\u2019s possible that a radically different movie world might have emerged. In my alt-Hollywood fantasy, female and male filmmakers would have worked side by side, perhaps giving us unimagined stories and heroines. That history in turn might have laid the foundation for an equitable present rather than an industry defined by entrenched sexism.In this quietly political Trump-era documentary, Wiseman offers a long, searching look at a small American town where homespun charm exists side by side with steadfast isolationism.With their gently nodding, brilliantly colored flowers and shifting shadows, Dorsky\u2019s heart-soaringly beautiful films are reminders that cinema is also about light and form.A.O. ScottA four-way tie for first place may look like wanton indecisiveness, but to me these lyrical, visionary documentaries add up to an indelible composite portrait of America right now. At a time when we tend to see ourselves and our fellow citizens as sociological stereotypes and ideological clich\u00e9s, these highly personal films suggest that a different way of telling the American story \u2014 the crazy multiplicity of American stories \u2014 may still be possible. Not because the filmmakers offer visions of consensus, but precisely because each one digs deep into the conflicts and contradictions that run through every neighborhood, household and individual heart. \u201cMonrovia,\u201d filmed in a tiny, mostly white heartland town, is the latest work from an 88-year-old master. \u201cHale County,\u201d set in a rural mostly black part of Alabama, and \u201cMinding the Gap,\u201d set in a mixed Illinois industrial city, are first features by skilled and intuitive young directors. \u201cBisbee \u201917,\u201d named for a mining town in Arizona, is a powerful midcareer foray into historical memory and political strife.Casting Melissa McCarthy and Richard E. Grant as witty, cynical partners in crime in early \u201990s Manhattan is pretty much foolproof. They would be fun to watch if all they did was insult each other over drinks. They do a lot of that, and this movie \u2014 based on the real-life escapades of literary forger Lee Israel and her accomplice, Jack Hock \u2014 is admirably modest and specific in scale. It doesn\u2019t preach or pose, but in the fine grain of its characters and the skill of its performers (including Dolly Wells as a sweet and credulous bookseller), it achieves a kind of perfection.Advertisement"}

First NASA spacecraft named after living person launchesThe Parker Solar Probe, the first NASA spacecraft named after a living person, was launched in August. The craft is named after astrophysicist Eugene N. Parker, who was the first to describe solar wind in 1958. The probe, which has set a new record as the fastest spacecraft, is the closest any manmade object has been to the sun.2. Painting sets record for living African-American artist3. Apple becomes first company to reach value of $1 trillionApple became the first publicly traded company to reach a market value of more than $1 trillion in August, with Amazon in close pursuit, reaching the benchmark just a month later. The rise of these so-called superstar firms have helped spur a long period of economic growth in the United States, but may have also contributed to a shrinking middle class and rising income inequality, experts say.4. A New kind of human adaptationResearchers have reported a new kind of human adaptation \u2014 to the ocean. According to the journal Cell, a group of people known as the Bajau, who traditionally live in houseboats or houses on stilts in villages in Southeast Asia, have evolved to be better divers. The researchers\u2019 findings reveal that the Bajau \u2014 regardless of whether they\u2019re divers or have other jobs \u2014 have spleens that are about 50 percent bigger than those who live 15 miles inland. Studies have shown that larger spleens can aid in deep diving among marine animals.5. A unified Korea, at least on the iceMembers of the women\u2019s ice-hockey team from North Korea and South Korea played as a joint team at the XXIII Olympic Games in Pyeongchang, marking the first time the countries had a unified Olympic team. The team lost in its first game, to Switzerland. South Korea, however, went on to win a total of 17 medals in the games, including five gold medals.6. First-ever \u201csausage dog\u201d museum opensTwo former florists opened what they say is the first museum dedicated to \u201csausage dogs.\u201d The Dackelmuseum, which is in Bavaria, Germany, features canine stamps, dog-shaped breads, porcelain figurines, prints and other items dedicated to the dachshund, one of Germany\u2019s oldest canine breeds.7. First pedestrian fatality by a self-driving carA self-driving Uber test car killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona, in March, in what is believed to be the first pedestrian fatality caused by an autonomous vehicle. Although the car had a backup driver, neither he nor the car\u2019s light detection and radar system sensed the pedestrian, a woman who was attempting to cross the street with her bicycle, in time to stop.8. Saudi Arabia hosts first fashion weekSaudi Arabia hosted its first-ever fashion week in Riyadh, in April. The event still bore hallmarks of the conservative kingdom. Despite the all-female audiences, a social media ban was in place so photos of women without their abayas, or floor-length overgarments, wouldn\u2019t leak. Organizers, however, hailed the event as a pivotal moment for women in a country where they still are expected to defer to their male guardians.9. Chinese company surpasses Apple\u2019s smartphone salesFor the first time, the Chinese company Huawei has outstripped Apple smartphone sales, selling more than 54 million phones in the second quarter of 2018, compared to Apple\u2019s 41 million, and trailing only Samsung. The company\u2019s success is all the more impressive considering that Huawei has failed to make inroads in some of the world\u2019s largest markets, including the United States, in part because of corporate and government espionage fears.10. Paris museum opens its doors to nudistsFor the first time in Paris, a museum has welcomed nude figures of a different kind: living ones. The Palais de Tokyo contemporary art museum opened its doors to nudists for a one-off tour scheduled by the Paris Naturists Association. Paris also has the world\u2019s first naturist restaurant, O\u2019Naturel, which opened in late 2017, as well as an area at a public park that is dedicated to people who prefer wearing their birthday suits.11. Machine tackles sea of plastic garbageThe world\u2019s first machine designed to clean up plastic detritus from the ocean \u2014 the brainchild of a college dropout who came up with the idea as a teenager\u2014 was deployed in September toward what\u2019s widely known as the \u201cgreat Pacific garbage patch.\u201d This expanse of ocean, located between Hawaii and California, has the world\u2019s largest accumulation of ocean plastic. Some experts, however, are worried that the machine will do more harm than good, arguing that it would be better to focus on efforts preventing plastic from entering the seas in the first place.12. French lawmakers ban smart devices in schoolsA law banning smart devices at schools in France went into effect in September. Students between the ages of 3-15 will have to leave their smartphones, tablets and any other digital devices at home or turned off on school premises, with exceptions for disabled students or during extracurricular activities. Some lawmakers scoffed at the new law as overkill, citing an existing rule that already prohibits smartphone use during instruction time in classrooms.13. Female fighter pilot breaks gender barrier in JapanJapan, which has a male-dominated workforce, named its first female fighter pilot in August. First Lt. Misa Matsushima, 26, who cited the American movie \u201cTop Gun\u201d as an inspiration, joined the Japan Air Self Defense Force in 2014. The JASDF began accepting female applicants in 1993, but women couldn\u2019t apply to be fighter pilots until 2015, when a ban was lifted as part of a nationwide initiative to increase the numbers of women in the workplace.14. Africa launches its first waste-to-energy plantEthiopia is the first country in Africa to open a waste-to-energy plant. Top government officials, including Ethiopian President Mulatu Teshome, were on hand at the inauguration of the $120 million plant, called Reppie, which was built in a landfill on the outskirts of Addis Ababa. It is supposed to take about 80 percent of the daily waste generated by the capital and fulfill about 30 percent of its energy needs.15. Ikea opens first store in IndiaIkea opened its first Indian store in Hyderabad, tweaking its usual strategy by cutting prices and changing its inventory \u2014 and even its cafe offerings \u2014 to appeal to the Indian consumer. The world\u2019s largest furniture retailer plans to open three other stores in the next two years to cater to the country\u2019s rapidly growing middle class.16. Russia flexes its musclesIn its largest show of military strength since the days of the Cold War, Russia assembled nearly 300,000 troops, 1,000 aircraft and 900 tanks for the exercises known as Vostok-2018. And for the first time, China participated in the exercises, sending helicopters and about 3,200 of its troops.17. Mexico\u2019s first reality series\u201cMade in Mexico,\u201d which follows the lavish lives of nine socialites in Mexico City, started streaming in September. The Netflix-backed series, Mexico\u2019s first reality program, has faced some heat, however, with critics pointing out that it\u2019s in poor taste in a country where nearly half the population lives in poverty.18. Canada legalizes recreational marijuanaCanada became the first major world economy to legalize recreational marijuana. It\u2019s the second country in the world \u2014 after Uruguay \u2014 to pass such legislation. Since mid-October, people over 18 could legally purchase and use dried cannabis flowers and oils. Legalization is expected to generate billions of dollars in revenue once fully implemented.19. More pigs than people in DenmarkPigs now outnumber people in Denmark: 215 pigs per 100 people, according to new statistics released by Eurostat. The agency estimates that about 150 million pigs live in the European Union, with 40 percent of them in Germany and Spain. And according to new figures released by the Spanish government, the number of slaughtered pigs, at 50 million, outnumber the country\u2019s population of 46.5 million.20. India\u2019s high court strikes down ban on gay sexFor the first time in more than 150 years, a law banning consensual gay sex in India has been deemed unconstitutional by the highest court in the land. Introduced to Indian law under British colonial rule, the rule was rarely enforced, but critics said it made the blackmail, sexual assault and harassment of L.G.B.T. people permissible.Looking Ahead:Disneyland to serve alcohol publicly for the first timeBottoms up, Mouseketeers.

{"Headline": "Interest in Court Square Condo Spikes Thanks to Amazon ", "Date": "2018-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe High EndThe 67-story condominium won\u2019t be completed until 2021, but already has nearly 700 buyer inquiries.Until recent weeks, Skyline Tower, a 67-story condominium under construction in the Court Square area of Long Island City, Queens, hadn\u2019t drawn much interest from buyers. But its developers weren\u2019t too concerned since the building is only about seven stories high right now.Although Amazon plans to build a sprawling campus along the East River, the company has already leased one million square feet in the Citicorp building, officially named One Court Square. Amazon has said it would begin moving workers in next year.Skyline\u2019s site, on 44th Drive adjacent to the elevated subway line, was owned by Citigroup when the United Construction & Development Group and partners paid $143 million for it in 2015, according to William Xu, vice president of the company and the nephew of its founder and president, Jiashu Xu.The Queens developer, who immigrated from China in the late 1980s and in 1994 opened his first business, in plumbing supply, has mostly constructed low- and midrise buildings in Elmhurst, Flushing and Jamaica.The Court Square project, for which the developer also bought air rights from the CUNY School of Law next door, is in a different league.\u201cMy uncle had a vision of doing a big, tall building to put Queens on the map on the condo scene,\u201d said the younger Mr. Xu.Skyline Tower will stand 778 feet tall and is poised to grab the Citicorp tower\u2019s mantle as the tallest building in Queens. It was designed by Hill West Architects as a curtain-wall building on a seven-story podium. That base will contain retail stores and the condo\u2019s many amenities, including a 75-foot-long skylit lap pool.A new entrance to the Court Square subway station, on which the developer is spending about $16 million, will also be at the base of the building.Apartments will range from studios to four-bedroom units \u2014 with one- and two-bedrooms predominating \u2014 and will be compact in size but have high-end finishes such as bronze fittings in kitchens and baths. Many west-facing units will have views of Manhattan, and some apartments will have private balconies or terraces. The building, which is costing about $500 million to construct, was to have brought in $1 billion in apartment sales, a record sellout for a Queens project. But with the surge of interest, the developer \u2014 whose partners include Henry Yeung, Brian Pun of FSA Capital and Risland U.S. Holdings \u2014 secured permission from the state attorney general\u2019s office for price increases totaling about $80 million. One-bedrooms, which average 702 square feet, will start at $865,000, and two-bedrooms of 932 square feet will start at $1.225 million.The building is expected to be ready for its first move-ins the second quarter of 2021.\u201cWe were excited about the building before, and now even more excited,\u201d Mr. Xu said. Interest in Skyline Tower suggests that buyers have confidence that the Amazon deal is firmly in place even as local opposition to the retail giant\u2019s arrival is gaining traction. Opponents object to incentives from the state and city that could total $3 billion for one of the world\u2019s richest companies, the lack of public review of the deal, and the potential impact on Queens neighborhoods already feeling the pinch of gentrification.Interest has also extended to other new condo projects in the Court Square area, including Corte, an eight-story, 85-unit building; the Bond, a seven-story, 42-unit project; and Craftsmen Townhomes, eight four-story townhouses. Modern Spaces, which specializes in real estate in Long Island City and Astoria, had been averaging eight or nine sales a week this year. But since the Amazon news, Mr. Benaim said, it has sold nearly 400 units, making the fourth quarter of 2018 its best in 10 years of business.Clearly, both the developer and the brokerage have found themselves in the right place at the right time.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "After Amazon Contest, N.Y. Lawmakers Want to Block Negotiations Done in Secret", "Date": "2018-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs cities around the country made bids to land Amazon\u2019s second headquarters, lawmakers and residents were purposely left in the dark.Now, New York lawmakers are taking aim at this kind of secretive process. On Thursday, Councilman Brad Lander of Brooklyn will introduce legislation that would ban New York City from entering into nondisclosure agreements during negotiations for prospective development projects. A similar bill will be introduced in Albany by State Senator Michael N. Gianaris of Queens in the upcoming legislative session.The efforts comes amid a nationwide backlash against Amazon and its HQ2 sweepstakes, which critics said allowed the online retail behemoth to collect data from cities across the nation and resulted in economic development officials offering massive incentives without public debate. In New York, officials gave Amazon city and state tax incentives and a state grant that together is worth roughly $3 billion, and approval to skirt the city\u2019s land use review process.\u201cThe process that Amazon required and that New York City acquiesced to forced cities to bid against one another in secret,\u201d Mr. Lander said.\u201cThat helped Amazon maximize tax breaks and features for its own benefit, but it hid the public economic development policy from the public. And that is bad for transparency, bad for economic development, bad for all of the cities that participated and, I think, bad for democracy.\u201dDuring the so-called HQ2 competition for a second headquarters, activists across the nation called for more transparency from Amazon and the cities that submitted bids. In places such as Chicago, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, city officials were pressured to reveal their bids. But that push for transparency has died down, said Nathan Jensen, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin who closely tracked the Amazon selection process.Now, even as New York contemplates banning nondisclosure agreements, Mr. Jensen said cities need to go further to fundamentally change the control that corporations have in economic development projects. For example, he thinks city councils should be able to vote on incentives a city might offer.Ultimately, Mr. Lander argued the federal government should take the lead.\u201cIn the ideal world, there would be federal policy to push back against the kind of crony capitalism that too often passes for economic development. But since we\u2019re not going to get help from Washington, cities are going to have to do it for ourselves,\u201d he said.Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s administration pushed back against Mr. Lander\u2019s proposal, highlighting the benefits Amazon will bring to New York City.\u201cThe city has secured thousands of good-paying jobs that will improve the lives of working families and give them security in a 21st-century economy,\u201d Jane Meyer, a spokeswoman for City Hall, said in a statement. \u201cWe will review any proposed legislation, but we remain very confident we took the right approach, and that the process ahead will foster significant public input.\u201dMr. Lander and the two co-sponsors of the bill, Jumaane Williams and Jimmy Van Bramer, seem to have the initial support of the Council speaker, Corey Johnson, potentially setting up yet another confrontation between the City Council and Mr. de Blasio.\u201cI am deeply concerned about the use of NDAs in general and with the Amazon deal in particular, so I look forward to reviewing this bill as it moves through the legislative process,\u201d Mr. Johnson said in a statement. \u201cThe public should have as much information as possible about these deals.\u201dCompanies, including Amazon, have often argued nondisclosure agreements are necessary to protect proprietary information. But, Mr. Gianaris said New York\u2019s Freedom of Information Law already protects that information.\u201cThe idea that we allow private corporations to dictate what governments can and cannot share with the people they represent is offensive on many levels,\u201d he said.Mr. Lander\u2019s bill is also the latest effort by the City Council to strip power from the mayor at a time when many lawmakers have expressed their displeasure with not being involved in the discussions surrounding Amazon\u2019s move to Long Island City.\u201cI don\u2019t like that the city shielded its bid from the public,\u201d Mr. Lander said, adding that the bill was \u201ccertainly motivated by a desire to prevent that from happening again.\u201dJ. David Goodman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Late-Night TV Hosts Give Publicity-Starved Novelists the Star Treatment", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks NewsThe novelist Rebecca Makkai was preparing for the usual string of interviews with radio stations and podcasts this year for her latest book, \u201cThe Great Believers.\u201dBut then she got a call from her publicist, who told her to get ready for a more prominent appearance: on NBC\u2019s \u201cLate Night With Seth Meyers.\u201d \u201cThe biggest thing I\u2019d done before that in terms of TV was a local morning show in Dayton, Ohio,\u201d Ms. Makkai said.Mr. Meyers has made it something of a habit to invite novelists onto his program, which averages 1.5 million viewers. In his nearly five years as host of \u201cLate Night,\u201d he has brought on a few dozen literary writers, many of them far from household names.\u201cAs much as I love having Stephen King or Jonathan Franzen or George Saunders, we also saw it as an opportunity to have diverse writers and writers who are publishing their first or second novel, because this will probably mean more for them than people who are already established,\u201d Mr. Meyers said in an interview.In a television landscape where literature has become largely overlooked, late-night hosts like Mr. Meyers and Trevor Noah have made it their mission to put a spotlight on writers \u2014 giving them an enormous amount of influence in the publishing world.Late night looked particularly barren after Jon Stewart, a champion of serious nonfiction, left \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d and Stephen Colbert ended \u201cThe Colbert Report,\u201d another reliable outlet for publishers. Mr. Colbert, who now hosts the most-watched show in all of late night on CBS, has mostly left noncelebrity authors behind. And other author-friendly TV hosts \u2014 Charlie Rose and Tavis Smiley \u2014 were ousted in sexual misconduct scandals.Those departures \u2014 following the end of Oprah Winfrey\u2019s daytime talk show and her original book club, which could turn an obscure novel into an overnight blockbuster \u2014 felt like a devastating loss for the literary world, as publishers fretted that books were being edged out of popular culture.The cumulative effect of those losses, and the growing fragmentation of the media landscape, have made it harder for publishers and authors to drive readers to a book with a well-placed TV appearance. Even when authors do land one of the coveted spots, the sales boost isn\u2019t what it used to be, in part because viewers have turned from network and cable television to streaming services and social media. Still, apart from an in-depth interview on NPR\u2019s \u201cFresh Air\u201d or a major literary award, few things can drive instant sales as dramatically as a television appearance.The turbulent political climate has meant that the authors getting the most television coverage \u2014 and netting the highest sales \u2014 are the ones whose books feed into the news cycle. The appetite for political books has exploded, with sales in that category reaching 11.7 million copies in 2018, up from 9.2 million in 2010, according to NPD BookScan.Michael Wolff and Bob Woodward, who each got wall-to-wall cable news coverage with their expos\u00e9s on the inner workings of the Trump administration, had two of the best-selling books of 2018. Michelle Obama\u2019s memoir sold more than two million copies in its first 15 days.Some industry analysts blame the relentless news cycle for the precipitous decline in fiction sales. Publishers\u2019 revenue from adult fiction fell to $4.38 billion in 2017, down 11.5 percent from 2015, while adult nonfiction sales rose nearly 11 percent to $6.18 billion, according to the Association of American Publishers.These new spots for novelists on late-night television have offered publishers some relief.The guest list for Mr. Meyers\u2019s show in the last few years reads like a roll call of some of the most groundbreaking literary writers at work today: Tayari Jones, Marlon James, Celeste Ng, Sunil Yapa, Viet Thanh Nguyen and Jesmyn Ward.\u201cHe\u2019s willing to take a chance on an unknown author, and that\u2019s been a fantastic boon for our books,\u201d said Todd Doughty, vice president and executive director of publicity at Doubleday. He noted that Mr. Meyers had helped drive exposure for Hanya Yanagihara\u2019s novel \u201cA Little Life,\u201d adding: \u201cWho would have guessed that a 700-page novel would be on national TV these days?\u201dMr. Noah, who succeeded Mr. Stewart as host of \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d on Comedy Central three years ago, has been intent on booking writers who have rarely been given the chance to address a mainstream television audience before.\u201cI\u2019ve tried to build upon the legacy I\u2019ve inherited from Jon by trying to find more diverse voices, and trying to find more writers who may not be the best-selling writers who we were already interviewing,\u201d he said in an interview.Mr. Noah\u2019s guests have included Yaa Gyasi, whose debut novel, \u201cHomegoing,\u201d traced the impact of slavery across 300 years; the indigenous writer Terese Marie Mailhot; the Nigerian novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie; and the poet Kevin Young.For some writers, a nod from Mr. Noah can alter the trajectory of a book, leading to other media appearances, more reviews and speaking gigs, all of which generate sales.\u201cIt was a heart-wrenching story, but it was powerful, it was funny,\u201d he told Mr. Moore.Mr. Moore later said he had been stunned by the interest in his memoir that the \u201cDaily Show\u201d interview generated.\u201cI\u2019m a lesser-known writer, so this clearly wasn\u2019t just about clicks for them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was about them making space for what they believed to be an important conversation.\u201dHe continued, \u201cIf you\u2019re not a celebrity writer, it\u2019s not likely that you\u2019ll have the type of platform that allows you to be on mainstream TV, and if you happen to be a black writer, or a woman, or a trans or queer writer, it\u2019s even harder to get space on television, or any other mainstream media outlet.\u201d\u201cWhen you look at Seth Meyers and you look at Trevor Noah, what publishers love is the intelligence the hosts bring to the conversations, and the risks that they\u2019re willing to take with the subject matter,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be a brand-name author if it speaks to them.\u201dOf course, a few literary-minded late-night hosts can\u2019t fully compensate for shifts in the media ecosystem. For a new or relatively unknown author, publishers increasingly have to cobble together an elaborate publicity plan that includes podcast, TV and radio interviews and coverage by blogs or YouTube book reviewers. And for authors of serious nonfiction about subjects other than politics, opportunities on television are hard to come by.\u201cI said: \u2018You\u2019re kidding. He actually reads them?\u2019\u201d she said in an interview.After her appearance, she heard from readers who had bought the book, and started getting inquiries from film and TV producers interested in acquiring screen rights, she said. (Her book also became a finalist for a National Book Award.)Most of all, she said, being on late night reinforced the idea that literary fiction remains relevant.\u201cIt\u2019s been a tragedy that we\u2019ve had all the other arts represented on late night \u2014 you have actors, Broadway people, musicians \u2014 but authors fell away for a while,\u201d she said. \u201cTo get authors back into the mix says this is not esoteric stuff, this is part of pop culture.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Pichai came across as evasive and unwilling to acknowledge the legitimate concerns about Google\u2019s business practices.At holiday parties and informal discussions in Washington, the conversation often turned to big tech and privacy. There seemed to be a growing wariness among lawmakers, regulators and aides about data collection and the unrelenting push by companies to gather more information about us.While many expressed concern about the bigness of Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple, there wasn\u2019t a consensus on how to deal with them. A federal privacy law with real teeth seemed uncertain, and not many folks expected antitrust regulation even in the face of European action.All the while, tech companies continue to sell the message that they are job creators and engines of economic growth.\u25a0 An argument often made against antitrust action is that the technology industry is dynamic, and that today\u2019s dominant predator can become tomorrow\u2019s prey.

But he became disillusioned over the Vietnam War.After helping to inaugurate a short-lived biweekly underground newspaper, The Washington Free Press, and joining in antiwar protests, he said he was pressured in 1967 to quit his government job.In the decades after that, he wrote largely polemical articles and columns, in print for publications like Foreign Policy Journal and Counterpunch and later online. He also produced, and contributed to, expos\u00e9s in books and other media about what he called misdeeds by the United States at home and abroad that were carried out in the name of national security.Faking a flat tire near the gate to Central Intelligence Agency headquarters in Virginia, he surreptitiously recorded the license plates of employees who were entering and leaving. He revealed the names and home addresses of more than 200 of them in his book \u201cThe CIA, a Forgotten History: U.S. Global Interventions Since World War 2\u201d (1986).In an interview with The Washington Post in 2006, Mr. Blum encapsulated his life\u2019s mission as \u201cending, at least slowing down, the American Empire,\u201d or \u201cat least injuring the beast.\u201d\u201cThis is almost as good as being an Oprah book,\u201d Mr. Blum said at the time.While Mr. Blum denounced the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in New York and Washington and said he would not want to live under an Islamic fundamentalist regime, he did not disavow the recommendation or express regret that bin Laden, the orchestrator of those attacks, shared his disdain for the policies carried out by the department where he had once worked.A memorial to those who lost their lives in 2018He also reiterated his unpopular, but not unique, position that American intervention abroad had been breeding enemies and inviting terrorism.

{"Headline": "The People of Mbomo Tell Their Stories", "Date": "2018-12-01", "News": "FootnotesIn \u201cCongo Tales,\u201d a new book about the second-largest tropical forest in the world, the story of a people and their home comes alive.Supported by\u201cCongo Tales,\u201d a new book published recently by Prestel, began as a call to action to save the Odzala-Kokoua National Park in the heart of the Congo Basin, which is the second-largest tropical forest in the world after the Amazon, from the threats of climate change. It soon became a book about the stories of the people who live there. A team including Pieter Henket, a Dutch photographer; Eva Vonk, a Dutch producer; Steve Regis \u201cKovo\u201d N\u2019Sond\u00e9, a Congolese artist and philosopher; his brother Wilfried N\u2019Sond\u00e9, a Congolese writer and musician; and a group of conservationists and researchers spent five years in the basin. There, they collected and translated the tales of the people of the Mbomo region. The stories were then edited by the N\u2019Sond\u00e9 brothers, a job suited to the pair who grew up with stories passed down from their grandmother.\u201cThese stories, through the values and symbols they carry, are our legacy,\u201d said Kovo N\u2019Sond\u00e9. \u201cWhen I say our, I don\u2019t only mean Congolese citizens or Bantu peoples, I mean mankind. These stories are all about wisdom, knowledge, ethical and aesthetic principles.\u201dA project of this nature is bound to draw scrutiny and face skepticism about exploiting native peoples and rituals. But this collaboration offers an opportunity to grapple with what an ethical approach to storytelling might look like. \u201cStorytelling is such a powerful thing with which we pass on information from generation to generation,\u201d Vonk said. \u201cAny authenticity I have gained is just by listening and not trying to explain.\u201dHenket, who photographed the community members\u2019 re-enactments of the stories, viewed his presence as more about offering technical expertise, such as lighting and composition. \u201cWhat I wanted to do with the Mbomo people was to really let them tell the stories how they wanted to see it,\u201d he said. Here are Henket\u2019s comments on some of the photographs in the book and their accompanying stories. I took a portrait of the eldest people in the village because there is a saying that when the old people die it\u2019s like a library of stories burning down. That whole concept on its own is already beautiful so we wanted to build on that. All Mbomo families have their own totem animals that represent them. We asked the kids about their family\u2019s totem animal and how they would express it. After a week of shooting, the whole village got involved and everyone wanted to be a part of it. This girl came with this simple leaf and put it on top of her head and we asked \u201cWhat are you?\u201d and she said, \u201cI\u2019m a bird.\u201dThis boy came in wearing this dress with moons and stars on it. We asked him what totem animal he would be and he said, \u201cI\u2019m a butterfly.\" We asked him: \u201cHow would you represent that?\u201d Together with our art director, he made this butterfly costume.We wanted to keep this story, which symbolizes how the days of the week were established, light and very much fantasy, so we created this wooden moon. All the kids wanted to be a part of this picture, and they started to come out of the forest with their own hats and their own masks. It adds to the whole goal of them telling their own stories instead of telling them to do this or do that.This story is about a fish and a crocodile becoming best friends. One day the fish says to the crocodile, would you come over and stay at my house tonight? So the crocodile stays and they have an amazing night. But then the crocodile eats the babies of the fish and so the fish says to the crocodile, I thought we were best friends. I wanted to do a picture in the river with all the children as if they were little fish eggs. These are most of the children of the people who were involved in the project. The difficult part is deciding what parts of the story are important to tell. With photography you have to choose moments. I wanted to somehow show the fish eggs and I thought it would be a beautiful composition to have all these children sitting in the river bank. This story about a woman trying to escape an abusive relationship is very much about female power. The casting process was super fun for this one because while we were shooting there were always a few people who stayed around us. These girls, who were in that group, were tough cool girls, and I thought they would fit perfectly for this powerful image. The man in the middle is Bosco, and he is sort of the unofficial mayor of the village. This is a story about how all the young boys decide at one point that they want to take power from the elders so they kill all the elders. But then they realize you need the wisdom from the elders. This picture represents that realization with Bosco as the elder and his son looking at the camera. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Move 2.8 Million Dead Fish", "Date": "2018-12-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGrace NotesThis is a fish story. And all of it is true.It is actually about 2.8 million fish, all dead and preserved in jars, except for the big ones, which are carefully preserved in tanks.\u201cNo, not even,\u201d said Steven Warsavage, who is in charge of moving them.The three structures are nondescript and easy to overlook. The Gilder Center will not be, with curving stone-and-glass walls, in contrast to the brick that dominates that side of the museum.The group\u2019s lawyer argued in State Supreme Court in Manhattan that the Parks Department\u2019s approval of the addition had violated the City Charter. The lawyer, Michael S. Hiller, also said in an interview that the Gilder Center addition should be required to undergo the kind of land use review that a private project would face.Justice Lynn R. Kotler ruled for the museum on Dec. 10. The group immediately filed an appeal and the Appellate Division issued a temporary restraining order while it considered the case.Now the group is mustering the star power of the neighborhood. It videotaped a public service announcement with the tennis star Billie Jean King, who lives in the neighborhood. \u201cI want the project to be stopped,\u201d she said in the video.The Appellate Division\u2019s temporary restraining order applied only to exterior work, not inside work such as moving the fish.Dr. Schaefer \u2014 whose titles at the museum include dean of science for collections, exhibitions and the public understanding of science \u2014 said the fish in the collection are like books in a library. The home they are leaving looks like the drab section of stacks in a large library where the public is not allowed. There are no soaring windows with views to inspire researchers and no impressive wooden tables where they might sit. The jars containing the fish rest on gray metal shelves.Some are tiny; some are huge. Two coelacanths, \u201cour version of the T. Rex,\u201d are so large they reside in a shiny trunk-size box. Scientists describe coelacanths as a fossil-like fish that time left behind. Dr. Schaefer said that until about 80 years ago, coelacanths \u2014 pronounced SEE-Luh-canths \u2014 were thought to have been extinct for 50 million years. Then they were discovered in the Indian Ocean. It turned out that they had survived more or less unchanged.Libraries have the Library of Congress classification system or the Dewey decimal system. The fish collection \u2014 which includes about 30 species that Dr. Schaefer discovered \u2014 has its own system. Similar to a library, however, every specimen has a number and a place on a shelf.He reached for a jar, and it brought back memories. It was No. 229305, a cyphocharax spiluropsis, a freshwater fish found in parts of the Amazon River basin. The label said he had collected it on a trip to Bolivia in 1998.So what about No. 1, the first fish in the museum catalog?\u201cI don\u2019t think I can find it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s wrapped up and ready to rock \u2018n\u2019 roll.\u201dWell, roll, anyway. The transport carts, custom-made with large rubber wheels, are supposed to minimize the rocking, jiggling and jostling.No. 1, by the way, is a European cyprinid, which Dr. Schaefer described as a relative of the carp minnow.For a brand-new museum, the prince\u2019s collection was an opportunity, and it bought 2,000 fish and reptiles, along with 4,000 mounted birds and 600 mounted mammals. The museum said the price was \u00a31,500, or about $200,000 today.Dr. Schaefer said the museum wants to keep the fish collection on the campus during the Gilder Center construction because it is essential for research and teaching. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to do that if your resources are spread all over the tristate area,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for the kind of science we do to be located apart from the resource base.\u201dThe temporary storage area will have room for expansion \u2014 Dr. Schaefer said the museum can add as many as 20,000 fish to the collection a year \u2014 and the Gilder building will have even more space. Gone will be the gray metal shelves, replaced by a system of rolling shelves that can store more specimens in less space.Mr. Warsavage, the museum\u2019s director of construction, said the move was \u201creally just a matter of choreography,\u201d but it had to be done shelf by shelf. \u201cWe have to follow the exact sequence it\u2019s laid out in now,\u201d he said.Mr. Warsavage did not look nervous.\u201cThree months ago, you might\u2019ve read my face differently,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve done dry runs.

{"Headline": "Guess Who\u2019s Accusing Cuomo of Dishonesty and Betrayal?", "Date": "2018-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt seemed like the political moment Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo had long been waiting for: Democrats in control of the State Senate and Assembly, a chance to finally embrace and implement real change.Within days, questions about the governor\u2019s intentions had emerged. They came from the Assembly and the State Senate, from new lawmakers and veterans. They accused the governor of dishonesty, stinginess, even betrayal.The backbiting was not altogether unexpected \u2014 this is Albany, after all. But what was unexpected was the source of the dissent: Mr. Cuomo\u2019s fellow Democrats.There was the cohort of six newly elected senators, five from New York City, who took issue with Mr. Cuomo\u2019s calling a legal fight over equitable school funding a \u201cdistraction.\u201d One of the six, Robert Jackson, who won a seat in Manhattan, called Mr. Cuomo\u2019s remarks \u201cfiction\u201d; another, John Liu, who won a seat in Queens, compared the governor to Ebenezer Scrooge.Even the Assembly speaker, Carl E. Heastie, recently made clear his displeasure with Mr. Cuomo over the governor\u2019s desire to limit legislators\u2019 outside income.\u201cGod knows the governor has had issues in his office,\u201d Mr. Heastie said in a radio interview, probably in reference to recent corruption trials connected to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s administration. \u201cYet only the Legislature was told, \u2018You have to reform the way you do business.\u2019\u201dIt was a striking comment from Mr. Heastie, who has typically been cautious when it comes to criticizing Mr. Cuomo.Together with the senators\u2019 statements, it suggested a subtle but potentially momentous shift in the power dynamics of Albany: Newly empowered by resounding Democratic majorities in both chambers and watched closely by an expectant electorate, legislators may be emboldened to push back against the governor.In other words, the strength of Democratic victories in November has raised the paradoxical possibility of more headaches for the state\u2019s Democratic governor than he endured from Republicans.\u201cI think that as a new senator, I\u2019m less concerned about managing expectations,\u201d said Julia Salazar, one of the six victorious insurgents who also panned the governor\u2019s education remarks. \u201cAnd a little bit, given my position on the political spectrum, I\u2019m less concerned about my direct relationship with Governor Cuomo.\u201dBut legislation he dislikes often languishes, and open criticism of him from fellow Democrats is rare.Progressives have long worried that Mr. Cuomo was using his political acumen to secretly undermine the liberal agenda he promoted, in particular by tacitly accepting the decision of a group of Democratic senators, known as the Independent Democratic Conference, to collaborate with the Republicans. Until recently, those senators helped allow Republicans to maintain control of the chamber and stall expensive bills that Mr. Cuomo, a fiscal moderate, might have wanted to avoid.Mr. Cuomo, progressives said, could then blame the Senate Republicans rather than having to veto the bills himself. He also blamed the Republicans for blocking some progressive legislation, such as the Dream Act, which would have made it possible for undocumented students to receive state financial aid.But after a slate of insurgent candidates won victory after victory this year, that dynamic has shifted. Five of the six senators who criticized Mr. Cuomo\u2019s education comments, including Mr. Jackson and Mr. Liu, had defeated former I.D.C. members.\u201cMembers cannot be afraid. Members need to represent their constituency, and they need to speak up for what they believe is right,\u201d said Mr. Jackson, the senator-elect from Manhattan and a longtime proponent of more funding for low-income schools. \u201cIf the governor is going to be \u2014 people say that he\u2019s like a dictator, things like that \u2014 well, let\u2019s stand up and fight.\u201dDemocrats hold a supermajority in the Assembly, and will hold 40 of the Senate\u2019s 63 seats, their strongest majority in more than a century, and just two votes shy of the two-thirds needed to override a veto by the governor. (One of those 40 is Senator Simcha Felder, who has previously sat with Republicans in that chamber. He has not indicated whom he will caucus with in the coming session, which begins in early January.)Mr. Heastie and Senator Andrea Stewart-Cousins, the leader of the Senate Democrats, have already signaled their intention to work closely together. On Thursday, Ms. Stewart-Cousins wrote on Twitter that she and Mr. Heastie had met to discuss a \u201cunited and historic legislature.\u201d Mr. Heastie replied that they would work \u201cclosely together\u201d toward shared goals.\u201cFor the first time in recent Albany history, I am hiring staff whose entire focus will be conducting investigations,\u201d Mr. Skoufis wrote. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of work to do.\u201d\u201cBecause I have the grass roots and the people behind me \u2014 it\u2019s less about him,\u201d she said of her willingness to challenge Mr. Cuomo on school funding. \u201cIt\u2019s more about, \u2018These people are relying on me to make the right decision on their behalf. I\u2019d better say things that are in line with what they want, always.\u2019\u201dAll the senators said they wanted to work with Mr. Cuomo and were ready to applaud him on issues where they agreed. They also emphasized their cohesion with the rest of their conference, including senators who had been in office longer and had not openly clashed with the governor.For its part, the governor\u2019s office says it is expecting a lot from the Assembly and the Senate, too.\u201cThe legislature will need to move from campaigning and advocacy to governing,\u201d said Dani Lever, a spokeswoman for Mr. Cuomo. That, Ms. Lever added, \u201cwill require them to balance the needs of the entire state\u201d and \u201cpass an on-time budget so we prove we are functional, don\u2019t lose the Senate majority and they get their raises that just passed.\u201dStill, many members of the Democratic conference, not just the new ones, are eyeing a more openly left-leaning agenda, despite potential political peril for more moderate members in New York City\u2019s suburbs and upstate.Indeed, freshmen and senior senators alike seem to be embracing a more independent approach. Senator Michael Gianaris of Queens, the deputy leader of the Democratic conference, has been a vocal critic of the subsidies that the state has promised Amazon for its new headquarters in New York; Mr. Cuomo has framed the deal as a major victory for the state.And Ms. Stewart-Cousins herself said in a recent interview that she would be unafraid to challenge Mr. Cuomo or any other official, no matter their position.\u201cI\u2019ve always been somebody who\u2019s very direct,\u201d Ms. Stewart-Cousins said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve always been somebody who is not afraid to say what needs to be said.\u201dLikewise, Mr. Jackson said the Legislature should announce its new strength boldly.\u201cEveryone knows that the governor thinks that he\u2019s in control. He\u2019s not in control,\u201d Mr. Jackson said. \u201cThe governor cannot pass laws by himself.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Are Apple\u2019s Moves a Threat to Silicon Valley?", "Date": "2018-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.In any case, as someone who recently covered the Texas economy, the Apple news got me thinking about what it signaled for California. If Apple and Amazon are amassing jobs in places that are not Silicon Valley, does that mean the Bay Area is losing its iron grip on that magical wealth-creating industry, tech?And those other places are, increasingly, hubs of other industries that companies like Apple would be smart to cozy up to.Mr. Thornberg talked about the Inland Empire, where local officials have tried to build up a tech economy. His firm told them, politely, that it\u2019s a waste to try to become the next Silicon Valley. \u201cTech for tech\u2019s sake is a tougher and tougher option,\u201d he said.Culver City, Mr. Thornberg said, makes sense for Apple because of its proximity to the entertainment industry.San Diego was less clear-cut, he said, but does have biotech and defense clusters. Whatever it was, San Diego officials said it wasn\u2019t tax breaks; the city didn\u2019t offer any. Neither did the state, according to the Governor\u2019s Office of Business and Economic Development.Culver City didn\u2019t offer incentives, either \u2014 and didn\u2019t need to, Mayor Thomas Small said.\u201cWe\u2019re a center for the tech and media economy, and they all want to be here,\u201d he said.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)\u201cA Christmas cake is all about the fruit!\u201d she said, offering me the most opulent, lightly spicy, ever-so-faintly boozy sample on the end of a toothpick.I made a note to buy a cake for my parents \u2014 immigrants from India and Kenya who grew up with homemade fruitcake as a seasonal luxury \u2014 so we can slice into it as we celebrate our first Christmas together in California.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "New Google Campus Accelerates Tech\u2019s March Into New York", "Date": "2018-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGoogle said on Monday that it planned to create a $1 billion campus just south of the West Village. The internet company\u2019s push into one of Manhattan\u2019s most famous neighborhoods positions it to become one of New York\u2019s biggest occupants of office space, allowing it to double its work force in the city to more than 14,000 over the next decade.\u201cLaw, medicine and finance have been superseded by information technologies,\u201d said Mitchell Moss, an urban-planning professor at New York University who studies the city\u2019s economy.The centerpiece of the new 1.7-million-square-foot campus will be the St. John\u2019s Terminal building near the Holland Tunnel on Washington Street, with Google also set to occupy space at two buildings nearby on Hudson Street. Altogether, the company will expand its footprint in Manhattan by a third to about 6.75 million square feet.Google arrived in New York when it opened an advertising sales office in 2000. It added an engineering team in the city in 2003 and has steadily expanded since.Other big tech companies quickly followed. Amazon and Facebook each now have more than 2,000 employees in New York, while Apple and Salesforce each employ more than 1,000. LinkedIn has a large office in the Empire State Building, and IBM chose New York as the base for its Watson artificial intelligence and cloud computing divisions.Since 2009, jobs in tech and advertising in New York have increased 31 percent to 360,600, while financial-services jobs in the city increased about 12 percent to 475,500, according to an analysis of federal data by Ken McCarthy, principal economist at the real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield. By contrast, the education and health sectors employ about one million people in New York, while the hospitality industry employs 465,800, according to his analysis.Mr. McCarthy said federal data categorized jobs based on the employer, meaning any bank employee is counted as finance. But New York\u2019s traditional industries \u2014 banking, retailing and consulting \u2014 have also added thousands of tech jobs. JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup each employ thousands of tech workers, including many in new fields like data science, blockchain and machine learning.And New York\u2019s tech sector is accelerating. Over the past year, the share of New York postings on the job site Indeed increased nearly 13 percent for tech jobs and just 2 percent for finance and accounting jobs. About 5 percent of all New York jobs posted on Indeed are now tech related, the site said, compared with 3 percent for finance and accounting.That growth has made San Francisco, which is a gateway to Silicon Valley, a sort of sister city to New York. As a result, the air route between them is one of the nation\u2019s most competitive and heavily trafficked.\u201cThere is more economic connectivity between New York and San Francisco than between New York and any of the declining upstate cities,\u201d Mr. Moss said.Google has expanded quietly and has not asked for public subsidies. \u201cWe\u2019ve been growing steadily for the past 18 years without heralding trumpets, or asking for support from the government,\u201d William Floyd, Google\u2019s head of external affairs in New York said this month. \u201cWe\u2019ve done it by the dint our own work.\u201dAnd some in Manhattan are wary that Google and other businesses will begin to spread into historic neighborhoods.\u201cMy concern is that with Google\u2019s concentration in that area, it\u2019s going to pull in even more intense pressure for office development, particularly tech office development, in adjacent neighborhoods like the Village and East Village, where we are seeing it happen already,\u201d said Andrew Berman, executive director of the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation.Mr. Berman said he did not oppose Google\u2019s expansion in Hudson Square, which in the past decade has transformed into a commercial district, with many of its lofts and factories converted to offices for more than 1,000 companies, many in technology, advertising and media. Today, more than 50,000 people work in the neighborhood, and thousands more have made their home there following a 2013 city rezoning that allowed residential development.But Mr. Berman said the growing demand for offices has led to the demolition of historic buildings, pushed out longtime businesses and residents, and resulted in modern office towers that are out of character with the rest of the neighborhood.Chelsea has also witnessed rapid development over the past decade as it has mostly shed its working class roots and identity as a hub of gay night life. It still maintains large public housing projects, but is dotted with art galleries, new condominiums and expensive restaurants.In response, Google invested in local nonprofit organizations and said it would pay for a ferry stop at Pier 57, where it is renting office space, earning some plaudits from local elected officials.\u201cIn terms of buying the new buildings, we want to make sure that they\u2019re not chasing anyone out,\u201d said Gale Brewer, the Manhattan borough president. \u201cBut they\u2019ve been awfully good neighbors in Chelsea.\u201dSteve Lohr contributed reporting from New York, and Ed Shanahan from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s Homegrown Chips Threaten Silicon Valley Giant Intel", "Date": "2018-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmazon, the world\u2019s largest online retailer and largest cloud-computing company, is pushing into a new line of work: computer chips.Late last month, the company, based in Seattle, revealed that it had spent the last few years building a new chip for use inside the millions of servers in its data centers around the world.Amazon does not plan to sell this chip directly to customers, but the decision by one of the world\u2019s biggest buyers of computer processors to go the do-it-yourself route is likely to have a major impact on Intel, the iconic Silicon Valley chip maker.Intel has struggled to keep up with recent technology trends, from the increasing use of mobile devices to artificial intelligence, as influence over chip designs has been shifting to Amazon, Apple and Google, which already dominate much of the rest of the tech industry.The homegrown chip also gives Amazon bargaining power with Intel, which hasn\u2019t had much competition in the server market in recent years. The internet company will still buy from Intel because it would be difficult to build all the chips it needed on its own. But now it will have options.Intel acknowledges that companies like Amazon want to reduce their dependency on one big chip supplier. \u201cI am not unaware of the dynamic,\u201d Lisa Spelman, an Intel vice president, said. \u201cOur goal is to understand and respectfully acknowledge that desire.\u201dAbout 35 percent of the server chips sold around the world go to about 10 companies, including large internet companies like Amazon and a handful of telecommunication firms, said Shane Rau, a chip analyst with the research firm IDC. That just one of them is shifting its business is terrible news for Intel.\u201cEach one of these companies is so large, they represent a market unto themselves,\u201d Mr. Rau said.Apple beat the other tech giants to this cost-saving trend four years ago when it unveiled its first custom-built chip for the iPhone. Google and Microsoft are also building the chips that go into devices like smartphones and virtual-reality headsets.Amazon has upped the ante. In 2015, it spent a reported $350 million to acquire a chip maker, Annapurna Labs, which helped build the new central processing unit, or C.P.U.A C.P.U. \u2014 the centerpiece of a computer\u2019s operations \u2014 is the sort of chip that Intel has made for decades to run personal computers and servers. Building these chips requires rare expertise and hundreds of millions of dollars in capital. It is a big step up in complexity from building chips tailored to certain tasks.\u201cThe belief was that you needed some magic to build a processor, particularly a server processor,\u201d said Andrew Feldman, the chief executive of the chip start-up Cerebras and a former executive at the chip maker AMD. \u201cYou had to be Intel or AMD \u2014 and that was about it.\u201dAmazon executives believe the chip, which was designed to be more energy efficient, will help reduce the cost of electrical power in its data centers. It said it was offering a cloud-computing service that would allow business customers to use its new chip. The cost of the service could be 45 percent lower than other options.And when Amazon buys chips from other companies, a homegrown option gives it even more sway over prices. \u201cThey can now say to Intel, \u2018We will just move the workloads to other chips,\u2019\u201d Mr. Feldman said.Though it is still enormously difficult, building a chip is easier than it used to be. Amazon licensed much of the technology from ARM, the company that provides the basic technology for most smartphone chips. It made the chip through TSMC, a Taiwanese company.For Intel, Amazon\u2019s move into C.P.U.s is a strike at a longtime strength. Intel was beaten to the smartphone and tablet market a decade ago, a significant missed opportunity. The tech industry shifted, and Intel didn\u2019t shift with it.But Intel has a 96.6 percent share of server chip sales, according to IDC. It was 98.6 percent until its longtime competitor, AMD, which had stayed on the sidelines of the server business for about a decade, recently re-entered the market.Intel\u2019s profits continue to rise with the rapid expansion of the tech industry. But the financial results of its most recent quarter highlight the chip maker\u2019s dependence on servers. Intel\u2019s data center group, which sells both server and A.I. chips, pulled in $6.1 billion, a 26 percent increase over the previous year. The group now accounts for more than 30 percent of Intel\u2019s revenue.As the chip market has changed, Intel has tried to diversify. In recent years, it bought three companies that design chips for artificial intelligence and other types of hardware that are becoming increasingly important inside smartphones, cars and data centers.Through their fast-growing cloud computing services, Amazon, Microsoft, Alibaba and Google are reinventing how companies set up their computer networks. Going to a cloud service allows companies to wash their hands of acquiring and maintaining back-room computer systems \u2014 the tech experts do it for them.It is a lucrative business. Amazon Web Services brings in nearly $27 billion a year, and it accounts for 56 percent of Amazon\u2019s profits.Inside these cloud operations, the internet companies are also reinventing how computers are built. They are designing much of their own hardware, from the servers to the networking gear that connects servers. Facebook is doing similar work with the technology in its data centers.Amazon\u2019s new chip is running only a small fraction of the software across the company\u2019s online empire. But that is expected to expand.\u201cWe will look back at this as a watershed moment,\u201d said Mr. Feldman, the chief executive of Cerebras.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Making a Difference in 2018", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFixesEven during a year of division and fear of the future in many corners of America, the Fixes column found people trying to make things better \u2014 and succeeding. What difference can one ordinary person make?Here are six people Fixes wrote about in the last year who show what the answer can be: a lot.Last month, Michigan voters overwhelmingly approved a ballot measure that changed the state Constitution. It created a commission of independent citizens to draw the lines of congressional districts, taking the job away from politicians.Ms. Fahey kept waiting for someone who knew what they were doing to come along and tell her to run along now, but no one did. In the last few months, Voters Not Politicians became more professional. By then, its citizen army had made its message of citizen power even more persuasive.But being amateurs also had drawbacks. \u201cThe system wasn\u2019t built for civilians,\u201d Ms. Fahey said. Most campaigns, for example, have experts file the required reports to the state. Voters Not Politicians had to learn to do it itself.Voters Not Politicians now gets calls from people all over who want to fight gerrymandering or want to organize around other issues. \u201cWho\u2019s helping the regular person who wants a dog park in their community?\u201d Ms. Fahey asked. \u201cWe challenged the assumption you have to wait for someone else, or look to a politician to fix a problem. Some 27-year-old can get a lot of people excited about gerrymandering and amend the constitution.\u201dAmazon\u2019s move to Queens will make New York\u2019s shortage of software developers far worse. At the same time, lots of low-income New Yorkers would love those jobs \u2014 but don\u2019t have the skills.Is there a way to solve both problems at once?Pursuit starts with a 10-month intensive boot camp where students learn coding, professional skills and how to navigate the tech industry. Then, for the next three years, they get coaching and support while working.That\u2019s expensive, but, Mr. Hsu says, good job training is. \u201cMost job training doesn\u2019t really have results,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to do this well.\u201dThere are lots of coding boot camps. Pursuit is different because it aims at students who can\u2019t pay. Such projects often get their money from charity or grants, but that would have kept Pursuit too small.Mr. Hsu has come up with new ways to pay for the work. Pursuit\u2019s students do pay tuition \u2014 but only after they graduate and get a job paying at least $60,000. Then they pay 12 percent of their salary for three years.Pursuit raises the upfront money in two ways. One is to issue a bond, as public infrastructure projects do. Pursuit found investors to put up $750,000 for the first bond. If enough students graduate, get high-paying jobs and pay tuition, the investors will profit. Mr. Hsu is now seeking multiple millions for the organization\u2019s next bond.The other way is to charge companies. Companies already pay recruiters to find software developers. Now, instead, they can pay Pursuit to retrain their own blue-collar workers.So far, only two companies, Blue Apron and Managed by Q, are doing this. But another company is about to start: Pursuit will run a training center inside Amazon.Ms. Joseph believes that treating patients with dignity protects them from stress.She designed her clinic to help patients feel respected, valued and in control of their pregnancies, starting with a welcoming, no-drama front desk that doesn\u2019t ask about ability to pay. \u201cOur receptionist is probably the most important person on the team,\u201d said Ms. Joseph. \u201cGreet, be nice, wipe the tears.\u201d Ms. Joseph can barely keep her own doors open. \u201cWe bill, and when people can pay, they do, and when they can\u2019t, we don\u2019t charge. There\u2019s not a business model here.\u201dThat means showing them how to clear anything flammable within 30 to 50 feet of a house. \u201cFire moves through a landscape throwing embers two to three miles ahead,\u201d said Ms. Green. \u201cIf they find flammable materials, they smolder and ignite.\u201d\u201cThe science behind defensible space has been around since the late 1990s,\u201d she said. \u201cI translate that science to residents. These are really simple changes, but not something a lot of folks think about.\u201dHer biggest challenge: Twenty people move to Deschutes County every day. They all need to learn how to protect their homes \u2014 and put in the work to do so.In August, three houses burned \u2014 the first home casualties since 2003. It was a high-wind day, and there had been no rain for more than two months. \u201cThese folks hadn\u2019t found the time to put in defensible space correctly,\u201d Ms. Green said. \u201cIt was devastating, but the way that fire was burning, it could have been 3,000 home losses.\u201dThe next year, Ms. Tracy and five or so colleagues went to the sex crimes unit\u2019s headquarters and spent three days reading through the files, flagging questionable practices. That review still happens every spring.Over time, police practices have greatly improved, Ms. Tracy said. And now the advocate reviews are starting to spread \u2014 for example, to the New York Police Department.While reading the files, Ms. Tracy noticed that the F.B.I. defined rape as \u201ccarnal knowledge of a female, forcibly and against her will.\u201d If that sounds archaic, it\u2019s because it was written in 1929. \u201cThat came as news to all of us,\u201d she said.Few women around the world can get a mammogram. They are far from a clinic, or lack the money, or just don\u2019t know about breast cancer. But now there\u2019s another kind of breast exam that could reach women that mammograms don\u2019t.That was, however, far less than half the battle \u2014 and it\u2019s the second part that trips up most entrepreneurs, especially those making products for poor countries. \u201cThere are so many great technologies out there,\u201d said Matthew Campisi, a co-founder. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make them a successful product.\u201dSo far, iBreastExam has been cleared by regulatory bodies in 10 countries. One is the United States. Mr. Shah said that 70 percent of uninsured women don\u2019t get routine mammograms. \u201cWe\u2019re not saying it\u2019s a replacement for a mammogram,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re saying there are areas where it can help.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified on second reference the organization that asked Robert Mueller, director of the F.B.I. at the time, to amend the definition of rape. It was the Women's Law Project, not Women's Law Center. The article also misidentified the place where members of the project reviewed Police Department files. It was the headquarters of the department's sex crimes unit, not the Police Department's headquarters.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Life for Old Classics, as Their Copyrights Run Out", "Date": "2018-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNearly a century ago, the publisher Alfred A. Knopf released a slim book of spiritual fables by an obscure Lebanese-American poet and painter named Kahlil Gibran.Knopf had modest expectations, and printed around 1,500 copies. Much to his surprise, the book \u2014 titled \u201cThe Prophet\u201d \u2014 took off. It became a huge hit, and went on to sell more than nine million copies in North America alone.Until now, the publishing house that still bears Knopf\u2019s name has held the North American copyright on the title. But that will change on Jan. 1, when \u201cThe Prophet\u201d enters the public domain, along with works by thousands of other artists and writers, including Marcel Proust, Willa Cather, D. H. Lawrence, Agatha Christie, Joseph Conrad, Edith Wharton, P. G. Wodehouse, Rudyard Kipling, Katherine Mansfield, Robert Frost and Wallace Stevens.This coming year marks the first time in two decades that a large body of copyrighted works will lose their protected status \u2014 a shift that will have profound consequences for publishers and literary estates, which stand to lose both money and creative control.But it will also be a boon for readers, who will have more editions to choose from, and for writers and other artists who can create new works based on classic stories without getting hit with an intellectual property lawsuit.\u201cBooks are going to be available in a much wider variety now, and they\u2019re going to be cheaper,\u201d said Imke Reimers, an assistant professor of economics at Northeastern University who has studied the impact of copyright. \u201cConsumers and readers are definitely going to benefit from this.\u201dThe sudden deluge of available works traces back to legislation Congress passed in 1998, which extended copyright protections by 20 years. The law reset the copyright term for works published from 1923 to 1977 \u2014 lengthening it from 75 years to 95 years after publication \u2014 essentially freezing their protected status. (The law is often referred to by skeptics as the \u201cMickey Mouse Protection Act,\u201d since it has kept \u201cSteamboat Willie,\u201d the first Disney film featuring Mickey, under copyright until 2024.)Now that the term extension has run out, the spigot has been turned back on. Each January will bring a fresh crop of novels, plays, music and movies into the public domain. Over the next few years, the impact will be particularly dramatic, in part because the 1920s were such a fertile and experimental period for Western literature, with the rise of masters like F. Scott Fitzgerald, William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway and Virginia Woolf.\u201cEventually, these books belong to the people,\u201d said James L. W. West III, a Fitzgerald scholar. \u201cWe can have new attempts to edit and reinterpret all of these iconic texts.\u201dOnce books become part of the public domain, anyone can sell a digital, audio or print edition on Amazon. Fans can publish and sell their own sequels and spinoffs, or release irreverent monster mash-ups like the 2009 best-seller \u201cPride and Prejudice and Zombies.\u201dTheater and film producers can adapt the works into movies, plays and musicals without having to secure rights. Rival publishing houses can issue new print editions, and scholars can publish new annotated versions and interpretations. Free digital copies will circulate online. At the start of the new year, Google Books, which has more than 30 million works scanned in its vast online digital library, will release full digital editions of works published in 1923, among them Edgar Rice Burroughs\u2019s \u201cTarzan and the Golden Lion\u201d and Edith Wharton\u2019s \u201cA Son at the Front.\u201dIt\u2019s difficult to say exactly how many works will enter the public domain this January, because some authors and publishers allowed their copyright to lapse, and some foreign-language books first published overseas in 1923 may remain under copyright for now, like Felix Salten\u2019s \u201cBambi.\u201d More than 130,000 copyright registrations were filed in 1923 for various creative works, but most of those were not renewed, according to John Mark Ockerbloom, a digital library strategist at the University of Pennsylvania.Some publishers and the writers\u2019 heirs fear that losing copyright protections will lead to inferior editions with typos and other errors, and to derivative works that damage the integrity of iconic stories.\u201cPublishers are right to be concerned about a proliferation of unreliable editions, some of them probably not very good,\u201d said John Kulka, the editorial director of Library of America, a nonprofit organization that publishes American literary classics.Still, many scholars and legal experts argue that American copyright law, which is mind-numbingly complex, has skewed toward enriching companies and the heirs of writers and artists at the expense of the public. When the first Copyright Act was passed in the United States in 1790, the maximum term was 28 years. Over the decades, lawmakers repeatedly prolonged the terms, which now stretch to over a century for many works. \u201cIt\u2019s worse than the tax code,\u201d said Rebecca Tushnet, an intellectual property expert at Harvard Law School. \u201cThe copyright term is way too long now.\u201dFor readers and book buyers, the proliferation of competing texts and editions will mean more selection and cheaper books. In 2019, the digital publisher Open Road Media is publishing around a dozen newly available works from 1923, including e-books of Jean Toomer\u2019s \u201cCane,\u201d Gibran\u2019s \u201cThe Prophet,\u201d Sigmund Freud\u2019s \u201cThe Ego and the Id,\u201d P. G. Wodehouse\u2019s \u201cThe Inimitable Jeeves\u201d and Christie\u2019s \u201cThe Murder on the Links,\u201d one of her early novels featuring the detective Hercule Poirot.Blake Hazard, Fitzgerald\u2019s great-granddaughter and a trustee of his estate, said she hoped some interesting new interpretations of the story would emerge. But she also worries about what would happen to the novel\u2019s legacy when the inevitable homages and retellings land, which will probably include unauthorized Gatsby sequels or novels told from Daisy Buchanan\u2019s perspective.\u201cI hope people maybe will be energized to do something original with the work, but of course the fear is that there will be some degradation of the text,\u201d Ms. Hazard said.But publishers who specialize in classics see a tremendous opportunity to reintroduce old works. Some have been planning for this moment for decades.Penguin Classics had a number of 1923 titles lined up for 1998, when the copyright for books published that year was set to lapse, but those plans were scrapped after Congress extended protections. About three years ago, Penguin\u2019s editorial team went back to their list of 1923 titles and began looking for classics that still resonate and sell well. Several jumped out, including \u201cThe Prophet.\u201dJohn Siciliano, the executive editor of Penguin Classics, wanted something to distinguish its edition of \u201cThe Prophet\u201d from the others, so he decided to commission a new introduction from a contemporary poet.\u201cI\u2019d been thinking of who the perfect person would be, someone like Kahlil Gibran, a poet with mass appeal,\u201d he said. \u201cIt became obvious that Rupi Kaur was the one.\u201d\u201cHaving multiple editions of these works and renewed publication energy behind them enlarges the market rather than cannibalizing it,\u201d Mr. Siciliano said. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to breathe new life into these works.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Marketing Through Smart Speakers? Brands Don\u2019t Need to Be Asked Twice", "Date": "2018-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHeading into last year\u2019s holidays, marketers at HBO were eagerly experimenting with how to use technology like augmented reality and virtual reality to promote their shows. But then, celebrating with their families across the country, they watched as everyone from children to elderly aunts unwrapped smart speakers from Google and Amazon and started barking orders.When they got back to work, the marketers had a new priority: Figure out how HBO, whose product lives on screens, could create a space for itself in the world of voice.\u201cWe saw, partly because Amazon discounted the devices so deeply, that they exploded,\u201d said Sabrina Caluori, HBO\u2019s senior vice president of digital and social marketing. \u201cVery quickly, we realized that we really needed to dig in.\u201dUnilever has created a recipes skill under its Hellmann\u2019s label, while Procter & Gamble has introduced features from Tide and Oral-B. Those using the Tide application can ask Alexa how to remove juice or grass stains from clothing, while Oral-B\u2019s offers a tooth-brushing timer.On Google Home, where the term \u201cskills\u201d is replaced by \u201cactions,\u201d Est\u00e9e Lauder has one for personalized beauty advice and Disney has some games for children.\u201cWe\u2019ve hit the point where the majority of our clients are now asking us for help with a voice strategy,\u201d said Abbey Klaassen, president in New York of the agency 360i, which works with HBO. \u201cIt\u2019s gone from an interesting kind of experiment to something they have recognized that they need to invest in to make sure they are discoverable and relevant in the next five years.\u201d\u201cThey have a vested interest in making sure brands are creating quality voice experiences and not a lot that will drive people crazy,\u201d Ms. Klaassen said.\u201cWe\u2019re used to thinking about the elements of the book that we make available for people to sample to get a sense of it,\u201d said Rebecca Ikin, a marketing director at Cornerstone, a division of the publisher. \u201cThis is taking that principle and applying it to smart speakers.\u201dLike HBO, Ms. Ikin said her team had explored the idea after seeing the boom in interest in the devices last holiday season.Ms. Caluori of HBO said creating the applications could be complex and time intensive, noting that more than 100 people worked on the \u201cWestworld\u201d skill, which was made for a niche audience. But she said less help from outside partners was likely to be needed in the future as the work became an \u201congoing evergreen capability.\u201d\"We feel like this voice-based interaction is not going away,\u201d Ms. Caluori said. \u201cIt\u2019s starting with speakers, but it\u2019ll very quickly be TVs and cars and all these other places.\u201dThe \u201cEsme & Roy\u201d skill, which was created with Sesame Workshop, showed the potential for smart speakers with children and their parents. Amazon has been seeking child-friendly voice applications, particularly now that it sells an Echo device meant for children, Ms. Caluori said. At the same time, she said, young parents such as herself are keen on smart speakers, partly because they\u2019re a screen-free alternative to tablets and phones.Once the game is opened, children can use the speaker to play along with show\u2019s two main characters. They can answer questions to \u201ctravel\u201d to places like space or underwater, and can jump around while listening to its cues.\u201cThis experience stands alone, even if you don\u2019t know the show,\u201d Ms. Caluori said. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for kid-friendly skills in your home, it may be a way to introduce your children to the characters, and that then helps you potentially try out the show.\u201dDanielle Reubenstein, executive creative director in the mobile division of the ad agency Possible, said she had been urging brands to view smart speakers as a way to connect with people rather than as a means to sell products \u2014 at least for now.\u201cIt\u2019s not a super-duper e-commerce platform,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about having your customers interact with you in a way that\u2019s going to make them more loyal to your product.\u201dMs. Reubenstein said her firm typically got basic data on which questions to Alexa were completed or not. But once, in a meeting with Amazon, the firm briefly got a deeper look, seeing snippets of queries for one client\u2019s Alexa skill that showed how customers can still be easily frustrated when navigating a voice application.\u201cWe started seeing a lot of cuss words in the user flow,\u201d said Ms. Reubenstein, who declined to name the client. She said they were able to identify at what point most users were getting frustrated and adjusted the skill to address the issue.These are still early days for marketing on voice devices. Ms. Reubenstein compared it to when brands began making apps for mobile devices. But over time, she said, voice interactions will begin to replace many of the activities that people are conducting on screens.\u201cAll of it is really a down payment on being able to use those technologies in the future,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Nashville\u2019s Star Rises as Midsize Cities Break Into Winners and Losers", "Date": "2018-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNashville and others are thriving thanks to a mix of luck, astute political choices and well-timed investments, while cities like Birmingham, Ala., fall behind.NASHVILLE \u2014 Forty years ago, Nashville and Birmingham, Ala., were peers. Two hundred miles apart, the cities anchored metropolitan areas of just under one million people each and had a similar number of jobs paying similar wages.Not anymore. The population of the Nashville area has roughly doubled, and young people have flocked there, drawn by high-paying jobs as much as its hip \u201cMusic City\u201d reputation. Last month, the city won an important consolation prize in the competition for Amazon\u2019s second headquarters: an operations center that will eventually employ 5,000 people at salaries averaging $150,000 a year.Birmingham, by comparison, has steadily lost population, and while its suburbs have expanded, their growth has lagged the Nashville area\u2019s. Once-narrow gaps in education and income have widened, and important employers like SouthTrust and Saks have moved their headquarters. Birmingham tried to lure Amazon, too, but all it is getting from the online retail giant is a warehouse and a distribution center where many jobs will pay about $15 an hour.Nashville and the other Amazon also-rans, like Columbus, Ohio, and Indianapolis, are thriving because of a combination of luck, astute political choices and well-timed investments. At the same time, Birmingham and cities like it, including Providence, R.I., and Rochester, are falling further behind.Last week, for example, Apple said it would invest $1 billion in Austin, Tex., and could eventually employ 15,000 people in the area, up from 6,000 now. Like Nashville, Austin is a booming state capital with a prominent university and it has a lively music scene.Nashville started with advantages. But local leaders also made some smart decisions like merging the city and county government in the 1960s, allowing Nashville and its suburbs to work together rather than at cross-purposes. And in the 1990s, when many downtowns across the county were struggling, the city built a convention center, a hockey arena and a new home for the Country Music Hall of Fame.By contrast, economic misfortune and poor choices have hobbled Birmingham. Once a center of steel production, the city suffered when that industry declined in the 1980s because of foreign competition and corporate bankruptcies. Local leaders tried to pivot by luring banks and insurers, but that bet soured during the financial crisis, and the city hasn\u2019t recovered the jobs it lost then.\u201cA place like Birmingham hasn\u2019t fallen off the map, but it\u2019s been bypassed by these places that have moved into this more clearly defined second tier,\u201d said Adam Kamins, an economist for Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cIt\u2019s treading water, and treading water tends to not be enough.\u201dAsk Ralph Schulz, president of Nashville\u2019s Chamber of Commerce, why this city has done so well and he begins with the Civil War. Nashville surrendered early, allowing it to avoid the destruction that befell many Southern cities. Union troops used the city as a logistics hub, which laid the groundwork for its postwar economy.Nashville stood apart in other ways, too. The city was less dependent on manufacturing, in part because being Tennessee\u2019s capital brought lucrative \u2014 and relatively recession-proof \u2014 public investments. Its colleges and universities, anchored by Vanderbilt University, earned it a reputation as the \u201cAthens of the South.\u201dThe music business, which grew out of a 19th-century publishing industry, gave the city an international reputation, while the growth of Hospital Corporation of America in the 20th century turned the city into a health care hub.As a result, Nashville had a diversified economy and an educated work force that left it well positioned for the 21st century. But success wasn\u2019t inevitable. As recently as the 1990s, the city was portrayed as a backwater on the variety show \u201cHee Haw.\u201dRonald L. Samuels, a local banker and civic leader, recalled being asked about Graceland \u2014 which is in Memphis \u2014 when visiting New York with the Chamber of Commerce in the 1980s.\u201cWe had to answer the \u2018Where\u2019s Nashville?\u2019 question many times,\u201d Mr. Samuels said.Beginning in the early 1990s, though, political, business and nonprofit leaders tried to promote Nashville. State and local leaders adopted a regional approach to economic development to recruit companies such as Bridgestone, Nissan and UBS. Tennessee overhauled its community college system and work force development efforts to align better with the jobs being created.Starting under Mayor Phil Bredesen, who later became Tennessee\u2019s governor, the city invested in big projects that helped revive downtown, a key part of the city\u2019s success.Economists disagree about what policies are most effective at helping cities grow \u2014 or if policies matter much. Some, such as Michael Porter of Harvard and Richard Florida of the University of Toronto, have emphasized the importance of cultivating a \u201ccreative class\u201d of artists, designers and entrepreneurs. Others, such as Jan Rivkin of Harvard, stress the importance of civic leadership. Pretty much everyone agrees that having an elite university is a big advantage.Whatever the exact ingredients, Nashville hit on a winning recipe. The urban renewal that began under Mr. Bredesen turned into a boom after the Great Recession, which, thanks to Nashville\u2019s diverse mix of industries, was comparatively mild here. The Gulch, a former rail yard and industrial district, was transformed into a vibrant neighborhood full of hip bars, luxury condominiums and boutique hotels.Tourism took off, thanks in part to the ABC television country-music drama \u201cNashville.\u201d Some of those tourists stuck around: The number of college graduates younger than 35 nearly doubled over a decade, to 155,000 by 2017.Employers soon followed. Among them are Eventbrite, a San Francisco tech company, and EY, the accounting firm, which last month announced plans to open an office downtown for 600 workers. AllianceBernstein, an investment company, decided in May to move its headquarters to Nashville, from New York, in part because of the big-city-worthy cultural amenities and the small-city cost of living.The company has been flooded with calls from finance industry workers interested in moving to Nashville, said Karl Sprules, an AllianceBernstein executive who is helping lead the transition.In recent decades, the most successful cities have achieved a kind of economic gravity drawing the best jobs and most talented workers. That\u2019s why few economists were surprised when Amazon chose New York and the Washington area for its big expansion.But the effect isn\u2019t limited to a few urban giants. Mark Muro, who researches cities for the Brookings Institution, likened it to a fractal pattern: Look past the top cities and there is another layer of inequality. \u201cNashville is not a superstar, but it\u2019s at the top end of this next echelon,\u201d Mr. Muro said.The success of the superstars and the substars like Nashville has come at the expense of Birmingham and other smaller cities.Birmingham\u2019s great boom arrived a century before Nashville\u2019s, when the region\u2019s iron and mineral deposits helped it become one of the nation\u2019s largest steel producers. But as the steel industry declined across the country, Birmingham struggled to find a replacement.But Birmingham also has some significant assets. It has a research university, the University of Alabama at Birmingham, with a top-flight medical school and hospital. Research conducted at the university has helped fuel a budding start-up scene, and an affiliated incubator in a former Sears store, Innovation Depot, is home to more than 100 new companies.Last year, the city elected a young mayor, Randall Woodfin, who has put economic development at the center of his agenda. He has created a Neighborhood Revitalization Fund to fix up homes and demolish dilapidated structures, and wants to use business tax incentives to help lift wages, not just create jobs.\u201cAs a midsize city, we have to be very intentional about diversifying our economy,\u201d Mr. Woodfin said. \u201cI\u2019m not waiting on Amazon or some other company to come in and save Birmingham.\u201dThe question for city leaders is whether they can overcome the economic forces driving inequality among cities.Birmingham\u2019s work force is also less educated than the work forces in other cities of comparable size, and its schools aren\u2019t training workers with the skills they need, the report concluded.Mr. Woodfin faces another challenge: Instead of collaborating, cities and towns in the area often compete against one another. Birmingham proper accounts for just a third of the population of Jefferson County, with cities frequently offering multimillion-dollar tax incentives to lure businesses across town lines.Mr. Sher would like Birmingham to follow Nashville in merging the city and county governments. He noted that Louisville, Ky., saw substantial growth after it did that in 2003.But even as some look to Nashville as an example, they want to avoid repeating its mistakes. Nashville\u2019s boom has brought congestion and soaring housing costs, making the city unaffordable for many longtime residents, particularly African-Americans.\u201cWhat is the policy, other than growth?\u201d asked Paulette Coleman, a local affordable-housing activist. \u201cIf economic growth is only benefiting a small percentage, you just keep getting these widening disparities.\u201dThose concerns raise questions about Nashville\u2019s future. The city has thrived in part by being an affordable alternative to New York and Atlanta. It may soon have to compete with them directly by trying to become a superstar in its own right.In Birmingham, Mayor Woodfin said the city must follow a different path.\u201cI am 100 percent convinced we do not have to be the next Nashville or the next Austin or the next Charlotte,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can be the best Birmingham.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is Tech Too Easy to Use?", "Date": "2018-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftSeven years ago, a younger and more carefree Mark Zuckerberg went onstage at Facebook\u2019s annual developer conference and announced a major change to the social network\u2019s design.\u201cFrom here on out, it\u2019s a frictionless experience,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.Of all the buzzwords in tech, perhaps none has been deployed with as much philosophical conviction as \u201cfrictionless.\u201d Over the past decade or so, eliminating \u201cfriction\u201d \u2014 the name given to any quality that makes a product more difficult or time-consuming to use \u2014 has become an obsession of the tech industry, accepted as gospel by many of the world\u2019s largest companies.Airbnb, Uber and hundreds of other start-ups have made billions of dollars by reducing the effort needed to rent rooms, hail taxis and complete other annoying tasks. And when a company fails, excessive friction is often cited as the reason.There is nothing wrong with making things easier, in most cases, and the history of technology is filled with examples of amazing advances brought about by reducing complexity. Not even the most hardened Luddite, I suspect, wants to go back to the days of horse-drawn carriages and hand-crank radios.Over the past several weeks, I\u2019ve spoken to more than a dozen designers, product managers and tech executives about the principles of frictionless design. Many said that while making products easier to use was usually good, there were cases where friction could be useful in preventing harm, and steering users toward healthier behavior.Bobby Goodlatte, a former Facebook designer who is now an angel investor, told me that the tech industry\u2019s culture of optimization \u201cpresumes that reducing friction is virtuous unto itself.\u201d\u201cIt leads us to ask, \u2018Can we?\u2019 \u2014 never \u2018Should we?\u2019\u201d he said.Several people praised the Time Well Spent movement spearheaded by Tristan Harris, a former Google design ethicist and co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology, as a kind of pro-friction cohort within the tech industry. Among other things, the group has successfully pressured companies like Facebook and Apple to take steps to curb tech addiction by including features that encourage users to limit their screen time.And a few lamented that in the tech industry\u2019s race for convenience, something important had been lost.\u201cWe wanted to juice engagement and therefore made things as frictionless as possible,\u201d said Jenna Bilotta, a design manager who has worked at Google. \u201cWe made a whole world of the literal \u2018least you could do\u2019 apps, and it\u2019s trashing people\u2019s mental health.\u201dOften, invoking the concept of friction is a useful way to obscure some larger, less savory goal. For Facebook, \u201cfrictionless sharing\u201d was a thinly veiled cover for the company\u2019s true goal of getting users to post more often, and increasing the amount of data available for ad targeting. For YouTube, auto-playing videos have sharply increased view time, thereby increasing the platform\u2019s profitability. And for Amazon, tools like one-click ordering have created a stunningly efficient machine for commerce and consumption.\u201cOur current application of tech has been to take something hard and make it easy,\u201d said Harper Reed, an engineer and the chief technology officer for President Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 re-election campaign.When tech companies do make their products harder to use, it\u2019s generally to secure them from hackers, spammers or other malicious actors. (Think of the security Captchas that require users to solve math problems or pick out photos of traffic lights, or the way YouTube requires new users to verify their phone numbers before uploading videos longer than 15 minutes.)More of these kinds of changes would be welcome, even if they led to a short-term hit to engagement. And there are plenty of possibilities.What if Facebook made it harder for viral misinformation to spread by adding algorithmic \u201cspeed bumps\u201d that would delay the spread of a controversial post above a certain threshold until fact checkers evaluated it?Or if YouTube gave users a choice between two videos when their video finished, instead of auto-playing the next recommendation?Or if Twitter discouraged abusive pile-ons by making it harder for people who haven\u2019t followed an account for a set number of days to reply to that account\u2019s tweets?This approach might seem overly paternalistic. But the alternative \u2014 a tech infrastructure optimized to ask as little of us as possible, with few circuit breakers to limit the impact of abuse and addiction \u2014 is frightening. After all, \u201cfriction\u201d is just another word for \u201ceffort,\u201d and it\u2019s what makes us capable of critical thought and self-reflection. Without it, we would be the blob people from \u201cWall-E,\u201d sucking down Soylent while watching Netflix on our self-driving recliners.\u201cImagine you run a social network and you\u2019re trying to aggregate all the trending stories based on what all users are clicking,\u201d Mr. Harris, the Time Well Spent founder, told me recently. \u201cWould you prefer to jack the plug into each person\u2019s reptilian brain to aggregate those stories, or would you prefer to jack the plug into their calm, reflective brain that is considering the consequences downstream?\u201dThere may even be a business case for complexity.Consider what happened to Tulerie, a New York start-up that makes a platform that allows women to share designer clothing.Tulerie\u2019s co-founder Merri Smith told me a fascinating story from the company\u2019s early days. In the beginning, Ms. Smith said, the company invited women to join via a brief Google survey, which it emailed to hundreds of prospective members.\u201cWe wanted to create as little friction as possible, while still having to vet these people,\u201d she said.But only one person filled out the survey. So Ms. Smith and her co-founder decided to try a more complicated approach. Anyone who wanted to join had to conduct a brief video call with a company employee first.Logically, the new strategy should have failed. But it was a huge hit. Prospective members flooded the invite list, filling up the company\u2019s interview schedule weeks in advance. By creating a more complex sign-up, Tulerie had signalled that its service was special and worth the effort.\u201cIt goes back to values,\u201d Ms. Smith said. \u201cPeople perceive it as harder to get into, and they want to be a part of it.\u201dI don\u2019t want to romanticize the slow, often frustrating processes of the past. There is nothing inherently good about complexity, and the tech industry could still do a lot of good by reducing friction in systems like health care, education and financial services.But there are both philosophical and practical reasons to ask whether certain technologies should be a little less optimized for convenience. We wouldn\u2019t trust a doctor who made speed a priority over safety. Why would we trust an app that does?Advertisement"}

Others just weren\u2019t particularly holiday-focused.THE star of \u201cGremlins\u201d is none of the perfectly adequate actors in the cast but the mogwai, a small, furry, fictitious creature that looks something like a cuddly teddy bear with the ears of a rabbit, a Bambilike nose, eyes as round and deep and dark as glass buttons, a sweet disposition and a physical nature more unstable than hydrogen gas.At the beginning of the film, when Rand Peltzer, an unsuccessful inventor, buys a mogwai in San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown as a Christmas present for his family, he is warned to keep the creature away from direct light, never to allow it to have contact with water and, above all, never feed it after midnight. Bluebeard\u2019s instructions to his foolish wives couldn\u2019t have been any more specific.Rand returns home to Kingston Falls, U.S.A., a perfect movie set of a town, where the plastic snow never melts and where, you can be sure, they start playing Christmas carols the day after the Fourth of July. In this comically idealized setting, it\u2019s just a matter of time before each of the mogwai prohibitions has been broken, with grotesque results that nearly destroy Kingston Falls as well as the movie.\u201cGremlins,\u201d which opens today at the Warner and other theaters, was produced by Steven Spielberg and directed by Joe Dante, who was responsible for \u201cIt\u2019s a Good Life,\u201d one of the better episodes in \u201cTwilight Zone - the Movie.\u201d This is pretty much the same relationship that Mr. Spielberg, usually a director (\u201cIndiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\u201d), had to \u201cPoltergeist,\u201d the classic spook movie he produced with Tobe Hooper as director.\u201cGremlins,\u201d however, has a very different character, being a wiseacre mixture of movie-buff jokes, movie genres and movie sensibilities. It\u2019s as schizoid as the mogwai, which, having been fed after midnight, suddenly reproduces itself, but not in its own sweet, cuddly image, but as dozens of small, demonic creatures - the gremlins of the title.These second-generation mogwais, which look like the imps of Hieronymous Bosch, are at first funny, having as their only goal the pursuit of mindless mischief. They\u2019re neither good nor bad, just self-absorbed. Then, however, they turn seriously mean. At which point \u201cGremlins\u201d explodes in an orgy of special effects, which should scare the wits out of very small children for whom, I assume, the movie was made.Both Mr. Dante and Chris Columbus, who wrote the screenplay, have antic senses of humor, but they are unreliable. They attack their young audience as mercilessly as the creatures attack the characters. One minute they\u2019re fondly recalling Frank Capra\u2019s sentimental classic, \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life,\u201d and the next minute they\u2019re subjecting this Capraesque Smalltown, U.S.A., to a devastation that makes the original \u201cInvasion of the Body Snatchers\u201d look benign.I\u2019ve no idea how children will react to the sight of a Kingston Falls mom, carving knife in hand, decapitating one gremlin and shoving another into the food processor, head first. Will they laugh when Billy Peltzer, the film\u2019s idealized, intentionally dopey, 20-year-old hero, is threatened by a gremlin with a chainsaw and then stabbed by a gremlin with a spear gun? Will they cheer when Billy blows up the Kingston Falls movie theater, where the gremlins, now resembling an average kiddie matinee crowd, are exuberantly responding to \u201cSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs\u201d?\u201cGremlins\u201d is far more interested in showing off its knowledge of movie lore and making random jokes than in providing consistent entertainment.Unfortunately, it\u2019s funniest when being most nasty. The high point of the film comes when Kate, Billy\u2019s pretty girlfriend, admits why she hates Christmas. It seems that when she was a child, her dad disappeared on Christmas Eve, only to be discovered some days later, decomposing, halfway down the chimmney in his Santa Claus suit.\u201cThat,\u201d says Kate, \u201cis how I found out there is no Santa Claus.\u201d\u201cGremlins\u201d takes a fairly jokey view of all its characters, including Kingston Falls\u2019s own wicked witch, a wealthy, ferociously mean-spirited woman - nicely played by television\u2019s Polly Holliday - who refers to an impoverished widow\u2019s two small children as \u201cdeadbeats.\u201dNone of the other actors, including Hoyt Axton (Rand Peltzer), Zach Galligan (Billy) and Phoebe Cates (Kate) has a chance against the mogwai and the gremlins, made by Chris Walas. These mechanical animals aren\u2019t very lovable, but they are cleverly devised, and one knows where one stands with them.\u201cGremlins,\u201d which has been rated PG (\u201cParental Guidance Suggested\u201d), may not be ideal entertainment for younger children for the reasons described above. Running time: 105 minutes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Revive Small-Town America", "Date": "2018-12-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bylettersReaders offer their ideas, including improving access, helping family farms and giving rural residents more respect.To the Editor:Both my husband and I are Midwesterners by birth. I appreciate this thoughtful analysis of the difficulties facing rural America. However, I suggest that more attention be given to one of the basic problems facing rural regions: access. It is difficult to provide goods and services in these isolated areas. Attracting companies and new businesses is much more difficult because of their remoteness.We have not lived in the Midwest for several years but have family members there. Visiting them from our home on the West Coast involves flying to Denver or Minneapolis, transferring to a regional carrier to take us to Sioux Falls, then renting a car to drive the remaining 150-plus miles to a small rural community in South Dakota. It takes the whole day to make this trip.A century ago small rural towns were connected to the rest of the country by railroads. The loss of these connections has exacerbated the isolation. The access problem is not easily solved.To the Editor:The new economy includes the wide-open green energy industry, which rural-state politicians have demonized. And rural voters have largely hurt their pocketbooks by buying into the vilification of unions.Rather than complaining about being left behind by the \u201celites,\u201d rural residents might want to look at why it is that new-economy companies flock to big cities and progressive states, and bring their values in line with what will be needed to compete in the global economy. To the Editor:But here in rural New York State, we are well aware that while federal farm legislation is splendid for giant industrial-style farm operations, it offers little to the small farms characteristic of our area and essential to its economic health. Clearly, this complex legislation needs to be revisited. \u201cNo Farms, No Food\u201d says a bumper sticker you can see around here. Take it seriously.To the Editor:I have witnessed jokes on TV shows directed at the tradespeople who are an essential spine of the economy where we are resettling. Party platforms call for \u201cfree college education,\u201d excluding training in the trades. Editorials write off small-town workers as necessary casualties of progress.While I believe that rural Americans\u2019 support for Donald Trump is misguided, I also believe that the derogatory labels applied to them are equally misguided. Every social justice movement over the past 50 years has begun with pride. Can our platforms and remedies not hold the same respect for rural Americans that we hold for every other group in our country?To the Editor:We could organize underpopulated areas as locations that would provide health care, shopping, dining and meal delivery for the elderly. Hospitals would need to be built, providing jobs. Plumbers and electricians would have work.Amazon isn\u2019t going to build a facility in Perry County, Kentucky. But reorienting who lives there and what services they would need could transform the landscape.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Toxic Smoke Is Africa\u2019s Quiet Killer. An Entrepreneur Says His Fix Can Make a Fortune", "Date": "2018-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEric Reynolds will tell you that he is on the verge of freeing much of humanity from the deadly scourge of the cooking fire. He can halt the toxic smoke wafting through African homes, protect what is left of the continent\u2019s forest cover and help rescue the planet from the wrath of climate change.He is happy to explain, at considerable length, how he will systematically achieve all this while constructing a business that can amass billions in profit from an unlikely group of customers: the poorest people on earth.He will confess that some people doubt his hold on reality.\u201cA lot of people think it\u2019s too good to be true,\u201d says Mr. Reynolds, a California-born entrepreneur living in Rwanda. \u201cMost people think I am pretty out there.\u201d\u201cDo we know that it\u2019s going to work?\u201d he asks. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s never been done before.\u201dInyenyeri presents a real-world test of an idea gaining traction among those focused on economic development \u2014 that profit-making businesses may be best positioned to deliver critically needed services to the world\u2019s poorest communities.\u201cProfit feeds impact at scale,\u201d says Mr. Reynolds, now in the midst of a global tour as he courts investment on top of the roughly $12 million he has already raised. \u201cUnless somebody gets rich, it can\u2019t grow.\u201dMore than four decades have passed since Mr. Reynolds embarked on what he portrays as an accidental life as an entrepreneur, an outgrowth of his fascination with mountaineering. He dropped out of college to start Marmot, the outdoor gear company named for the burrowing rodent. There, he profited by protecting Volvo-driving, chardonnay-sipping weekend warriors against the menacing elements of Aspen. Now, he is trying to build a business centered on customers for whom turning on a light switch is a radical act of upward mobility.Inyenyeri is betting that it can give away stoves and make money by charging people for fuel. If it succeeds, it vows to deliver virtues that go well beyond the bottom line.Rwandans in rural areas \u2014 and, eventually, across Africa and South Asia \u2014 would be freed from the time-sucking drudgery of having to look for wood. People in cities, who rely on charcoal, could switch to cheaper wood pellets, using the savings to buy health care, food and school uniforms.In much of the developing world, initiatives aimed at sparing the environment tend to pit the livelihoods of poor people against the protection of natural resources. Peasants in the Amazon are supposed to stop hacking away at forests to clear land for crops so the rest of the planet can benefit from a reduction in carbon emissions. Yet in Inyenyeri\u2019s designs, the everyday concerns of poor households are aligned with environmental imperatives, because people prefer to cook with the stoves.At 66, with sunburned cheeks and intense blue eyes, Mr. Reynolds can at times sound like the latest white man come to save Africa. \u201cIt\u2019s just outrageous that we have three billion people still cooking in the Stone Age,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s entirely solvable.\u201dHe touts his ability to connect with customers, the women who do the cooking in Rwanda, though even after a decade living in the country he does not speak the local language, Kinyarwanda. He sits on the dirt floors of villagers\u2019 homes and speaks English slowly and loudly, exaggerating each syllable. Rwandan women trust him, he says, because he married one. He hands them his phone and displays the proof \u2014 pictures of his wife, Mariam Uwizeyimana Reynolds, 32, and their two fresh-faced boys, Terry Toulumne Reynolds, 6, and Marc Booth Reynolds, 3.On a recent evening, he visits Buzuta village, a scattering of mudwall huts on a rutted dirt road in western Rwanda, not far from the shore of Lake Kivu. He sits opposite Mukamurenzi Anasthasie, who is rearing two grandchildren and two orphans in a house with neither plumbing nor electricity.For most of her 60 years, Ms. Anasthasie watched the daylight seep away with a sense of dread, anxious that darkness might fall before she could find enough wood to cook a meal. The forests that once surrounded her village had been dismantled and hacked into firewood. She and her neighbors wandered for hours into the surrounding mountains looking for sticks.\u201cSometimes, we\u2019d just collect dry grasses and try to cook with those,\u201d she says. \u201cSometimes \u2014 especially if it rained \u2014 we just didn\u2019t eat. It was painful. We were constantly worrying about where we could find wood.\u201dTwo years ago, Ms. Anasthasie traded her cooking fire for an Inyenyeri stove, a red cylinder holding a chamber to burn pellets that sits on her dirt floor. She no longer spends her day worrying about wood. She and the children have been relieved of their constant coughing. She can put beans on to simmer and walk away and do something else.\u201cI don\u2019t have to waste time waiting for food,\u201d she says.In Mr. Reynolds\u2019s telling, his career in business was born of a simple desire to sleep comfortably.It was the early 1970s, and he was 21 years old, officially studying climatology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, yet spending most of his time scaling the granite walls of the Yosemite Valley. He and his climbing partner were unhappy with their bulky sleeping bags. They began sewing their own. As word spread that their bags were lightweight and warm, demand soared. Mr. Reynolds left school to pursue Marmot full time.Revenues multiplied, but Mr. Reynolds was restless. As a kid in Davis, where his father taught microbiology at the University of California campus, he had been reared on the works of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Gandhi. He carried a sense that he was supposed to be addressing injustice.\u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d he says, \u201call we really did was keep yuppies warm and dry.\u201dHe left Marmot in 1987, passing the years scaling peaks from the Andes to the Himalayas while based in Boulder, Colo. He took over a start-up that sold water-purifying pumps for backpackers. He worked as a consultant.Then, in the summer of 2003, he conceived what was supposed to be his ultimate creation, a business engineered to achieve social-minded goals. The company, Nau, designed and sold outdoor gear made from environmentally sustainable fabric. It sent 5 percent of its revenue to activist organizations. It raised $35 million in less than two years.Barely a year in, Mr. Reynolds was pushed out in a power struggle. He descended into depression.An old friend was helping design a memorial to victims of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. She invited Mr. Reynolds to help.He flew into the capital, Kigali, in March 2007, and drove seven hours over horrendous dirt roads to the village that held the memorial. The country he traversed was raw and broken. Thirteen years had passed since the wave of murder that had killed perhaps 800,000 people in 100 days, yet Rwanda was still seething with grief and distrust.The infant mortality rate was one of the highest on earth. Life expectancy was less than 60 years. The typical Rwandan had an income of $206 per year.As Mr. Reynolds visited villagers, he was struck by the impossibility of their daily existence. Clean drinking water was nonexistent. So were electricity and toilets. People spent hours fetching water and looking for wood.\u201cEvery time I went inside, I became more and more intrigued,\u201d he says. \u201cHow are these people surviving?\u201dSigns of the charcoal industry were inescapable. Fires wafted up from supposedly protected national forests. Steep, verdant hills once covered in rain forest were denuded and exposed to the elements. Rivers were choked with brown silt, the soil and nutrients stripped off the land by pounding rains.All this, to produce fuel that was quietly killing hundreds of thousands of people across Africa.\u201cThere is nothing in the house that causes as much suffering as cooking,\u201d Mr. Reynolds says. \u201cIt\u2019s dirty. It\u2019s smoky. Momma is there with the baby on her back, and both are coughing. It\u2019s ruinously expensive. I could see the trees disappearing and the mudslides forming. I could see that this was a time bomb.\u201dAfter three weeks in Rwanda, he returned to Boulder and tore into books and academic reports on cooking practices and stove technology.Philanthropic efforts were focused on distributing cleaner-burning stoves. For-profit ventures were developing models for sale. But all of these undertakings were bedeviled by the same problem. The high-tech stoves that limited toxic smoke were as much as $150 each \u2014 preposterously expensive for African villagers, many of whom lived on less than 50 cents a day. The cheaper models were useless.Most manufacturers were obsessed with keeping costs low, given that customers were poor. But the stoves still produced smoke, or took too long to cook, or required that the wood be chopped into little pieces \u2014 an extra burden. The women doing the cooking (and it was overwhelmingly women) were not inclined to use them. As Mr. Reynolds returned to Rwanda for research, he saw many of these models stuck behind houses or propped up by the cooking fire as stools.To succeed, a stove had to be so convenient and clean burning that women preferred it over their existing cooking method.Mr. Reynolds began testing stoves made in Italy, India, the United States and China. He tried making his own.He came to realize that the magic was in the combination of stove and fuel. He experimented with making charcoal out of corncobs. (\u201cA stupid idea,\u201d he says.) He tried burning banana leaves. Then he discovered wood pellets, which involve compressing wood and eliminating water, the element that produces much of the smoke.He settled on a Dutch-made stove that reduces wood down to clean-burning gases. Using pellets reduced the need for wood by 90 percent compared with charcoal. But those stoves cost more than $75.Then came the epiphany: Inyenyeri could supply the stoves for free while collecting revenue from subscriptions for pellets. Rwanda was urbanizing rapidly, and city dwellers rely on charcoal. They would be eager to switch to pellets, which were 30 to 50 percent cheaper.\u201cIf you sell fuel every day rather than selling a stove every two years,\u201d Mr. Reynolds says, \u201cthat\u2019s a business.\u201dCustomers in rural areas could not afford to buy pellets, but Inyenyeri could serve them with a barter system. People could gather sticks, though less than they needed for cooking, and exchange them for pellets. Inyenyeri would use the sticks to make more pellets.In this way, Inyenyeri would effectively become a utility providing clean cooking fuel. It would construct a network of factories to produce pellets. The bigger the business grew, the cheaper the cost of making them. As charcoal rose in price \u2014 a trend propelled by growing numbers of people flocking to cities and needing the product \u2014 the more appealing pellets would look.That development was getting a push from African governments intent on reducing the use of charcoal. Across the continent, charcoal is a $40 billion-a-year industry, one dominated by criminal gangs that pilfer public forests and employ child labor. Rwanda\u2019s government has vowed to phase out its use.\u201cTo be able to sell something that is essential to life, and where the government is actively trying to kill your competition,\u201d Mr. Reynolds says, \u201cis the kind of investment that venture capitalists hunger for.\u201dInyenyeri would start in Rwanda, where the government has gained credibility with international aid organizations for its success in reducing poverty. It could use success there as a springboard for expansion across Africa.The business model would get more attractive as the cost of charcoal climbed, and as innovation inevitably made stoves more efficient. Inyenyeri would also stand to collect revenue from an arrangement it later entered into with the World Bank to sell credits for reducing emissions.In 2010, Mr. Reynolds sold his house in Boulder and went all in on Inyenyeri. He unloaded his wine cellar, liquidated his retirement accounts and moved to Rwanda with no plan to leave.Today, Inyenyeri has distribution offices in cities and villages in Rwanda, including one inside a camp for refugees from the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo. It runs a small-scale pellet plant in Gisenyi, a city on Lake Kivu, and is developing a bigger factory.Company representatives go home with new customers to help them cook their first meal using their new stoves. Inyenyeri delivers pellets for free using bicycle messengers, and is close to rolling out a system that will allow customers to place orders using a smartphone.The company has engineered its own customer management software to track purchases of pellets, customer cooking habits and a host of other data, updated in real time by people in the field using a mobile app. The data has attracted research institutions including the National Institutes of Health, Johns Hopkins University and the University of North Carolina. They have undertaken studies probing how clean cooking technology affects public health, and how families freed from gathering wood use their extra time.But one crucial element is still missing \u2014 scale.In every company projection, a steep increase in customer numbers is required for the business to become profitable. Inyenyeri now needs to persuade investors to deliver the cash to buy hundreds of thousands of stoves and erect new pellet plants.For Mr. Reynolds, the all-or-nothing uncertainties are familiar. Back in his climbing days, he habitually opted for less-traveled routes. On an ascent of Everest that featured a rarely employed bypass around a treacherous ice field, he spent 58 days camped in the thin air between 20,000 and 28,000 feet above sea level.But Mr. Reynolds nurses fears. Once Inyenyeri demonstrates the potential in the clean cooking fuel industry, he says, greedy competitors are likely to emerge. They could pick off the wealthiest urban customers while abandoning the rural poor. They could buy wood from unsavory sources.\u201cI worry we could create a monster,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see us make a lot of money, and others are going to flock to this to make even more money by not being scrupulous.\u201dBut if the virtues of the business model have yet to be demonstrated, the demand for Inyenyeri\u2019s product appears overwhelming. Everywhere the company expands, word-of-mouth swiftly exhausts the supply of stoves. Customers speak of emancipation from smoke, and of less need to haul jerrycans of water to their homes from taps 20 or 30 minutes away by foot, because their pots are no longer covered in soot and need less washing.In Buzuta village, Dorcas Nyiransabimana, a mother of two, simmers beans and leaves them untended while she prepares to feed the pigs she keeps in a pen next to her house.Twice a year, she sells piglets, fetching 15,000 Rwandan francs (about $17), an enormous sum in rural Rwanda. With her cooking fuel secured, she can spend more time scavenging for food for the pigs \u2014 milk past its sell date from a nearby dairy and discarded grains from a brewery.Nearby, the walls of Ms. Anasthasie\u2019s house are bare, save for a torn poster of pop stars \u2014 Rihanna, Beyonc\u00e9, Tupac. A low wooden table and three stools are the only furniture in her home. The red Inyenyeri stove glows like a totem of modernity.She used to be trapped by her wood fire. Now, she leaves her pot to cook and gathers banana leaves to feed to the goat she keeps tethered to a tree.\u201cBefore, I\u2019d find leaves for the goat and come back and not have time to cook for me and the family,\u201d she says. \u201cOr I\u2019d cook for us and the goat would not get to eat. Now, we all get to eat \u2014 us, and the goat.\u201dMr. Reynolds hears this story as darkness falls. As he walks up the dirt road through the village toward his car, cook fires are glowing inside houses, smoke wafting skyward.\u201cThis business model will happen,\u201d he says. \u201cIf it\u2019s not Inyenyeri that\u2019s the first mover, then it will be someone else who learns from our mistakes and does it better. It\u2019s too big of an opportunity.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the name of global consulting company. It is Capgemini, not Capgemi.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Exploring the Future of Our Cities", "Date": "2018-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW ORLEANS \u2014 How do the greatest cities succeed?The question could not come at a more critical time, as cities around the world face challenges \u2014 and opportunities \u2014 unimagined in human history. By some estimates, 68 percent of the world\u2019s population will live in cities by 2050. Will city dwellers have sufficient housing? Can police forces cope? Will food distribution be adequate? What about the effects of climate change? Will technology provide the answers?Among the conference guests are policy and government officials, entrepreneurs, cultural and sports figures, thought leaders, and industry executives.Topics include the race among tech companies of all kinds, along with venture capitalists, to invest in urban areas large and small \u2014 like Amazon\u2019s plan to move to New York and suburban Washington; efforts to promote environmental resilience with an eye toward social equity; techniques for working effectively with state, federal and even international counterparts to advance local interests; thoughts on conquering the urban income divide; and the impact of athletes-as-activists on cities and the nation.On a lighter note, the conference is acknowledging the food and music scenes that have helped make New Orleans so famous.Some of the guests include the mayors of the cities of New Orleans, San Diego and Seattle; Mitch Landrieu, a former mayor of New Orleans who was the state\u2019s lieutenant governor during Hurricane Katrina; Steven Case, a venture capitalist; Walter Isaacson, an author and professor at Tulane University; Grant Hill, co-owner of the Atlanta Hawks; Adam Silver, commissioner of the N.B.A.; Stefano Boeri, architect and city planner; Emeril Lagasse, the celebrated chef; and Jon Batiste, bandleader and musical director of \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert.\u201d\u201cBoston is brutal right now, because we\u2019re going through this really huge growth spurt,\u201d said Ms. Lynch, who owns eight restaurants in the city and has won three James Beard Awards.She sees developers latch on to young chefs eager for their own restaurants, but then they lock the chefs into high rent, she said, and demand 6 percent of sales. \u201cThey\u2019re using your name,\u201d she said.Mr. Lagasse, whose restaurant empire has its headquarters in New Orleans with outposts in Florida, Las Vegas and Pennsylvania, also complained about being squeezed by rising real estate costs.Cities that have been through disaster learn one important lesson: \u201cNature wins.\u201dThese local leaders agree that while you can\u2019t fight nature in terms of the disasters that have hit their homes \u2014 hurricanes Harvey, Maria and Katrina \u2014 you can learn to live with it, even as climate change promises to make such crises even worse in the future.\u201cIt\u2019s recognizing that you have to look at storm water management as a system,\u201d Ms. Cantrell said. \u201cYou can\u2019t pump your way out of it; it\u2019s not just pumps and power.\u201dInstead, she added, preparing for disasters and recovering from weather challenges require many different strategies, including \u201cholding that rainwater, keeping the flow from going into the drains faster, raising your homes above the flood line.\u201dOf course, Ms. Cruz said, understanding the challenge doesn\u2019t make it easy to address. \u201cYou have to sort of fly the plane and fix it at the same time.\u201dDealing with the challenges of weather and climate require a new way of seeing the world, Mr. Emmett said. Texans have seen themselves, historically, as being in a battle with nature. \u201cWe were going to tame nature, by gum,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were going to build and keep growing.\u201dNow the realization is that people have to \u201cstay out of nature\u2019s way,\u201d even though too many people still live not only in the floodplain, but also in the floodway, putting themselves directly at risk. \u201cTexas is big on freedom,\u201d he said.Ms. Cruz said disaster recovery meant \u201cengaging in a massive battle over gentrification.\u201d Poor people can be displaced in a recovery as speculators buy cheap land hoping to make a score.Ms. Cantrell said the rules regarding recovery could work against those of limited means, since recovery money is often tied to the value of a damaged home before a storm.\u201cNo matter where you live, Sheetrock costs the same,\u201d she said, and so the income disparities grow worse even in the process of rebuilding. She recommended \u201cgap financing\u201d to address the issues, and to keep gentrification from driving people out of their neighborhoods.It\u2019s not the type of crime that typically ends in arrest: a murder in a parking garage after a suspected drug deal. But a camera from the New Orleans Police Department\u2019s $40 million camera system caught high-definition images of the probable killer.The department disseminated clear images and made an arrest within a few days, Michael S. Harrison, the police superintendent, said in a conversation with the privacy expert Julia Angwin.Although Ms. Angwin raised civil liberties concerns about the use of the cameras and their oversight, Mr. Harrison, who is usually reserved, was uncharacteristically enthusiastic. \u201cAny sheriff or law enforcement executive who does not have this is living in the Dark Ages and working behind the times,\u201d he said.Mr. Harrison said the city\u2019s 300 cameras were placed on public poles on public streets and that staff members from the city\u2019s Real Time Crime Monitoring Center tapped into the images only when prompted by a 911 call reporting crime in the area. He called it a \u201ccrime-fighting tool,\u201d not surveillance.He said that residents and businesses are now able to buy their own cameras, and that they can be used by the center to deal with routine nuisance crimes like drug dealing and illegal dumping. \u201cWho doesn\u2019t want to identify the murderer?\u201d Ms. Angwin asked. \u201cBut what about the protester, the dumper?\u201dMs. Angwin also asked about oversight. How could citizens be assured that protocols were being followed, she asked. And did everyone in New Orleans know how to deal with images generated by the camera system?\u201cWe have a clear system in the offline world,\u201d she said. Probable cause is clearly defined in court, for instance. \u201cAnd we know what happens afterward: how to challenge that warrant in court.\u201dIn Washington, the border between the United States and Mexico is often portrayed as a lawless place and a threat. But to local leaders in San Diego, Calif., and in Tijuana, Mexico, it\u2019s the line marking a close and mutually beneficial relationship.\u201cWe\u2019ve always managed to live with a fence,\u201d said Ivette Casillas, a member of the Tijuana City Council. \u201cBut between us, it\u2019s like a Romeo and Juliet story. Even though they try to keep us apart through this wall or fence, or whatever you want to call it, the love still exists.\u201dJust as important, commerce exists. When the United States closed the border for just a few hours recently, it resulted in about $5 million in economic loss, said Kevin Faulconer, mayor of San Diego. Each day, 135,000 people cross the border for business, for family and even to use the Tijuana airport. \u201cIt\u2019s the strength of us,\u201d he said.Ms. Casillas said that when the number of migrants and asylum seekers in Tijuana jumped from several hundred at a time to 6,000, \u201cthe city wasn\u2019t prepared.\u201d But, with the help of hundreds of local nonprofit agencies, they have been able to accommodate them.The Vertical Forest buildings of the architect and urban planner Stefano Boeri make the most of the often overlooked and profound contributions of a single tree.The beauty of incorporating more trees and plant life in urban architecture is that the trees both assist in absorbing carbon dioxide and in producing more oxygen.As Mayor Mike Duggan was trying to revive Detroit, he traveled to other parts of the country and talked with planners and officials in flourishing urban areas. He had vacant buildings, left behind in the early 2000s, as jobs had dried up and 260,000 people left the financially stagnant city.Mr. Duggan heard about the downside of prosperity, including gentrification. So he asked, \u201cIf you were in Brooklyn and you could rewind the clock, what would you do differently?\u201dLeaders of other cities told him that instead of displacing existing residents, they would work harder to keep those residents in place as rents and property values increased. Mr. Duggan returned to Detroit and worked to help carry out an ordinance requiring that developers who buy discounted city-owned land or receive a certain level of municipal support must include a minimum of 20 percent of permanent affordable-housing units in their buildings.Ms. Wylde said that Amazon was bringing 150,000 jobs to New York because the city\u2019s universities had worked hard to develop skills within the city\u2019s work force.\u201cThey are not coming because of the incentives we offered,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re coming for talent; they need a talent pipeline that is very big and that they can tap.\u201dMr. Duggan also required developers who received subsidies to hire a minimum of 51 percent Detroit residents. Those who did not reach that point paid a penalty that went into a fund to help train local residents to be plumbers, carpenters and electricians.In four years, developers who had started out with 6 percent local residents have risen to about 30 percent, he said.When Mr. Tubbs took office, he talked to his staff about Stockton\u2019s high poverty rates, with 22 percent of residents under the poverty line in 2017. \u201cThe crux of all our issues is poverty,\u201d he told staff members. \u201cLet\u2019s find the most radical intervention for poverty. Give me a policy.\u201dAfter extensive research, his staff came back and told him, \u201cGive out a basic income; give people money.\u201dAt first, they had conversations about \u201cthe dignity of work,\u201d Mr. Tubbs said. \u201cWork has dignity,\u201d he said. But he added that it was \u201cinherently undignified\u201d for people working 14 hours a day or driving lengthy Uber shifts to try to pay their bills.The N.B.A. has earned a term that its commissioner hadn\u2019t heard. \u201cHow does it feel to be the wokest professional sports league?\u201d asked Marc Lacey, the national editor at The Times.\u201cI didn\u2019t know we were given that designation,\u201d said Adam Silver, the N.B.A. commissioner, laughing. \u201cBut I understand the sentiment and we\u2019re proud of that.\u201dIn the past few years, the N.B.A. has found itself in the spotlight for the way its players and teams have spoken out on social and political issues. They are in stark contrast to the N.F.L., which has struggled to handle the reaction to its players kneeling during the national anthem.Which begs the question. Where would Colin Kaepernick be if he were an N.B.A. player?Mr. Kaepernick, who led the San Francisco 49ers to the Superbowl in 2012, has remained unsigned since the end of the 2016 season, when he took a knee during the national anthem to raise awareness of racism, social injustice and police brutality.He pointed to Mr. Silver, who has been the N.B.A. commissioner since 2014. \u201cAdam takes the time to listen and understand the issues and what players are concerned about and where they are coming from,\u201d Mr. Hill said.Mr. Silver said he views free speech as a part of a core set of American values being shared with an international audience and teams full of international players.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Genes That Make Parrots Into the Humans of the Bird World", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesLong-lived and clever parrots may be as different genetically from other birds as humans are from other primates.After comparing its genome with those of dozens of other birds, the researchers\u2019 findings suggest that evolution may have made parrots something like the humans of the avian world. A general rule of life span in birds and other animals is the bigger or heavier you are, the longer you live. A small bird like a finch may live five to eight years, while bigger ones like eagles or cranes can live decades. The blue-fronted Amazon and some other parrots are even more exceptional, in that they can live up to 66 years \u2014 in some cases outliving their human companions.In their analysis, Dr. Mello and his colleagues found that these parrots and some other long-lived birds shared changes in a set of 344 genes that seem to be involved in various processes that influence life span, like how an animal\u2019s body repairs DNA, manages cancer or controls cell growth. While about 20 of these genetic changes have been implicated in aging in other animals, the rest of the genes\u2019 direct role in life span has not been investigated. Future studies may reveal that they\u2019re not just important to aging in parrots or other long-lived birds, but in other animals as well.Parrots are distinguished not only by their longevity, but also by their cognitive abilities.\u201cThey\u2019re really, really smart animals, and the brains are particularly big. We seem to see a parallel in humans that have bigger brains and enhanced capacities, compared to other animals,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think parrots are the parallel in the avian world.\u201dThe team found changes in parts of the parrot genome remarkably similar to those that set humans apart from other primates.This intrigued Dr. Mello. The similar changes found in parrots and humans aren\u2019t to the genes themselves, but occur along regions of the genome that regulate the expression of nearby genes that seem to play a role in brain development and intelligence. Could these changes explain the parrot\u2019s large, complex brain and diverse set of talents?By looking at specifics in the genetic changes of parrots and humans, researchers in the future may develop a better understanding of the powers of convergent evolution. Perhaps there is only one path that leads complex brain structures and advanced cognitive abilities like those of parrots and humans. Or it could be that there is more than one evolutionary route capable of producing such complex creatures in different parts of the animal kingdom.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Are We Suddenly Surrounded by \u2018Grift\u2019?", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFirst WordsThe two most jarring events in the past decade of American life both had the whiff of a grand con about them. One was the crisis of 2008, after which a lot of ordinary Americans turned their attention to the financial-services industry and discovered something that looked, on the surface, uncannily like a classic bilking: There was a lot of hard-to-follow shifting about of who owned what and who owed what to whom, and in the end a lot of people found that their retirement savings had vanished. The other was the election of Donald Trump, who has always been fairly open about his talent for old-school hucksterism. To the very end, many people were convinced his entire campaign had been a long-game self-promotional exercise \u2014 a man wandering past real estate, casinos, reality television, mail-order steaks and wealth-building seminars to arrive at right-wing politics as a high-quality grift.The grifter is a lot more entertaining, and this summer, con stories seemed to be everywhere \u2014 not because of any sudden renaissance of fraud, but because the media had tapped into a bottomless appetite for hearing about it. The blockbuster was the tale of Anna Sorokin, a.k.a. Anna Delvey, a European 20-something who managed to persuade New York socialites that she was a wealthy heiress, living out of Manhattan hotels on, reportedly, a series of forged documents and an air of general blitheness. (Both Shonda Rhimes and Lena Dunham are at work on TV adaptations.) And this was nearly nothing compared with Anthony Gignac, an orphan who spent decades impersonating a Saudi prince. According to an October story in Vanity Fair, he was exposed when, during the slow negotiation of a multimillion-dollar business deal, he raised suspicions by ordering prosciutto.The appeal of these stories is hardly mysterious. There you are, stuck at work, while others somehow declare themselves to be billionaires or airline pilots or Stanley Kubrick. We admire the gall, and often the craft \u2014 the cinematic complexity of a well-developed con, whether it involves high-wire role-playing or just chiseling petty cash out of passers-by. If you ever feel like the old-fashioned grift has gone the way of fast-talking men in hats and three-card Monte on street corners \u2014 the way of Harold Hill in \u201cThe Music Man,\u201d commencing his 1912 grift with a rousing patter song about moral decay \u2014 all you have to do is Google terms along the lines of \u201celaborate Walmart returns scheme\u201d to witness the American ingenuity still on offer. It was a treat to read the story, this summer, of how a security worker for the McDonald\u2019s Monopoly contest spent years filching winning tokens and finding co-conspirators to redeem them. We deplore this stuff, in theory, but under the right circumstances we are entranced by the audacity \u2014 at the hacker\u2019s skill of spotting the weak spots in the systems that bind the rest of us, and bluffing straight through them.This line of thinking can, pretty obviously, be a glib one; to say something like \u201ccapitalism is a grift\u201d is to express an intuition, not file a detailed indictment. Grift is capacious. In just five characters, it can casually point out the suspect mechanics and empty, grasping heart of almost any figure or phenomenon. Young people look at their paychecks and suspect that their college educations were a grift, or at least the student loans were. One Twitter skeptic smells grift in all of \u201cthe business world,\u201d another in the artificial scarcity of diamonds, another in all skin care beyond sunscreen and acne medication, another in liberal podcasts, another in \u201ceverything.\u201dThis might scan as terminally cynical, a way of sneering diffidently at, well, everything. But it\u2019s not exactly outlandish (or unpopular) for a modern person to note that many of the systems she encounters have been carefully constructed to extract maximum profits, to sustain themselves, to get what they can while the getting is good \u2014 not unusual for a modern person to suspect it would be easier to deal with an actual con artist than with Wells Fargo or a budget health-insurance company. And perhaps this is cause for despair.But over the course of the year, it has begun to feel that the energy behind calling everything a grift is the very opposite of jaded. You just need to turn your focus from the grift to the negative space around it. If huge segments of our economic activity manage to feel \u2014 aesthetically, if not legally \u2014 like fine-tuned rackets, then the segments that remain must consist of actual work with actual purpose, productive labor that requires no puffery or misdirection to sustain. This is the surprisingly wholesome, traditionalist set of values that sneering at grift inevitably pushes you toward: old-timey rectitude and integrity, honest work and firm handshakes and mutual respect. The opposite of a grift, you find, is creating things of real value, paying fair wages, asking what is right more than what is profitable. The opposite of grift is a square deal.Advertisement"}

(Warning: iPhone addiction ahead.)Tech and media have long been converging. What are the biggest effects on the media industry, and how has it had to adapt? The effects cannot be overstated \u2014 and in some ways, everything is changing, which is what makes it so exciting to cover. The question is what the new power structure will look like. Will it be more reflective of America and continue to tell better stories about it? Or will it be meet the new boss, same as the old boss?At the same time, the digital transformation has introduced supercool ways of telling stories and given the industry a new dynamism from a new talent pool. At the end of the day, though, the basics still rise: penetrating, holy-smokes reporting in stories well told.How do you consume media now? Which gadgets or tech services do you use most often?I am so addicted to my iPhone that my fingers hurt. My distal interphalangeal joints \u2014 the ones toward the tips of my digits \u2014 take it particularly hard, though they are probably so strong by now they could lift a VW Bug. I\u2019m a 6s-type person, and if I didn\u2019t have the iPhone battery case I\u2019d be dead in the water by noon every day (especially when dealing with sensitive sources via battery-eating encrypted apps).Most of my iPhone time is spent on Twitter, far more than I want to admit. I use Twitter far more to consume than to tweet myself; I prefer to save my best thoughts for my column, though I am constantly reassessing that as I watch many of my colleagues make wonderful use of the platform to report without cutting into their more traditional dispatches. I\u2019m using Apple TV more and more, and am constantly toggling between my content on Apple, Amazon Prime, Netflix and the cable box. I\u2019ve yet to figure out the remotes; I just push buttons until stuff turns on. Spotify is a constant in my life, and it\u2019s what I usually use on my Sonos home speaker system as well.What could be better about the tech tools you rely on most for your beat?Also, the platforms simply have to do a better job of identifying and eradicating bots whose sole mission appears to be to inflame and harass. Yes, they target all sorts of users, but in some cases (and in the parochial terms of my beat) they\u2019re aimed at journalists \u2014 either to sway them or to just attack them, in another affront on democracy\u2019s fourth estate. Don\u2019t get me started on misinformation. I have too many columns ahead to fill on the topic.What tech product are you personally obsessed with? I\u2019m going to cheat and talk about two. And it won\u2019t be pretty. Let\u2019s start with Nest. The device \u2014 at least ours, which we got two years ago \u2014 has a mind of its own. At times, it makes me feel as if I\u2019m in the \u201cJetsons\u201d reboot episode in which the robots all turn against George. My wife and I are often away from our house for long periods, so we keep the heat low. The Nest allows us to warm it from afar hours ahead of time so we don\u2019t come home to an icebox. But then, for no apparent reason, the Nest will set the heat back to low when we\u2019re in the house so it is suddenly freezing again. This has happened in exceedingly cold weather when there are pipes to worry about. The device is running on an algorithm that we can turn off \u2014 I get that (theoretically, at least; my m.o. with tech is to figure out the minimum that will serve my needs and leave it at that). And I\u2019m sure there are other ways to fix it. The other day I hit up against a new and unforeseen problem \u2014 it went totally dead on me just as a cold snap kicked in. I forgot to pay the internet bill. I know one thing: My old thermostat was immune to my own idiocy, didn\u2019t play games with me or jeopardize my plumbing and I didn\u2019t need to pore through a manual to figure it out. We are giving it one more chance before we ditch it. Ditto Sonos. The stereo speakers are wireless and portable, so you can play music throughout your house from your iPhone, without having to hire a contractor to embed speakers in your walls or sell you some fancy and expensive system. But often \u2014 usually when we\u2019re throwing a dinner party \u2014 the speakers will stop playing as the app goes on the fritz for prolonged periods without obvious reason. (And customer support isn\u2019t all that supportive.) That never happened with my old Sony hi-fi. One more ruined playlist during a party and I\u2019m out.What\u2019s one app you can\u2019t live without?Surfline. It\u2019s not the only app to give you surf conditions and predictions, and it\u2019s not the only good one. But its easy-to-digest ratings \u2014 \u201cgood,\u2019\u2019 \u201cfair,\u2019\u2019 \u201cpoor\u201d \u2014 are great for committed surfers with the unfortunate affliction of a day job.

But then in early November, news broke that Amazon would build a vast campus in the neighborhood and hire more than 25,000 employees.Some inquiries have come from Amazon employees, but since only a few hundred will arrive in 2019, most buyers have been investors and New Yorkers looking to relocate to a neighborhood on the rise.The initial hype has leveled off, and with interest rates rising and signs of a recession, the market\u2019s ascent could come to a halt. But for now, while the rest of the city remains sluggish, the Amazon effect has changed the game in Long Island City real estate, as visits with three sleep-deprived brokers showed.Kayla Lee put on a hard hat and took a large work elevator to the roof of Corte, an eight-story condo building under construction where she is the sales director.She pointed to the nearby Citigroup Building, where Amazon has rented office space for the first wave of employees.

They range from $560,000 studios to penthouses selling for nearly $3 million.Since the Amazon news, Corte has raised prices about $30,000 per apartment; more increases are planned.The Amazon deal, Ms. Lee said, has boosted buyer confidence.Some buyers texted her offers moments after viewing units and are now in contracts to buy. One overseas buyer bid $2 million for an apartment without seeing it. When Ms. Lee took 30 minutes to respond, he raised his offer by $20,000. He is now in contract. Of the building\u2019s 85 units, 57 are under contract, with 35 having been bought after the Amazon deal.A handful of Amazon employees from Seattle have expressed interest, Ms. Lee said, adding that the number of daily showings had jumped from a half dozen to about 28.\u201cPeople want a slice of the pie,\u201d said Ms. Lee, 41, who led a potential buyer, Darren Floyd, 48, through a three-bedroom priced at $2.3 million.Mr. Floyd, who creates e-commerce start-ups and lives in Chelsea, said that moving to Long Island City would shorten his weekend trips to East Hampton and put him in an up-and-coming neighborhood.\u201cYou can just kind of feel that things are moving,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to buy after the wave has come through.\u201dPatrick W. Smith was bearing good news when he stepped into a spacious two-bedroom penthouse on the seventh floor of the Fifth Street Lofts, a couple of blocks from the future Amazon headquarters site.The apartment owner, Michael McGoldrick, had bought the condo for $848,000 nine years ago and recently decided to sell after upgrading it and purchasing a deeded parking space.His asking price was a million more \u2014 $1.85 million \u2014but offers had fallen slightly short. Now, with a sturdier market, Mr. Smith, a broker with Stribling & Associates, was here to tell him that a buyer was willing to pay the asking price.Both men smiled and recalled speaking on the phone when the Amazon news was breaking.\u201cI said, \u2018Can you believe this?\u2019\u201d Mr. McGoldrick, 54, recalled.Mr. McGoldrick, a commercial real estate lender, said he would weigh this latest offer.\u201cI\u2019m not in a rush,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t want to leave money on the table.\u201dMr. Smith, a longtime Long Island City resident and broker, puts out a weekly report for clients that includes weekly totals of all signed contracts reported in the neighborhood. Recent levels of buyer interest and sales have soared, he said.Before the Amazon announcement, there were fewer than five signed contracts per week in 2018, he said. But since the Amazon news, the figure has nearly doubled \u2014 and does not include many recent units that have gone into contract.\u201cWe\u2019re the only neighborhood in New York that is a seller\u2019s market,\u201d said Mr. Smith, who has taken to categorizing local listings into separate tiers, based on proximity to the Amazon site.\u201cNo one knows how long this will be the new normal,\u201d he said. He is working with an investor hoping to purchase 10 apartments. \u201cThis has always been a growing and desirable neighborhood, but since the Amazon announcement, we\u2019ve been catapulted by unprecedented national and international exposure.\u201dParis Hampton, a sales associate at Galerie, a 182-unit condo building across from the MoMA PS1 museum, smiled as a potential buyer, Ian Samlin, browsed the building\u2019s showroom.Mr. Samlin, 25, runs a money-lending firm in Manhattan and rents an apartment in Midtown Manhattan with friends, but the Amazon announcement prompted him to start looking across the East River. \u201cThere\u2019s a buzz and people know what Long Island City is now,\u201d he said.The plush sales gallery that shows off the luxury amenities of the 11-story Galerie was inundated after the Amazon deal.\u201cThe Amazon news hit and created a tsunami,\u201d Ms. Hampton said. \u201cWe had to start doing group tours.\u201dGalerie, too, is still under construction, so buyers have been bidding on units based on floor plans, Ms. Hampton said.\u201cPeople are excited to be part of a new neighborhood evolving in New York City,\u201d she said.About 50 units have been sold in the nearly seven weeks since the Amazon deal was announced, nearly equaling the roughly 55 sold in the building\u2019s first nine months on the market, said Ms. Hampton\u2019s boss, Vanessa Connelly, director of sales at HPDM, which handles marketing and sales for Galerie.After the Amazon announcement, Galerie filed with state officials to increase asking prices. One penthouse unit increased by $250,000, going from $2.5 million to $2.75 million, Ms. Connelly said.Gary Hirshfield, 57, an ophthalmologist from Queens who is also a client of Mr. Smith, counts himself lucky for having secured a three-bedroom penthouse in the building for $2.5 million before the Amazon announcement.He was back in the showroom to look at an adjacent studio for about $700,000, as a guest apartment.\u201cNow that Long Island City is more of a hot commodity,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u201cI might grab it.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a condo owner.

{"Headline": "The Fight for and Against Australian Secrecy", "Date": "2018-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter 85______But publishing news about this case is illegal.Judges in Australia and some other countries, including Britain, often issue gag orders that temporarily restrict the publication of information related to a criminal proceeding on the grounds that it might sway jurors or potential jurors.Sometimes, judges even require the existence of these orders to be kept secret.In this case, something unusual is happening \u2014 the sweep of the restrictions is so all-encompassing that the conflict between the public\u2019s right to know and the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial is rippling across the internet and the world, touching news outlets and institutions in distant countries.If you\u2019re not in Australia, you may have already read recent coverage of the case.If you are in Australia or depend on online news from international organizations like The New York Times, The Associated Press or Reuters, you probably know nothing about it.Gag orders, also known as suppression orders, are supposed to work that way. They usually apply to speech within a specific jurisdiction.But the global nature of the internet has blurred the lines, giving local judges the power to threaten any website accessible to local residents, regardless of where the site or its journalists are based.That includes The Times: The Times is not publishing the latest news of the case online, and it blocked delivery of the Friday print edition to Australia, to comply with the judge\u2019s order. The Times\u2019s lawyers in Australia have advised the organization that it is subject to local law because it maintains a bureau in the country.Two Times journalists who have been covering the case would be at risk. The judge in the case has threatened journalists with contempt of court charges, which can bring up to five years in prison.Some publications that have published the news have no full-time staff in Australia and face no such risk. Even naming them appears to be illegal.But the battle reaches beyond one particular case. It\u2019s a contest of competing democratic values.The core debate is an old one, pitting the right of the accused to a fair trial against the right of free speech, and of the public to know what\u2019s going on in the courtroom. Those poles are not mutually exclusive: Trials in Australia, as in the United States, are usually both open and fair.\u201cWhat you need for a fair trial are fair and unbiased jurors, not people who have been kept in the dark,\u201d said Kurt Wimmer, a media and technology lawyer who is a partner with Covington and Burling in Washington.Because of the way technology has shifted the media landscape, gag orders now raise additional questions of scale and geography. The question now is whether a local judge, in protecting the right to a fair trial, should have the unilateral authority to silence journalists and publishers around the globe.In the case at hand, a criminal matter involving someone whose previous position of power touched the lives of millions all over the world, the stakes are especially high. The defendant is well known, having played a public role with issues and institutions that inspire strong emotions, making bias harder to stamp out.On the other side are not just journalists, but also those who were affected by the defendants\u2019 actions over many years in many places. They demand accountability, and also claim a right to know, seeing secrecy as an accomplice to the crimes of the case.A few news outlets without personnel or a corporate presence in Australia \u2014 and therefore no legal obligation or vulnerability \u2014 have already reported the case\u2019s latest developments online. On Twitter and Facebook, where the news can be found but is not ubiquitous, there has been praise from some Australians that the news was posted, and criticism from others worried that publication has jeopardized justice.Other attempts to maneuver within the law have varied. One news site published the news online but tried to block access to the article in Australia. The New York Times published the news in its American print editions, but not online, while Australian media outlets have tried to sidestep the issue, boldly calling out the court\u2019s restrictions while avoiding mention of the underlying news.Several newspapers published front-page editorials this week. One led with a large-font headline that said: \u201cCensored.\u201dThe court, in turn, has been strictly enforcing limits within a common framework.Suppression orders that completely ban coverage related to continuing sensitive prosecutions have become more frequent in many parts of Australia. It happens more often when there are two related trials in close succession and the goal is obvious: to prevent the risk of prejudice by juries, and to ensure that accusers and the accused can have their cases heard without being undermined at trial or on appeal.But, international lawyers note, there are other ways to accomplish that. In the United States, the First Amendment prohibits prior restraint on publication in nearly all instances. Courtrooms are rarely closed, and those that are shut mostly involve cases with classified information.For the most sensitive, dangerous or high-profile cases, such as O. J. Simpson\u2019s murder trial, juries are sequestered. They are kept in a hotel away from the internet, television and other media when not in court, and ordered not to discuss the case with anyone.In Australia, too, there are states \u2014 Queensland, for one \u2014 that rarely muzzle the media to provide an extra layer of protection for a fair trial. But in Victoria, the location of this particular case, suppression orders have become fairly routine.Hundreds of cases each year in Victoria are subject to such orders, according to court statistics \u2014 a trend that began in the 1990s with dozens of overlapping murder cases involving organized crime. And the scope of these prohibitions tends to be broad. In many cases, they bar all information derived from legal proceedings, including ancillary issues that appear to have little to do with protecting the defendant, like a judge\u2019s ruling on challenges to the gag order itself.Some legal experts in Australia say that such orders reflect a misplaced lack of faith in jurors\u2019 ability to reach a fair conclusion without being influenced by coverage or related cases.\u201cWe should trust juries, and we should give clear instructions,\u201d said Bruce Baer Arnold, a law professor at the School of Law and Justice at the University of Canberra. He added that this was the standard in the United States, as in most of Australia. \u201cTake the law seriously. Obey instructions. You make your decision on the basis of the argument and the basis of the facts.\u201dJournalists and scholars have also argued that there is another problem with prohibiting publication of facts about such a significant case: the suppression of criticism and accountability.Several lawyers in Victoria declined to be quoted about the issues raised by this case, even generally, fearing they would run afoul of the judge.Members of the public who have already spent months in court observing the case\u2019s progress have also been silenced, unable to share their conclusions with the world when they are most relevant and likely to be respected.For now, one judge in an Australian court is altering how the world sees a global figure accused of serious crimes. To preserve a local media blackout, he and the case\u2019s lawyers, who have supported the media ban, demand that the rest of the world not publicly debate their competence or the man being prosecuted to ensure, as much as possible, fair treatment in court.To some, that suppression of information will be seen as a triumph of justice, a noble win for local self-determination and the rule of law.To others it will be seen as an act that, however well intended, undermines transparency and accountability in a case that much of the world would desperately like to discuss.______Let us explain.______Sometimes celebrity isn\u2019t all it\u2019s cracked up to be.______Why do some people get stuck in fear to the point of debilitating anxiety and stress, developing post-traumatic stress disorder or other panic disorders, while others seem to become more, well, fearless?______Fun and serious coverage abounds.

{"Headline": "Maybe It\u2019s Not Taxes That Scare Off Business but Failing Subways", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe animosity directed at Amazon and the legislators who have opened the velvet rope to the city has been fomenting for weeks, but on Wednesday it reached peak rage. It was then that Amazon executives faced members of the City Council, a body that was locked out of the process of wooing the company here, as well as protesters whose numbers were large enough that the council chamber could not accommodate all of them.Both officials and civilians wanted to know why Amazon needed billions of dollars in subsidies when it had so much money, why it was getting a helipad, and how it imagined it could be considered a good neighbor when the city\u2019s public land use process had been bypassed.Ever since the announcement was made last month that Amazon had chosen Queens for its second headquarters over Detroit or Pittsburgh or anywhere else that would have welcomed it with far less ambivalence, the move has served as a projection screen for a wide and emotionally charged set of apprehensions about corporate tyranny, displacement, inequality, democracy, unfairness, loss.How much of the anger at Amazon and its enablers is justified? Those in favor of the deal have repeatedly argued that 25,000 new jobs in New York make all the compromises worth it. Even if unemployment in the metropolitan area is low, and the city has added tens of thousands of jobs in the technology sector in recent years, civic leaders, like hypochondriacs in perfectly good health, live in perpetual fear that those sorts of gains could easily evaporate.Since the beginning of time, it would seem, Republicans have played out that fear in rhetoric about tax policy, insisting that unless local tax rates were kept low, companies and jobs would flee to other states and cities. In New York, that has not proven to be true. But deteriorating infrastructure could emerge as the real threat to job growth and retention.Although there were several factors at play, the first grievance mentioned by the firm\u2019s representatives, Ms. Wylde said, was that New York had gotten tough to live in: a company survey revealed that average commuting times for employees were reaching the 90-minute mark. \u201cThen,\u2019\u2019 she said, \u201cthey listed all the other reasons.\u201dLast year, as it happened, the Partnership set out to study the dozens of foreign companies in its membership, talking to them about the attractions and obstacles of operating in New York. The resulting report noted that \u201cin every interview conducted,\u201d the condition of airports, subways, roads and trains was cited as a major challenge.\u201cThe number one reason companies chose not to expand in New York,\u201d Ms. Wylde told me, \u201cwas the condition of transportation infrastructure.\u201d This is not a small thing. Foreign companies currently employ close to 300,000 New Yorkers and contribute 11 percent of the city\u2019s total $761 billion economic output.In the mind of the chief executive, inconvenience is vanished profit. The delays stemming from the failures of the R train or the incapacitations of suburban rail lines is money gone to the winds.So when does New York, with its cramped spaces and soaring housing prices that force people farther and farther away from Manhattan, making them even more beholden to unreliable means of getting to work, stop being worth it? When do certain businesses say, Enough, and invest in the idea that talent is mobile, that good pizza, in the 21st century, can be found anywhere? Amazon\u2019s move to New York is a vote for the belief that the city, despite how generic it has come to seem in so many places, really is unlike anywhere else. Can that optimism survive?Advertisement"}
