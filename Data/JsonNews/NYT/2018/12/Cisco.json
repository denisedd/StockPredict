{"Headline": "The Huawei Executive\u2019s Arrest Is Igniting Fear. The U.S. Should Take Notice.", "Date": "2018-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe New New WorldIn an email with the subject line \u201cTravel Restriction to China,\u201d the Silicon Valley networking giant cautioned employees against nonessential travel to China \u201cdue to recent events.\u201d Cisco has since said that the email was sent in error and that there are no China travel restrictions on its employees.Still, the fear is real.Over spicy hot pot last week after the announcement of Ms. Meng\u2019s arrest, an American-educated Chinese tech entrepreneur told me that he wouldn\u2019t travel to the United States unless necessary. Another Chinese tech figure, one who is backed by American money, discussed whether he should give up his beloved iPhone for a Huawei smartphone.The founder of an artificial intelligence start-up said that when he visited the Bay Area in October, he was questioned extensively at immigration. One investor, a former Silicon Valley engineer who moved back to China a few years ago to set up a venture capital fund focused on A.I., left his laptop at home and deleted messages from the social media platform WeChat from his phone in case American security personnel decided to take a peek. They didn\u2019t.(All the tech industry figures spoke on the condition of anonymity \u2014 to protect themselves not just from the Chinese government but from the American government as well.)\u201cOut of national security consideration, we can start thinking about the possibility of ousting Apple from China,\u201d Fang Xingdong, the founder of ChinaLabs, a technology think tank in Beijing, wrote on WeChat.On Chinese social media, jingoism is running high. \u201cA guilty conscience needs no accuser!\u201d \u201cBoycott Cisco!\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s detain Tim Cook of Apple!\u201dThe United States, on the other hand, risks losing important potential allies in its tug of war with China\u2019s authoritarian government. China\u2019s tech elite are comfortable with the American system and open to many Western values. It would not be in Washington\u2019s interest to push them closer to the Communist Party.\u201cThe party building in the past few years was a big present to the U.S. and Europe,\u201d said Chen Zhiwu, an economist at Hong Kong University.China\u2019s pro-market elites have been trying to use the pressure of a slowing economy and the trade war to push Mr. Xi to give power back to entrepreneurs, which would be in line with some of Washington\u2019s goals.Now, they aren\u2019t sure that the Trump administration views them any differently from the Chinese government.This time is different. Huawei is among the most respected private enterprises in China. The world\u2019s biggest telecom equipment maker and No. 2 smartphone maker, Huawei is frequently exalted in China\u2019s business world for elbowing out its bigger Western rivals and developing cutting-edge technologies.There are all kinds of tales about how hard Huawei engineers and salespeople work. Many entrepreneurs told me that they respected Ren Zhengfei, Huawei\u2019s founder and Ms. Meng\u2019s father, more than high-profile Chinese internet tycoons like Jack Ma of Alibaba and Pony Ma of Tencent because Huawei is the only Chinese corporation with a truly global footprint.The United States accuses Ms. Meng of being directly involved in efforts to circumvent its sanctions against Iran. The authorities there may have compelling evidence. For people not familiar with China and China\u2019s business world, it may be puzzling that some businesspeople would take Ms. Meng\u2019s arrest so badly.Still, many people in China who have grown up under an authoritarian regime see only a blunt exercise of state power. Because many Chinese view Ms. Meng\u2019s arrest as a tool to escalate the trade war, they see her as a victim of geopolitics rather than a potential lawbreaker.They also worry they could be seen as tainted simply because they are from China. Think of it as China\u2019s \u201coriginal sin\u201d \u2014 it is hard to be a truly independent private business in China because the government controls most of the resources. The Chinese government uses bank loans, business licenses and regulations to make sure companies toe the party line. It is increasingly a major venture capitalist.If the United States isn\u2019t careful, it could alienate a group of people who may be instrumental if China is going to loosen up and give its people more freedom. Many admire the American political, judiciary and economic systems. If the United States puts more pressure on them, they may be forced to choose sides \u2014 and the Chinese government may seem like the only choice to make.\u201cThe whole world is taking sides,\u201d Ren Yi, a senior investment banker in Beijing, wrote on the social media site Weibo. Huawei \u201csuddenly finds itself on the front line of civilizational confrontation.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Stocks Often Rise and Fall Together. They Shouldn\u2019t.", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThe stock market often acts as though tech stocks were members of a close-knit family that must always travel together.Talking about tech as if it were a monolith isn\u2019t entirely wrong. Tech stocks often do move in a pack \u2014 mainly because investors frequently treat them as a cohesive entity.\u201cWhat we call \u2018tech companies\u2019 really includes a broad range of companies that are at different stages of maturity,\u201d Professor Damodaran said in an interview. \u201cThe aging process for tech companies \u2014 which usually start out as high-growth companies \u2014 is very rapid.\u201cAlso, some companies are more tech at their core. Some are less tech,\u201d he added. \u201cWe should be looking at companies along a kind of a spectrum, along at least two dimensions.\u201dThe problem, then, is twofold.\u25a0 First, Professor Damodaran said, \u201ctech companies live in dog years.\u201d They have accelerated life cycles and behave differently as children and mature adults. A young money-burning company like Tesla and an old cash-generating company like IBM need to be evaluated with different metrics.\u25a0 Second, tech has become ubiquitous. \u201cNearly all big companies today are tech companies, at least to some degree,\u201d he said. In late 2018, simply using advanced technology isn\u2019t a distinguishing characteristic.Even the newspaper industry \u2014 which used linotype machines and pneumatic tubes when I started as a copy boy in the 20th century \u2014 has a lot in common with tech companies. Like Netflix and Spotify, for example, The New York Times and The Washington Post use streaming technology and data analysis to feed information and entertainment to growing armies of digital subscribers.\u201cOn the day that, say, 60 percent of profits and revenues come from digital sources, do we reclassify these companies as tech companies?\u201d Professor Damodaran asked.Similarly, he compared Tesla, which makes electric cars and is widely viewed as a tech company, with Ford and General Motors. Should Ford and G.M. be categorized as tech companies, too, when the bulk of their revenue eventually derives from electric vehicles?Tesla and IBM are at two ends of what Professor Damodaran calls the tech company life cycle.As an infant company, Tesla poses a valuation challenge. Assessing the value of a stock typically starts with an assessment of earnings and cash flow, but that requires imagination with Tesla because it churns out annual losses, not earnings. Yet investors in the stock market collectively say Tesla is worth about $60 billion, more than G.M. or Ford, which make profits.Will Tesla become profitable enough to justify its current price? Professor Damodaran believes its shares are grossly overvalued. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to know with a young company,\u201d he conceded, adding that Tesla is \u201ca risky proposition but not an impossible one.\u201dOld profitable companies like IBM are easier to value. The stock market says it is worth about $110 billion, based on a price-to-earnings ratio of 8.4. That ratio is less than half the level at which the average stock trades, presumably because IBM hasn\u2019t been growing rapidly and, by some metrics, has been shrinking.\u201cAn old company can\u2019t run as fast as a young company can, and usually it shouldn\u2019t try,\u201d he said.Sober analysis is critical to market health. Consider the damage done by bouts of magical thinking about the value of tech stocks.While valuations are generally more subdued today, imprecise thinking about tech stocks abides, with troubling implications.Amazon, for example, trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 109 \u2014 more than five times the valuation of the average stock. That has given its shareholders, including its founder, Jeff Bezos, astonishing wealth. It has allowed the company, which is old in tech years, to behave like an upstart, Professor Damodaran said, plowing profits into new businesses and disrupting entire industries.The answers should be different in each case, because tech stocks really aren\u2019t the same. One day, grouping them together is likely to seem quaint and, possibly, dangerous.Follow Jeff Sommer on Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.E. to Spin Off Its Digital Business", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGeneral Electric is spinning off its software business as part of the campaign by its new chief executive, H. Lawrence Culp Jr., to streamline the struggling industrial company.The move, announced on Thursday, is an effort to create a sustainable business from G.E.\u2019s ambitious and costly foray into the software industry.G.E., analysts say, correctly identified that the digital wave of the internet, sensors, data and software would fundamentally alter how heavy equipment was built, maintained and repaired. But the company\u2019s digital push, they say, was propelled by too much corporate optimism and too little appreciation of the challenges \u2014 a microcosm of G.E. management missteps in recent years.Investors cheered the decision, and G.E.\u2019s battered stock rose more than 7 percent on Thursday.G.E. spent billions and hired an army of engineers for the software business, called GE Digital. Jeffrey R. Immelt, then the chief executive, declared in 2015 that the goal was to become a \u201ctop 10 software company\u201d by 2020.\u201cIts approach to the market was overhyped and way too broad,\u201d said Steven Winoker, an analyst at UBS.Instead, the market demand was for software to parse the sensor data streaming off heavy equipment for tasks like predicting when a machine needed maintenance. In short, customers wanted software applications tailored for specific industries.G.E. has long made industrial software that animates its jet engines, power generators, medical-imaging equipment and other machinery. But GE Digital, based in San Ramon, Calif., was developing internet-era cloud software.\u201cG.E. is a 19th- and 20th-century industrial company with no real experience in modern software,\u201d said Thomas M. Siebel, chief executive of C3, a Silicon Valley start-up that competes with GE Digital.Unlike G.E., C3 followed the typical high-tech model for a software company, beginning with small team and steadily improving its product. The company, founded in 2009, has more than $100 million in yearly revenue and is growing at 80 percent annually. C3\u2019s last venture funding round values the company at $1.4 billion, Mr. Siebel said.In the last year, GE Digital has cut its spending and more tightly focused its business on software for specific industries. The spinoff move is a further move in that direction.The step is also a measured vote of confidence in the software business. Some analysts and competitors had expected Mr. Culp to shut the unit down or sell it off. Once GE Digital is spun off early next year, the business will have its own brand, board of directors and equity structure. It will be run independently, while still owned by G.E.But G.E. said it would sell a majority stake in ServiceMax, whose software is used to manage industrial field service workers, to Silver Lake Partners, a private equity firm. The financial terms were not disclosed. G.E. bought ServiceMax in 2016 for $915 million.GE Digital, the company said, will begin with yearly revenue of $1.2 billion, much of that software sales to its large base of customers in industries including aviation, electric power and health care.In a statement, Mr. Culp said, \u201cAs an independently operated company, our digital business will be best positioned to advance our strategy to focus on our core verticals to deliver greater value for our customers and generate new value for our shareholders.\u201dThe separate share structure is intended partly to be able to attract tech workers, who often want to be compensated with stock options as well as salary.There has been little appeal in G.E.\u2019s stock, which has shed 60 percent of its value in the past year, amid the industrial company\u2019s surprising cascade of troubles.G.E.\u2019s big power business has been battered, its finance arm has absorbed billions in losses, and government investigators are examining its accounting and financial reporting practices.G.E. is saddled with debt and has cut its dividend twice in the past year. Turning G.E.\u2019s fortunes around is the daunting challenge that Mr. Culp accepted when he became chief executive in September, succeeding John Flannery, whose tenure lasted just 14 months.William Ruh, a former Cisco executive who led GE Digital, is leaving the company.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can the U.S. Stop China From Controlling the Next Internet Age?", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech executives worry China will turn to tit-for-tat arrests of Americans in response to the detention of Meng Wanzhou. And the worries don\u2019t stop there. Ms. Swisher covers technology and is a contributing opinion writer. Imagine, if you will (and you should), a big American tech executive being detained over unspecified charges while on a trip to Beijing.\u201cIt\u2019s worrisome, because it\u2019s an escalation we did not need,\u201d one executive said, referring to the already tense trade talks between the two countries. \u201cWhat China will do, given all the existing tensions, is anyone\u2019s guess.\u201dNo one I spoke to would talk on the record, out of fear of antagonizing either side and also because no one knows exactly what is happening. But many expressed worry about the possibility of tit-for-tat arrests. While everyone focuses on the drama of the arrest \u2014 Ms. Meng was grabbed while changing planes at the airport \u2014 and its effect on the trade talks and stock prices, to my mind there is a much more important fight brewing, and it is about tech hegemony. Specifically, who will control the next internet age, and by whose rules will it be run?Until recently, that answer was clearly the United States, from which the Internet sprang, wiring the world together and, in the process, resulting in the greatest creation of power and wealth in history. While China has always had a strong technology sector, in recent years it has significantly escalated its investment, expertise and innovation, with major support from the government.That hand-in-glove relationship creates obvious issues, and the Trump administration is right to stop pretending that China does not present a threat both from security and innovation perspectives.But the high-profile arrest of Ms. Meng underscored a new and disturbing spiraling in the already complex relationship the tech industry has with China and the Trump administration.The Justice Department had been investigating Huawei on suspicion of having violated sanctions against exporting American technologies to Iran, and the arrest of Ms. Meng appears to be part of that effort. Since Huawei has become a global powerhouse in smartphones and equipment for the mobile networks, it\u2019s no surprise that scrutiny about whose interests it is serving would increase. The company\u2019s founder, and Ms. Meng\u2019s father, Ren Zhengfei, was a former engineer in the People\u2019s Liberation Army, which had long set off warning bells among American intelligence officials about Huawei\u2019s ties with the Chinese government. All this makes the move against Ms. Meng look like a particularly bold one and a message to China that the United States has come to play. The government has a lot to be concerned about. As critical 5G \u2014 fifth generation \u2014 wireless networks roll out over the world, many are being deployed by Huawei. These are the networks that will usher in the next age of innovation, and the idea of China \u2014 which pretty much exemplifies the surveillance economy \u2014 dominating that age is troubling.But I am perplexed about why the Trump administration has been such an embarrassment when it comes to the kind of actual leadership and vision needed to keep the United States at the forefront of the tech race. Our government\u2019s commitment to investment in what\u2019s coming next is the best counterpart to vigilance against competitors like China. Instead, we are seeing a loud but decidedly empty effort to promote the idea that tech manufacturing should return to the United States (it won\u2019t) and a very weak commitment to bringing qualified tech and science minds into the centers of power (a good pick for the head of the Office of Science and Technology Policy has yet to be confirmed after being nominated this year).From where I sit, the sentiment in Silicon Valley seems to be: Good for the government for being tough on Chinese companies when they break the rules \u2014 that rule-breaking having been a longtime complaint of companies like Cisco and Apple. Vigilance is key, of course, but everyone would feel a lot more confident if the government was also focused on investing more in American innovation and if the crackdown looked less chaotic.Which is why you can imagine a big American tech executive being detained over unspecified charges while on a trip to Beijing. And our government should, too.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Huawei\u2019s \u2018Wolf Culture\u2019 Helped It Grow, and Got It Into Trouble", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHENZHEN, China \u2014 Earthquakes, terrorist attacks and low oxygen levels on Mount Everest could not hold them back.As the Chinese tech giant Huawei expanded around the globe, supplying equipment to bring mobile phone and data service to the planet\u2019s farthest reaches, its employees were urged on by a culture that celebrated daring feats in pursuit of new business.They worked grueling hours. They were encouraged to bend certain company rules, as long as doing so enriched the company and not employees personally, according to Huawei workers interviewed by The New York Times.It is not clear precisely how Huawei\u2019s culture shaped its dealings in Iran. But an intense will to get ahead, which helped propel it to the head of the global market for telecom network equipment, seems to have informed employees\u2019 actions in previous cases that put the company under scrutiny.In an emailed statement, a spokesman said that Huawei requires all employees to study and sign guidelines on business conduct every year. \u201cAt the heart of the guidelines is the principle of acting in accordance with all local laws and regulations,\u201d said the spokesman, Joe Kelly. \u201cWhere employees are found to have acted outside these guidelines, the company takes decisive action which can include immediate termination of employment.\u201d\u201cIf it blocks the business from producing grain, then we all starve to death,\u201d he said, according to a transcript of his comments on a Huawei website.Security concerns about Huawei and other Chinese equipment providers are mounting among traditional allies of the United States.At the annual meeting of spy chiefs of the so-called Five Eyes countries, Huawei was among the topics discussed by senior intelligence officers from Britain, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States, including Gina Haspel, the C.I.A. director, according to current and former officials. There was no formal agreement to seek a ban of Huawei, but the discussion shows the loose coordination Western security officials have pursued as they try to push the Chinese company out of agreements to build the next-generation mobile broadband networks, known as 5G, some of the officials said.The pressure on the business is building. In Germany last week, Deutsche Telekom said it was taking seriously the \u201cglobal discussion about the security of network elements from Chinese manufacturers.\u201d On Monday, the Czech intelligence agency warned against the country working with Huawei and ZTE, another Chinese technology company.Huawei was founded in the late 1980s, during the tumultuous early years of China\u2019s capitalist revival. Mr. Ren was an engineer in the People\u2019s Liberation Army for nearly a decade before starting Huawei, and military values \u2014 tenacity, dedication, drive \u2014 have long suffused the company.In the early years, squads of Huawei salesmen crisscrossed China in sport utility vehicles peddling the company\u2019s telephone switches to post offices. Employees were given mattresses so they could nap while working late nights.Company lore, as recounted in employee publications and admiring books by business professors, is heavy on stories of dogged staff members enduring physical hardship. They worked to keep telecom services running despite a terrorist attack in Mumbai and an earthquake in Algeria. They braved cold and sleeplessness to provide mobile coverage to climbers on Mount Everest.Today, the working hours are still long at Huawei, although folding beds at work are more likely to be used for midday shut-eye than for all-nighters, according to three employees. Several Huawei staff members spoke to The New York Times on condition of anonymity, fearing reprisals.New hires at Huawei take part in a boot camp-style training course that involves morning jogs and classes on the company\u2019s culture. Employees also compose and perform skits that illustrate how they would persevere and serve their customers in difficult environs, such as war zones, according to three Huawei employees.In a research lab in Huawei\u2019s Shenzhen headquarters, a piece of framed calligraphy on the wall reads: \u201cSacrifice is a soldier\u2019s highest cause. Victory is a soldier\u2019s greatest contribution.\u201dThis intense work environment is not universally admired in China. Internet users savaged Huawei after a 25-year-old employee died of encephalitis in 2006. A spate of employee suicides led to more outrage in the Chinese media.When it comes to staff conduct at Huawei, there are \u201cred lines\u201d that cannot be crossed under any circumstances, four employees told The Times. These include disclosing company secrets and breaking laws and sanctions.But in company parlance, there are also \u201cyellow lines,\u201d employees say. They say they are encouraged to ignore certain internal rules, such as a ban on using gifts or other inducements to win customers, if it benefits the firm to do so.For some people at Huawei, these lines may have become blurred as the company grew rapidly around the globe.\u201cNot long ago, high-speed growth was Huawei\u2019s priority,\u201d Mr. Guo said. \u201cThis helped Huawei mature quickly, but it also caused Huawei\u2019s management to become negligent.\u201dNow, he said, \u201cwe must control the impulse to expand, and hold to account managers who spread themselves too thin.\u201dBy then, Huawei had said it had halted expansion in one particularly sensitive market: Iran. Still, United States investigators now say the company broke the law in connection with its business there.The accusations against Ms. Meng, Huawei\u2019s chief financial officer, stem from events in 2013.According to an affidavit that was made public during Ms. Meng\u2019s bail hearing, Huawei used a company called Skycom as an unofficial subsidiary for doing business in Iran. The filing, which contains information provided by the United States, says that Ms. Meng concealed Skycom\u2019s link to Huawei to reassure HSBC and other banks that Huawei was not violating American sanctions against Iran.As a result, HSBC and its American subsidiary had cleared more than $100 million in transactions with Skycom in Iran by 2014, the affidavit says.Huawei still has a presence in Iran. At a cellphone bazaar in Tehran is a store that specializes in the company\u2019s devices.Inside, a shopkeeper, Hamed Hajipour, says Huawei\u2019s phones are popular in Iran. Mr. Hajipour, 29, has even had his name tattooed in Chinese characters on his arm.\u201cI love everything about China,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great and powerful country.\u201dThomas Erdbrink contributed reporting from Tehran; Edward Wong and Julian E. Barnes from Washington; and Hana de Goeij from Prague. Carolyn Zhang and Claire Fu contributed research.Advertisement"}
