{"Headline": "What Good Is \u2018Community\u2019 When Someone Else Makes All the Rules?", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFirst WordsYou can tell a lot about the cultural status of capitalism by how we refer to people who buy stuff. \u201cCustomer,\u201d with its implicit deference \u2014 its suggestion that the buyer is always right \u2014 is now a relic of a bygone era. \u201cClient\u201d is formal and reserved for professional relationships. \u201cConsumer,\u201d with its air of piggish, Pac-Man voracity, is the slightly dehumanizing moniker most of us grew up with, but that was some time ago, before the rise of the brand as a cultic family. Now everyone who buys or uses or even just cares about a product or service has been collectively upgraded to something more ephemeral, almost spiritual, a loose association of souls brought together in one churchlike congregation: a \u201ccommunity.\u201dImagining such groups as little virtual villages is an old tech clich\u00e9, an echo from the days when the agglomerations of people on the internet were smaller, more like-minded and manageable. It\u2019s still how Facebook describes its more than two billion users, stretching the notion of \u201ccommunity\u201d thin enough to cover over a quarter of the earth\u2019s population. This is the scale of the demographic Mark Zuckerberg has now spent so much time reminding us \u2014 and, over two days of testimony in Washington, our congressional representatives \u2014 that he feels very, very sorry to have disappointed. As he told Recode last month, he is sorry that the company \u201clet the community down.\u201dThere\u2019s an association that still lingers between a \u201ccommunity\u201d and a physical location \u2014 the idyllic small town, say, or the utopian village, real or imagined. It evokes a cozy, friendly, simple place in which people live in easy harmony and cooperation, each with a role to play, each mattering to the whole.But the countless, ever-multiplying communities of today are something different: not collections of humans functioning in unison but random assortments of people who do the same things, like the same things, hate the same things or believe the same things. Life online is absolutely full of communities. There are fan communities, hobbyist communities, communities for users or enthusiasts of every consumer product imaginable. Every interest, every circumstance and point of identification, it seems, benefits by gathering under this feel-good umbrella word, which instantly puts a friendly gloss on every activity. People who interact are a community. People who don\u2019t interact but share some quality or belief become a community. People who are lumped into communities by other communities are communities. \u201cCommunity\u201d makes everything sound better. It makes \u201cthe activist community\u201d sound approachable; it makes \u201cthe skin-care community\u201d sound important; it makes \u201cthe Christian community\u201d sound inclusive and kind; it makes \u201cthe medical community\u201d sound folksy and skilled at the bedside; it makes \u201cthe homeless community\u201d sound voluntary; it makes \u201cthe gun rights community\u201d sound humanistic; it makes \u201cthe tech community\u201d sound like good citizens.The tech community, of course, is partly responsible for this explosion. Platforms like Facebook, which exist for the express purpose of \u201ccreating community,\u201d turn out to be in the business of exploiting the communities they\u2019ve created for the benefit of those outside (the business community, the strategic communications community, the Moldovan hacker community). They invite members to \u201cparticipate,\u201d but not, in the end, to make decisions together; the largest rewards, and the greatest powers, stay private. The company lays claim to everything of value that can be extracted from the assembled group. Nobody feels any personal kinship with a \u201ccommunity\u201d of billions of fellow Facebook users; only people who work for Facebook would ever describe things this way. But this communal language maintains the illusion that we\u2019re all in this together, working for something that will benefit us all \u2014 neatly keeping the focus on the things being \u201cliked\u201d and \u201cshared,\u201d rather than the ones being mined or sold.McMillan and Chavis also cited an important distinction between two types of community that have long coexisted. One is geographical \u2014 neighborhood, town, city \u2014 and the other is \u201crelational,\u201d concerned with the interconnections among people. Our sense of community seems to shift steadily among these very different modes of thinking. Over the decades, its meaning has lost the precision of city limits and has expanded to accommodate groups with shared values, planned and intentional organizations and a general sense of interpersonal connectedness. In 2018, it feels as if community is about being recognized as a certain kind of person \u2014 when it\u2019s not merely about fitting into a broad category. In other words, our sense of community is less and less about being from someplace and more about being like someone.This is certainly how it works in politics, where \u201ccommunity\u201d magically converts huge groups of people \u2014 what we\u2019d maybe once have called a constituency \u2014 into neat, undifferentiated units. Community is the spoonful of sugar that makes the othering go down. A politician might gingerly refer to \u201cthe black community,\u201d which sounds more validating and supportive than simply saying \u201cblack people.\u201d A \u201ccommunity,\u201d it\u2019s implied, is vibrant and productive and self-sustaining. It doesn\u2019t need others outside it to defend its rights or protect its interests. Adweek once suggested that \u201cthe female community is finding and establishing itself among the ranks of the techies in the Big Apple.\u201d The \u201cfemale community,\u201d of course, implies that disenfranchisement is just another ladies\u2019 choice.In the utopian-village sense of a \u201ccommunity,\u201d it\u2019s other human beings who accomplish this, exerting all their different social pressures over us to make us behave a certain way. This is a dynamic we can understand, and accept. Raymond Williams\u2019s observation \u2014 that \u201ccommunity\u201d seems never to be used unfavorably \u2014 still rings true. We imagine community as a cocreated project in which everything can be negotiated, in which everyone has a stake, in which democracy can flourish. The only things that can\u2019t be negotiated are the laws of nature, the floods and droughts and cataclysms and acts of God no village can avoid.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tesla to Halt Production of Model 3 Cars Temporarily", "Date": "2018-04-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTesla plans to halt production of its Model 3 compact car on Tuesday in a bid to work out kinks that have slowed assembly of the car, a critical vehicle in the company\u2019s business plan.It expects to idle its Model 3 assembly line for several days to clear impediments that have held production well below the electric-car company\u2019s targets.In the final week of March, Tesla made just over 2,000 Model 3s. It is hoping to lift that to 5,000 cars a week by the end of the second quarter. At one time, the company\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, thought Tesla would be able to make several hundred thousand Model 3s in 2018.In a statement, Tesla said it had planned downtime into its production plans at its car plant in Fremont, Calif., \u201cto improve automation and systematically address bottlenecks in order to increase production rates.\u201dNews of the halt in production was first reported by BuzzFeed. The company\u2019s stock price was down slightly in Tuesday trading.Tesla\u2019s trials in putting the Model 3 into mass production have drawn scrutiny from investors. With a starting price of $35,000, the Model 3 is supposed to be Tesla\u2019s most affordable and top-selling car. The company has been counting on a quick increase in sales to bolster revenue and enable the company to pare down losses and pay off bonds and borrowings while still investing heavily in future vehicles.Concerns over the slow pace of Model 3 assembly spurred Moody\u2019s Investors Service to cut Tesla\u2019s credit rating last month and question whether the company could face a cash crunch this year.Its financial troubles have been compounded by an investigation by federal safety experts into a fatal crash on March 23 that involved a Tesla Model X sport-utility vehicle that was operating with its Autopilot driver-assistance system engaged. The driver, Wei Huang, a software engineer at Apple, died in a hospital shortly after the crash.The National Transportation Safety Board sent investigators to California to look into the crash. Tensions between Tesla and the agency increased after the automaker suggested the driver was at fault because data from the car showed that he did not have his hands on the steering wheel for several seconds before the car hit a concrete barrier.In production of the Model 3, Mr. Musk gambled by creating an assembly line that relies much more heavily on automated equipment and robots than workers. But it has proved more difficult than he expected to get the machinery to work in harmony. He recently said he was sleeping at the Fremont plant while working to improve the production line, and he has described the delays and glitches as \u201cproduction hell.\u201dIn a tweet over the weekend, Mr. Musk acknowledged that \u201cexcessive automation at Tesla was a mistake. To be precise, my mistake. Humans are underrated.\u201dTesla stock and bond prices have slumped in recent weeks. On Monday, Tesla shares closed at $291.21, down 3 percent on the day. They have lost nearly a fifth of their value since March 12.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spotify\u2019s Wall Street Debut Is a Success", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpotify is a hit.On its first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the music streaming service finished with a valuation of $26.5 billion. The share price closed at $149.01, giving Spotify a market value similar to that of companies like M&T Bank and General Mills.\u201cThere\u2019s a healthy appetite among public market investors for streaming media assets,\u201d said Rob Sanderson, an analyst at MKM Partners.The stock opened trading at $165.90, meaning that Spotify was valued at $29.5 billion to start the day, before declining gradually through the afternoon.Among Wall Street traders, Spotify\u2019s debut as a public company drew attention for the way it decided to list its shares. It went with a so-called direct listing approach, a rare process that eschewed the usual circus \u2014 and safeguards \u2014 of a standard initial public offering.Typically, a company lists its shares publicly as part of a broader plan to raise fresh cash for acquisitions or other investments. Spotify chose not to raise any new funds by issuing shares, which would have diluted the value of existing stakes owned by shareholders.Instead, the company is taking existing shares and allowing them to be traded on the exchange. That allows longtime shareholders \u2014 like investors and employees \u2014 to sell their shares on the exchange immediately, though for years an active secondary market has existed for Spotify stock.The Stockholm-based company, which was founded in 2006 and went online in 2008, said it did not need to raise any new cash from investors, citing the roughly $1.84 billion it had on hand at the end of 2017.Daniel Ek, the company\u2019s chief executive and co-founder, characterized Spotify\u2019s manner of going public as perfectly in keeping with the company\u2019s self-image as a disrupter.\u201cWhile I appreciate that this path makes sense for most, Spotify has never been a normal kind of company.\u201dSpotify\u2019s direct listing approach was still seen as risky. Without underwriting banks acting as \u201cstabilizing agents,\u201d and without millions of newly issued shares to guarantee liquidity, the process for setting an opening price proved slow and complex. The stock did not begin trading until 12:43 p.m., the latest start for any company ever listed on the New York Stock Exchange, according to Kristen Kaus, a spokeswoman for the exchange.Afterward, the day went without a glitch, with Spotify achieving a trading volume of 30 million.\u201cIt was a safe landing,\u201d said Santosh Rao, the head of research at Manhattan Venture Partners. \u201cPeople thought this was going to be chaotic, but it was smooth.\u201dSpotify\u2019s arrival on the market followed the Wall Street debut of Dropbox last month, when the cloud storage company\u2019s shares jumped 36 percent on its first day of trading. Dropbox closed Tuesday at $31.59, far above its I.P.O. price of $21 a share.Taken together, the new offerings amount to a bright spot for a technology sector that has been badly beaten up by investors this year. Amid growing concern over trade tensions with China and possible regulatory scrutiny of Facebook, technology shares shed roughly $450 billion in market capitalization between March 12, the peak of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 tech sector, and Monday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Employees Jump at Genetic Testing. Is That a Good Thing?", "Date": "2018-04-15", "News": "Genetic disease risk screening is becoming a popular employee benefit. But the tests may not be all that beneficial for the general population, experts say.Supported byLevi Strauss & Company introduced a novel benefit for employees at its San Francisco headquarters last fall: free genetic screening to assess their hereditary risks for certain cancers and high cholesterol.\u201cIt really is a differentiator,\u201d Mr. Bergh said.The tests screen for inherited gene mutations that can greatly increase a person\u2019s risk of developing diseases like colon cancer or breast cancer. Doctors now regularly suggest them for high-risk patients, such as people who have close family members with certain cancers.But for people of average risk in the general public, a screening may not be all that useful \u2014 and could even cause harm, experts said. A person without a family history of cancer may have the same problematic mutations as high-risk patients, they said, but could have lower risk of developing cancer.In fact, most cancers are not the result of the hereditary mutations in single genes that these tests detect. Some experts cautioned that extending use of the tests to the broader population may lead some people of average risk to forgo recommended screening tests like colonoscopies. And they warned that it could also lead people to undergo unnecessary medical procedures, including going to the extreme of having surgery to remove their breasts.\u201cYou could scare the living daylights out of people unnecessarily,\u201d said Dr. Stephen J. Chanock, director of the division of cancer epidemiology and genetics at the National Cancer Institute.Color, the genomics company, takes something of a middle road. It markets comprehensive medical diagnostic tests that screen for all mutations of certain genes known to be linked to certain kinds of heredity cancers and heart risks. It has doctors available to order its tests online for users and provides genetic counseling to discuss users\u2019 results.\u201cBy using genetics, you can help some people prevent or interrupt something at an earlier stage where the costs are much lower,\u201d said Othman Laraki, chief executive of Color Genomics. The start-up advises users that they could develop major diseases even if their test results show no harmful mutations.Executives at SAP and Nvidia said they hoped genetic screening might ultimately help prevent at least a few late-stage cancers, the kinds of life-threatening illnesses that can debilitate employees and cost companies with self-funded health plans more than $1 million in medical fees.After Nvidia began offering free screening from Color last year, about 27 percent of its 6,000 eligible employees in the United States took the test. After SAP started subsidizing the genetic tests last year, about 17 percent of the company\u2019s 30,000 eligible employees and family members participated.\u201cIn the long-term view of a program like this, it\u2019s going to pay for itself,\u201d said Jason J. Russell, who oversees employee compensation and benefits for SAP North America. And, he added, \u201cYou are creating good will with employees.\u201dGiven the expense of screening more people of average risk \u2014 as well as follow-up costs from additional tests, medicines, surgery and potential complications from surgeries \u2014 experts said that overall medical expenditures were actually likely to increase. Even so, they said, spending on screening for conditions like hereditary high cholesterol, which increases risk for strokes and heart attacks before the age of 50, could ultimately prolong some lives.\u201cYou are getting good preventive care value for money, \u201d said David L. Veenstra, a professor at the University of Washington who studies health outcomes and economics.Color has raised $150 million from venture capital firms like General Catalyst as well as Bay Area tech luminaries including Max Levchin, a PayPal co-founder; Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive; and Laurene Powell Jobs, a philanthropist-investor who is the widow of the Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.The company has reduced genetic testing costs by using robotics and machine learning and eliminating tasks like in-person prescreening by doctors. It charges $249 for hereditary risk screening for eight of the most common cancers and began offering that price while more established medical diagnostics firms were charging $4,000 for similar tests.The price point appealed to OpenTable. It started offering genetic screening benefits after an employee with a history of cancers told executives she was spending thousands of dollars out of her own pocket to pay for hereditary risk tests.\u201cThis was a really interesting opportunity to provide some choice to our employees that was accessible and affordable so they could better understand their own personal health,\u201d said Christa Quarles, chief executive of OpenTable.As for privacy concerns, executives at several companies said that Color regularly sent them aggregated data on the number of employees with harmful disease mutations, but that the data is not tied to identifying details like employees\u2019 names or birth dates.Executives at several companies that have signed up with Color said they were aware of the debate over genetic screening, but said they believed the start-up was simply ahead of the curve.\u201cOver time, innovation becomes consensus science,\u201d said Mr. Russell of SAP.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "I Downloaded the Information That Facebook Has on Me. Yikes.", "Date": "2018-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixBut when I opened my file, it was like opening Pandora\u2019s box.With a few clicks, I learned that about 500 advertisers \u2014 many that I had never heard of, like Bad Dad, a motorcycle parts store, and Space Jesus, an electronica band \u2014 had my contact information, which could include my email address, phone number and full name. Facebook also had my entire phone book, including the number to ring my apartment buzzer. The social network had even kept a permanent record of the roughly 100 people I had deleted from my friends list over the last 14 years, including my exes.There was so much that Facebook knew about me \u2014 more than I wanted to know. But after looking at the totality of what the Silicon Valley company had obtained about yours truly, I decided to try to better understand how and why my data was collected and stored. I also sought to find out how much of my data could be removed.But that\u2019s an overstatement. Most basic information, like my birthday, could not be deleted. More important, the pieces of data that I found objectionable, like the record of people I had unfriended, could not be removed from Facebook, either.Beth Gautier, a Facebook spokeswoman, put it this way: \u201cWhen you delete something, we remove it so it\u2019s not visible or accessible on Facebook.\u201d She added: \u201cYou can also delete your account whenever you want. It may take up to 90 days to delete all backups of data on our servers.\u201dDigging through your Facebook files is an exercise I highly recommend if you care about how your personal information is stored and used. Here\u2019s what I learned.A history of the steps the company took to become an advertising giant.When you download a copy of your Facebook data, you will see a folder containing multiple subfolders and files. The most important one is the \u201cindex\u201d file, which is essentially a raw data set of your Facebook account, where you can click through your profile, friends list, timeline and messages, among other features.This was unsettling. I had hoped Messenger would use my contacts list to find others who were also using the app so that I could connect with them easily \u2014 and hold on to the relevant contact information only for the people who were on Messenger. Yet Facebook kept the entire list, including the phone numbers for my car mechanic, my apartment door buzzer and a pizzeria.My Facebook data also revealed how little the social network forgets. For instance, in addition to recording the exact date I signed up for Facebook in 2004, there was a record of when I deactivated Facebook in October 2010, only to reactivate it four days later \u2014 something I barely remember doing.Facebook also kept a history of each time I opened Facebook over the last two years, including which device and web browser I used. On some days, it even logged my locations, like when I was at a hospital two years ago or when I visited Tokyo last year.Facebook keeps a log of this data as a security measure to flag suspicious logins from unknown devices or locations, similar to how banks send a fraud alert when your credit card number is used in a suspicious location. This practice seemed reasonable, so I didn\u2019t try to purge this information.But what bothered me was the data that I had explicitly deleted but that lingered in plain sight. On my friends list, Facebook had a record of \u201cRemoved Friends,\u201d a dossier of the 112 people I had removed along with the date I clicked the \u201cUnfriend\u201d button. Why should Facebook remember the people I\u2019ve cut off from my life?Facebook\u2019s explanation was dissatisfying. The company said it might use my list of deleted friends so that those people did not appear in my feed with the feature \u201cOn This Day,\u201d which resurfaces memories from years past to help people reminisce. I\u2019d rather have the option to delete the list of deleted friends for good.What Facebook retained about me isn\u2019t remotely as creepy as the sheer number of advertisers that have my information in their databases. I found this out when I clicked on the Ads section in my Facebook file, which loaded a history of the dozen ads I had clicked on while browsing the social network.Lower down, there was a section titled \u201cAdvertisers with your contact info,\u201d followed by a list of roughly 500 brands, the overwhelming majority of which I had never interacted with. Some brands sounded obscure and sketchy \u2014 one was called \u201cMicrophone Check,\u201d which turned out to be a radio show. Other brands were more familiar, like Victoria\u2019s Secret Pink, Good Eggs or AARP.Facebook said unfamiliar advertisers might appear on the list because they might have obtained my contact information from elsewhere, compiled it into a list of people they wanted to target and uploaded that list into Facebook. Brands can upload their customer lists into a tool called Custom Audiences, which helps them find those same people\u2019s Facebook profiles to serve them ads.Brands can obtain your information in many different ways. Those include:\u25a0 Getting your information in simpler ways, too. Someone you shared information with could share it with another entity. Your credit card loyalty program, for example, could share your information with a hotel chain, and that hotel chain could serve you ads on Facebook.The upshot? Even a Facebook lurker, like myself, who has barely clicked on any digital ads can have personal information exposed to an enormous number of advertisers. This was not entirely surprising, but seeing the list of unfamiliar brands with my contact information in my Facebook file was a dose of reality.I tried to contact some of these advertisers, like Very Important Puppets, a toymaker, to ask them about what they did with my data. They did not respond.Let\u2019s be clear: Facebook is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to what information tech companies have collected on me.In another folder, labeled Android, Google had a record of apps I had opened on an Android phone since 2015, along with the date and time. This felt like an extraordinary level of detail.Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.On a brighter note, I downloaded an archive of my LinkedIn data. The data set was less than half a megabyte and contained exactly what I had expected: spreadsheets of my LinkedIn contacts and information I had added to my profile.Yet that offered little solace. Be warned: Once you see the vast amount of data that has been collected about you, you won\u2019t be able to unsee it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Time Warner C.E.O. Testifies That AT&T Merger Is Needed to Battle Silicon Valley", "Date": "2018-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Time Warner\u2019s chief executive, Jeffrey Bewkes, vigorously defended his company\u2019s $85.4 billion merger with AT&T on Wednesday, saying the deal was necessary to confront \u201ctectonic changes\u201d in entertainment caused by internet competitors like Netflix and Amazon.Before a packed courtroom on Wednesday, Mr. Bewkes portrayed Time Warner as an underdog against Silicon Valley giants that can reach hundreds of millions of users and are spending billions of dollars a year to produce original shows that compete with Time Warner\u2019s HBO and Turner Broadcasting.\u201cWe don\u2019t have the tech platform, don\u2019t have the engineers, don\u2019t have the infrastructure,\u201d Mr. Bewkes said in arguing for his company\u2019s need to combine with AT&T, a mobile wireless and satellite television giant with access to more than 150 million subscribers nationwide.In cross-examination, a lawyer for the Justice Department grilled Mr. Bewkes on the underdog narrative, and presented an internal document that Mr. Bewkes wrote in January 2017 to Time Warner\u2019s board that touted the company\u2019s revenue projections. The document also showed that Time Warner was planning to introduce digital products even without the potential merger.AT&T\u2019s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, is expected to testify as soon as Thursday. John Stankey, the AT&T executive who is poised to run Time Warner after the merger, also began testimony on Wednesday afternoon. Arguments are expected to close as early as April 30. Judge Richard J. Leon of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, who is presiding over the case, is expected to take about a month before giving his opinion.For Mr. Bewkes, 65, the courtroom appearance was a rare public pleading to salvage a career-defining deal. The media titan is a 39-year veteran of Time Warner and has been chief executive since 2008, overseeing the spinoff of Time Warner Cable a year later, the rise of HBO and the turbulent evolution of CNN and the Warner Bros. movie studio.Confident and congenial, Mr. Bewkes engaged directly with Judge Leon, leaning forward in his chair and making eye contact as he explained how the media industry is being challenged by Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google and Netflix. He described the Justice Department\u2019s theory that the merged company would threaten to withhold Time Warner content from rival cable operators as \u201cridiculous.\u201dAmong the biggest problems for Time Warner as a stand-alone television and movie producer is that it does not have access to viewer data to target advertising and other valuable customer information the same way that Amazon and Netflix do, Mr. Bewkes said.\u201cWe don\u2019t have emails, contact information, billing information \u2026 any of these things,\u201d he said.At the center of the antitrust trial are arguments over consumer and competitive harms, with attention focused on economic analyses presented by both sides last week. The Justice Department and several consumer groups said the deal would hurt consumers, who would have to pay bigger bills as a result of higher prices for Time Warner programs.The companies have argued that the Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit is at least a decade behind the times. Time Warner said companies like Google and Facebook have the most valuable data on users but they are not willing to share that information.Mr. Bewkes said he has also unsuccessfully tried to buy data on viewers from distributors like Comcast, which was only willing to sell limited sets.These trends prompted Mr. Stephenson and Mr. Bewkes in the summer of 2016 to meet to discuss business options, Mr. Bewkes said Wednesday. In late August 2016, over a three-hour lunch on the 10th-floor dining room of the Time Warner building in New York, they agreed a merger made the most sense. The companies\u2019 boards approved the plan soon after.Judge Leon, who has not commented much throughout the trial, has said the action was a \u201crare breed of horse\u201d but not a \u201cunicorn.\u201dMr. Bewkes and Mr. Stephenson have previously suggested that the Justice Department was influenced to block the deal by presidential politics. President Trump said during his election campaign that the deal should be denied. Mr. Trump has also repeatedly bashed CNN for its coverage of his administration.The Justice Department has denied any political interference in its suit to block the deal.Advertisement"}

He was visiting from San Francisco, and as we sat in the white-brick backyard of a bar, he urged me to disclose my location to him on Find My Friends, a function that Apple began quietly placing on all iPhones in 2015. In a world where we use social media to broadcast highly curated versions of ourselves, the app offers a frightening antithesis: to tell the people in our lives, via a small orange dot moving across a map, exactly where we are at all times. \u201cWhat are you hiding?\u201d Jeff asked me, giggling and snapping his gum like some teenage villain.In the next few weeks, I was more in touch with Jeff than I had been in the half-decade since I left California. During his visit, we\u2019d spoken about all the hiking I wasn\u2019t doing and all the hiking that he was, so I took the opportunity, when I saw him stuck in gridlock traffic on the freeway at the foot of Potrero Hill, to text: \u201cHow\u2019re those great outdoors treating you, bud?\u201d During a week when I had dodged a call, claiming the careerist busyness of a New Yorker, he caught me strolling through Central Park at 3 on a Tuesday, and he volleyed back. Sometime in July, Jeff and his wife, Evyan, went up to the Russian River, where as a kid I learned to swim crosscurrent. It\u2019s a place I dream of often, and when I saw him there, I wrote to say that I missed them, missed the river. \u201cSend a picture,\u201d I wrote, and he did. It felt so much better to see it this way, a piece of their lives I\u2019d asked for, than to encounter it on Instagram and absently double-tap.That I should expose myself this way is particularly strange, given how I value my independence, often leaving my normal life for months at a time to be alone in the woods. Oddly enough, the app that allows my friends to spy on me constantly supports this part of me, too. Late in September, I planned a hike to a peak in the White Mountains, on the border of Maine and New Hampshire, precisely the type of risky, grueling, seven-hour undertaking I was told as a Girl Scout never to do alone. There most likely wouldn\u2019t be enough service to make a phone call if I missed a crucial cairn or snapped an ankle, but GPS would work, so I asked two friends to periodically check my dot, and to call someone if, by an hour after dark, it had disappeared or stopped moving.That climb was astonishing, the green sugar maples giving way to oversaturated orange and red as the altitude rose and the temperature dropped. Not passing anyone on my way past the tree line was moving, and scrambling alone up the pink granite was a spectacle, but there was also the pleasure of being seen like this, by the people who know me \u2014 as solitary as I often want to be, as silent and as far.Kathleen Alcott is a writer whose third novel, \u201cAmerica Was Hard to Find,\u201d will be published by Ecco in 2019.Advertisement"}

By then, debt held by the public will almost match the size of the nation\u2019s economy, reaching 96 percent of gross domestic product, a higher level than any point since just after World War II and well past the level that economists say could court a crisis.The new C.B.O. projection is the first since President Trump signed a tax cut that is expected to cost the government nearly $1.9 trillion over 11 years, then signed legislation to significantly boost military and domestic spending over the next two years. The figures are sobering, even in a political climate where deficit concerns appear to be receding.This fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, the budget deficit is expected to total $804 billion, up from $665 billion last fiscal year, according to the C.B.O. projections. In a decade, the red ink is expected to reach $1.5 trillion.\u2014 Thomas KaplanWhen he goes before Congress this week, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, will issue a broad apology for letting the website be used as a conduit for fake news, election meddling by foreign entities, hate speech and privacy abuses, according to a copy of his testimony released on Monday.Mr. Zuckerberg, in his prepared remarks, addresses the scandal, saying that Facebook must do more to protect its users\u2019 personal information. The company, he says, will block app developers from gaining access to the data of users who have been inactive for three months; restrict the ability of users to inadvertently share information about others in their networks; and adopt stricter permissions guidelines and search features.Democrats are expected to grill Mr. Zuckerberg about the privacy scandals, and how the social network is guarding against possible interference in this fall\u2019s midterm elections. Republicans are expected to be more reticent about privacy regulations, and may use the hearings to raise suspicions of political bias on the social network.More from The Information:\u201cOverall, there has never been a time where we have seen so much focus on diversity.

{"Headline": "Goldman\u2019s Gains in Trading Raise a Familiar Dilemma: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Tuesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 A \u2018Geneva Convention\u2019 for cyberwar?\u2022 Did Goldman\u2019s trading business perform too well?\u2022 The U.S.-China fight has pushed deeper into tech.Goldman Sachs\u2019s strong first-quarter earnings raise a familiar dilemma for the bank.The results got a significant fillip from trading, a business Goldman must do well in, but not so well that investors think the bank is too dependent on it. And a breakdown of first-quarter revenue shows the dominance of trading. Revenue from trading in stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities and derivatives totaled $4.39 billion during the first three months of the year. That works out at 44 percent of total revenue, well above the 37 percent share that trading had in 2017.Stock and bond markets are unpredictable, even in relatively good times, so the helpful trading conditions this quarter may not last. What can Goldman\u2019s senior executives do to persuade investors that the bank is a lot more than a trading shop? They can point to the fact that David M. Solomon is in line to succeed Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman\u2019s current C.E.O. Mr. Solomon ascent took place in the bank\u2019s powerful investment banking division, not its trading operations.Goldman\u2019s leaders can continue to talk about the steps the bank is taking to widen its client base and diversify into other businesses that might have more stable revenue, like its relatively new consumer lending operations. But such businesses are going to take time to make a meaningful contribution.And it\u2019s important to remember that other major businesses at Goldman are also volatile. Investing and lending, which mostly involves making longer-term investments in companies, and whose revenue can be unpredictable, made up 21 percent of total revenue in the first quarter, the second largest contribution.Despite the bumper results in trading along with investing and lending, Goldman\u2019s shares slid slightly on Tuesday, suggesting investors are waiting on longer-term trends than one quarter\u2019s results.But the volatility of revenue is not the only reason investors are often skeptical about Wall Street firms. The huge amounts that they pay out in compensation is also a concern. When revenue rises, so does pay. As a result, money that could have fallen to the bottom line at other types of companies instead gets paid out to traders and bankers. Compensation at Goldman Sachs made up 45 percent of non-interest revenue in the first quarter, up from 44 percent the first quarter of 2017.\u2014 Peter EavisHere are the numbers:The move comes amid an outcry prompted by the arrests of two African-American men at a Starbucks location in Philadelphia last week.The two men were arrested after asking to use the restroom in the shop. An employee refused their request, because the men had not bought anything, according to officials. The men sat down and were asked to leave, and an employee eventually called the police. The prosecutor\u2019s office in Philadelphia reviewed the case and declined to pursue charges against the men because of \u201ca lack of evidence that a crime was committed,\u201d according to a spokesman.Some may be optimistic that the $1.5 trillion tax cut will extend the business cycle.The strategists at Morgan Stanley are not among them.\u201cWhile there\u2019s a fair amount of debate about how much this fiscal expansion extended the economic cycle, for markets our analysis suggests we\u2019re closer to the end of the day than the beginning. Hence, there\u2019s less reason to behave like it\u2019s \u2018morning in America\u2019 than \u2018happy hour in America.\u2019\u201dKey points\u2022 Morgan Stanley argues that while the tax cuts will help lift growth in the near term, its benefits are already priced into the markets.\u2022 The new tax law creates economic cliffs, as many key provisions in the law are not permanent and end in just a few years.\u2022 The tax cuts may make it more difficult for the government to turn to fiscal stimulus to fight the next downturn.In conclusion\u201cWhile this policy supports growth in the near term, it may worsen the next downturn while limiting the fiscal reaction to it. Even if those concerns are unfounded, we think much of fiscal stimulus\u2019 \u2018good news\u2019 is already in the price of key markets.\u201dThe streaming video company added 7.41 million subscribers during the first quarter. Its profit jumped 62 percent, and sales grew 40 percent.Netflix also said it plans to spend $10 billion on content and marketing this year.Shares are up 8.6 percent Tuesday and 75 percent this year. That easily beats the S.&P. 500, which has gained just 0.2 percent this year. It also tops the performance of its fellow FANG stocks. Facebook is off 4.5 percent this year, Google-parent Alphabet is up about 3 percent, and Amazon has risen 28 percent.Stephen Ju, an analyst over at Credit Suisse, writes in a note titled \u201cGetting Closer and Closer to Achieving Escape Velocity\u201d:\u201cNetflix continues to reap the benefits of its programming win streak, as it wields its large content acquisition budget as a weapon to put greater distance between itself and its competitors (especially as Disney prepares to exit the platform). And we find it hard to argue with the accelerated pace of subscriber additions as the conceptual proof of its capital allocation decision, and we also expect the Street to continue to underwrite the investments.\u201dTwitter is having an even better day.The stock is up 87 percent over that period.The NYT\u2019s David Sanger says the impetus came largely from Microsoft\u2019s president, Brad Smith, \u201cwho has been arguing for several years that the world needs a \u2018digital Geneva Convention\u2019 that sets norms of behavior for cyberspace just as the Geneva Conventions set rules for the conduct of war in the physical world.\u201dAlso striking: Who hasn\u2019t yet signed, including Google, Apple and Amazon.More from Michael:Ms. Massenet and Mr. Brown are counting on Ms. Massenet\u2019s Net-a-Porter experience and contacts to help Imaginary Ventures stand out. The firm has already invested in companies like Glossier and Everlane, an upstart clothing brand.Mr. Ballmer said of the latest report, \u201cPublic companies owe this level of transparency to shareholders; I think citizens, as America\u2019s shareholders, deserve the same.\u201dAs more financial firms move to pressure gun makers and sellers into self-regulation, the advocacy group (backed by Mike Bloomberg) plans to ask them to press for more policy positions and operational changes.Among them: Requiring background checks for all gun sales; more funding for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; having gun makers require sellers to adopt a code of conduct; and adopting smart-gun tech.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Knowledge Gap Hinders Ability of Congress to Regulate Silicon Valley", "Date": "2018-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cI think we need to be careful,\u201d cautioned Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican. \u201cI think there are a number of different ideas, but I don\u2019t think anything has coalesced in terms of a consensus.\u201dFor the public, watching the many bursts of fireworks from Congress and the quick after-fizzle can be dizzying. But Representative Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey, the ranking Democrat on the House committee responsible for internet regulation, warned voters not to expect much.\u201cI hate to be such a pessimist, but I don\u2019t believe the Republicans will end up doing anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI just don\u2019t have any faith in their willingness to regulate to protect privacy in the context of Facebook.\u201dBeyond the typical political gridlock that has stymied action in Congress, technology and the companies that sell access to it are particularly protected.Inaction does not reflect a lack of will so much as a failure of expertise.\u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen an issue where everybody seemed to be on the same sheet of music,\u201d Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said Thursday.If Congress does not follow through with new rules for internet companies, \u201cwe\u2019ll look like a bunch of idiots,\u201d Mr. Graham added.Avoiding that dunce cap will be difficult. Lawmakers will confront Silicon Valley\u2019s powerful new lobbying establishment. Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple now hold the biggest corporate lobbying budgets in Washington and spent a combined $49.7 million in 2017 on direct lobbying, which does not include their outside lobbying trade groups, up 24 percent from the previous year. They have hired top privacy experts into their lobbying troops to defeat privacy and other internet laws.Facebook has said it would embrace some regulation, with Mr. Zuckerberg saying this week that rules for internet companies were \u201cinevitable.\u201d But he also indicated that it would have to be the \u201cright\u201d regulations, and he was not willing to commit on the spot to several ideas posed by lawmakers.The hearings spurred new momentum for the introduction of privacy laws. On Thursday, Senators Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, and John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, introduced legislation that would allow consumers to opt out of getting tracked on a site. The bill would also mandate simpler privacy policies.One new bill would restrict data collection of students using classroom technology, and another would require companies to get permission before collecting and sharing user data. That would move the United States closer to rules about to take effect next month in Europe. An earlier bill would mandate more disclosure on Facebook advertising purchases.Nevertheless, the creation of any regulations in coming months is doubtful. Most lawmakers said in the hearings that they were concerned about privacy and foreign interference on social media during the 2016 election. But several Republicans also expressed anxiety over regulations that could slow the growth of Silicon Valley, a beacon for the American economy.\u201cThese are tough ones. Privacy versus innovation versus security versus freedom \u2014 these are always tough questions,\u201d said Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona. He said he would most likely support the political ad disclosures bill but added, \u201cWhen we step in, are we always late?\u201dThis week, Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, introduced the Consent Act, which would require companies to get permission before tracking and sharing data. But even he pointed to Washington\u2019s short attention span. Companies like Facebook, he said, would try to stand in Congress\u2019s way.\u201cThey will try to make it more complex than it is,\u201d he said.\u201cThe question is timing,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal added, pointing to the difficult midterm elections in November and the desire by many legislators to do as little as possible until then. \u201cThis session, everybody says, is over as far as serious legislating is concerned.\u201dMr. Graham, who said regulations were necessary, also acknowledged the pitfalls of moving too fast.\u201cI\u2019d hate to be the senator that killed an effort to have reasonable regulation,\u201d Mr. Graham said. But, he conceded, \u201cYou really need to know what you are signing up for.\u201dBeyond the short term, the hearings may have laid the foundation for broader privacy regulations in coming years, analysts said. The most likely action to follow Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s grilling is the passage of a bill that requires financial disclosures of political advertising on social media, a law similar to broadcast television and radio political ad disclosures.Narrow regulatory ideas could gain momentum that prevent online location tracking, strengthen privacy protections for children and teens and require stronger disclosures for data breaches. But the government\u2019s light hand on Silicon Valley will continue for some time even as the European Union prepares to enact comprehensive privacy rules that limit data collection and push companies to ask permission before sharing information about users.Even if seats in the House and Senate shift after the midterm elections, any privacy laws would be at least a couple of years away, said Paul Gallant, a technology policy analyst at the Cowen Group.\u201cIf Democrats win the House in November, the chances of legislation would rise, although a likely Republican Senate would still make passage an uphill battle,\u201d Mr. Gallant said.A big problem is the lack of technological expertise in Congress, and the informational imbalance with the tech companies\u2019 lobbyists.In 2011, tech lobbyists blanketed the Senate Judiciary Committee after former Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, introduced a geolocation privacy bill.Internet firms brought in engineers and deployed their outside lobbying groups to warn lawmakers that Mr. Franken\u2019s bill was dangerous and technically flawed, said Alvaro Bedoya, a former staff member for Mr. Franken who is now the executive director of the Georgetown Center for Privacy and Technology.Another obstacle to action is a disagreement on regulatory priorities.Indeed, Mr. Graham identified a grab bag of problems that he wanted addressed with Facebook, most of which are not being addressed by any current legislative proposals.He mentioned terrorism content, Facebook\u2019s \u201cmonopoly\u201d and political bias as regulatory targets. At Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s hearings on Tuesday and Wednesday, other lawmakers brought up data breaches, foreign interference and censorship, particularly of the pro-Trump internet personalities Diamond and Silk.\u201cI want somebody to look at how they set these machines up, not just for Facebook, but other people, to make sure that the algorithms are not being politically motivated,\u201d Mr. Graham said.The lack of technological knowledge was glaring. Members mostly comprised lawyers or former business people, and many are just getting acquainted with social media, artificial intelligence, autonomous self-driving cars, drones and other technologies that they are charged to oversee.Diversity in government has become a platform issue for Brianna Wu, a former software designer who is running for the 8th House district in Massachusetts.Ms. Wu watched Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s hearings and was struck by the basic lack of knowledge members had in how the site works, such as the business model of ad-supported websites and how messaging apps like Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp works. Before the hearings, many of the members brought in technology experts from academic institutions to prepare them for Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s appearance.\u201cMost people can understand why guns are a threat,\u201d she said. \u201cWith technology, people don\u2019t understand fundamentally what the threat is. That is a threat to democracy.\u201dA photo caption with an earlier version of this article misidentified a member of the Senate attending the hearing.

A customer holding a bicycle helmet lingered over the iPhones, browsing; a sixtysomething man knelt on the floor, taking a selfie with a German pinscher named Polo; and a young Orthodox man wrapped a customer in tefillin, traditional Jewish prayer straps, while reading him prayers to repeat. \u201cI get an iPhone, and I get tefillin,\u201d said the customer, Harvey Rossel, a chiropractor and longtime local.Ari Kirtchuk, 55, the store\u2019s owner, took in the action from behind his counter. \u201cThey\u2019re monsters from Crown Heights,\u201d he said, \u201cfrom the Lubavitch cartel.\u201d A wave of laughter passed through the store.Many lament the mallification of New York City, with banks, chain restaurants and anonymous cellphone shops rapidly replacing the beloved mom-and-pops of generations past. But for some ineffable reason, there are certain chain stores that contain the warmth, diversity and conversation once associated with Greek diners or soda fountains. The AT&T \u201cauthorized retailer\u201d owned by Mr. Kirtchuk, near the corner of Union Street and Seventh Avenue, is one. At any moment, only about half of the people inside are there for cellphone problems. The others come to talk. Perhaps it\u2019s the two soft black chairs by the front window that encourage conversation, or the frequent presence of Polo, Mr. Kirtchuk\u2019s son\u2019s dog. Or perhaps it is the unique energy of Mr. Kirtchuk, who seems to value jokes, long stories and political debate as much as sales commissions.Elegant and handsome, with a lanky physique that resembles his hero Larry David\u2019s, he has a thin smile, carved cheekbones and a deadpan demeanor. On a given day, he helps seniors, delivery men, teenagers, caregivers, the homeless, celebrity locals such as the actor Peter Sarsgaard and the novelist Nicole Krauss, as well as the brownstone bourgeoisie. Though he has one full-time employee, John Rossello, 27, Mr. Kirtchuk himself comes in six days a week and often seven. \u201cThe reason they come here is because they know me and they need some company,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big city with a lot of lonely people.\u201dIn his Israeli accent, Mr. Kirtchuk likes to insert \u201cAnd?\u201d as someone is telling him a story, to cue them for the next detail. His signature phrase is, \u201cGimme a second,\u201d and he greets all customers, new and old, with \u201cHow ya doing.\u201dMichael Carr, a 65-year-old handyman, wandered in and sat on a stool near the service desk. He was there only to talk. \u201cAri\u2019s got respect for the older heads,\u201d he said in an accent part Dutch and part West Indian. \u201cHe\u2019ll tell them: \u2018This phone is not for you. You can\u2019t handle it at this age.\u2019\u201dThe store phone rang. \u201cAT&T,\u201d said Mr. Kirtchuk. \u201cYes, yes, you can bring it over. The SIM card is $10. But do you need internet? For an additional $10 you get 1G of data.\u201dHe hung up. \u201cPeople are used to a 1-2-3 situation. When they get extra service, they\u2019re surprised. I\u2019m not a diamond but I look like a diamond because of my competition.\u201dThere are two other AT&T retailers within a mile of his, one part of a large chain and the other owned by an individual. (There are also several other cellphone franchises in proximity.) Mr. Kirtchuk explained that authorized retailers are independent contractors that compete with one another, unlike, say, two branches of one clothing chain. They make commissions on each new activation or upgrade, based on the value of the transaction. The commission on a new activation is higher than that on a phone upgrade. \u201cThe AT&T competition I can control with my customer service,\u201d said he said. \u201cCompetition with Verizon is not under my control.\u201d (AT&T did not respond to requests for comment on this article.)Born in Argentina, Mr. Kirtchuk moved to Israel with his family when he was 3. He arrived in the United States in the late 1980s, when he was in his early 20s. He thought he would work, save some money, and return to Israel to study. He got a job in a clothing store in the South Bronx, and in 1988 he met the woman who would become his wife. They married, had two sons, and moved to Richmond Hill, Queens. A few years later Mr. Kirtchuk dropped his plans to return to Israel.A job in an electronics store led him to open his own business selling and servicing pagers in 1990, and as technology changed, he opened a series of cellphone dealerships. Soon he owned four in Queens. \u201cI was looking for stores all the time,\u201d he said recently. \u201cI thought I could grab the world.\u201dOne day in 2003 he was driving down Seventh Avenue in Park Slope, looking for future locations. \u201cI thought to myself, \u2018Nice area,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cI went to the landlord, and half an hour later I signed the lease.\u201d After his divorce, he closed all his Queens stores within a few years and installed himself full-time in Park Slope. Even today, he said, several former Richmond Hill customers travel nearly nine miles to see him.On a different weekday he was aiding a married couple, Arta Ukha, 32, and her husband, Ari Nikci, 37, who had come in for new phones. Mr. Kirtchuk\u2019s mind was on the stock market. \u201cIf the stocks are down two days in a row,\u201d he said, \u201cmaybe Wall Street knows something we don\u2019t. Maybe Trump is on his way out.\u201dMr. Rossello was on the store phone. \u201cI can\u2019t understand what you\u2019re saying,\u201d he told the caller.A discussion ensued on different accents. Ms. Ukha, originally from Kosovo, explained the challenges of helping her parents set up a smartphone. \u201cIn Albania the words are pronounced the way they\u2019re written,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to tell my parents, \u2018Press DO-neh\u2019 instead of \u2018DONE.\u2019\u201dA pizza delivery man came in and handed Mr. Kirtchuk his phone, leaving within a few minutes. \u201cHe just needed to wipe it,\u201d Mr. Kirtchuk explained. \u201cHe lost his password.\u201d He was philosophical about life as an authorized retailer. \u201cIf you take care of your customers, you\u2019re going to make a few dollars out of it. The money will follow. I represent a big corporation, but they allow me to work in an old-fashioned way, to find a balance between making them happy and doing what I want.\u201dWhat about the unpleasant customers? \u201cI recognize them right away,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll try to encourage them to go to my competition.\u201dHe often learns about people\u2019s problems as he helps them with their phones. Several months ago a regular, close to tears, came in and asked to pull up her husband\u2019s text messages for her. \u201cShe said, \u2018I think he has something going on,\u2019\u201d Mr. Kirtchuk recalled. \u201cI told her, \u2018First of all, I can\u2019t do that, and even if I could, I wouldn\u2019t.\u2019 I told her to wait 24 hours and cool down to think about it. Maybe she was jumping to conclusions.\u201dLater on the hectic Friday of the Jewish prayer ritual, the door burst open and Yanki Reichman, 56, who wore a prayer shawl beneath a TrueValue Hardware hoodie, went to Mr. Kirtchuk, joking with him in Hebrew. He stops in the store on his trips to the bank, often bringing Jewish delicacies from Crown Heights.The chiropractor, Mr. Rossel, who had come in to buy his first smartphone, waited for it to be activated. \u201cPhones bring people into the store,\u201d he observed. \u201cBecause they are a capitalistic pursuit they require updates. Since Ari put those chairs here there\u2019s always people sitting in them. This is the new barbershop.\u201d\u201cAT&T is a franchise that swallowed all the smaller ones,\u201d said Mr. Reichman, \u201cbut without Ari, people would get lost. He spends hours and hours trying to help them and he doesn\u2019t get paid for it.\u201dMr. Rossello, the full-time employee, asked Mr. Rossel a series of security questions as he set up the device, like his mother\u2019s maiden name or the city he was born in. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have it ask your dream job?\u201d Mr. Kirtchuk interrupted. \u201cBelly dancer? My dream job was always to be a belly dancer.\u201dA tall young man with broad shoulders came in. He carried a gym bag and lingered near the door. \u201cIt\u2019s your lucky day, Ari,\u201d he said in a strong Southern accent. \u201cI have a hundred dollars in here.\u201d\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you bring me a thousand?\u201d Mr. Kirtchuk asked.The man was Jonathan Jones, 33, a clothing designer, author and investor who works at the Whole Foods in Gowanus. He moved to New York from Vicksburg, Miss., six months ago and met Mr. Kirtchuk after coming into the store offering his web-building services. They became friendly.A woman who resembled Laurie Anderson, with a distraught face under her parka hood, came in and announced dramatically, \u201cI lost my phone.\u201d\u201cYou have insurance?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cAll right,\u201d Mr. Kirtchuk said. \u201cGimme a second.\u201d They spoke quietly. After typing her number into the computer he determined that she did, in fact, have insurance. She left, and returned 10 minutes with two cups of coffee, one for Mr. Kirtchuk. \u201cGood coffee,\u201d he said.They approached a display phone together, and an intense, guitar-heavy folk song emanated from the store speakers. It turned out to be a music video by her husband, also a customer. Mr. Kirtchuk complimented the music while he helped her set up a new phone, which would arrive in the mail. (Days later she would find her lost phone.)As afternoon turned to evening, a redheaded young woman came in and told Mr. Rossello she was a Verizon customer, asking him detailed questions about AT&T plans, including the number of gigabytes and international-calling details. Mr. Kirtchuk approached her and said she could switch, explaining how much she would save on a similar AT&T plan and handing her a business card. It seemed uncharacteristically aggressive; he prefers a soft sell. She said she would think about it. \u201cWhen you\u2019re ready,\u201d Mr. Kirtchuk said.She paused to pet Polo, remarking on his calm demeanor. After the door closed behind her Mr. Kirtchuk said, \u201cI think she was a secret shopper, sent by AT&T to check on things.\u201d When asked why he said, \u201cShe knew too much.\u201dAdvertisement"}

On Tuesday, when he took his seat on the committee room floor, the suit was navy, and the tie was Facebook blue. It was somber. It was on brand.Cosmetic, perhaps. Superficial, sure. Presumably once he is back on the West Coast he\u2019ll go right back to hoodies and tees. But it was strategic and optically effective nonetheless.\u201cAs a symbolic gesture it was absolutely the right message,\u201d said Alan Flusser, a tailor in New York and the author of \u201cClothes and the Man.\u201dIt said to suspicious, establishment lawmakers: I am in your house, I will accept your rules. It said, O.K., maybe we in Silicon Valley really don\u2019t know best. It said: I acknowledge the responsibility I bear and take this seriously. It acceded to the general interpretation that this was a growing-up moment, because in the iconography of clothing, the suit is the costume of the grown-up, while the T-shirt is the costume of the teenager, the off-duty, the breaker of rules.It took away one of the signifiers of difference between the old guard and the new, and replaced it with an olive branch of similarity. (Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s suit and tie almost matched the suit and tie worn by John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee.)(At the time Mr. Kudlow was wearing a blue pinstripe suit, white pocket handkerchief, and had a blue scarf knotted like an ascot around his neck.)Mr. Zuckerberg \u201cknew people would be on the lookout\u201d for the answer, said Joseph Rosenfeld, a personal style adviser who specializes in the tech world in Silicon Valley and New York, and whose clients work at companies such as Apple, Intuit and Google.This was not, of course the first time Mr. Zuckerberg has worn a suit. It\u2019s just that it is seemingly possible to count on two hands the times he has done so: always on public occasions and (not counting his wedding) always when heads of state or other dignitaries are involved. He wore a suit, for example, to address the G8 summit in France in 2011; to the state dinner for Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2015; to interview Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Facebook the same year; and to testify in a Dallas courtroom during the Oculus intellectual property trial in 2017.Much was written about his wife\u2019s wedding dress after their wedding, but there was little about his dark suit. A Facebook spokeswoman declined to comment on his choice of suit for Congress. Mr. Rosenfeld said he had no idea of the maker or whether Mr. Zuckerberg was getting outside advice. A quick survey of my colleagues who work in Silicon Valley elicited only puzzlement. But over the years Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s suits have gotten skinnier, the ties narrower, the aesthetic less uncomfortable-kid-in-Dad\u2019s-borrowed-suit.Certainly Mr. Zuckerberg has publicly acknowledged, a few times, the very conscious way he uses clothes. Just because he is known for wearing the same thing every day doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t think about fashion or how what he wears gets interpreted. In fact, it is exactly the opposite.Which is to say, he wears the same thing because that way he thought about it once and never had to think about it again.Though the current situation does somewhat demonstrate the limits of that approach.Advertisement"}

You can no longer separate one from the other.\u201cThis is mixing old media and new media in a completely harmonious way,\u201d Michael Hackman, chief executive of Hackman Capital Partners, said by phone on Wednesday.\u201cI like the sense of history because it holds us to a standard,\u201d Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder and chief executive, said when a reporter asked him about the Culver Studios move at an Oscar-season cocktail party.Culver Studios may have a grand past \u2014 \u201cRaging Bull\u201d and \u201cE.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\u201d were made here, along with the pilot for the original \u201cStar Trek\u201d television series \u2014 but the complex also epitomizes the troubles the movie business has encountered over the decades.By 2004, when a struggling Sony sold the property, years of underinvestment had taken a toll.

{"Headline": "U.S. Investigating AT&T and Verizon Over Wireless Collusion Claim", "Date": "2018-04-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Justice Department has opened an antitrust investigation into potential coordination by AT&T, Verizon and a telecommunications standards organization to hinder consumers from easily switching wireless carriers, according to six people with knowledge of the inquiry.In February, the Justice Department issued demands to AT&T, Verizon and the G.S.M.A., a mobile industry standards-setting group, for information on potential collusion to thwart a technology known as eSIM, said two of the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details are confidential.The technology lets people remotely switch wireless providers without having to insert a new SIM card into a device. AT&T and Verizon face accusations that they colluded with the G.S.M.A. to try to establish standards that would allow them to lock a device to their network even if it had eSIM technology.The investigation was opened about five months ago after at least one device maker and one wireless carrier filed formal complaints with the Justice Department, two of the people said. The device maker was Apple, one of them said.Representatives for the Justice Department, and Apple declined to comment.In a statement, a Verizon spokesman confirmed that the carrier had been working with the Justice Department for several months on the inquiry because of \u201ca difference of opinion with a couple of phone equipment manufacturers regarding the development of eSIM standards.\u201d He said the issue was \u201cmuch ado about nothing.\u201dAn AT&T spokesman said the company was \u201caware of the investigation,\u201d had provided information to the government and was working \u201cto move this issue forward.\u201dG.S.M.A. confirmed that it had developed an eSIM standard that would allow a carrier to lock a device to its network but put the standard on hold pending the Justice Department\u2019s investigation. Under the pending standard, the G.S.M.A. said, a wireless carrier would need permission from a consumer to lock a device.\u201cThe G.S.M.A. is cooperating fully with the Department of Justice in this matter,\u201d the organization said in a statement.At the heart of the investigation is whether the nation\u2019s biggest wireless carriers, working with the G.S.M.A., secretly tried to influence mobile technology to unfairly maintain their dominance, in a way that hurt competition and consumers and hindered innovation in the wider mobile industry.AT&T and Verizon together control about 70 percent of all wireless subscriptions in the United States. A technology that made it easy to switch carriers could lead to more turnover and fewer subscribers for them.The investigation highlights a push by the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, to crack down on the opaque world of intellectual property, or I.P., standards. He has said the Justice Department will scrutinize potential coordination in standards-setting organizations that can hurt competition.Currently, most mobile phones use SIM cards, which contain unique identifying information about a user and are inserted into the devices so the phones can function. People typically have to buy a new SIM card when changing carriers.The eSIM technology, which was introduced in early 2016, is embedded in mobile phones and other devices so that people do not need SIM cards anymore.The push by the major carriers to restrict the flexibility of eSIM runs counter to a movement in which consumers were gaining more flexibility to move from carrier to carrier. In late 2013, under pressure by the Federal Communications Commission, the wireless industry agreed to let people take devices off any particular network without penalty once the devices were fully paid for.After the formal complaints against AT&T and Verizon were filed, several device makers and other wireless companies voiced similar concerns to the agency about the carriers\u2019 actions around eSIM, four people familiar with the investigation said. The investigation may also include other major American carriers, another person said.\u201cThe actions would limit choice for consumers and harm competition,\u201d said Ferras Vinh, a policy expert at the Center for Democracy and Technology.In a private meeting of a task force called G.S.M.A. North America this year, AT&T and Verizon pushed for the ability to lock phones to their networks, bypassing the purpose of eSIM technology, said Harold Feld, a senior vice president of Public Knowledge, a nonprofit consumer group, who was briefed on the meeting. Verizon has said it needed to be able to lock down phones to prevent theft and fraud.\u201cThere is a constant problem with industry standards-setting organizations that on the one hand allow the industry to come together for the purpose of efficiency but can be very anticompetitive and operate in secrecy,\u201d Mr. Feld said.Advertisement"}

Leon of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, who is presiding over the case, is expected to make a decision on the suit as early as the end of May.In cross-examination of Mr. Stephenson, the Justice Department\u2019s lead litigator, Craig Conrath, picked apart the portrayal of AT&T as under siege by Silicon Valley. Mr. Conrath said the key difference between AT&T and tech companies is that AT&T is in a powerful position as the company that provides broadband access to the internet \u2014 a service that Netflix and Amazon don\u2019t offer.Mr. Conrath also presented a friendly email from June 2017 between Mr. Stephenson and Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, in which Mr. Zuckerberg offered to help build AT&T\u2019s ad platform. Mr. Conrath questioned the offer of \u201ccooperation,\u201d suggesting there was less of a rivalry between the companies than Mr. Stephenson had said.Mr. Stephenson dismissed the significance of the email with Mr. Zuckerberg. Mr. Zuckerberg was following up on a casual meeting the executives had during an annual media industry gathering of executives in Sun Valley, Idaho, he said.The key disadvantage that AT&T and Time Warner face is their slow start in behavioral advertising and marketing, Mr. Stephenson said. Both companies do not collect or analyze the habits of television and web users in the same way that Comcast does with cable subscribers and that Google and Facebook do on their platforms.Mr. Stephenson said Netflix, Amazon, Google and Facebook are all investing in premium video content to collect increasing amounts of data on users who would spend longer times on their sites and visit more often.The AT&T chief spent much of his time talking about the history of the company. He spoke directly to Judge Leon to explain the company\u2019s evolution from a phone company to one that seeks to make money from advertising and subscriptions for consumers who will watch much of their videos on mobile devices.Mr. Stephenson attacked the Justice Department\u2019s underlying theory that the company would threaten to withhold Time Warner content to raise prices on other cable and satellite distributors.

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 What might happen to Amazon\u2019s bottom line if it paid its workers more?\u2022 Sears shares jumped after ESL called on the Sears to sell the Kenmore brand.\u2022 Walmart is said to be close to gaining a majority stake in Flipkart.\u2022 Mike Bloomberg opened his wallet for climate change.\u2022 Learn more about \u201ctransshipping,\u201d one of President Trump\u2019s big trade bugbears.What might happen to Amazon\u2019s bottom line if it paid its workers more? This question may become more pressing if labor shortages start to force companies to up their pay to attract and retain employees.Amazon does not disclose its total compensation expense, so it\u2019s not possible for outsiders to accurately compute what would happen to profits if it raised pay.But the disclosure of median pay provides a little insight. Under S.E.C. rules, public companies must now disclose the median pay figure for all their employees. In annual filings, that number is then compared with the pay of the chief executive. In Amazon\u2019s case, the $1,681,840 that Jeff Bezos earned in 2017 was 59 times that of the median employee, a lower ratio than exists at other large public companies.One way to get a rough proxy for a company\u2019s overall compensation expense is to multiply its median pay number by its total number of employees. For Amazon, that would produce a purely hypothetical compensation expense of $16.1 billion (566,000 employees times $28,466.)Increasing Amazon\u2019s median pay number by 10 percent would bump the $28,466 up to $31,313, and the putative compensation expense would rise to $17.7 billion. Such an increase would have cut Amazon\u2019s $3.8 billion of pretax income in 2017 by 42 percent to $2.2 billion. A 20 percent raise would have slashed those earnings by 85 percent.How does Amazon stack up against Walmart? The C.E.O. of Walmart, Doug McMillion, made $22.8 million in the company\u2019s latest fiscal year. That sum was 1,188 times as large as the median employee\u2019s pay of $19,177 (a number that excludes some foreign employees.)At Walmart, increasing the hypothetical compensation expense would have less of an impact on earnings. A 10 percent increase would reduce Walmart\u2019s latest annual pretax profits by 28 percent, while a 20 percent pay increase would lower profits by 56 percent.There are two ways to view such numbers. One is that retail is a cutthroat business and wages cannot rise by much if a company is going to be healthily profitable. The other is that large retailers have used their heft to lower as many of their costs as possible, including wages.\u2014 Peter Eavis\u2022 Net profit jumped 73% to $9.4 billion in the first quarter, up from $5.4 billion a year ago.\u2022 Earnings per share came in at $13.33 per share, beating analyst estimates of $9.28 per share.\u2022 The company reported a $3 billion, or about $3.40 a share, gain on equity securities in the first quarter.\u2022 Sales rose to $31.1 billion, beating the consensus estimate of $30.3 billion.Shares of Alphabet bounced around after hours. The stock rose as much as 2.2 percent but is now down slightly.Critics\u2019 cornerRobert Cryan of Breakingviews writes:\u201cThe tech group\u2019s $9.4 billion of earnings in the first quarter came with new noise after it adjusted the way it accounts for investments like ride-hailing app Uber, moved some smart-home appliances into Google and started stressing \u201cimpressions\u201d over clicks. Investors wanting concrete measurements are getting squishy ones instead.\u201dShares of Sears Holding are up about 4 percent in recent trading on Mr. Lampert\u2019s latest attempt to save the troubled retailer.In a letter to the Sears board, Mr. Lampert, whose ESL Investments hedge fund owns a controlling stake in the company, said ESL would also be willing to buy the retailer\u2019s home-services and its appliance-parts units.Mr. Lampert offered to pay Sears $500 million for the home-services and appliance-parts units, but did not mention a price for the Kenmore brand or the real estate. He noted that the company had been trying to sell the assets for nearly two years, but had failed to find other buyers.Mr. Lampert is Sears\u2019s chief executive. Any deal involving Sears and Mr. Lampert is complicated by his dual roles running both the retailer and the hedge fund, which is also a major Sears lender.Mr. Lampert said in his letter that he would recuse himself from any board discussions about his proposal. Any deal would need to be approved by a majority of Sears shareholders not affiliated with ESL, the letter said.\u2014 Michael CorkeryMargrethe Vestager, the European Union\u2019s competition commissioner, said in a statement:\u201cThe way people listen to music has changed significantly in recent years, with more and more Europeans using music streaming services. Our investigation aims to ensure that music fans will continue to enjoy attractive music streaming offers and won\u2019t face less choice as a result of this proposed merger.\u201dThe European Commission is concerned that Shazam\u2019s strong position in music recognition would enable Apple to \u201cobtain access to commercially sensitive data about customers of its competitors.\u201d\u201cAccess to such data could allow Apple to directly target its competitors\u2019 customers and encourage them to switch to Apple Music. As a result, competing music streaming services could be put at a competitive disadvantage.\u201dThe European Commission has until Sept. 4 to finish its investigation.Apple reached a deal to buy Shazam for roughly $400 million in December.Why it\u2019s important: Both Walmart and Amazon have hungrily watched India, where the e-commerce market trails only the U.S. and China in terms of size but where foreign retailers have struggled. But don\u2019t expect Amazon, Flipkart\u2019s biggest rival, to give up.What the parties said about the deal\u2022 Michael Polk, Newell\u2019s C.E.O.: \u201cThis agreement will enable the Company to now focus exclusively on the execution of our transformation plans and our efforts to strengthen our financial and operational performance.\u201d\u2022 Mr. Icahn: \u201cI am pleased that we were able to facilitate peace between the company and Starboard.

Matt Stoller of the Open Markets Institute told the NYT, \u201cWhat he\u2019s doing is a threat to democracy, but so is Amazon.\u201dThe problem: Customers often aren\u2019t notified when money is transferred; customers are subjected to phishing attacks that drain money from their accounts; buyers have no protections if sellers don\u2019t provide paid-for goods.Why it matters: Banks want their share of digital payments, and 18 so far have signed up with Zelle.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "They Tried to Boycott Facebook, Apple and Google. They Failed.", "Date": "2018-04-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHow did Mr. Knight post the message? He used an iPhone.As the reach and influence of Silicon Valley\u2019s tech giants have increased, so have the calls to boycott their products and services. The problem is that pulling off a boycott is not exactly easy: The tech companies\u2019 products are so pervasive that they are difficult to avoid.\u201cIt\u2019s exactly the same company. I realize it\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d said Sachi Cunningham, a documentary filmmaker in San Francisco who deactivated her Facebook last week and shifted her attention to Instagram, where, she said, the conversation is less toxic.Ms. Cunningham, who has freelanced for The New York Times, added that she had immediately begun missing Facebook as a research tool for her documentaries. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can get out of the ecosystem,\u201d she said.People looking to punish major tech companies by abstaining from their products have been bedeviled time and again by the difficulty in escaping them. After Google fired an engineer, James Damore, for criticizing the company\u2019s diversity efforts last year, hundreds of people on social media called for a boycott of the company. But an analysis of nearly 7,000 tweets using the hashtag #BoycottGoogle since August showed that 26 percent of the tweets came from devices using Google\u2019s Android software, according to Keyhole, a social-media research firm.One Twitter account named Milton Prescott tweeted on Aug. 8: \u201cGoogle\u2019s firing of James Damore proves his point completely. I will no longer be using Google for any services. #BoycottGoogle.\u201d The tweet came from an Android device. A message to the account went unreturned.Marisa Richardson, a program manager at a life-sciences company, said she began boycotting Amazon recently after learning that it offered the NRA channel on its streaming-video service. So when she needed laundry detergent, she avoided the e-commerce site and instead braved the crowds and traffic \u2014 and spent a few dollars more \u2014 at a nearby Target.But a few days later she shopped at the Whole Foods near her home in Oakland, Calif. \u201cI completely forgot that they\u2019re owned by Amazon,\u201d she said.After the shooting in Parkland in February, gun-control activists called for a boycott of certain Apple and Amazon services because they hosted the NRA channel.\u201cHad I sent the same tweets from an Android phone, the same issue would apply. There is an NRATV app for Android phones,\u201d Ms. Milano said through a spokeswoman. \u201cWe are only just beginning to understand how these companies have infiltrated not only our ideologies, but also our lives in the most in-depth way imaginable.\u201dNearly a third of the 4,700 tweets using the #BoycottApple hashtag since August came from iPhones, according to Keyhole.\u201cI do have an iPhone, but as a customer of Apple\u2019s, am I not allowed to hold them accountable?\u201d Mr. Knight, the activist who used an iPhone to call for an Apple boycott, said in an interview.Many of those who recently abandoned their Facebook accounts are still in the company\u2019s orbit, not only with Instagram but also with the company\u2019s popular messaging apps WhatsApp and Messenger.When Cher recently deleted her Facebook page, she said on Twitter, \u201c2day I did something VERY HARD 4 me.\u201d But her Instagram account, with 768,000 followers, was still active.Stephen Cox, 39, a woodworker in Los Angeles, recently posted on Facebook that he was deactivating his account in favor of Instagram.

Now she spends her time on Instagram.While she acknowledged the irony of moving to another Facebook-owned service, she said her options were limited.

{"Headline": "The Disappearing Doctor: How Mega-Mergers Are Changing the Business of Medical Care", "Date": "2018-04-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIs the doctor in?In this new medical age of urgent care centers and retail clinics, that\u2019s not a simple question. Nor does it have a simple answer, as primary care doctors become increasingly scarce.\u201cYou call the doctor\u2019s office to book an appointment,\u201d said Matt Feit, a 45-year-old screenwriter in Los Angeles who visited an urgent care center eight times last year. \u201cThey\u2019re only open Monday through Friday from these hours to those hours, and, generally, they\u2019re not the hours I\u2019m free or I have to take time off from my job.\u201cI can go just about anytime to urgent care,\u201d he continued, \u201cand my co-pay is exactly the same as if I went to my primary doctor.\u201dPeople are flocking to retail clinics and urgent care centers in strip malls or shopping centers, where simple health needs can usually be tended to by health professionals like nurse practitioners or physician assistants much more cheaply than in a doctor\u2019s office. Some 12,000 are already scattered across the country, according to Merchant Medicine, a consulting firm.There\u2019s little doubt that the front line of medicine \u2014 the traditional family or primary care doctor \u2014 has been under siege for years. Long hours and low pay have transformed pediatric or family practices into unattractive options for many aspiring physicians.And the relationship between patients and doctors has radically changed. Apart from true emergency situations, patients\u2019 expectations now reflect the larger 24/7 insta-culture of wanting everything now. When Dr. Carl Olden began watching patients turn to urgent care centers opening around him in Yakima, Wash., he and his partners decided to fight back.They set up similar clinics three years ago, including one right across the street from their main office in a shopping center.The practice not only was able to retain its patients, but then could access electronic health records for those off-site visits, avoiding a bad drug interaction or other problems, said Dr. Olden, who has been a doctor for 34 years.\u201cAnd we\u2019ve had some folks come into the clinics who don\u2019t have their own primary care physicians,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been able to move them into our practice.\u201dThe new deals involving major corporations loom over doctors\u2019 livelihoods, intensifying pressure on small practices and pushing them closer to extinction.The latest involves Walmart and Humana, a large insurer with a sizable business offering private Medicare plans. While their talks are in the early stages, one potential partnership being discussed would center on using the retailer\u2019s stores and expanding its existing 19 clinics for one-stop medical care. Walmart stores already offer pharmacy services and attract older people.While both CVS and UnitedHealth have large pharmacy benefits businesses that would reap considerable rewards from the stream of prescriptions generated by the doctors at these facilities, the companies are also intent on managing what type of care patients get and where they go for it. And the wealth of data mined from consolidation would provide the companies with a map for steering people one way or another.On top of these corporate partnerships, Amazon, JP Morgan and Berkshire Hathaway decided to join forces to develop some sort of health care strategy for their employees, expressing frustration with the current state of medical care. Their announcement, and Amazon\u2019s recent forays into these fields, are rattling everyone from major hospital networks to pharmacists.Doctors, too, are watching the evolution warily.\u201cWith all of these deals, there is so much we don\u2019t know,\u201d said Dr. Michael Munger, president of the American Academy of Family Physicians. \u201cAre Aetna patients going to be mandated to go to a CVS MinuteClinic?\u201dDr. Susan Kressly, a pediatrician in Warrington, Pa., has watched patients leave. Parents who once brought their children to her to treat an ear infection or check for strep, services whose profits helped offset some of the treatments she offered, are now visiting the retail clinics or urgent care centers.What is worse, some patients haven\u2019t been getting the right care. \u201cSome of the patients with coughs were being treated with codeine-based medicines, which is not appropriate at all for this age group,\u201d Dr. Kressly said.Even doctors unfazed by patients going elsewhere at night or on weekends are nervous about the entry of the corporate behemoths.\u201cI can\u2019t advertise on NBC,\u201d said Dr. Shawn Purifoy, who practices family medicine in Malvern, Ark. \u201cCVS can.\u201dNurse practitioners allow Dr. Purifoy to offer more same-day appointments; he and two other practices in town take turns covering emergency phone calls at night.And doctors keep facing new waves of competition. In California, Apple recently decided to open up its own clinics to treat employees. Other companies are offering their workers the option of seeking medical care via their cellphones. Investors are also pouring money into businesses aiming to create new ways of providing primary care by relying more heavily on technology.Dr. Mark J. Werner, a consultant for the Chartis Group, which advises medical practices, emphasized that convenience of care didn\u2019t equal quality or, for that matter, less expensive care.\u201cNone of the research has shown any of these approaches to delivering care has meaningfully addressed cost,\u201d Dr. Werner said.Critics of retail clinics argue that patients are given short shrift by health professionals unfamiliar with their history, and may be given unnecessary prescriptions. But researchers say neither has been proved in studies.\u201cThe quality of care that you see at a retail clinic is equal or superior to what we see in a doctor\u2019s office or emergency department,\u201d said Dr. Ateev Mehrotra, an associate professor of health care policy and medicine at Harvard Medical School, who has researched the retail clinics. \u201cAnd while there is a worry that they will prescribe antibiotics to everybody, we see equal rates occurring between the clinics and doctor\u2019s offices.\u201dStill, while the retail clinics over all charge less, particularly compared with emergency rooms, they may increase overall health care spending. Consumers who not long ago would have taken a cough drop or gargled with saltwater to soothe a sore throat now pop into their nearby retail clinic for a strep test.Frustration with the nation\u2019s health care system has fueled a lot of the recent partnerships. Giant companies are already signaling a desire to tackle complex care for people with a chronic health condition like diabetes or asthma.\u201cWe\u2019re evolving the retail clinic concept,\u201d said Dr. Troyen A. Brennan, the chief medical officer for CVS. The company hopes its proposed merger with Aetna will allow it to transform its current clinics, where a nurse practitioner might offer a flu shot, into a place where patients can have their conditions monitored. \u201cIt requires new and different work by the nurse practitioners,\u201d he said.Dr. Brennan said CVS was not looking to replace patients\u2019 primary care doctors. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to buy up an entire layer of primary care,\u201d he said.But people will have the option of using the retail clinic to make sure their hypertension or diabetes is well controlled, with tests and counseling provided as well as medications. The goal is to reduce the cost of care for what would otherwise be very expensive conditions, Dr. Brennan said.If the company\u2019s merger with Aetna goes through, CVS will initially expand in locations where Aetna has a significant number of customers who could readily go to CVS, Dr. Brennan said.UnitedHealth has also been aggressively making inroads, adding a large medical practice in December and roughly doubling the number of areas where its OptumCare doctors will be to 75 markets in the United States. It is also experimenting with putting its MedExpress urgent care clinics into Walgreens stores.Big hospital groups are also eroding primary care practices: They employed 43 percent of the nation\u2019s primary care doctors in 2016, up from 23 percent in 2010. They are also aggressively opening up their own urgent care centers, in part to try to ensure a steady flow of patients to their facilities.HCA Healthcare, the for-profit hospital chain, doubled its number of urgent care centers last year to about 100, according to Merchant Medicine. GoHealth Urgent Care has teamed up with major health systems like Northwell Health in New York and Dignity Health in San Francisco, to open up about 80 centers.\u201cThere is huge consolidation in the market right now,\u201d said Dr. Jeffrey Le Benger, the chief executive of Summit Medical Group, a large independent physician group in New Jersey. \u201cEveryone is fighting for the primary care patient.\u201d He, too, has opened up urgent care centers, which he describes as a \u201closs leader,\u201d unprofitable but critical to managing patients.Eva Palmer, 22, of Washington, D.C., sought out One Medical, a venture-backed practice that is one of the nation\u2019s largest independent groups, when she couldn\u2019t get in to see a primary care doctor, even when she became ill. After paying the annual fee of about $200, she was able to make an appointment to get treatment for strep throat and pneumonia.\u201cIn 15 minutes, I was able to get the prescriptions I needed \u2014 it was awesome,\u201d Ms. Palmer said.Patients also have the option of getting a virtual consultation at any time.By using sophisticated computer systems, One Medical, which employs 400 doctors and health staff members in eight major cities, allows its physicians to spend a half-hour with every patient.Dr. Navya Mysore joined One Medical after working for a large New York health system, where \u201cthere was a lot of bureaucracy,\u201d she said. She now has more freedom to practice medicine the way she wants and focus more on preventive health, she said.By being so readily available, One Medical can reduce visits to an emergency room or an urgent care center, said Dr. Jeff Dobro, the company\u2019s chief medical officer.As primary care doctors become an \u201cincreasingly endangered species, it is very hard to practice like this,\u201d he said.But more traditional doctors like Dr. Purifoy stress the importance of continuity of care. \u201cIt takes a long time to gain the trust of the patient,\u201d he said. He is working with Aledade, another company focused on reinventing primary care, to make his practice more competitive.One longtime patient, Billy Ray Smith, 70, learned that he needed cardiac bypass surgery even though he had no symptoms. He credits Dr. Purifoy with urging him to get a stress test.\u201cIf he hadn\u2019t insisted,\u201d Mr. Smith said, \u201cit would have been all over for me.\u201d Dr. Purifoy\u2019s nurse routinely checks on him, and if he needs an appointment, he can usually see the doctor that day or the next.\u201cI trust him 100 percent on what he says and what he does,\u201d Mr. Smith said.Those relationships take time and follow-up. \u201cIt\u2019s not something I can do in a minute,\u201d Dr. Purifoy said. \u201cYou\u2019re never going to get that at a MedExpress.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Zuckerberg Gets a Crash Course in Charm. Will Congress Care?", "Date": "2018-04-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor Facebook, Tuesday is being seen as a kind of dreaded final exam.In preparation for Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony, his first such appearance, Facebook has spent the last couple of weeks trying to transform its public image from a defiant, secretive behemoth into a contrite paragon of openness, announcing a string of new privacy and anti-abuse measures and making company executives available for numerous interviews.It has also hired a team of experts, including a former special assistant to President George W. Bush, to put Mr. Zuckerberg, 33, a cerebral coder who is uncomfortable speaking in public, through a crash course in humility and charm. The plan is that when he sits down before the Senate Commerce and Judiciary committees on Tuesday, Mr. Zuckerberg will have concrete changes to talk about, and no questions he can\u2019t handle.\u201cFor every major C.E.O., and now for Mark Zuckerberg, this is a rite of passage,\u201d said Reed E. Hundt, a former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. \u201cFacebook has become so important \u2014 not just to business but to society \u2014 it can\u2019t avoid having to run the congressional gantlet.\u201dInternal staff has pushed Mr. Zuckerberg to answer lawmakers\u2019 questions directly, and not to appear overly defensive. Their goal is to make Mr. Zuckerberg appear as humble, agreeable and as forthright as possible, the people close to the preparations said. Reginald J. Brown, a former special assistant to President George W. Bush, is leading the WilmerHale group. A spokesman for Facebook declined to comment.As questions about Facebook\u2019s role in the 2016 election and its privacy issues mounted, Mr. Zuckerberg initially tried to avoid the limelight, dodging requests for public testimony by lawmakers in the United States and Europe. He instead sent lieutenants, including Sheryl K. Sandberg, the company\u2019s chief operating officer, and Colin Stretch, Facebook\u2019s general counsel, to answer tough questions from lawmakers and reporters.Mr. Zuckerberg is set to testify before the Senate Commerce and Judiciary committees on Tuesday and the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday. In these hearings, Democrats are expected to grill Mr. Zuckerberg about the privacy scandals, and how the social network is guarding against possible interference in this fall\u2019s midterm elections. Republicans are expected to be more reticent about privacy regulations, and may use the hearings to raise suspicions of political bias on the social network.The risk for Mr. Zuckerberg is appearing evasive or further angering government officials, which could lead them to attack the company even more aggressively. The company\u2019s stock has fallen about 15 percent in the three weeks since Cambridge Analytica\u2019s misuse of data became public.Facebook\u2019s damage control efforts, which are being overseen by a policy and communications team of more than 500 employees as well as a handful of outside crisis communications firms, are unprecedented in the company\u2019s 14-year history.The 2016 election, and revelations that Russians used the platform to spread misinformation, have proved to be more intractable problems. In the fall, when Mr. Stretch testified before a Senate subcommittee about why Facebook had failed to stop Russian interference, his remarks were not warmly received.The Cambridge Analytica scandal seems to have unlocked even larger worries about the influence of social media, the power of Silicon Valley and the cavalier approach many tech companies have taken toward user privacy. While the vast majority of users and advertisers have not abandoned Facebook, Mr. Zuckerberg has acknowledged that the company\u2019s reputation has taken a hit.\u201cSo far, they\u2019ve failed at every state of this, and at every level of the organization,\u201d said Ari Ratner, a former Barack Obama administration official who now runs Inside Revolution, a strategic communications firm. \u201cThey have the potential to reset with Zuckerberg\u2019s appearance before Congress.\u201dIn addition to mollifying lawmakers and investors, Mr. Zuckerberg needs to impress another important audience during next week\u2019s hearings: Facebook\u2019s rank-and-file employees, who have begun to question the company\u2019s leadership as the latest crisis has spiraled.\u201cMorally, it was extremely difficult to continue working there,\u201d Mr. Lohne wrote.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "This Start-Up Says It Wants to Fight Poverty. A Food Stamp Giant Is Blocking It.", "Date": "2018-04-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFour years ago, Jimmy Chen left a lucrative perch as a product manager at Facebook to found Propel, what he calls an \u201canti-poverty software company.\u201dThe Propel-Conduent conflict offers a textbook case of a digital newcomer running into resistance from the old order. The twist is that the newcomer said it did not want to destroy the incumbent but instead build atop it to do good for underserved populations, as well as build a business for itself.The animating idea behind Propel, Mr. Chen said, was to \u201capply the Silicon Valley playbook to poverty in some way.\u201d He added that \u201cwe have to build on top of the old world to be successful.\u201dPropel has had no problems with the other major government contractor that manages state food stamp networks, FIS, Mr. Chen said. Nor did Propel have trouble with the Conduent system until recently. Propel has complained to Conduent managers repeatedly, but, Mr. Chen said, \u201cthey\u2019ve never offered us a direct explanation as to why now.\u201dIn written replies to questions, Conduent, which spun out from Xerox in January 2017, portrayed Propel less as an innovator than as a freeloader. Propel\u2019s smartphone app, Conduent said, was introduced \u201cwithout the knowledge, input or consent from Conduent.\u201d It accused Propel of overloading its networks with data requests, causing \u201ca capacity ambush.\u201dConduent took actions to block the app, and described them as prudent \u201csteps to prevent unauthorized access to data \u2014 from Propel or any other unauthorized user.\u201dThe fight over the app is now affecting people like Brianna LaBelle, 25, of Augusta, Me., who has two young sons. She has used Propel\u2019s app to create shopping lists, track food purchases and budget. \u201cI love it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very handy.\u201dBut in February, when Ms. LaBelle tried to check her food stamps balance, she got a message that access to her information was \u201ccurrently unavailable to the residents of Maine.\u201d That interruption, she said, lasted for nearly a month, in which she also lost the timesaving and meal-planning convenience of the app.Propel, Mr. Chen insisted, has tried to explain its business to state governments and to food stamp contractors. The Propel app is a digital \u201cskin\u201d that works on top of the websites of food stamp contractors, like Conduent. A user taps the app, which is known as FreshEBT, to look up the amount left in the account. On average, users check their balances seven times a month.Conduent, in another twist, has begun competing with the start-up. The business services outsourcer, which has $6 billion in yearly revenue, introduced its own smartphone app last year. Conduent\u2019s entry, ConnectEBT, has significantly fewer reviews and lower ratings on the Google and Apple app stores than Propel\u2019s FreshEBT.Conduent\u2019s app is available in Utah, South Carolina and Oklahoma, and offers only basic information on account balances and purchases. But the company said it was beginning a broader rollout this year, and would provide \u201cmore features and functions\u201d as it gets states\u2019 approval as a regulated contractor, unlike Propel.Propel\u2019s predicament is magnified because the food-stamp system\u2019s technology, like many government tech services, is outsourced to a relatively small number of companies.\u201cIt\u2019s an oligopoly game, so there\u2019s often not much choice, competition or innovation,\u201d said Josh Miller, who oversaw the development of digital products in the Obama White House. He added that the volume of data requests from Propel is \u201ctiny\u201d in internet terms.Propel\u2019s early success suggests there is opportunity for innovation in the low-income market, no matter how the start-up\u2019s wrangling with Conduent turns out.Propel is a fledgling company, with only 11 employees, two of them former food-stamp recipients. Mr. Chen, 30, is not one of them. His family emigrated from China when he was 4, and he attended Stanford University on a full scholarship, based on need. Propel has raised $5.2 million from investors like Andreessen Horowitz, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm, and Omidyar Network, which funds start-ups focused on social goals.Paper food stamps are long gone, replaced beginning nearly two decades ago by debit-style cards, called Electronic Benefit Transfer cards. The program is federally funded and administered by the states, which typically rely on private contractors to provide the service.The account look-up feature in FreshEBT has been its way into the low-income market, but was only a first step. Other features that were added over time, including food coupons, job opportunities and recipes for inexpensive meals, have also become popular.So far this year, FreshEBT users have downloaded coupons advertised on the app worth more than $2 million. In the past six months, they have applied for jobs more than 10,000 times from the app, the company said. Propel typically gets referral fees from its coupon, job-listing and other advertiser partners. It does not store or sell users\u2019 personal information, the company said.Keyana Workman, 25, who has two young children and lives in Brooklyn, has been off and on food stamps for the last three years, as jobs and income fluctuate. She calls FreshEBT\u2019s balance look-up \u201ca real improvement\u201d from making 800-number calls.Lately, Ms. Workman has also tapped into the recipes and health and exercise tips. \u201cI\u2019ve been working out a lot,\u201d she said.Propel estimates that 80 percent of its users in the Conduent states have now had problems accessing their information from its app at some point in the past few months.What Propel is doing in the low-income market is broadly similar to what other companies like Mint and Yodlee have done by offering digital services that let people organize and manage their personal finances. The major banks initially opposed allowing those online services to pull account information, but the Dodd-Frank financial reform law in 2010 included a mandate to allow consumers \u2014 and third-party apps on their behalf \u2014 to access their data.\u201cIt should be up to the participants in the program to decide how to organize and use their information,\u201d Ms. Dean said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Huawei, Failing to Crack U.S. Market, Signals a Change in Tactics", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHENZHEN, China \u2014 In a grand hotel ballroom on Tuesday, Huawei executives laid out a soaring vision for the future. The Chinese electronics giant, already the world\u2019s biggest supplier of the equipment that powers the wireless age, now wants to provide the digital backbone for artificial intelligence, the internet of things and other transformative technologies.But that future is increasingly looking as if it will not include the United States.Last week, the company laid off five American employees, including William B. Plummer, the executive who was the face of its Sisyphean efforts to win over Washington, according to people familiar with the matter. Huawei has also been dialing back its political outreach in the United States, these people said \u2014 which could end a decade of mostly fruitless efforts to dispel Washington\u2019s accusations that the company has ties to the Chinese government.Huawei\u2019s tactics are changing as its business prospects in the United States have darkened considerably. On Tuesday, the Federal Communications Commission voted to proceed with a new rule that could effectively kill off what little business the company has in the United States. Although the proposed rule does not mention Huawei by name, it would block federally subsidized telecommunications carriers from using suppliers deemed to pose a risk to American national security.Huawei\u2019s latest moves suggest that it has accepted that its political battles in the United States are not ones it is likely to win.\u201cSome things cannot change their course according to our wishes,\u201d Eric Xu, Huawei\u2019s deputy chairman, said at the company\u2019s annual meeting with analysts on Tuesday. \u201cWith some things, when you let them go, you actually feel more at ease.\u201dYet Huawei\u2019s experience also illustrates how little Washington can do to curb Chinese influence in cutting-edge industries throughout the rest of the world.At Tuesday\u2019s meeting with analysts, executives at the company, which says it is owned by its employees and not by the Chinese state, emphasized growth opportunities in Europe and Asia. They also described ambitions to further diversify Huawei\u2019s business into helping organizations of all kinds \u2014 not merely wireless carriers, but factories, governments and the police \u2014 transform themselves through cloud computing and artificial intelligence.\u201cFor Huawei, the major challenge is not how we can serve operators better,\u201d said David Wang, a company president. Instead, he said, \u201cwe have to work harder to cope with wider challenges in all industries.\u201dThe company has said repeatedly that its products pose no security risk and that it complies with the law everywhere it operates. Still, the layoffs last week appear to be an acknowledgment by Huawei that it has failed to clear the political cloud around it.Mr. Plummer, Huawei\u2019s vice president of external affairs, had been with the company for almost eight years. He was the most senior member of Huawei\u2019s American policy team who was not a Chinese citizen.It is not clear whether he will be replaced. The company\u2019s policy operations in the United States are led by a relatively recent arrival, Zhang Ruijun, who took the post nine months ago after working for the company in Mexico and Russia.A Huawei spokesman said in a statement that any layoffs simply reflected an effort to better align resources with \u201cbusiness strategy and objectives.\u201d\u201cAny changes to staffing size or structure are simply a reflection of standard business organization,\u201d he said.Founded three decades ago, Huawei made $93 billion in revenue last year \u2014 not much less than Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, and more than its two main rivals in telecom gear, Nokia of Finland and Ericsson of Sweden, combined.Chinese carriers are likely to deploy such networks more quickly than their American counterparts are, at least in the beginning. But as 5G comes up in the United States, Japan, South Korea and Europe, Nokia and Ericsson will catch up, said Pierre Ferragu, an analyst in New York with New Street Research.In the United States, Huawei customers that would be affected by the F.C.C.\u2019s proposed rule \u2014 small carriers in rural areas \u2014 may soon need to find new equipment suppliers.These carriers love Huawei gear, said Carri Bennet, general counsel for the Rural Wireless Association, an industry group for American telecom companies with fewer than 100,000 subscribers.\u201cThey just love it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt works like a charm, the customer service support is awesome,\u201d and the price is attractive, she added.Ms. Bennet said that rather than blacklisting specific manufacturers, Washington should be creating a system for testing telecom gear for security vulnerabilities.\u201cThese companies who are reliant on this support, they don\u2019t have the funds to overhaul their whole network,\u201d she said. \u201cPublic safety, getting 911 services, broadband \u2014 it all just starts falling apart.\u201dRaymond Zhong reported from Shenzhen, China, and Paul Mozur from Shanghai.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Huawei and ZTE Hit Hard as U.S. Moves Against Chinese Tech Firms", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe United States undercut China\u2019s technology ambitions on Tuesday, advancing a new rule that would limit the ability of Chinese telecommunications companies to sell their products in this country.The Federal Communications Commission voted unanimously to move forward with a plan that would prevent federally subsidized telecommunications carriers from using suppliers deemed to pose a risk to American national security. The decision takes direct aim at Huawei, which makes telecommunications network equipment and smartphones, and its main Chinese rival, ZTE, sending a message that the government doesn\u2019t trust them.The moves intensify an already testy fight between China and the United States for high-tech supremacy. Although tensions have simmered for years, the two economic powerhouses are threatening a global trade war as they look to protect their most advanced industries.Long bedeviled by political concerns about its ties to the Chinese government, Huawei (pronounced \u201cHWA-way\u201d) has spent the better part of the last decade trying to sell its equipment and phones in the United States.Since then, Huawei has signaled that its political battles in Washington may be all but lost. The company has been dialing back on government outreach in the United States, including lobbying, and last week it cut key staff there, according to people familiar with the matter. The new F.C.C. rule, which would become final with a second vote, could kill off what little equipment business Huawei has in the United States.These are uncertain times for tech companies, whether American or Chinese, that are trying to do business across the Pacific. The two nations are playing an aggressive game of one-upsmanship, both to support their own companies and guard against threats to national security. Last month, the Trump administration accused Beijing of stealing American know-how as part of its ambitions to transform the Chinese economy, prompting tit-for-tat tariffs.The latest moves against Huawei and ZTE mean that American companies like Apple and Qualcomm could soon be caught in the crossfire \u2014 and they have a lot to lose. Apple, for example, sold $46.5 billion worth of iPhones and other products in mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong last year. That was about 20 percent of its total sales.Wealthy Chinese consumers have gravitated toward Apple, and President Xi Jinping and the Communist Party still aim to keep the public happy. But there are limits to Apple\u2019s leverage in the country.\u201cBeijing will not sit idly by,\u201d said Paul Triolo, who leads global technology policy analysis at Eurasia Group, a geopolitical risk consultancy. \u201cChinese officials will likely pause to digest this move, and the series of other trade and investment moves coming at them in waves, before deciding how best to respond. It is likely to get ugly before it gets better.\u201dBeijing could use its broad cybersecurity laws to steal the core computer code of American companies operating in China, said Dean Garfield, head of the Information Technology Industry Council, a trade group that represents the largest American tech companies. The Chinese government also could walk back recent commitments to allow more financial and electronic payments services from Mastercard, Visa and JPMorgan Chase. Or it could simply restrict American companies\u2019 ability to do business in China, he said.For ZTE, this week\u2019s sanctions are a nightmare come true. The company\u2019s smartphones and network gear rely on American microchips and software, which means it could need to redesign as much as 90 percent of its product line.ZTE and Google, which supplies the Android operating system in the Chinese company\u2019s phones, are concerned that the ban may prevent ZTE from licensing the software, according to a person familiar with the discussions but not permitted to speak publicly on the matter. No conclusion has been reached yet, the person said.Huawei is a global telecommunications equipment powerhouse, with $93 billion in revenue last year. It has spent millions trying to pry its way into the United States but found few takers \u2014 save for smaller, rural telecom companies that receive federal subsidies and would likely be barred from working with it by the F.C.C. rule.Huawei\u2019s troubles in the United States have been mounting since 2012, when a congressional report warned that its gear could be used to spy on Americans or to destabilize American telecom networks. The company spent $1.2 million on lobbying that year. Last year, it spent $60,000.Major American carriers such as Verizon and AT&T have since shunned Huawei. The Commerce and Treasury Departments have subpoenaed it over possible violations of American sanctions on Iran and North Korea. And bills are before Congress to stop government agencies and contractors from buying Huawei products.In January, researchers discovered security flaws in the microprocessors inside nearly all of the world\u2019s computers. A Senate committee wrote to Huawei\u2019s founder to ask what the company knew about the vulnerabilities, and how it had been affected by them. Huawei decided not to respond.Then, last week, Huawei laid off five American employees, including William B. Plummer, the executive who was the face of its Sisyphean efforts to win over Washington.The company has said repeatedly that its products pose no security risk and that it complies with the law everywhere it operates. Still, the layoffs appear to be an acknowledgment by Huawei that it has failed to clear the political cloud around it.\u201cSome things cannot change their course according to our wishes,\u201d Eric Xu, Huawei\u2019s deputy chairman, said at the company\u2019s annual meeting with analysts on Tuesday in its home city, Shenzhen. \u201cWith some things, when you let them go, you actually feel more at ease.\u201dMr. Plummer, who was Huawei\u2019s vice president of external affairs, had been with the company for almost eight years.

{"Headline": "Following the Trail of Online Ads, Wherever It Leads", "Date": "2018-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech We\u2019re UsingHow do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Sapna Maheshwari, a reporter who covers advertising for The Times, discussed the tech she\u2019s using.What tech tools do you use to monitor what advertisers are doing with our data on websites, apps and gadgets?More than anything, though, I do lots of phone interviews \u2014 despite what they say about millennials and phones \u2014 and meet with brand marketers and people at ad agencies and ad technology companies to hear what they\u2019re thinking about and working on.What do you like about these tools, and what could be better?The online ad tracking services are helpful for the desktop and mobile web, but I haven\u2019t yet found an effective way to sort through the many, many ads that flow through Facebook and Instagram or across various mobile apps.How has tech changed advertising, and how much is the advertising industry looking to tech these days? Tech has transformed advertising \u2014 there are so many more ways to target and reach people now than when the industry was dominated by TV, print, radio and event sponsorships.There\u2019s also so much more data being collected about our habits by an array of companies, from big tech platforms to agencies to the advertisers themselves. Huge portions of advertising dollars in the last few years have gone to the big tech giants that we read about all the time \u2014 specifically Google and Facebook and, to a lesser extent, companies like Snap. Lately, advertisers have said they\u2019re spending more money on Amazon. So there are still more major changes afoot.Advertisers are also grappling with how to measure their ads in this new world. That\u2019s a challenge throughout the industry. Think of all the ways that people watch TV shows now. I recently watched \u2014 or, more accurately, binged \u2014 NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Good Place.\u201d I watched the first season on Netflix, where there were no ads, then saw the first eight episodes of the second season through NBC\u2019s Apple TV app, where there were lots of commercials. I watched the final few on Hulu, which might have had different ads. That type of behavior \u2014 especially since I was using my parents\u2019 cable login for the NBC app \u2014 is a new kind of challenge for the people buying, selling and measuring ads.What do you think of Google\u2019s and Facebook\u2019s power in the online ad industry?It\u2019s an enormous topic within the advertising industry, which generally refers to Google and Facebook as the \u201cduopoly.\u201d It\u2019s pretty remarkable that two of the world\u2019s most valuable companies make virtually all of their money from selling online ads and dominate more than half of the American digital ad market.Their size and influence make it essential for people to really understand how the companies\u2019 business models work and the types of information they\u2019re sharing with them every day \u2014 and what makes them such powerful advertising machines.Outside work, what tech product do you love using? And I love the Bose wireless speaker that my boyfriend gave me for Diwali. I use it to listen to podcasts and talk on the phone while cooking or cleaning. I love that the speaker gets me away from my phone, which can charge in the meantime, and that I can use it throughout my apartment. It would be nice if it just did the cooking for me, though.What\u2019s your advice for those who want to prevent their data from being tracked by advertisers?It\u2019s hard to prevent, but you can take some steps to limit it. Explore the privacy settings on your smartphone, including which apps have access to your location and microphone and whether you allow ad tracking. Delete apps that you don\u2019t use anymore.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Takes the Punches While Rest of Silicon Valley Ducks", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Two pages of notes sitting in a binder in front of Mark Zuckerberg during his congressional testimony this week hinted at a message the Facebook chief executive rarely got a chance to deliver: We\u2019re not the only ones.Mr. Zuckerberg was prepared to say that his company accounts for just a slice of the $650 billion advertising market and that it has plenty of competitors. Google, for example, has an online advertising business more than twice the size of Facebook\u2019s. And Google also collects vast amounts of information about the people who use its online services.But as Facebook has taken it on the chin over the way it has handled the personal information of its users, the leaders of other tech companies have demonstrated that even in publicity-hungry Silicon Valley, it is entirely possible for billionaire executives and their sprawling empires to keep a low profile.What set Mr. Zuckerberg apart? The personal information of up to 87 million Facebook users ended up in the hands of the voter-profiling firm Cambridge Analytica, which worked with the Trump campaign in the 2016 presidential election. Google and the biggest tech companies \u2014 as far as anyone knows \u2014 have never made such a giant mistake.Mr. Zuckerberg was the only executive to testify in two days of hearings this week. Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, and Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, were also asked to testify by the Senate Judiciary Committee.But when that hearing combined with one from another committee, which had not asked for Google or Twitter\u2019s participation, Mr. Pichai and Mr. Dorsey were let off the hook, said company officials and congressional aides.For now, at least.The companies have until April 25 to respond. When asked whether they were concerned about congressional or regulatory scrutiny, Google and Twitter, through company representatives, declined to comment.\u201cOutside of Facebook, there is probably no company paying more attention\u201d than Google, said Jason Kint, a frequent critic of Google and Facebook and chief executive of Digital Content Next, a trade group that represents entertainment and news organizations, including The New York Times. \u201cThey\u2019re absolutely ducking for cover while the heat is on Facebook. They don\u2019t want to try to trip any alarms.\u201dLike Facebook, Google collects vast amount of data on users \u2014 including their YouTube choices, internet searches and location history \u2014 to target advertisements. Facebook has more than two billion users globally, but Google has seven products, including YouTube, Gmail and its Android software, with more than a billion users each.On Wednesday, when Representative John Shimkus, Republican of Illinois, questioned Facebook\u2019s tracking of logged-off users, Mr. Zuckerberg was quick to point out that Google and \u201cthe rest of the industry\u201d employed similar tactics. It was one of the few times Google\u2019s data practices were mentioned in the two days of hearings.Mr. Zuckerberg did not get a chance to say much more about Facebook\u2019s industry peers this week. Over two days of hearings, Google was referenced 11 times by lawmakers. Twitter was mentioned 10 times and Amazon once. Apple was mentioned three times, mostly in passing.Google employees said they had not received explicit orders from management to keep a low profile because most already understood the risk. One employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because workers were not allowed to speak publicly on the issue, said there was an understanding inside Google that the company was the obvious next target.In a statement, Aaron Stein, a Google spokesman, said the company was \u201ccompletely focused on protecting our users\u2019 data\u201d and \u201cwill take action\u201d if it found evidence of \u201cdeceptive behavior or misuse of personal data.\u201dGoogle is staying on the sidelines in other ways. Four days before Mr. Zuckerberg was set to testify, Facebook surprised many in Washington when it endorsed the Honest Ads Act, a Senate bill that would require more transparency and stricter rules for political ads on the internet. Facebook\u2019s endorsement was a reversal from its previous opposition, said a spokeswoman for one of the bill\u2019s co-sponsors, Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia.Mr. Warner and another co-sponsor, Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, called on Twitter and Google to also back the bill. Twitter quickly responded with an endorsement. Google has not taken a public position.Similarly, Facebook and Google had donated $200,000 each to a group opposing a California ballot initiative that proposes enabling Californians to sue companies for data breaches, among other things. Facebook this week dropped its opposition to the initiative, which organizers said was on track to appear on the November ballot in California.Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s notes, which were photographed during the testimony, also contained a prepared response if lawmakers echoed criticism from Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, who has chided Facebook and other companies for collecting gobs of personal information about their users.\u201cLots of stories about apps misusing Apple data, never seen Apple notify people,\u201d said the document. \u201cImportant you hold everyone to the same standard.\u201dRepresentatives for Facebook and Apple declined to comment on Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s notes.Apple has long campaigned to draw a distinction between the way it operates and the way Facebook and Google do.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to traffic in your personal life. I think it\u2019s an invasion of privacy,\u201d Mr. Cook told MSNBC. \u201cI think everybody needs to understand Silicon Valley is not monolithic.\u201dWhen asked if it was worried about regulations for the industry stemming from new scrutiny of Facebook, Apple referred to recent comments Mr. Cook made to MSNBC. He said he typically believed \u201cthe best regulation is no regulation\u201d but \u201cI think we\u2019re beyond that here.\u201dAmazon uses shoppers\u2019 purchase history to target ads, though Forrester Research estimated its advertising revenue last year was $2.5 billion. Facebook makes $39.9 billion on ads and Google makes $95.4 billion.Amazon\u2019s top competitors for that business? Google and Apple.Many tech companies understand that Washington\u2019s renewed focus on privacy is likely to reach them soon, said Dean Garfield, head of the Information Technology Industry Council, a trade group representing the largest tech companies.\u201cThe tide has shifted,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is passing us by.\u201dNick Wingfield contributed reporting from Seattle.videoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook Should Consider a \u2018Why Me?\u2019 Button", "Date": "2018-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBook\u201cOne of our biggest responsibilities is to protect data.\u201dOver the past year, the downside of social media companies \u2014 Facebook foremost among them \u2014 has become glaringly apparent. They have been platforms for information campaigns that influenced elections and endangered lives. They have failed to keep users\u2019 personal information private. And the carefully targeted ads that appear on them can be, well, creepy.It is not clear that Facebook will be able to stave off regulators, but Mr. Zuckerberg and his colleagues might want to consider this: a \u201cWhy Me?\u201d button. (Google, Amazon and others might want to take note, too.)Facebook suffers from a lack of trust because of the asymmetrical nature of the relationship users have with it. We provide it all sorts of information. But we have no idea how the information is being used, how our data is being harvested, how that data is being commingled and cross-referenced with other data sets and ultimately sold to advertisers. (Facebook already has a button, relatively buried in a list of other items, that it calls \u201cWhy Am I Seeing This Ad?\u201d It is, to some degree, a crippled version of what I\u2019m suggesting should be introduced on all of Facebook\u2019s properties.)To his credit, Mr. Zuckerberg does appear to recognize the problem that his company faces over privacy concerns. After acknowledging that protecting users\u2019 data is one of the company\u2019s biggest responsibilities, he went on to say, \u201cIf you think about what our services are, at their most basic level, you put some content into a service, whether it\u2019s a photo or a video or a text message \u2014 whether it\u2019s Facebook or WhatsApp or Instagram \u2014 and you\u2019re trusting that that content is going to be shared with the people you want to share it with.\u201dThat\u2019s where the \u201cWhy Me?\u201d button could help. This button would sit next to every advertisement and piece of content that appears before you on all of Facebook\u2019s properties, including Instagram and WhatsApp.If you saw an ad or an article pop up on your screen, you could click the \u201cWhy Me?\u201d button. Then you would see a full explanation of why that item was pushed to you.The \u201cWhy Me?\u201d explanation would not just include the name of the advertiser, but what keywords, demographics or other information the advertiser specifically targeted. It would also offer a full rundown of how your information fit into the parameters of the advertiser\u2019s request and where that information came from.Maybe Facebook saw that you had clicked on a pair of sneakers on a different service that shares information with Facebook. The \u201cWhy Me?\u201d section would show you when and where that information was collected. Did Facebook notice you searched for a new cellphone plan? Facebook would tell how it knew that, too.Did Facebook use artificial intelligence to find your face in an image without you or anyone else labeling it? The \u201cWhy Me?\u201d section would show you the images that the artificial intelligence system cross-referenced to identify you. Did Facebook scrape another site or buy information about you that it commingled with the data that you had provided? It would tell you that, too.Most important, at every point in the \u201cexplanation tree,\u201d the user would have the option to turn off or disable that specific piece of data. Facebook, of course, could \u2014 and probably should \u2014 explain the trade-offs of such decisions.The \u201cWhy Me?\u201d button could also be extended to content. When a friend or company shares a post, Facebook doesn\u2019t just display it to everyone listed as the poster\u2019s friend or follower. Facebook\u2019s algorithms choose which friends and followers see it based on all sorts of parameters, usually related to the kind of content or how you\u2019ve interacted with the friend in the past.The \u201cWhy Me?\u201d button should explain all the data points that are used in the calculation and how they are weighted.The current \u201cWhy Am I Seeing This Ad?\u201d often says something like: \u201cCompany A wants to reach people ages 18 and older who live or were recently in the United States. This is information based on your Facebook profile and where you\u2019ve connected to the internet.\u201dBut it hardly tells you the whole story. Facebook doesn\u2019t say so explicitly, but it allows companies to upload their own databases, cross-reference them with Facebook\u2019s data and use that information to serve ads to users. It also doesn\u2019t say how that other site originally got that information about who you are.In fairness, the \u201cWhy Me?\u201d button might create all sorts of problems for Facebook, and its advertisers, too. It would allow users \u2014 and rivals \u2014 to reverse engineer much of the way the system works. And advertisers would probably object to the idea of making their targeting plans public. But that would be the cost of using such large public platforms with such exact targeting.It has become something of a clich\u00e9, but in 1913, before he became a Supreme Court justice, Louis D. Brandeis said, \u201cSunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.\u201dIt could well be applied today at Facebook \u2014 and its peer companies \u2014 if it wants to avoid a governmental crackdown.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "YouTube Shooting Puts a Focus on Workplace Security", "Date": "2018-04-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe laid-back companies of Silicon Valley are known for corporate headquarters that resemble universities, where employees mingle with tourists taking selfies and collaborations take shape out on the quad.But those generous green spaces and relaxed atmospheres come with a trade-off: They\u2019re difficult to secure.Many Google employees love the headquarters\u2019 open nature but some worry about it, according to one current and one former Google employee who declined to be named because of a company policy barring workers from speaking to the news media. There is often no barrier between employees and the public, they said. People \u2014 most likely other employees \u2014 sometimes slip into buildings behind workers with badges, they said, and neither had ever seen an armed guard on campus. Google declined to comment.The shooting this week at the headquarters of YouTube, a Google-owned company about 25 miles north in San Bruno, has highlighted the security risks of Silicon Valley\u2019s relatively open corporate campuses \u2014 particularly as tech companies\u2019 expanding influence angers more people online.But the risk is not confined to the tech sector. Many companies across the country are similarly exposed, reflecting an open-door policy that for generations has pervaded corporate America, where safety training has long focused on fire drills, earthquake-sheltering procedures and accident cleanup.\u201cI just don\u2019t know how we got here,\u201d said James D. Smith, president of the American Society of Safety Engineers. \u201cWe would never be thinking 10, 15 years ago that this would be an issue.\u201dMs. Aghdam shot the people in an enclosed courtyard where employees dined. YouTube said she had entered the courtyard through a parking garage. The gate between the parking garage and the courtyard was unlocked, according to Zach Vorhies, an engineer at YouTube. A former YouTube employee who used to handle threats from disgruntled video creators, but was not allowed to speak about it publicly, said his team repeatedly warned YouTube security about the risk of the parking garage and unlocked gate, but it was never fixed.YouTube said in a statement on Wednesday that Ms. Aghdam never entered the building itself thanks to other security protections. The company said it was \u201crevisiting this incident in detail\u201d and would be increasing security at all of its offices around the world.Workplace shootings have fueled a cottage industry of security consultants who show employees how to manage panic, when to run or hide, and how to fight as a last resort. Lesson plans identify which filing cabinets or pieces of furniture offer the best protection, and which office tools can become improvised weapons. A full day of training can cost companies thousands of dollars.Companies are sending their employees to self-defense classes and their security personnel to gun ranges to test active-shooter threats in virtual reality. Architects are designing offices with designated safe rooms. Insurance providers are offering lower premiums for corporate clients with stronger security.\u201cIf you can\u2019t protect the work force, you\u2019re putting your entire operation at risk,\u201d said Arnette Heintze, a former Secret Service agent who runs the security consulting firm Hillard Heintze, which posted record revenue in the most recent quarter.At Apple\u2019s new campus in Cupertino, Calif., visitors are required to enter through a single, guarded entrance. The headquarters have a large courtyard, but reaching it requires someone to pass through the building.One former Facebook employee who worked on the company\u2019s security protocols, who declined to be named because of Facebook\u2019s prohibition on discussing internal company matters, said the company received dozens of threats a week.In recent years, Facebook has increased security at the entrances to its headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., but its parking lots and surrounding areas remain accessible. \u201cThe safety of our employees is paramount, and we work hard every day to maintain a safe and secure environment for our community,\u201d Jamil Walker, a Facebook spokesman, said in an email.Some security experts instruct clients to shift their parking lots farther away from the main facility, giving more time for potential attackers to have second thoughts and for guards to act on a threat. Consultants recommend that executive offices remain unlabeled to make them less of a target.Companies of all kinds have stepped up security. General Mills said it made physical changes to its building in Minneapolis to better prepare for an active shooter situation, but did not provide specifics. Wendy\u2019s said it had installed upgraded security cameras throughout its headquarters in Dublin, Ohio; set up advanced access control systems that can lock down different parts of the facility; and upgraded its phone systems with emergency messaging capabilities.Hallmark and Hershey said they show employees a training video from the Center for Personal Protection and Safety that covers active shooter protocol. Some companies use a softer term \u2014 \u201chostile intruder\u201d \u2014 to describe the training, while others add customized introductions to the footage.Employees are being asked to download internal apps loaded with safety plans, maps and emergency alerts. Some are told that their bonuses will be withheld if they do not attend mandatory drills.And preventive tactics are gaining traction. Employers are hiring social media trackers and data analysts to search for warning signs in employee behavior. Accenture said it has a behavioral threat assessment team made up of human resources representatives, lawyers, on-call psychologists and others.But security remains a matter of balance.\u201cYou don\u2019t want a security program so restrictive that it hinders the company from doing the business it\u2019s in,\u201d Mr. Heintze said.Employees looking for convenience tend to prop open automatically locking doors. Some will pass a badge over a turnstile to a friend who forgot his or hers.One corporate client described its facility to John M. White, the chief executive of the Protection Management security consulting firm, as being fully secure. Within three hours, Mr. White found that he could waltz through most of the building\u2019s doors without being screened and that some were so old they would not lock.Another customer spent several hundred thousand dollars installing security cameras, only to find that their views were obstructed. Mr. White said he has spoken to employees who, in a theoretical attack, said they would be unwilling to break a window to escape out of fear of being fired later.\u201cYou can\u2019t just throw a million dollars at security and say that now the problem\u2019s gone,\u201d he said. \u201cIn some ways, it can be a facade \u2014 you could have the most secure facility in the world, and there will still be some risks you\u2019re going to have to accept and manage.\u201dSheera Frenkel contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Or that these services have created millions of jobs, new business ecosystems and helped fuel the rise of the digital economy that brings broad societal benefit.But it is important not to forget the learning of lessons and the hoped-for change. We are seeing some of these changes now. There is no playbook for addressing the principles at play here, and so it will not be all smooth sailing. But you can be certain that the effort will be earnest and that these services will be better as a result.DEAN GARFIELD, WASHINGTONThe writer is president and chief executive of the Information Technology Industry Council, a lobbying group for Google, Facebook, Twitter, Apple and Amazon, among others.To the Editor:Once something is shared with hundreds of others, it is not private. Lax privacy rules are indeed a problem, but denial about posts remaining private is another major problem, and unlike the lax rules, what is posted is within the direct control of every Facebook user.ETHAN ANNIS, SAN FRANCISCOTo the Editor:The Facebook brouhaha has fascinated me for one reason: When you sign up for Facebook, you aren\u2019t obligated to put any information about yourself in the sign-up. You are asked, but you don\u2019t have to reply.Several people I know have little or no information about themselves out there, and some have put in wrong birthdays and left out education, hometown and so on.My hometown is listed incorrectly. I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s even there, but I don\u2019t care. The people I\u2019m on Facebook with know who I am, and that\u2019s all that counts. If the data miners get it wrong, tough.TERRY SHAMES, BERKELEY, CALIF.To the Editor:We are sidestepping the larger problem of this predictable data breach.Facebook has been using \u2014 and selling \u2014 our data with little or no active consent or even active thought given by most data owners for more than a decade. This basic trade-off, of privacy for convenience, has been fundamental to the operation of social media sites over the last decade.The loss of user data to Cambridge Analytica is obviously an issue. But the bigger issue is the loss of countless hours to Facebook and other social media outlets. Compounding that issue is how screens affect our interactions with others and how social media influences our understanding and awareness of the world around us.Facebook\u2019s data breach without user consent should be a catalyst inspiring examination of our connection to screens and how screen time affects news consumption, time management and intimate relationships.To the Editor:I agree that we need better privacy rules. Here\u2019s a simple solution. Why not pay consumers for the use of their data?Instead of combing through agreements for buried data use protocols and having to \u201copt out\u201d of data sharing, consumers would \u201copt in\u201d to data sharing in exchange for a fee, depending on the extent and the frequency of data use.Much simpler, and more fair.RICHARD KATZ, BROOKLYNAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Firms Sign \u2018Digital Geneva Accord\u2019 Not to Aid Governments in Cyberwar", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe principles, which have been circulating among senior executives in the tech industry for weeks, also commit the companies to come to the aid of any nation on the receiving end of such attacks, whether the motive for the attack is \u201ccriminal or geopolitical.\u201d Although the list of firms agreeing to the accord is lengthy, several companies have declined to sign on at least for now, including Google, Apple and Amazon.Perhaps as important, none of the signers come from the countries viewed as most responsible for what Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president, called in an interview \u201cthe devastating attacks of the past year.\u201d Those came chiefly from Russia, North Korea, Iran and, to a lesser degree, China.The impetus for the effort came largely from Mr. Smith, who has been arguing for several years that the world needs a \u201cdigital Geneva Convention\u201d that sets norms of behavior for cyberspace just as the Geneva Conventions set rules for the conduct of war in the physical world. Although there was some progress in setting basic norms of behavior in cyberspace through a United Nations-organized group of experts several years ago, the movement has since faltered.Mr. Smith said over the weekend that the first move needed to come from the American companies that often find themselves acting as the \u201cfirst responders\u201d when cyberattacks hit their customers. \u201cThis has become a much bigger problem, and I think what we have learned in the past few years is that we need to work together in much bigger ways,\u201d Mr. Smith said in an interview. \u201cWe need to approach this in a principled way, and if we expect to get governments to do that, we have to start with some principles ourselves.\u201dYet not all governments are likely to embrace the \u201cCybersecurity Tech Accord\u201d in part because the principles it espouses can run headlong into their own, usually secret efforts to develop cyberweapons.Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor who leaked documents about surveillance programs, revealed pictures suggesting that American officials intercepted some hardware that came out of Cisco Systems, a major manufacturer of the routers and switches that make up the spine of the internet, apparently so the equipment directed traffic back to American intelligence agencies. There is no evidence that Cisco cooperated, but the publication of the photos led some foreign customers to believe that American equipment had been broadly compromised by the N.S.A.Cisco is one of the firms that has signed the accord. Mark Chandler, Cisco\u2019s general counsel, said the company believed that \u201cwe need to say we will not be part of any effort that will undermine the security of the web, or undermine those who depend on it \u2014 our customers.\u201d Among the other signatories were Dell, Juniper Networks, the two parts of the recently-split Hewlett-Packard, Symantec and FireEye. Two foreign firms, Telephonica of Spain and Nokia of Finland, also signed. There are no Chinese or Russian companies on the list of initial signatories.The new technology accord vows that the 31 signers \u201cwill protect against tampering with and exploitation of technology products and services during their development, design, distribution and use.\u201d Among the companies that signed are Oracle, Symantec, FireEye and HP, along with the Finnish company Nokia and the Spanish company Telef\u00f3nica.The cybersecurity coordinator at the White House, Rob Joyce, is widely rumored to be considering leaving his post and returning to the National Security Agency, where he ran the most elite of the cyberforces that attack foreign networks. If Mr. Joyce departs, the White House will have lost its two most senior, and most knowledgeable, cybersecurity policymakers in the span of a few weeks.An earlier version of this story incorrectly referred to the name of one of the signatories on the technology accord. It is Juniper Networks, not Juniper Systems.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Big Reason Wall Street Is Flocking to Spotify: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Good Tuesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Spotify\u2019s shares opened at $165.90.\u2022 If the markets fall again, we have some possible explanations.\u2022 Should Facebook offer \u201cWhy Me?\u201d buttons?\u2022 Disney has offered to buy Sky News to help Fox\u2019s Sky bid.Spotify is a loss-making company that might not report a profit until next decade, but that didn\u2019t stop investors from valuing the company at $30 billion when it debuted Tuesday on the United States stock market.Spotify is an impressive company. Its loyal, paying customer base is enormous and is expected to keep growing. Also, Spotify has so far held its own in the face of competition from Apple, Amazon and Google, all of which want to win new subscribers to their music streaming services.But there is an important reason that Wall Street is flocking to Spotify: It is doing a great job at getting record companies to roll over.Spotify\u2019s main cost is what it pays record companies for the music it streams to its customers. As Spotify has grown, that expense has fallen as a share of its total revenue, which shows that Spotify is negotiating increasingly advantageous deals with record companies.That has bolstered Spotify\u2019s gross profit margin, which measures how much money a company keeps after paying out the costs directly related to generating its revenue. Last year, that margin was 21 percent of revenue at Spotify, well up from 14 percent in 2016.Crucially, though, Spotify has said it expects its gross margin to expand to as much as 35 percent over the longer term. In other words, as Spotify\u2019s spending on music grows, so will its leverage over record companies. And it may well achieve its gross margin target. After all, Netflix, which occupies a similar position in the market for streaming video, has a gross margin of 35 percent.But Spotify\u2019s main rivals could complicate things. What if Amazon offered record companies better terms than Spotify? That would reduce Spotify\u2019s bargaining power, making it harder to deliver wider gross margins investors are expecting. And Amazon, along with Apple and Google, has far deeper pockets to slog it out over the long term.\u2014 Peter EavisSpotify\u2019s unusual path to the public markets was a success.On its first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the music streaming service finished with a valuation of $26.5 billion.Spotify\u2019s shares opened at $165.90 before closing at $149.01.That\u2019s well above the high of $132.50 that its shares changed hands at in private transactions this year. It\u2019s also well above the $137.50 the WSJ reported its private shares were trading at during the past week.Spotify had eschewed a typical initial public offering in favor of a direct listing. That meant there was no \u201cdeal price\u201d for investors to reference on the first day of trading and no underwriters acting as stabilizing agents if the stock began to plunge.Despite all that, Spotify\u2019s valuation at the close on Tuesday ranks among the highest for a tech company debuting on an American exchange.Here\u2019s a look at the tech companies with the 10 biggest market capitalizations after their first day of trading, courtesy of Dealogic:Alibaba \u2014 $233.9 billionFacebook \u2014 $81.7 billionPalm \u2014 $53.3 billionInfineon Technologies \u2014 $47.9 billionJD.com \u2014 $28.9 billionSnap \u2014 $28.9 billionGoogle \u2014 $27.2 billionSpotify \u2014 $26.5 billionTwitter \u2014 $24.9 billionAgilent \u2014 $20.1 billionTesla said:\u2022 It built 2,020 Model 3s in the past seven days. That fell short of its goal of 2,500 by the end of the quarter.\u2022 Tesla produced 9,766 Model 3s during the quarter.\u2022 In total, Tesla produced 35,000 cars in the first quarter.\u2022 It has delivered 8,800 Model 3s during the first quarter, below the 8,800 analysts expected according to Bloomberg.\u2022 In all, Tesla delivered a record 29,980 vehicles during the quarter.\u2022 The company said it expects Model 3 weekly production to reach 5,000 by the end of the second quarter.\u2022 The combined deliveries of the Model X and Model S came to 21,800 cars, the lowest total in several quarters.ContextTesla\u2019s stock and bond prices have plunged amid concerns about how much cash the company is using as it struggles to speed up assembly and sales of the Model 3. With a starting price of $35,000, the car is supposed to be more affordable than Tesla\u2019s other cars. The company has been counting on a quick expansion of its Model 3 business to increase revenue.The president reiterated his claim that Amazon is \u201ccosting the United States Postal Service massive amounts of money\u201d in a post to Twitter on Tuesday morning.Shares are essentially flat on the day.\u201cPackage delivery has been a bright spot for a service that\u2019s lost money for 11 straight years. The losses are mostly due to pension and health care costs \u2014 not the business deal for the Postal Service to deliver packages for Amazon. Boosted by e-commerce, the Postal Service has enjoyed double-digit increases in revenue from delivering packages, but that hasn\u2019t been enough to offset declines in first-class letters and marketing mail, which together make up more than two-thirds of postal revenue.\u201cWhile the Postal Service\u2019s losses can\u2019t be attributed to its package business, Trump\u2019s claim that it could get more bang for its buck may not be entirely far-fetched. A 2017 analysis by Citigroup concluded that the Postal Service was charging below-market rates as a whole for parcels. The post office does not use taxpayer money for its operations.\u201dCould Mr. Tump\u2019s criticism lead to action against Amazon?\u201cNothing can be certain, except death and taxes \u2026 and more Trump tweets on Amazon. We believe sales tax collection changes would have limited impact on consumer use of Amazon and could actually help Amazon\u2019s relative competitive positioning in domestic e-commerce.\u201dMore from Andrew:The \u201cWhy Me?\u201d button might create all sorts of problems for Facebook, and its advertisers, too. It would allow users \u2014 and rivals \u2014 to reverse engineer much of the way the system works. And advertisers would probably object to the idea of making their targeting plans public. But that would be the cost of using such large public platforms with such exact targeting.The bottom line: Disney wants Fox to have full control of Sky to support its $52.4 billion deal to buy most of Fox, and it wants to get ahead of Comcast\u2019s rival effort to buy that 39 percent of the British broadcaster.An earlier version of this article misstated the status of a Department of Defense contract for cloud computing services.

{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s Deal for Shazam Is Delayed in Europe Over Data Concerns", "Date": "2018-04-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 If data is the most valuable currency of the digital economy, at what point does a company have so much that it becomes unfair?That\u2019s a question antitrust experts are increasingly asking themselves as the world\u2019s biggest technology companies harvest more and more information about people and businesses. On Monday, European regulators pushed the idea forward, announcing an investigation into Apple\u2019s proposed acquisition of the song-identification app Shazam over concerns the iPhone maker would get access to data on competitors like Spotify.Ms. Vestager has said that with free services, customers pay with their data, and are not always getting a fair deal. This broader interpretation of antitrust law would have important consequences for future acquisitions made by companies such as Amazon, Facebook and Google.\u201cCompeting music streaming services could be put at a competitive disadvantage,\u201d the commission said. It added that it wanted to prevent Apple from blocking Shazam from referring users to other music services.The European Commission has until Sept. 4 to make a final decision on whether to block or approve the deal, or seek concessions from Apple.Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Ms. Vestager\u2019s office has also fined a number of other tech giants, including Amazon, Facebook, Google and Qualcomm. And a new data protection law taking effect next month is expected to bring even more scrutiny.Antitrust cases based on data will become more common as companies use customer information as a moat against competitors, according to Maurice Stucke, a law professor at the University of Tennessee, who has written in favor of broader enforcement of antitrust rules. He cited a potentially influential German investigation of Facebook over the use of data.The European inquiries are likely to influence governments elsewhere in the world, Mr. Stucke said. Governments, wary of the technology industry\u2019s power over the global economy, will develop rules to account for concerns that data can be used to build monopoly positions, even when companies buy businesses that wouldn\u2019t initially seem to be consequential, he said.\u201cYou\u2019re seeing significant changes over the last three to four years on data, privacy and competition policy,\u201d Mr. Stucke said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sea change.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Wall Street analysts expect earnings for the companies in the S.&P. 500 to increase 25 percent this year, according to data compiled by Standard & Poor\u2019s, an unusually large jump that was reflected in the stock market valuations. Much of that projected earnings increase is coming from tax cuts and some from expectations that companies\u2019 revenue would grow at a nice clip as global growth stayed strong.\u2014 Peter EavisA little humor has not cleared the clouds over Tesla.The accident renews questions about Autopilot, a signature feature of Tesla vehicles, and whether the company has gone far enough to ensure that it keeps drivers and passengers safe.Raj Rajkumar, who researches autonomous driving at Carnegie Mellon University, thinks those assumptions concern one of Tesla\u2019s key sensors. \u201cThe radars they use are apparently meant for detecting moving objects (as typically used in adaptive cruise control systems), and seem to be not very good in detecting stationary objects,\u201d he says.Doubts about the fundamental capabilities of Tesla\u2019s Autopilot could crimp demand for its cars among a customer base that is often seeking the best technology.Out of respect for the privacy of our customer and his family, we do not plan to share any additional details until we conclude the investigation.- Peter EavisTech companies are again dragging down stocks on Wall Street.The S.&P. 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite are off 3.1 percent and 3.5 percent Monday. The continued fall in the share prices of some of the biggest tech companies is weighing heavily on the indexes.Amazon is down 5.4 percent, Netflix is off 5.9 percent, Facebook fell 3 percent, Google-parent Alphabet slipped 3.6 percent and Apple dropped 5.9 percent.After leading the market higher for much of the past two years, tech stocks have hit some turbulence. Since March 16, Facebook, Alphabet, Netflix and Amazon are all down more than 12 percent, while Apple is down 7.3 percent.Over that period the business models of those companies have come under increased scrutiny. News that Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm hired by President Trump\u2019s 2016 election campaign, gained access to private information on more than 50 million Facebook users has weighed not only on the shares of Facebook but on Alphabet as well. Amazon, meanwhile, has come under attack from President Trump.President Trump attacked the e-commerce again on Monday morning.Monday\u2019s tweet is the latest over the past five days from Mr. Trump criticizing Amazon. Over that period, Mr. Trump has accused Amazon of not paying enough taxes, of putting thousands of local retailers out of business and of using the United States Postal Service as its \u201cDelivery Boy.\u201dAmazon\u2019s shares are down 4 percent and are off nearly 11 percent since Axios reported on Wednesday about Mr. Trump\u2019s anger toward the company.Context\u2022 Amazon has said that the Postal Regulatory Commission, which oversees the service, has consistently found that its contracts with Amazon are profitable.Critic\u2019s cornerDA Davidson analyst Tom Forte wrote in a note via Reuters:\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s comments are consistent with industry sources we have spoken to in the shipping industry, who often label Amazon\u2019s deal with the USPS as a sweetheart deal. An argument, however, could be made that the USPS was losing billions before it expanded its service offerings for Amazon and would, still, likely lose billions if Amazon discontinued its use of the USPS tomorrow.\u201dCiting anonymous sources, Bloomberg\u2019s Ian King and Matt Gurman report:\u201cThe initiative, code named Kalamata, is still in the early developmental stages, but comes as part of a larger strategy to make all of Apple\u2019s devices \u2014 including Macs, iPhones, and iPads \u2014 work more similarly and seamlessly together.\u201dApple provides Intel with about 5 percent of its annual revenue.Kenneth C. Griffin\u2019s Citadel has just hired Phil Villhauer, a former top trader at Steven A. Cohen\u2019s investment firm. Mr. Villhauer will become deputy head of global equities at Citadel, a newly created position. He will officially join the Chicago-based hedge fund in the middle of April and work out of Citadel\u2019s office in New York, a Citadel spokesman confirmed.\u201cWe see this as a big hire for us,\u201d said Zia Ahmed, a Citadel spokesman.In January, Mr. Cohen reconfigured Point72 as a hedge fund after establishing it as a family office in 2014 to manage $11 billion of his personal wealth. Point72 has said it has raised between $2 billion and $4 billion in outside money.Mr. Villhauer had been with Mr. Cohen through both the good days and bad days. He was there when SAC turned into a powerhouse hedge fund, and he was there when the fund pleaded guilty to insider trading charges in 2013. The guilty plea required the firm to stop managing money for outside investors.When Mr. Villhauer left Point72, Mr. Cohen, in a letter to employees, called the departure a \u201cretirement\u201d and said he was sad to see Mr. Villhauer go.Now Mr. Villhauer will start a new chapter in his career at another well-known hedge fund firm.____________________________Part of the silence, people in the industry say, comes from a desire to avoid the business equivalent of bad karma \u2014 knowing that they, too, may one day face the buzz saw of public censure.Critic\u2019s corner More on data and privacy The Chinese government said on Monday that it would place tariffs on the imports of 128 American-made products in retaliation for to President Trump\u2019s tariffs on steel and aluminum.The Washington flyaroundWhen the Justice Department allowed Live Nation to merge with Ticketmaster, it tried to assuage concerns that the deal would cripple competitors.But critics have reason to be skeptical. Here\u2019s how Beau Buffier, the chief of the New York Attorney General\u2019s Antitrust Bureau, described Live Nation:\u201cIt is now widely seen as the poster child for the problems that arise when enforcers adopt these temporary fixes to limit the anticompetitive effects of deeply problematic vertical mergers.\u201dThe inquiries come as the department is reviewing two more mergers, between AT&T and Time Warner, and Disney and Fox.The department\u2019s new antitrust chief has said that the Live Nation deal and several other deals posed problems because they relied too much on the federal government\u2019s ability to police corporate behavior.\u201cEven if we wanted to do that, we often don\u2019t have the skills or the tools to do so effectively,\u201d the antitrust chief, Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, said in a speech.More for your playlistThe deals flyaroundAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Police Identify Woman Who Wounded 3 at YouTube and Killed Herself; Motive Is Unclear", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN BRUNO, Calif. \u2014 A woman opened fire with a handgun at YouTube\u2019s headquarters in California on Tuesday afternoon, shooting three people \u2014 one of whom was critically injured \u2014 before killing herself, the authorities said.The San Bruno Police Department identified the attacker late Tuesday as Nasim Najafi Aghdam, who was in her late 30s. The motivation for the shootings was under investigation, the police said, although her social media postings included criticisms of YouTube.Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital received three patients: a man, 36, in critical condition; a woman, 32, in serious condition; and a woman, 27, in fair condition, a hospital spokesman, Brent Andrew, said at a news conference. A fourth person had injuries that weren\u2019t from a gunshot, the police said.\u201cAt this time there is no evidence that the shooter knew the victims of this shooting or that individuals were specifically targeted,\u201d the San Bruno Police Department said in a written statement.Word of the attack in San Bruno at YouTube, which is owned by Google and is one of the world\u2019s largest social media companies, quickly spread online through employees\u2019 social media feeds.Vadim Lavrusik, a YouTube employee who formerly worked for The New York Times, tweeted just before 1 p.m. that there was an \u201cactive shooter at YouTube HQ\u201d and that he had \u201cheard shots and saw people running while at my desk.\u201d He was barricaded in a room with co-workers, he said, but moments later tweeted that he had been safely evacuated.The last known address for Ms. Aghdam was in Menifee, a city in Southern California about halfway between Los Angeles and San Diego.Ms. Aghdam was active on various social media outlets, including YouTube, where she had a number of channels in Persian, Turkish and English. On YouTube, she published an eclectic set of videos, including music parodies and workouts, on topics like animal cruelty and vegan cooking.In February 2017, she recorded a video on Facebook criticizing YouTube for taking measures that decreased the number of views on her videos.She said that she had contacted YouTube, but that the site\u2019s support staff told her that her workout videos contained inappropriate scenes and needed to be restricted from younger audiences.\u201cThis is what they are doing to vegan activists and many other people who try to promote healthy, humane and smart living \u2014 people like me are not good for big business, like for animal business, medicine business and for many other businesses. That\u2019s why they are discriminating and censoring us,\u201d she said in the video on Facebook.YouTube had pulled down all of her channels as of Tuesday night.\u201cFor me, animal rights equal human rights,\u201d said Ms. Aghdam, then 29, who attended the protest carrying a plastic sword and wearing a wig and jeans painted with drops of blood.The shootings on Tuesday took place in a courtyard at YouTube\u2019s offices, the police said. Those offices, like other Google facilities, maintain light security, with employees using badges to go through security gates or doors. Usually, the main lobby is attended by a receptionist. There are no visible metal detectors or armed guards.San Bruno is about nine miles south of San Francisco, with a population around 43,000. YouTube is the city\u2019s biggest employer, and many workers commute here from San Francisco. Though YouTube is owned by Google, it operates in a separate office, about 20 miles from Google\u2019s main campus in Mountain View, Calif.Outside the YouTube headquarters, armed police officers waded into a crowd of 200 or so employees who had evacuated to a nearby parking lot Tuesday afternoon. The police asked for employees who had witnessed something firsthand to come forward, and about two dozen, some visibly distraught, walked over to the officers.Many employees said they had initially thought the episode was a fire drill. Others said they had run when people started shouting that there was a shooter. Two hours after the attack, YouTube employees, including Susan Wojcicki, the chief executive, continued to stream slowly down the hill, away from the office.Footage broadcast by CNN showed people leaving the building in single file with their hands raised above their heads. Separate footage showed a large crowd lining up to be frisked, one by one, by the police.Zach Vorhies, 37, a senior software engineer at YouTube, said in an interview that he had been sitting at his desk when the fire alarm went off. He grabbed his electric skateboard and headed for a back exit, he said. As he rode down a gravel hill, he heard someone shouting and saw a man lying motionless in one of the office\u2019s outdoor dining areas.\u201cHe had a red spot on his stomach, and he was lying on his back, not moving,\u201d Mr. Vorhies said. \u201cI saw the blood soak through the shirt.\u201dAbout 25 feet away from the victim, he said, a man was shouting, \u201cCome at me!\u201d Mr. Vorhies thought the man was the attacker, but he did not see a gun and said it was possible that the man had actually \u201cbeen taunting the shooter.\u201dA moment later, an armed police officer entered the patio area, and Mr. Vorhies quickly left, he said.The dining area can be reached from an adjacent parking structure without an employee badge, Mr. Vorhies said.By 2:15 p.m., President Trump had been briefed on the attack. He tweeted a short time later: \u201cWas just briefed on the shooting at YouTube\u2019s HQ in San Bruno, California. Our thoughts and prayers are with everybody involved. Thank you to our phenomenal Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders that are currently on the scene.\u201dExecutives at other Silicon Valley companies took to Twitter to send their condolences to YouTube employees.Others, including a trauma surgeon at the hospital where shooting victims were taken, expressed anger at continued gun violence.\u201cYou\u2019d think that after we\u2019ve seen Las Vegas, Parkland, the Pulse nightclub shooting, that we would see an end to this, but we have not,\u201d the surgeon, Dr. Andre Campbell, told reporters Tuesday afternoon.An earlier version of this article misquoted a comment made by Nasim Najafi Aghdam in one of her YouTube videos. She said, \u201cThis is what they are doing to vegan activists and many other people who try to promote healthy, humane and smart living,\u201d not \u201cwhat they are doing the weekend activists.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the name of the city in California where Ms. Aghdam\u2019s last known address was. It is Menifee, not Menefee.Daisuke Wakabayashi reported from San Bruno, and Maggie Astor, Maya Salam and Matt Stevens from New York.

{"Headline": "Three Reasons Deutsche Bank Didn\u2019t Exit Wall Street Earlier: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Thursday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Deutsche Bank is finally, and drastically, shrinking itself.\u2022 Facebook can afford to clean up its act.\u2022 Is the problem with I.P.O.s a \u2018middle-market tax\u2019?\u2022 On today\u2019s earnings calendar: Amazon, Microsoft, PepsiCo and Lazard.Since the financial crisis a decade ago, the German institution\u2019s giant investment banking operations have lagged well behind those of its rivals. And Deutsche Bank\u2019s problems had relevance well beyond the trading desks of Wall Street; its difficulties have at times pumped uncertainty into the global financial system. Deutsche Bank\u2019s post-crisis behavior stands in contrast to that of other European investment banks that had also become risky and bloated before the 2008 meltdown. Switzerland\u2019s Credit Suisse and UBS made hard decisions several years ago that helped them adapt to new realities. But Deutsche Bank wavered and delayed. And since this probably won\u2019t be the last time that a too-big-to-fail bank takes too long to fix itself, it\u2019s worth asking why Deutsche Bank dragged its feet. Some reasons follow:- Peter EavisDeutsche Bank\u2019s decision to end its Wall Street ambitions should benefit its American rivals.The German lender said on Thursday that it was scaling back operations such as trading and providing services to hedge funds. According to a note from Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Deutsche Bank\u2019s decision to shrink its investment banking business should \u201chelp industry pricing and provide a revenue opportunity\u201d for United States banks.Deutsche Bank\u2019s scale of tradingLast year Deutsche Bank had a 7.7 percent share of the trading in bonds, currencies and commodities, and a 5.1 percent share of stock trading.Deutsche Bank reported \u20ac4.4 billion in revenue from fixed-income trading last year and another \u20ac2.1 billion from equity trading. Of the combined \u20ac6.5 billion in revenue it generated, 40 percent came from the United States, according to a note from Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.Which banks stand to benefitJPMorgan, Bank of America and Citigroup should get a lift from Deutsche Bank\u2019s pull back from fixed-income trading. The three banks\u2019 market share of fixed-income trading is nearly 50 percent.For stock trading, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan have about 45 percent of the market.Amazon\u2019s profit more than doubled during the first quarter, while Microsoft\u2019s earnings jumped 35 percent. A driver for both companies was their cloud-computing businesses.Amazon\u2019s numbers\u2022 The e-commerce giant reported a profit of $1.6 billion, up from $724 million a year ago.\u2022 Earnings per share came in at $3.27. Analysts expected $1.26 per share, according to Thomson Reuters.\u2022 Revenue jumped 43 percent to $51 billion, beating analysts\u2019 expectations of $49.78 billion.\u2022 Operating income increased 92 percent to $1.9 billion in the first quarter.\u2022 Sales for Amazon Web Services, its cloud-computing business, increased 49 percent to $5.4 billion.Critic\u2019s corner\u201cSales have more than doubled in five years, but it\u2019s taking more fixed assets to get there. Amazon now uses property and such with less efficiency than Walmart.\u201dMicrosoft\u2019s numbers\u2022 The software giant posted a profit of $7.42 billion, up from $5.49 billion a year ago.\u2022 Earnings per share came in at 95 cents. Analysts expected 85 cents per share.\u2022 Revenue rose 16 percent to $26.82 billion, beating expectations of $25.77 billion.\u2022 Operating income rose 23 percent to $8.3 billion.\u2022 Revenue at Azure, Microsoft\u2019s could-computing business, surged 93 percent.Shares of Amazon climbed 7 percent after hours, while Microsoft\u2019s stock rose 2.1 percent.Critics\u2019 cornerSince hitting an intraday low of $150.80 on March 28, the stock has climbed 15 percent and reclaimed more than $60 billion in market value.Ross Sandler, an analyst at Barclays, writes:\u201cWe don\u2019t think 1Q marks the \u201call clear\u201d for FB shares by any means, but given the drubbing over the past two months, we think it may start an overdue stabilization period (next week\u2019s f8 should also help move the conversation back to innovation to some degree). Stepping back, FB\u2019s valuation is attractive vs. its peers, and while we fully expect more tape-bombs in 2018 we think patient investors will be rewarded at current levels when sentiment eventually improves.\u201dFacebook\u2019s first-quarter earnings featured a 63 percent jump in profit and a 49 percent rise in revenue. And roughly 70 million new monthly active users.Peter Eavis\u2019s take: If Facebook wants to spend more on protecting its community, it can: Its operating earnings are equivalent to 46 percent of its revenue. But its expense numbers haven\u2019t provided clear evidence that the company is going the extra mile yet.The key assessment, from the Pivotal analyst Brian Wieser:\u201cAll the data privacy issues, the congressional hearings, none of that will get as much scrutiny from investors as the bottom line.\u201dThe chipmaker reported results Wednesday that topped Wall Street\u2019s expectations. The conference call that followed provided analysts an opportunity to ask about where Qualcomm\u2019s acquisition of NXP stands. The deal is awaiting approval from Chinese regulators, but growing trade tension between China and the United States has increasingly put the deal in doubt.Here is what Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm\u2019s chief executive, said on the call:\u201cWe continue to work closely with China. The environment is obviously quite difficult from a geopolitical point of view, at least right now. However, we expect to ultimately receive approval. And I\u2019ll just remind folks that we have 8 of 9 jurisdictions that have already ruled on it. So although we \u2014 we remain committed to it. And we think it\u2019s going to get done. However, if it does not get done, as you mentioned, we think we have the ability to move very rapidly on a buyback as we communicated earlier in the January time frame. I\u2019ll just remind everyone that we did a 90-day extension to the merger agreement. And we\u2019re going to work very hard to get that done. And if it doesn\u2019t get done, we\u2019re going to move on to another approach. So hopefully, that answers the question.\u201dA bit later in the call Mr. Mollenkopf added:\u201cWith respect to MOFCOM and remedies, our evaluation of the environment is such that really, I think the issue is probably more related to the higher-level discussions between the countries as opposed to any individual issue related to MOFCOM. Of course, we continue to work with the regulators and work through any issues that pop up. But I think the environmental issues between the countries are probably more the situation today than anything else. But obviously, we work closely with the regulator.\u201dIt\u2019s not just regulations like Sarbanes-Oxley that put smaller companies off public listings, argues Rob Jackson, a Democratic S.E.C. commissioner \u2014 it\u2019s the fact that they pay on average 7 percent of proceeds raised in their offerings, way more than bigger clients.\u201cWith the deck stacked against them, it\u2019s no wonder that middle-market I.P.O.s have been on a steady decline. And this has had real effects across our economy, which is now dominated by fewer, and larger, public companies than ever before.\u201dHe suggests the S.E.C. should make underwriters disclose more about the costs of going public, including companies\u2019 potential losses from underpricing, and that bankers should do more to explain why they\u2019re worth their fees.What Jeffrey Lurie, the owner of the Philadelphia Eagles, said, according to the NYT:\u201cWe\u2019ve got to be careful not to be baited by Trump or whomever else.\u201dBob Kraft of the New England Patriots, a friend of Mr. Trump, said:\u201cThe problem we have is, we have a president who will use that as fodder to do his mission that I don\u2019t feel is in the best interests of America.\u201dThere\u2019s no question that it will help make sense of Randall Stephenson\u2019s expansion of AT&T into the pay-TV market and improve AT&T\u2019s positioning and value proposition.Advertisement"}

To do so, it will have to move beyond what\u2019s worked in the age of Facebook video, and make something new.The idea that video will be a financial savior in the media business is contentious, and often mocked. It is expensive to create, and audiences aren\u2019t equivalent \u2014 yet \u2014 to print or even web in their ability to be monetized. (In human terms: One person watching a video is not financially equivalent to what one person paying for a magazine has been worth.)But Vogue the magazine has just over a million paid subscriptions, and Vogue the YouTube channel has more than 2.2 million subscribers.\u201cIn the next 24 months, I hope that video is half our business,\u201d said Craig Kostelic, the chief business officer of The Lifestyle Collection. \u201cIt\u2019s critical. It\u2019s the macro trend of content consumption.\u201dCond\u00e9 Nast is not betting everything on \u201chands and pans\u201d videos. In fact, it is increasingly looking beyond them as viewers gravitate toward something that is a cross between short social videos and the food programs of yore (you might remember it as cable television). Much of the space is for videos featuring hosts like Claire Saffitz, who is known for videos in which she breaks down complex recipes for foods as varied as Twinkies and soup dumplings, or Brad Leone, the quirky host of \u201cIt\u2019s Alive,\u201d a series about fermentation, pickling and more.\u201cFor so long we were doing those hands and pans videos, and it\u2019s one of those things you had to do based on internet demand and traffic,\u201d said Adam Rapoport, the editor in chief of Bon App\u00e9tit. \u201cThey\u2019re kind of boring, they\u2019re not stimulating and they\u2019re predictable. It was not creatively rewarding. As an industry, we\u2019ve gone beyond that and it\u2019s gone more to the personality videos, to more narrative.\u201dTo optimize the new test kitchens for filming, they have been outfitted with overhead lights, blackout curtains and acoustic paneling to muffle outside sound. All the stovetops are gas. \u201cPeople want to see the flame,\u201d said Eric Gillin, the digital general manager of The Lifestyle Collection. Sponsored product is everywhere. The countertops? Caesarstone. The small appliances? Braun. Furniture? Crate & Barrel. The smart fridges? Samsung. And so on.And though the test kitchen at Cond\u00e9 Nast\u2019s headquarters has served well as a shooting location, it will now go back to being primarily a work space for editors who are trying out recipes. \u201cVideo can be kind of intrusive,\u201d said Mr. Rapoport. \u201cYou have camera people, lights, you have to section off a portion of the kitchen, you don\u2019t want people to be too noisy. Shooting interrupts the basic workflow.\u201d\u201cOn YouTube, over half of our audience is under 34 years old. These people are young, they\u2019re really engaged, they\u2019re watching for an average of over five minutes. It\u2019s not this 8-second watch time like on Facebook,\u201d said Matt Duckor, the executive producer for the Lifestyle Collection.\u201cYouTube is a sneaky, over-the-top kind of channel unto itself,\u201d Mr. Gillin said.The Cond\u00e9 Nast teams have embraced the flexibility of the mid-length format. \u201cWhen you\u2019re post-cable, it\u2019s not a half-hour TV show, you\u2019re not programming for these ad blocks, you\u2019re telling the story for as long as there\u2019s a story to be told,\u201d Mr. Gillin said.\u201cThis industry is moving so fast,\u201d Mr. Duckor said. \u201cThe videos we\u2019re creating now compared to two years ago are really different, but you\u2019re always going to need kitchens, you\u2019re always going to need the ability to have production space to have people work and sit.\u201dFor now, the revenue coming in from videos is split between advertising and sponsorships. \u201cAbout half to two-thirds of it is more about traditional ads, like pre-roll,\u201d Mr. Kostelic said, referring to the brief advertisements that play before a video. But increasingly Cond\u00e9 Nast makes videos for its clients that it does not promote on its own platforms.\u201cHistorically, you would have a digital media plan with a set amount of view or impressions,\u201d Mr. Kostelic said. \u201cMore people are coming to us for our content and creative services plans, with distribution being a separate conversation.\u201dThe greater goal is for the lessons the Lifestyle Collection team will learn with the Kitchen Studio space to trickle out to the rest of the company.\u201cThe issue that Cond\u00e9 Nast used to have is that it was really siloed out by brand, and the brands didn\u2019t speak to each other, they didn\u2019t share learnings,\u201d Mr. Duckor said. \u201cWe\u2019re at a place now where we can take learnings from Bon App\u00e9tit and the success we\u2019ve had on YouTube and apply them to Architectural Digest, where they haven\u2019t quite had the investment in that platform that we have. That\u2019s the real opportunity.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jamie Dimon\u2019s Letter \u2014 Handicapping a Run for President in 2020: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Good Thursday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Jamie Dimon chafes under liquidity rules.\u2022 Mark Zuckerberg has disclosed more on how much Facebook user data may have been accessed.\u2022 The White House is still talking tough on trade with China.\u2022 Blackstone\u2019s infrastructure fund isn\u2019t doing so well.On Wall Street, there\u2019s been a running parlor game about whether Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s chief executive, would try to run for president in 2020. His annual letters, filled with commentary on U.S. policy, have only increased the chatter, and this year\u2019s letter, released Thursday, is no different. It touches on everything from trade to immigration. While Mr. Dimon, who once called himself \u201cbarely a Democrat,\u201d says he plans to stay at the bank for the next five years, the question among political prognosticators is whether Mr. Dimon\u2019s policy views could ever find a home among voters in this politically polarized environment.Mr. Dimon\u2019s sensible letter was seemingly supportive of some of President Trump\u2019s policies, while taking the opposing side on others. Mr. Dimon particularly applauded the corporate tax cut and deregulation efforts. On China trade, Mr. Dimon writes: \u201cIt is not unreasonable for the United States to press ahead for more equivalency,\u201d and that \u201cone of the administration\u2019s best arguments is that negotiation alone has not worked.\u201d However, he said he would like to see more cooperation with U.S. allies on talks with China and added that the U.S. should \u201crevisit the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\u201dOn immigration, he called for tougher border control, writing, \u201cAmerican citizens have the right to complain that we have not successfully protected our borders since the last immigration reform in 1986.\u201d He also said, \u201cPeople immigrating to this country should be taught American history, our language and our principles.\u201d At the same time, he also advocated for \u201ca path to legal status and citizenship\u201d for \u201cDreamers\u201d and improving \u201cmerit-based immigration\u201d programs so that immigrants educated here can stay.Mr. Dimon made a point of saying that part of the problems facing the country is that too many people are talking past each other.\u201cWhen people argue as if there are binary solutions, the argument is almost always wrong,\u201d he wrote, advocating that people try to look at all sides of a situation. \u201cI tell my liberal friends to read columnists like Arthur Brooks and George Will. And I tell my conservative friends to read writers like Tom Friedman.\u201dIf Mr. Dimon were to run, he would likely have to do so as an independent. It is hard to see how liberal Democrats would embrace much of his deregulatory positions. And yet many of his positions \u2013 and especially some of his social positions not enunciated in his letter \u2014 may not be far right enough to capture the interest of Republicans.Maybe the country needs someone in the middle, but history has not been kind to third-party candidates.\u2014 Andrew Ross SorkinBut he also addressed a policy area much closer to home \u2013 bank regulation. Mr. Dimon often has expressed skepticism about aspects of the banking overhaul that took place in the wake of the financial crisis. But his remarks on regulation arguably carry more weight now. Congress is closer to modifying the post-crisis rules than at any point since Dodd-Frank was signed into law in 2010. An important regulatory requirement Mr. Dimon criticized, therefore, might become a focus for those wanting to roll back the rules.Mr. Dimon in this year\u2019s letter zeroed in on regulations that require banks to have a certain amount of liquidity, the financial term for access to cash or low-risk assets that can be easily sold for cash.In 2008, some large financial firms were crippled when customers, depositors and creditors withdrew their money. The Federal Reserve and taxpayers had to step in to support the banks. To help prevent a repeat of this, post-crisis rules require that banks hold a certain amount of liquid assets to cover a theoretical level of outflows. Mr. Dimon is in favor of banks having more liquidity than before the crisis, but in the letter, released Thursday, he wrote:Liquidity requirements, while much higher, now have an element of rigidity built in that did not exist before. Banks will be unable to use that liquidity when they most need to do so \u2014 to make loans or intermediate markets. They have a \u201cred line\u201d they cannot cross (they are required to maintain hard and fast liquidity requirements). As clients demand more liquidity from their banks, the banks essentially will be unable to provide it.First, a bank that lacks liquidity is in no position to lend. When a bank\u2019s creditors and customers fear it doesn\u2019t have enough cash in reserve, they will most likely withdraw their money. This not only deprives the bank of the money it needs to lend, it also sharply reduces its chance of survival. Or as Gregg Gelzinis of the left-leaning Center for American Progress puts it, \u201cYou won\u2019t be able to take this action if you fail.\u201dThe nation\u2019s largest bank holding companies have strong capital levels and retain their ability to lend to households and businesses during a severe recession.Andrew Gray, a JPMorgan spokesman, followed up with more material on Mr. Dimon\u2019s thinking on liquidity.He re-emphasized Mr. Dimon\u2019s point about having to tie up funds that could be used to make loans. Mr. Gray noted that a bank facing outflows would be expected to keep refilling its pool of liquid assets to be in compliance with a liquidity regulation. This would leave fewer funds for lending and making markets, Mr. Gray asserted.He also addressed the argument that higher capital levels, not liquidity, will largely determine the extent to which banks will lend through a downturn. Mr. Gray asserted that liquidity rules play an important role in ensuring banks have the resources to participate in wider financial markets. Rules forcing the hoarding of liquidity may, thus, crimp that activity.\u2014 Peter EavisMick Mulvaney, the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has complained that the regulator engages in \u201cwasteful spending.\u201d He even submitted a quarterly budget request recently of $0.That attitude apparently didn\u2019t apply to two of his recent hires.ContextThe consumer bureau, as well as fellow financial regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, is allowed under federal law to pay employees significantly more than other government agencies can pay. The rationale is that the higher salaries are necessary to recruit skilled employees who otherwise might land jobs on Wall Street.As a result, the C.F.P.B. is stocked with employees who earn more than the average Washington bureaucrat. Of the agency\u2019s 1,600 employees, 219 make more than $200,000, according to the records reviewed by The Times.\u2014 Stacy CowleyBlackRock, the world\u2019s largest money manager, plans to offer a series of new products allowing individuals and institutions to invest in market indexes without putting money into manufacturers and retailers of firearms.They include:\u2022 a new exchange-traded fund that will track the performance of the MSCI USA Small Cap Extended ESG Focus Index, composed of small stocks with favorable environmental, social and governance standards, while specifically excluding producers and large retailers of civilian firearms.\u2022 a similar credit-focused ETF that eschews the debt of gunmakers and distributors.\u2022 an option to take the guns out of institutional strategies tracking major market indexes, including the S&P 500, the Russell 2000 and three others.Critic\u2019s cornerRob Cox of Breakigviews writes:\u201cBlackRock\u2019s moves may spark criticism from gun-rights supporters, who lashed out at companies like Delta Air Lines that severed ties with the National Rifle Association. But it\u2019s hard to see how offering customers more choice is ever a bad idea. Moreover, by getting out early, BlackRock makes clear to those young people lobbying for tighter gun laws \u2013 who it hopes will be customers for decades to come \u2013 that it has something for them. Far from virtue signaling, it\u2019s simply good business.\u201d\u2022 Facebook said Cambridge Analytica harvested the data of 87 million users, not 50 million.\u2022 A vulnerability in search and account recovery functions may have exposed \u201cmost\u201d of Facebook\u2019s 2 billion users to unauthorized harvesting of their public profile information.A brighter note for Facebook: Its shares are up in premarket trading today, after Mr. Zuckerberg said that #DeleteFacebook didn\u2019t appear to be having much effect.The Facebook calendar\u2022 April 9: Alerts should start popping up for users whose information may have been shared with Cambridge Analytica.\u2022 April 10: Mr. Zuckerberg is scheduled to testify before the Senate\u2019s Commerce and Judiciary committees.\u2022 April 11: He will testify before the House Energy and Commerce Committee.People familiar with the negotiations say Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, and Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, have at times argued for more dialogue with the Chinese and quicker concessions that would help diminish the trade deficit. \u2026 Other top trade advisers, including longtime China critics like Robert Lighthizer and Peter Navarro, have taken a tougher stance.The United States trade deficit rose 1.6 percent to $57.6 billion, its highest level since October 2008. The deficit has now risen for six straight months, the longest such streak since 2000.The merchandise-trade gap with China narrowed to $34.7 billion in February from $35.5 billion. The Trump administration wants to cut $100 billion, or about 25 percent, from the annual deficit with China, Bloomberg points out. During President Trump\u2019s first year in office, the United States\u2019 trade deficit with China rose to $375.2 billion in 2017, a record high.Last May, Blackstone announced with great fanfare that it planned a $40 billion fund with Saudi Arabia to invest in U.S. infrastructure: up to $20 billion from the Saudis, who would match commitments by other outside partners. But as of now, Blackstone has secured just $575 million in such commitments \u2014 and missed two fund-raising deadlines.\u2022 The Saudis wanted the fund overseen by an investment committee, with a seat for them. Blackstone refused.\u2022 Many potential investors balked at committing money until an investment team was in place, a process that took some time.More from Scott Shane and Dai Wakabayashi of the NYT:That kind of idealistic stance, while certainly not shared by all Google employees, comes naturally to a company whose motto is \u201cDon\u2019t be evil,\u201d a phrase invoked in the protest letter.

{"Headline": "Google\u2019s Parent Company Spends Like It\u2019s Thinking of a Future Beyond Ads", "Date": "2018-04-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, is spending like it is beginning to prepare for life after advertising.Currently, Alphabet makes nearly 90 percent of its money from selling advertising on the internet, and gobbles up heaps of data about its users to help marketers target those ads more effectively.But a close reading of Alphabet\u2019s financial results for the first quarter of 2018, which were announced on Monday, showed that the Silicon Valley giant is accelerating its efforts to diversify into other businesses.Alphabet has made investments in areas like self-driving cars and online computer services for businesses for years, but spending in those areas was up dramatically in the first quarter. The company\u2019s capital expenditures, which included installing undersea cables and the construction of new data centers, were $7.7 billion \u2014 more than triple the same period last year.Ruth Porat, Alphabet\u2019s chief financial officer, said that increase reflected a \u201ccommitment to growth\u201d because the company had spent heavily on computing infrastructure, for both its own internal use and customer needs like Google Cloud \u2014 the unit that provides technology services to other companies.Alphabet\u2019s expenses rose 27 percent in the quarter. Ms. Porat said the heaviest spending came from research and development costs \u2014 mainly the hiring of additional technical staff. The company said its total employees had increased to 85,050 from 73,992 in the same period a year ago.Over all, Alphabet said its net income rose 73 percent, to $9.4 billion, from the same period a year earlier, boosted in part by an increase in the value of its outside investments. Revenue rose 26 percent to $31.1 billion.Ms. Porat also pointed out an increase in spending for advertising to promote newer products including Google\u2019s own hardware \u2014 a relatively new business manufacturing branded smartphones, laptops and smart speakers \u2014 and the company\u2019s artificially intelligent digital assistant.\u201cThey are thinking about their future,\u201d said Collin Colburn, an analyst at Forrester Research who focuses on search advertising. \u201cThey want to diversify beyond just advertising being such a big part of their business.\u201dStill, the search giant\u2019s core business showed no sign of slowing in the first quarter. Revenue from Google\u2019s advertising business, which includes ads shown on Google search and commercials running before YouTube videos, increased 24 percent during the quarter.However, Google\u2019s advertising profits were weighed down by an increase in traffic acquisition costs \u2014 the fees that it pays companies like Apple to make sure that its search engine is the default option when people open a browser on the iPhone.Also among the company\u2019s expenditures in the quarter: $2.4 billion to buy the Chelsea Market building in Manhattan, where the company had set up some of its New York offices.On a conference call with investment analysts, Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, avoided answering questions about the potential effects of new regulations concerning data privacy in Europe. The new law, which goes into effect on May 25, will restrict how companies like Google can collect, store and use personal data from users across Europe.Mr. Pichai said the company has been preparing for the law for more than 18 months, but didn\u2019t discuss how the new regulations may affect the company\u2019s bottom line.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Markets That Climbed the Trump Bump Are Tumbling Down From It", "Date": "2018-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Trump Bump is becoming the Trump Slump.In the first year of Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidency, ebullient investors propelled stock markets to one record high after another. And Mr. Trump was the bull in chief, celebrating the record-breaking march as validation of his economic policies.Those days are done.Even after a fast start to 2018, stock markets finished the first quarter down for the year \u2014 the first quarterly decline since 2015. It suggested that a period of calm and steadily rising markets had given way to a turbulent new era with a bearish bent.The plunge continued Monday, with the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index sinking 2.2 percent. Investors jettisoned shares of financial, technology and many other businesses, spooked at least in part by a tweet from Mr. Trump aimed at one of the country\u2019s biggest companies: Amazon.Monday\u2019s decline left stocks down more than 4 percent so far in 2018. They are now down more than 10 percent from their peak in late January. That means the market has entered a so-called correction \u2014 a term used to indicate that the downward trend is more severe and lasting than simply a few days of bearish trading.The stock market is still up more than 20 percent since Nov. 8, 2016, the day Mr. Trump won the White House \u2014 a roller-coaster ride driven in part by expectations about what a Trump presidency could bring to Washington.At first, the prospect of Republicans controlling the White House and both houses of Congress thrilled investors. They anticipated a wave of regulatory rollbacks and the slashing of corporate and personal tax rates. Many of those dreams have been realized, culminating in Mr. Trump signing a huge tax cut into law in December. When the S.&P. 500 notched its high-water mark of 2872.87 on Jan. 26, it represented a roughly 325 percent increase since the bull market began in March 2009.But since February, a toxic stew of factors \u2014 many but certainly not all of them emanating from Washington \u2014 has polluted what had been the market\u2019s placidly rising waters. And there\u2019s little prospect of the messes dissipating anytime soon.First there was the risk that the economy might be growing too fast, which could prompt central banks to hike interest rates sooner than expected. Then there was the risk of a trade war ignited by the White House imposing tariffs on certain products, an action that quickly prompted countries like China to erect trade barriers of their own. Next came the threat of a government crackdown on technology companies, after revelations of their misuse of customer data.Monday\u2019s dose of unnerving news was a presidential tweet aimed at Amazon, which Mr. Trump accused of hurting the United States Postal Service. Mr. Trump\u2019s feud with the company has been going on sporadically since before he became president, but the onslaught has accelerated lately. On Monday, Mr. Trump tweeted that the Post Office loses money by working with Amazon \u201cand this will be changed.\u201dIn the face of these factors, the optimism of just two months ago has all but evaporated.\u201cIt certainly adds to uncertainty, and the market doesn\u2019t like uncertainty,\u201d said Ed Clissold, chief United States strategist at Ned Davis Research, a stock market research firm.One thing is clear: The days of calm markets marching steadily higher, shattering one record after another, are gone for now. That carries risks for Mr. Trump, who spent the first year of his presidency as a stock-market cheerleader but in recent months has been mostly silent about the market\u2019s gyrations.It also could be a danger for the United States economy. Academic research suggests that long-term market declines can rub off on consumers, leading them to feel less affluent and therefore spend less money. That is bad news for an economy that hinges largely on zesty consumer spending.The market\u2019s decline over the past two months has been broad based. Six of the 11 sectors included in the S.&P. 500 index are down more than 10 percent from the market high in late January.On any given day, a particular sector might be clobbered. One day it could be industrial companies such as Boeing or Caterpillar, which export lots of products and therefore could be harmed in a trade war. Another day could bring declines to technology companies like Facebook and Twitter, whose profits are vulnerable to tougher government regulation of social media networks. The next day it could be energy and financial companies, whose fortunes would be diminished if the economy slows.On Monday, just 13 stocks in the S.&P. 500 rose.The meat producer Tyson dropped more than 6 percent, after China imposed duties on pork and fruit from the United States in response to the tariffs that the Trump administration has imposed on products imported from China. China is one of Tyson\u2019s most important export markets. Lean hog futures \u2014 which reflect the anticipated prices of pig carcasses \u2014 were down 3.9 percent.After Mr. Trump\u2019s complaint about Amazon, it too, was a big loser, falling 5.2 percent. Other giant tech firms were sucked into the downdraft. Microsoft dropped 3 percent. Facebook tumbled 2.8 percent, bringing its year-to-date decline to 14.4 percent. And Intel dove 6 percent after a Bloomberg News report that Apple was planning to use its own chips in its computers instead of Intel processors.And Tesla, reeling amid doubts about its ability to churn out electric vehicles, tumbled more than 5 percent.The tech sector has been the epicenter of stock market pain in recent weeks, hurt by concerns about trade friction with China \u2014 a key market and supplier for tech firms \u2014 and fears of tighter government regulation. Even before Monday\u2019s fall, some $457 billion had been wiped off the sector\u2019s total market value.\u201cPeople think that tech is going to go from the Wild West to a much more regulated, scrutinized environment,\u201d said Dan Suzuki, an equity strategist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Even the shares of financial institutions \u2014 the companies that would most likely benefit from a looser regulatory environment favored by Republicans \u2014 have been battered. The sector dropped 2.1 percent Monday, with investors worried about an unfavorable lending environment.For markets, nothing is for sure. They could rebound mightily later this week and shake off jitters about a trade war. But some observers believe conditions may have to get worse before they can get better \u2014 and there could be more declines before that happens.\u201cIn order for the market to bottom, there probably has to be more consternation and more pessimism about the current environment,\u201d said Mr. Clissold, of Ned Davis Research.Advertisement"}
