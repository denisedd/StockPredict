{"Headline": "Key Dates to Watch in China-U.S. Trade Dispute: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Tuesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 The will-he-or-won\u2019t-he Trump trade policy\u2022 Will Google become the next target of privacy inquiries?The world needs a way to tell whether President Trump wants to pursue his combative trade policies.The Trump administration has in recent weeks announced a barrage of trade actions. First, Mr. Trump said he was imposing tariffs against steel and aluminum imports from a range of countries. Then came announcements of actions against China that included tariffs on a large number of products.Very few restrictions have come into effect, though. President Trump has allowed temporary exemptions to the steel and aluminum tariffs. The moves against China have to go through a public comment process before they can take place.Investors, executives and farmers who have concerns about the economic impact of the trade actions may like that little has so far happened. And they may hope that Mr. Trump uses the leeway he has under trade law to step back from his threats. But supporters of tougher trade policies will be watching closely to see if Mr. Trump actually carries them out.In the coming months, there are a number of important dates at which the Trump administration has to decide whether it wants to retreat, delay, negotiate, fight on or escalate. To help assess the stance of the United State in this trade standoff, DealBook has compiled these dates.Before looking ahead, it\u2019s important to note that the Trump administration has imposed new restrictions on some countries.Much remains up in the air, though.\u2014 Peter EavisOne of Wall Street\u2019s biggest (and nerdiest) contests is between Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. With each quarter\u2019s earnings, the banks disclose their return on equity, a number that shows the profitability of the equity capital they have deployed in their businesses.Goldman usually wins. From 2010 until 2017, Morgan Stanley\u2019s annual return on equity was stronger in only two of those eight years, and those two years were not good ones for Wall Street overall.A big test was going to be how these banks fared in unambiguously good conditions, like those that existed in the first quarter of this year, when trading activity was strong and the economic outlook bullish. Goldman\u2019s return on equity in the first quarter was 15.4 percent, compared to 14.9 percent for Morgan Stanley.In other words, Goldman clinched the bragging rights. But with some rounding, they both achieved a 15 percent return.\u2014 Peter EavisThe Wall Street firm reported record revenue and profit for the first quarter driven by a jump in trading and the new tax law.\u2022 Morgan Stanley reported profits of $2.58 billion, up 40 percent from a year ago. That also topped analysts\u2019 expectations of $2.2 billion in earnings, according to Thomson Reuters.\u2022 Earnings per share came in at $1.45, beating the $1.25 analysts had expected.\u2022 Revenues increased 13.7 percent to $11.08 billion. Analysts expected revenue of $10.36 billion.\u2022 Total trading revenue rose 26 percent to $4.40 billion.\u2022 Equity trading revenue increased to $2.6 billion, up 30 percent from a year ago\u2022 Fixed-income trading revenue rose 9 percent to $1.8 billion.\u2022 Fees from investment banking rose 7 percent to $1.51 billion.\u2022 Fees from advising on mergers and acquisitions gained 16 percent to $574 million.\u2022 Underwriting revenues rose 2 percent.\u2022 Wealth management revenues increased 8 percent to $2.37 billion.The I.M.F. numbers are just the latest highlighting the negative impact the $1.5 trillion in tax cuts could have on the fiscal outlook of the United States.Fact-check: Despite Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet, South Korea isn\u2019t in the TPP.Facebook has born the brunt of fury over the tech industry\u2019s practices, particularly after the Cambridge Analytica scandal shed light on how user data is shared. But another behemoth\u2019s practices could come under scrutiny, particularly if Democrats take back Congress in the midterm elections.Two years ago, Google altered its offerings in a way that makes it more vulnerable to data-sharing scrutiny. Advertisers using its DoubleClick system to target and measure ads could start anonymously combining web-tracking data (from \u201ccookies\u201d that follow users online) with potent Google information including search queries, location history, phone numbers and credit card information. Until then, Google had steadfastly kept that data separate.Justice Sonia Sotomayor said that Congress, rather than the Supreme Court, should settle the matter. But Chief Justice John Roberts said \u201cit would be very strange for us to tell Congress it ought to do something in any particular area.\u201dThe stakes: The case in question, South Dakota v. Wayfair, could upend a decades-old status quo in online retail \u2014 and bring states some much-needed revenue.More from Nathaniel Popper and Nicholas Confessore of the NYT:The goal of Cambridge Analytica\u2019s own coin offering? Raise money that would pay for the creation of a system to help people store and sell their online personal data to advertisers, Brittany Kaiser, a former Cambridge Analytica employee, said in an interview. The idea was to protect information from more or less what the firm did when it obtained the personal data of up to 87 million Facebook users.The tech flyaroundStock and bond markets are unpredictable, even in good times, so the helpful trading conditions this quarter may not last. What can Goldman\u2019s senior executives offer to persuade investors that the bank far more than a trading house? More explanations, perhaps \u2014 and time.\u201cI\u2019m proud of what we achieved at Yahoo. That said, we had a quickly decaying legacy business.

{"Headline": "Blockchain Will Be Theirs, Russian Spy Boasted at Conference", "Date": "2018-04-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Last year, representatives of 25 countries met in Tokyo to work on setting international standards for the blockchain, the technology that was introduced by the virtual currency Bitcoin and has ignited intense interest in corporate and government circles.Some of the technologists at the meeting of the International Standards Organization were surprised when they learned that the head of the Russian delegation, Grigory Marshalko, worked for the F.S.B., the intelligence agency that is the successor to the K.G.B.They were even more surprised when they asked the F.S.B. agent why the Russians were devoting such resources to the blockchain standards.\u201cLook, the internet belongs to the Americans \u2014 but blockchain will belong to us,\u201d he said, according to one delegate who was there. The Russian added that two other members of his country\u2019s four-person delegation to the conference also worked for the F.S.B.Another delegate who had a separate conversation with the head of the Russian group remembers a slightly different wording: \u201cThe internet belonged to America. The blockchain will belong to the Russians.\u201dBoth of the delegates who recounted their conversations did so on the condition of anonymity, because discussions at the International Standards Organization, or I.S.O., are supposed to be confidential. Neither the Russian organizations overseeing the delegation to the I.S.O. nor the Russian delegates responded to requests for comment.The sentiment expressed by the Russian delegate is as clear a sign as any of the significance that some governments are assigning to the blockchain \u2014 a technology that is now being applied to things as varied as financial trading and voting \u2014 and the degree to which it is becoming a subject of geopolitical battles.The Russian interest in the normally wonky technical sessions has caused concern among other delegations, who worry that individual countries could push standards that would make the security of the blockchain technology vulnerable to surveillance and attack.The I.S.O., based in Geneva, was created in 1947 to ensure that important technologies are built or measured in the same way all over the world. Over the years, it has created standards for food safety, film sensitivity and much more.Russia is not the only country sending high-powered delegations to the I.S.O. technical committee focusing on blockchain standards, which got its start last year. The 25 countries with committee delegations sent over 130 people to the last meeting to discuss matters like a common method for security. China sent officials from the finance ministry while the United States had delegates from IBM and Microsoft, according to participants.\u201cIt is a very sought-out technology today, because it really does create the foundation for the future that is coming,\u201d said Gilbert Verdian, the head of the British delegation working on blockchain standards at the I.S.O. and the founder of the company Quant Network. \u201cTo get behind it and back it now is going to put people at an advantage, either politically or economically.\u201dThe original blockchain is the shared database on which all Bitcoin transactions are recorded. It is kept by a distributed network of computers managed by many people, rather than one central authority. While there are now many virtual currencies, each with its own blockchain, there are also many government and corporate efforts looking at ways to use blockchain technology to securely record other kinds of data.There are still significant questions about whether the technology will live up to expectations \u2014 and few projects have proceeded beyond the pilot stage aside from virtual currency networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum.Within the young blockchain industry there is a widespread belief that the companies and countries that establish an early lead could guide the direction of the technology, for both commercial and national security purposes.Emma Channing, a lawyer who frequently works with blockchain start-ups, recently raised an alarm about the intrigue at the I.S.O. standards group.Ms. Channing said she was worried that countries that devote more resources to the process could successfully push their preferred cryptographic algorithms to be the standards, potentially creating so-called back doors that could be used in the future to spy on blockchain activity.\u201cIn the context of software it is the perfect Trojan,\u201d said Ms. Channing, a co-founder of the Satis Group, an American company that advises blockchain projects. \u201cIf something gets buried in it, these things will get adopted wholesale \u2014 and won\u2019t be questioned on the way in.\u201dMs. Channing recently emailed dozens of blockchain experts, trying to get them to volunteer as representatives to the I.S.O. delegations in their countries, so that the process does not become dominated by a few countries.The chairman of the I.S.O. blockchain committee, Craig Dunn, rejected the idea that any country could shape the process. While I.S.O. proceedings are generally confidential, new standards must go through many stages, with many rounds of voting \u2014 first with smaller working groups and then with full national delegations.\u201cThere has to be agreement and consensus across the member countries to take a standard forward,\u201d said Mr. Dunn, who is also the head of the Australian delegation to the committee.Another member of the Russian delegation, Alexey Urivskiy, told the Russian newspaper Vedomosti last year that the delegation at the I.S.O. committee was supposed to get Russian cryptographic algorithms into the standard. The Vedomosti article said that the head of the Russian I.S.O. delegation, Mr. Marshalko, was affiliated with the F.S.B.Russia is not the only country pushing hard on the blockchain. Many Chinese government offices have been public about their interest in taking advantage of the blockchain technology for tasks like tracking people and products moving through industrial supply chains.At the I.S.O. meetings last fall in Tokyo, the Chinese government sent one of the largest delegations, with at least nine people, including representatives from the finance ministry and the Chinese central bank, according to a delegate from another country who met the Chinese participants.The United States delegation was led at the last meeting by a Microsoft employee and included a delegate from IBM. Microsoft and IBM are two of the global companies that have pushed hardest to develop blockchain technology.At the first meeting of the I.S.O. blockchain group, the Russian delegation led a study group on security and privacy issues, which caused discomfort among some delegates from other countries, according to the two delegates who spoke to The New York Times. At a second meeting, oversight for these issues was transferred to a working group led by France.Mr. Verdian, the head of the British group, said lots of delegations were jockeying to get an edge on the new technology.\u201cIt will change how our society can operate, but at the same time, in harnessing this technology people might want to leverage that for their own gain,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all owe it to each other to do it right so that it benefits all of us rather than a few.\u201dOleg Matsnev contributed reporting from Moscow.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In This Space Race, Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk Are Competing to Take You There", "Date": "2018-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionLaunch Pad 39A, just north of Cape Canaveral, Fla., was the storied site where America\u2019s space dreams and the imaginations of its youth were sent soaring. The first manned mission to the moon blasted off from there in 1969, as did the last, in 1972; so did the first space shuttle mission, in 1981, and the last, in 2011. But by 2013, with the shuttle program grounded and America\u2019s half century of space aspirations having ended with bangs and whimpers, 39A was rusting away and weeds were growing through its flame trench. A crippled NASA was eager to sell it.The space agency knew there was a natural customer: Elon Musk, the cheeky PayPal co-founder and Tesla creator whose SpaceX venture had become the first private rocket company to launch into orbit with a payload. Musk\u2019s mesmerizing style \u2014 skittering on the border between visionary and eccentric \u2014 made it seem at times that his obsession with space travel involved a desire to return to some celestial home, but his Falcon rockets had won NASA\u2019s respect. Surprisingly, a second bidder emerged: Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, who pursued his passion for all things, including space travel, with an awesome talent for being both exuberant and methodical. His company, Blue Origin, was building a reusable launch vehicle that, among other things, planned to take tourists into space.Musk won the bidding for Launch Pad 39A, but a few months later Bezos bought the nearby Launch Complex 36, from which missions to fly by Mars and Venus had been launched. The transfer of these hallowed pads represented, both symbolically and in practice, John F. Kennedy\u2019s torch of space exploration being passed from government to the private sector \u2014 from a once-glorious but now sclerotic federal agency to a new breed of boyish billionaires who embodied the daring passion and imagination of history\u2019s great pioneers, adventurers and innovators.Two new books chronicle this fascinating transition. \u201cThe Space Barons,\u201d by Christian Davenport, a Washington Post reporter, is an exciting narrative filled with colorful reporting and sharp insights. The book sparkles because of Davenport\u2019s access to the main players and his talent for crisp storytelling. \u201cRocket Billionaires,\u201d by Tim Fernholz, a reporter for Quartz, is not quite as vibrant a narrative and lacks some of Davenport\u2019s memorable scenes, but it provides smart analysis of the New Space sector as well as historical context about NASA\u2019s triumphs and failures.In the class that I teach on the history of the digital revolution, the students discuss whether innovation is driven more by big government projects or by nimble entrepreneurs. The answer, of course, is that it usually involves a symbiotic mix, like the semiconductor industry, which arose out of the Pentagon and NASA\u2019s need to put guidance systems in the nose cones of rockets. Vannevar Bush was the dean of engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a co-founder of Raytheon, and oversaw the government science programs that resulted in the atom bomb and electronic computer. He wrote a seminal paper in 1945, called \u201cScience \u2014 the Endless Frontier,\u201d which described how a collaboration of all three sectors he had been part of \u2014 academia, business and government \u2014 would drive innovation. Government funding of basic research in university labs would lead to discoveries in fundamental science that would be the \u201cseed\u201d for future inventions.Many innovations have progressed along that path. The ENIAC computer funded by the United States Army and built at the University of Pennsylvania was the genesis for UNIVAC and then most other electronic computers. The network funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and designed by a consortium of academic and private labs led eventually to today\u2019s internet. The National Science Foundation, started based on Vannevar Bush\u2019s paper, created a multiagency Digital Library Initiative that funded the academic research of Larry Page and Sergey Brin, which led to Google. The sequencing of the human genome, largely funded by the National Institutes of Health, planted the seeds for the biotech industry.Now space endeavors are following this \u201cinnovation progression,\u201d as we can call it. \u201cJust as Darpa served as the initial impetus for the internet and underwrote a lot of the costs of developing the internet in the beginning, it may be the case that NASA has essentially done the same thing by spending the money to build sort of fundamental technologies,\u201d Musk said a year after launching SpaceX. \u201cOnce we can bring the sort of commercial, free enterprise sector into it, then we can see the dramatic acceleration that we saw in the internet.\u201dOne of the first private pioneers was Burt Rutan, a mutton-chopped aircraft designer who regarded NASA as a bloated and unimaginative bureaucracy and in 1982 founded a company called Scaled Composites that designed aircraft so innovative that, as Davenport writes, \u201cit was as if his inspiration came not just from the laws of aerodynamics but from Picasso.\u201d One of his ideas was for a manned aircraft that could reach the edge of space and then fold its wings upward to act as a feather allowing the craft to re-enter the earth\u2019s atmosphere, land on a runway, and be reused. It would become his entry in the Ansari X Prize, which offered $10 million for the first private company that could launch a reusable vehicle to space twice within two weeks.Rutan attracted two billionaire partners. The first was the Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, who as a schoolboy in Seattle yearned to become an astronaut but, being nearsighted, realized that was impossible so spent his time coding in the school\u2019s computer room with his friend Bill Gates. Rutan\u2019s second partner was the toothy goldilocked Richard Branson, a thrill-addicted serial adventurer and entrepreneur who was as enthusiastic about publicity as Allen was averse to it. Branson\u2019s personal motto for his company, Virgin, was \u201cScrew it, let\u2019s do it,\u201d which was no longer a guiding principle at NASA, and he created Virgin Galactic with the goal of taking tourists into space. \u201cPaul, isn\u2019t this better than the best sex you ever had?\u201d Branson asked Allen during one test flight as the spaceship climbed higher.In 2004, Rutan\u2019s craft (with a Virgin logo on its tail) flew twice to space and back to win the X Prize. At the celebration, Rutan took a shot at NASA. \u201cI was thinking a little bit about that other space agency, the big guys,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they\u2019re looking at each other now and saying, \u2018We\u2019re screwed.\u2019\u201d Branson began selling tickets at prices that started at $200,000 to those who wanted to ride in a similar plane he began building, the launch date of which always seems to be about a year away.Elon Musk\u2019s love of adventure came partly from his maternal grandfather, an accomplished amateur pilot in South Africa who in 1952 completed a 22,000-mile journey across the globe with no electronic instruments. Musk founded SpaceX in 2002 with the eventual goal of colonizing Mars. \u201cThe more Musk studied, the more he realized that there had been very little advancement in rocket technology in the past 40 years,\u201d Davenport writes. \u201cTo a self-made Silicon Valley tech entrepreneur, this was stunning.\u201d His company\u2019s mantra was, \u201cSet audacious, nearly impossible goals and don\u2019t get dissuaded.\u201dMusk\u2019s entrepreneurship had a social purpose. SpaceX, Tesla, his electric car company, and SolarCity, his renewable energy company, Fernholz writes, \u201cwere explicitly intended to further human civilization.\u201d Along the way, he developed a cultlike following. When SpaceX managed to launch a space capsule into orbit and dock it at the International Space Station in 2012, something NASA could no longer do on its own, the employees at his headquarters broke into a chant, \u201cWe love Elon!\u201dBezos was likewise inspired by his own maternal grandfather. Lawrence Preston Gise, an upright but loving naval commander, helped develop the hydrogen bomb during a stint at the Atomic Energy Commission and then retired to his sprawling Texas ranch to enjoy his family \u2014 and in particular his insatiably curious little grandson with very big ears, smile and laugh. Bezos\u2019 passion for space began when he was 5 and he watched with his family the launch of Apollo 11, the manned moon mission commanded by Neil Armstrong. \u201cIt really was a seminal moment for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember watching it on our living room TV, and the excitement of my parents and my grandparents. Little kids can pick up that kind of excitement.\u201dBezos spent every summer at his grandfather\u2019s ranch, where he fixed windmills, castrated cattle and geeked out on the tiny county library\u2019s surprisingly large sci-fi collection. His high school valedictorian speech was about space: how to colonize planets, build space hotels and save our fragile planet. \u201cSpace, the final frontier, meet me there!\u201d he concluded.When Bezos founded Blue Origin in 2000, naming it after that pale blue planet where humans originated, he called upon one of his favorite science fiction writers, Neal Stephenson, to be an adviser. They kicked around wildly novel ideas, such as using a bullwhip-like device to propel objects into space. Eventually Bezos focused on reusable rockets. \u201cHow is the situation in the year 2000 different from 1960?\u201d Stephenson asked him. \u201cWhat\u2019s different is computer sensors, cameras, software. Being able to land vertically is the kind of problem that can be addressed by those technologies that existed in 2000 that didn\u2019t exist in 1960.\u201dBezos began putting together a huge tract of ranch land in Texas where he could build his reusable rockets in secret. One of the great scenes in Davenport\u2019s book is the description of the helicopter trip Bezos took to find the land, which ended with a terrifying crash. He survived, and it conditioned him to the fact that flying machines sometimes fail. Among Bezos\u2019 many strengths is to be exuberant patiently, to have a long-term horizon, as he has done at Amazon. At his Texas ranch, he has begun construction of a 10,000-year \u201cClock of the Long Now\u201d designed by the futurist Danny Hillis, which has a century hand that advances every hundred years and a cuckoo that comes out every millennium. In the mission statement for his space company, he wrote, \u201cBlue will pursue this long-term objective patiently, step by step.\u201d As Elon Musk pushed forward with very public fits and starts, Bezos advised his team, \u201cBe the tortoise and not the hare.\u201dAt the end of 2015, within a month of each other, Musk and Bezos both launched rockets that returned safely to earth and were reusable. For the moment, Musk the hare had darted ahead: His powerful Falcon 9 rocket had lifted a payload into orbit, whereas Bezos\u2019 smaller New Shepard craft had merely gone up into the edge of space and returned. But as happens with scrappy entrepreneurial business competitors, in contrast to government bureaucracies, Bezos and Musk were goading each other on. And unlike the race between the tortoise and the hare, they can both triumph \u2014 as can, one hopes, Richard Branson and others.Indeed, even NASA and its big corporate contractor, the United Launch Alliance, a venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing, can come out winners from competition. As is often the case with the innovation progression, the greatest technological advances come when a symbiosis is reached that combines the resources of a visionary government and the scrappiness of risk-taking entrepreneurs, each spurring the other onward and upward.Walter Isaacson is a professor of history at Tulane.

{"Headline": "I Wrote the Uber Memo. This Is How to End Sexual Harassment.", "Date": "2018-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMs. Fowler\u00a0is an engineer best known for her blog post about her experiences working at Uber.If the news over the past year has taught us anything, it\u2019s that discrimination, sexual harassment and retaliation are pervasive in nearly every industry.From the systemic culture of sexual harassment and discrimination at Uber to the ubiquitous stories of women taken advantage of at Fox News to the tales of harassment in industries ranging from professional football to restaurants, we\u2019ve seen one company after another publicly outed and shamed for illegal treatment of employees. The question is no longer whether egregious mistreatment actually occurs, nor whether it is limited to a few bad companies and industries, but what we can do to ensure that it never happens again.Amid all the questions about where #MeToo goes next, there\u2019s at least one answer that everyone should support, one backed by bipartisan legislation currently sitting in Congress, simply awaiting a vote: We need to end the practice of forced arbitration, a legal loophole companies use to cover up their illegal treatment of employees.Discrimination, harassment and retaliation are illegal under federal and state laws. But they are not criminal offenses, so the process of obtaining justice must go through civil court. If, for example, you found yourself experiencing racial discrimination at your workplace and your workplace did nothing to fix the problem, you could publicly sue your employer in a court of law and \u2014 presumably \u2014 justice would be carried out.Not all people want their lawsuit to play out in court. Sometimes victims of harassment and discrimination want privacy; sometimes corporations want to keep the ugly details of workplace disputes out of the public eye. For these cases, there is another avenue for obtaining justice: private arbitration. When the parties to a lawsuit decide to go to arbitration rather than a court of law, they meet with an arbitrator (usually a retired judge, and someone they both have decided to use), present their cases and then accept the judgment handed down. That is, ideally, how arbitration works.Forced arbitration has become a standard practice for a variety of reasons. The dominant view is that it helps manage long-term legal risk, ensuring that companies won\u2019t become embroiled in costly, drawn-out lawsuits. The examples of Uber and I.B.M. show that the opposite is true: Forced arbitration leads to long-term operating risk. Forcing legal disputes about discrimination, harassment and retaliation to go through secret arbitration proceedings hides the behavior and allows it to become culturally entrenched.Before us lie three possible options for putting an end to this practice. The first is to leave it to individual companies and allow them to choose not to force their employees to sign away their constitutional rights. Microsoft has taken the lead on this and has stopped using arbitration agreements in cases of sexual harassment. As hopeful as this option might sound, leaving it up to individual companies is not likely to change the industry: The good companies will elect to ban arbitration agreements, while the bad companies will continue to use them and continue to mistreat their employees.This leaves us a third and final option: legislation. Promising progress is being made at the state level. Several measures were recently passed in the state of Washington, including one that will prohibit companies from using forced arbitration agreements to keep victims from reporting sexual assault and sexual harassment to authorities; in California, Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez Fletcher plans to propose a measure that would prohibit employers from making forced arbitration a condition of employment.We could be making progress at the federal level, too. Last year, Representative Cheri Bustos of Illinois and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York introduced the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Harassment Act of 2017, which would ban the use of forced arbitration in cases of sexual harassment and discrimination. The bill has bipartisan support. Senators and members of the House are now waiting to vote on it. Even if this bill is passed, it will be only the beginning: We must demand that our federal and state legislatures pass laws that ban forced arbitration in all cases of discrimination and harassment.There are real questions about where #MeToo goes next \u2014 how it maintains momentum, how it can go beyond individuals losing their jobs and companies issuing public statements to create real, lasting change in our workplaces. Not all of them have easy answers. But there is at least one clear, tangible step that everyone who supports ending discrimination, harassment and retaliation in the workplace can take: Support the elimination of forced arbitration.Susan Fowler is a writer and former engineer at Uber.Advertisement"}

Its promise instead lies in caffeinated beverages and in the company\u2019s potential for growth in the rest of the United States.\u201cCoffee is the major driver \u2014 it\u2019s a daily purchase, it\u2019s habit-forming, and it\u2019s got a 90 percent margin,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s an enormous opportunity for them to add franchisees west of the Mississippi.\u201dWix, for its part, is known as a website builder for small businesses. Mr. Bonavico said he and Mr. Broad believe the company has a better strategy than competitors like Squarespace and GoDaddy.\u201cWix has zero salespeople \u2014 they compete only on the quality of the product,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re the only one using the freemium model.\u201d Wix customers can pay nothing for basic service or pay up for more features.The Jackson Square fund officially began in 2016, two years after Mr. Bonavico and Mr. Broad and several colleagues formed their own firm, Jackson Square Partners. Mr. Bonavico and Mr. Broad previously managed the Delaware Smid Cap Growth fund, starting in 2005 and continuing through 2016.Betting on Big ThemesAmong those themes are cloud computing, big data and sustainable energy. To winnow the many outfits clambering in these fields, Mr. Lippert will assess the durability of a company\u2019s competitive advantage and the quality of its management, in addition to its fundamentals.That led him to a stock that some investors might dismiss as a laggard \u2014 Microsoft. Mr. Lippert said Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, Satya Nadella, who took over in 2014, has reoriented the company by focusing on cloud computing and artificial intelligence. \u201cMicrosoft used to just sell you Office,\u201d he said. Today, thanks to its software-as-a-service approach, the company knows how customers are using its products and can continuously update and personalize them.Tesla is trying to optimize and control every phase of its electric-car production, he said, and that\u2019s both potentially revolutionary and extremely challenging, Mr. Lippert said. \u201cPeople understand that, but they aren\u2019t giving them room to do it.\u201dMr. Lippert\u2019s fund, with an expense ratio of 1.41 percent for its retail shares, returned 9.2 percent in the first quarter.Bulking up with Brazil \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting about Brazil is, when you compare it to any other major market in the world, it\u2019s the only one on its own economic cycle,\u201d he said. \u201cThey went through their own depression, and they\u2019ve just emerged from that. All economic data is signaling they\u2019re past the worst.\u201dThroughout Latin America, Mr. Pruett said, banks tend to be family-controlled and operated, which typically aligns their interests with those of outside shareholders. On top of that, \u201cMarkets are concentrated, and the penetration of financial services is low,\u201d he said.Consider Peru, home to one of his top holdings, Credicorp, a major bank in a country with 31 million people and an economy growing at 6 percent a year. It is one of four banks that dominate the country\u2019s financial system.\u201cThey each have about a quarter of the market,\u201d Mr. Pruett said. \u201cMargins are high.\u201dInvestors have noticed, pushing Credicorp\u2019s stock up nearly 50 percent over the last year. \u201cThe banks in Latin America are long-term winners.\u201dMr. Pruett\u2019s fund, with an expense ratio of 1.09 percent, returned 10.5 percent in the first quarter.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018The Business of War\u2019: Google Employees Protest Work for the Pentagon", "Date": "2018-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Thousands of Google employees, including dozens of senior engineers, have signed a letter protesting the company\u2019s involvement in a Pentagon program that uses artificial intelligence to interpret video imagery and could be used to improve the targeting of drone strikes.The letter, which is circulating inside Google and has garnered more than 3,100 signatures, reflects a culture clash between Silicon Valley and the federal government that is likely to intensify as cutting-edge artificial intelligence is increasingly employed for military purposes.\u201cWe believe that Google should not be in the business of war,\u201d says the letter, addressed to Sundar Pichai, the company\u2019s chief executive. It asks that Google pull out of Project Maven, a Pentagon pilot program, and announce a policy that it will not \u201cever build warfare technology.\u201dThat kind of idealistic stance, while certainly not shared by all Google employees, comes naturally to a company whose motto is \u201cDon\u2019t be evil,\u201d a phrase invoked in the protest letter. But it is distinctly foreign to Washington\u2019s massive defense industry and certainly to the Pentagon, where the defense secretary, Jim Mattis, has often said a central goal is to increase the \u201clethality\u201d of the United States military.Google employees have circulated protest petitions on a range of issues, including Google Plus, the company\u2019s lagging competitor to Facebook, and Google\u2019s sponsorship of the Conservative Political Action Conference.Employees raised questions about Google\u2019s involvement in Project Maven at a recent companywide meeting. At the time, Diane Greene, who leads Google\u2019s cloud infrastructure business, defended the deal and sought to reassure concerned employees. A company spokesman said most of the signatures on the protest letter had been collected before the company had an opportunity to explain the situation.But improved analysis of drone video could be used to pick out human targets for strikes, while also better identifying civilians to reduce the accidental killing of innocent people.Without referring directly to the letter to Mr. Pichai, Google said in a statement on Tuesday that \u201cany military use of machine learning naturally raises valid concerns.\u201d It added, \u201cWe\u2019re actively engaged across the company in a comprehensive discussion of this important topic.\u201d The company called such exchanges \u201chugely important and beneficial,\u201d though several Google employees familiar with the letter would speak of it only on the condition of anonymity, saying they were concerned about retaliation.The statement said the company\u2019s part of Project Maven was \u201cspecifically scoped to be for non-offensive purposes,\u201d though officials declined to make available the relevant contract language. The Defense Department said that because Google is a subcontractor on Project Maven to the prime contractor, ECS Federal, it could not provide either the amount or the language of Google\u2019s contract. ECS Federal did not respond to inquiries.Google said the Pentagon was using \u201copen-source object recognition software available to any Google Cloud customer\u201d and based on unclassified data. \u201cThe technology is used to flag images for human review and is intended to save lives and save people from having to do highly tedious work,\u201d the company said.An uneasiness about military contracts among a small fraction of Google\u2019s more than 70,000 employees may not pose a major obstacle to the company\u2019s growth. But in the rarefied area of artificial intelligence research, Google is engaged in intense competition with other tech companies for the most talented people, so recruiters could be hampered if some candidates are put off by Google\u2019s defense connections.The employees\u2019 protest letter to Mr. Pichai, which has been circulated on an internal communications system for several weeks, argues that embracing military work could backfire by alienating customers and potential recruits.\u201cThis plan will irreparably damage Google\u2019s brand and its ability to compete for talent,\u201d the letter says. \u201cAmid growing fears of biased and weaponized AI, Google is already struggling to keep the public\u2019s trust.\u201d It suggests that Google risks being viewed as joining the ranks of big defense contractors like Raytheon, General Dynamics and the big-data firm Palantir.Like other onetime upstarts turned powerful Silicon Valley behemoths, Google is being forced to confront the idealism that guided the company in its early years. Facebook started with the lofty mission of connecting people all over the world, but it has recently come under fire for becoming a conduit for fake news and being used by Russia to influence the 2016 election and sow dissent among American voters.Paul Scharre, a former Pentagon official and author of \u201cArmy of None,\u201d a forthcoming book on the use of artificial intelligence to build autonomous weapons, said the clash inside Google was inevitable, given the company\u2019s history and the booming demand for A.I. in the military.\u201cThere\u2019s a strong libertarian ethos among tech folks, and a wariness about the government\u2019s use of technology,\u201d said Mr. Scharre, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security in Washington. \u201cNow A.I. is suddenly and quite quickly moving out of the research lab and into real life.\u201dScott Shane reported from Washington, and Daisuke Wakabayashi from San Francisco.

{"Headline": "How Shipping Costs Have Put Amazon in a Bind: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Good Friday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Does Amazon have its shipping costs under control?\u2022 What will come out of the Merkel-Trump meeting?\u2022 Why Deutsche Bank was so late to make necessary cuts.\u2022 More complaints have emerged about NBC News\u2019s response to harassment allegations.Amazon\u2019s shipping costs have suddenly become a hot subject, not just to President Trump, but also to the 100 million people who have Amazon Prime.Higher shipping costs are a reason Amazon is raising the cost of Prime membership to $119 a year from $99.But a 20 percent hike is a lot for even a popular service, and it could turn customers off. So why did Amazon do it? The e-commerce giant\u2019s results provide some clues.Members of Prime get free shipping, though their membership fees partially pay for that perk. As the Prime program covers more goods, it\u2019s getting more expensive for Amazon. \u201cOur two-day shipping, it\u2019s now available on over 100 million items, up from 20 million as recently as 2014,\u201d Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon\u2019s C.F.O., said on a conference call Thursday when announcing the increase in the Prime membership fee.The cost pressures from shipping are getting uncomfortable for Amazon. Worldwide shipping costs totaled $6.1 billion in the first quarter of this year, equivalent to 22.5 percent of Amazon\u2019s sales from its online stores during the period. That\u2019s up from 2017, when quarterly shipping costs averaged 19.9 percent of online sales. By bringing shipping costs back down to 20 percent of online sales, Amazon could, in theory, save over $2.5 billion a year (2.5 percent of annualized first-quarter sales comes to roughly $2.8 billion.)To save money, Amazon could offer free shipping on fewer goods, but that could undermine the company\u2019s efforts to bolster sales. And Amazon doesn\u2019t need to do that if it can increase its Prime fees, to help recoup the higher shipping costs. But the fee increase may not be enough. Charging 100 million Prime members an extra $20 per year, in theory, raises \u201conly\u201c $2 billion.- Peter EavisMore on her challenge, from the NYT:Few leaders seem less personally in sync with Mr. Trump than Ms. Merkel. Estranged by widely diverging temperaments and leadership styles, the two leaders have also clashed on substance \u2014 from climate change and military spending to Germany\u2019s chronic, yawning trade surplus with the United States, a particular bugbear of the president.Or as a former State Department official told the NYT, \u201cMerkel is going to Washington and it looks like the U.S. just doesn\u2019t care.\u201d But a foreign relations expert said, \u201cNever underestimate Merkel.\u201dA combination of the two companies would complete one of the telecommunications industry\u2019s most long-awaited transactions and would create the third-largest wireless carrier in the United States, with more than 127 million customers. Sprint and T-Mobile have tried to negotiate a merger twice before.Analysts have argued, and Sprint and T-Mobile themselves have acknowledged, that the companies need greater scale and more resources to better compete against the industry\u2019s leaders, Verizon and AT&T.Should the deal be completed, only three companies would dominate the market in the United States for cellphone service. It is unclear whether the transaction would get regulatory approval. A previous round of merger talks ended in 2014, having drawn strong opposition from the Obama administration.\u2014 Michael de la MercedWhat Mr. Ubben had to say: \u201cThe management and board of FOX has done a superb job of steering the company through a time of transition for the entertainment industry.\u201dWhat Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch had to say: \u201cJeff has been an important partner during a transformational period. Our board and, ultimately, our shareholders, have benefited enormously from his many contributions.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la Merced\u2022 Nonresidential fixed investment \u2014 what businesses spend on equipment, software, buildings and intellectual property \u2014 increased at a solid 6.1 percent.\u2022 Business spending on equipment climbed 4.7 percent, down from 11.6 percent in the fourth quarter.Bigger pictureEconomists on Wall Street and in Washington have repeatedly warned that the economy\u2019s upward streak is unlikely to extend beyond the next year or two.Over the longer term, the Fed expects real annual growth in the United States to fall to 1.8 percent. The Congressional Budget Office\u2019s 10-year outlook comes to the same disappointing conclusion.The nation\u2019s debt has topped $21 trillion and is growing, a level many view as unsustainable. And if the Federal Reserve follows through on its plan to raise interest rates, the cost of paying off that debt will grow larger.\u2022 Hubris: Unlike rivals, Deutsche Bank didn\u2019t raise capital after the financial crisis, ultimately leaving it significantly weaker. By the end of last year, its tangible equity capital ratio was still below JPMorgan Chase in 2011. (Perhaps Germany\u2019s banking regulator should have applied more pressure, as Switzerland\u2019s did.)\u2022 Fear: Did Deutsche Bank\u2019s leaders worry about scaling back the investment bank because of its huge importance for revenue? (Last year, it provided 54 percent.) And about the cost of unwinding some trades?The news organization asserted that the complaints that led to Matt Lauer being ousted from the \u201cToday\u201d show were the first of their kind. Others disagree:What NBC News has done: Brought in a consultant for in-person sexual harassment prevention seminars and pledged to share the results of an internal review.The online video giant has largely avoided the political heat that has burned Facebook, but it has still lurched from crisis to crisis, particularly over upsetting videos.The idea is that someday humans will be able to train the machines, in a similar manner, to sniff out misinformation, smut, and abuse.Sure, there\u2019s logic to it, in the face of the threat from Netflix and Amazon. But as the two companies continue to bicker over price and executive chairs, is there another reason Shari Redstone is pushing the idea so hard, when other CBS shareholders seem uninterested?What seems to be driving Shari Redstone is familial score-settling, a quest for victory over her father, who never wanted her to have a role in either Viacom or CBS. \u201cIt\u2019s the story of a person who was mistreated by her father,\u201d said the source who recently noted Sumner\u2019s physical condition, and has known the father and daughter for an extensive period of time.Advertisement"}

Even some of Bill Gates\u2019s billions are in on the action.\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have imagined that it would become what it is,\u201d said Mr. Guzzo, 42, who writes about the area\u2019s history, among other topics, for The Tampa Bay Times. \u201cThere\u2019s stuff to do downtown. There are people there 24 hours a day. That\u2019s the difference.\u201dA forecast by Dodge Data & Analytics predicts that $13 billion will be spent on development in the Tampa Bay area \u2014 which includes Tampa, Clearwater and St. Petersburg \u2014 through 2022. That figure, for both new construction and renovations, includes apartments, condos and commercial and institutional buildings.The 42-acre development, scheduled for completion in 2027, will comprise 17 buildings, including two new hotels and the renovation of a third, as well as restaurants and rooftop bars, one million square feet of cultural and retail space, 3,500 residential units and an \u201cinnovation hub.\u201d It will also include two million square feet of office space in what will be the first new office towers here in almost 25 years, according to the developer.Already under construction in the Water Street development is the University of South Florida\u2019s Morsani College of Medicine and Heart Institute, a 325,000-square-foot facility that is set to open next year.\u201cWe\u2019re filling the hole in the middle of the doughnut,\u201d said James Nozar, Strategic Property Partners\u2019 chief executive, referring to the Water Street project\u2019s position in a sparsely developed area in the heart of the city, which includes Amalie Arena, home of the Lightning. One of the aims of the project, he said, is to \u201creconnect downtown to the waterfront.\u201dTo support the outside investment, officials from Tampa and Hillsborough County have agreed to split the roughly $100 million cost of a revamped street grid in and around the Water Street project. Planned improvements include new parks, sidewalks, storm drains, underground utility and communications pathways, as well as lines connected to a cooling plant that will provide chilled water to the air conditioning systems of the buildings.The streets are being designed with driverless cars in mind and parking structures that could be converted to other uses. Renderings of the project show wide, verdant sidewalks, with bustling businesses, cafes, shade trees and children running through fountains. The developer estimated that 23,000 people will fill the Water Street area every day, as residents, visitors or workers.\u201cI\u2019ve been dreaming of this for a long time,\u201d said Bob Buckhorn, who has been Tampa\u2019s mayor since 2011. \u201cWe\u2019ve changed our economic DNA. I knew that if we were going to invest in intellectual capital, we had to create a built environment and an urban core that was attractive to young people, which meant completely transforming downtown Tampa on the waterfront.\u201dThere was much that needed changing. Tampa, incorporated in 1849, was long known for little more than phosphate mining, cigar factories, mobsters and corrupt politicians. It was sometimes derisively referred to as Sin City or Little Chicago.There was an extensive streetcar system beginning in the 1890s, and the city erected its first skyscrapers in the 1920s, said Gary Mormino, a former professor of history at the University of South Florida. But by the late 1950s, he said, the city center had gone into a \u201cdeath spiral.\u201dMr. Mormino recalled walking around the Channelside area just east of downtown in the early 1980s and seeing a \u201cdeserted\u201d landscape that was populated by jack rabbits and home to abandoned shipping wharves and a dilapidated cast-iron drawbridge.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on now is on a very different level,\u201d Mr. Mormino said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s on steroids. It\u2019s pretty dramatic.\u201dCity and county officials hope to attract companies in the high-tech, financial and creative sectors to fill the new space, not only downtown but elsewhere in the area. In the last three years, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Johnson & Johnson, Amgen, Ashley Furniture and Bertram Yachts have opened offices or other facilities here.\u201cThis whole area has gone through a transformation,\u201d said Noah Breakstone, a managing partner at BTI Partners, a developer based in Fort Lauderdale. BTI is planning the $400 million Westshore Marina District, a 52-acre waterfront project in Tampa on long-vacant industrial land.\u201cTampa presented a strong opportunity for us,\u201d Mr. Breakstone said. \u201cIt has a lot of dynamics similar to what Miami had in terms of its ability to grow, but Miami is now out of land. Tampa still has available land on the waterfront \u2014 a really limited commodity in most places.\u201dPlans for the Westshore Marina District call for hundreds of townhouses and condominiums, as well as restaurants and stores. Its crown jewel, the developer said, will be Marina Pointe, a complex with a 150-slip marina, the largest in Tampa, and three 16-story towers designed by the Miami architect Kobi Karp, each with 110 condominiums.Three other South Florida developers, the Related Group, Lennar Corporation and the Bainbridge Companies, have purchased parcels from BTI in the Westshore site for their own residential developments. Related, a major Miami-based developer, has several other residential projects in the works in Tampa and St. Petersburg, including the rebuilding of Tampa\u2019s oldest public housing site into a $350 million development with 1,636 mixed-income units and 177,000 square feet of commercial space.To the east of the Westshore Marina District, the New York developer Bromley Companies is planning a mixed-use, 1.8-million-square-foot project called Midtown Tampa at a cost of more than $400 million. In its announcement last month, the developer said that it would include 750,000 square feet of office space, 400 apartments or condominiums, a 225-room hotel and 240,000 square feet of retail and entertainment space.The Tampa Bay area, which has a combined population of about three million, ranked fourth in the nation in terms of growth in 2016, when some 58,000 people became residents, according to the Census Bureau. Officials here note that Zillow Research last month named Tampa the top market in the United States for first-time home buyers.From 2012 to 2016, about 148,000 jobs were created in the area, said Craig J. Richard, the chief executive of the Tampa Hillsborough Economic Development Corporation. Tampa, he added, has long labored under an inferiority complex.\u201cWe just plod along as a happy little town, but we don\u2019t know how good we really are,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got housing affordability, sports teams, museums, beaches, blue skies and palm trees. There are not a lot of places that can claim such a great quality of life.\u201dMr. Richard added that the market had been untapped for many years in terms of major construction, especially downtown. \u201cThe last thing you want to be, in terms of economic development, is a best-kept secret,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we\u2019ve managed to do that for decades.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Revenue rose 16 percent to $26.8 billion in the quarter, exceeding the Wall Street consensus forecast of nearly $25.8 billion.Microsoft\u2019s earnings per share increased 36 percent to 95 cents a share, well above the analysts\u2019 average estimate of 85 cents a share, compiled by Thomson Reuters.Since Satya Nadella became chief executive in 2014, the cloud portion of Microsoft\u2019s revenue has soared from 3 percent to more than 21 percent this year, according to estimates by Credit Suisse.Azure, the company\u2019s unit supplying cloud-based computer processing and storage, grew by 93 percent compared with the same quarter a year ago. Microsoft is now a strong No. 2, behind Amazon, in this market for the foundation layer of cloud technology. Microsoft finished 2017 with 13 percent of the cloud infrastructure services market, according to Synergy Research Group, a gain of three percentage points during the year.Microsoft\u2019s broader commercial cloud division, which includes Azure and customer and operations management software for corporations, grew by 58 percent.The cloud transition is changing the company\u2019s business model to one with a rising share of steady, recurring revenue from cloud subscriptions rather than traditional software sales. Including contributions from cloud-based versions of its Office productivity software and online gaming subscriptions, recurring revenue streams now account for about 30 percent of Microsoft\u2019s sales, said Michael Nemeroff, an analyst at Credit Suisse.That share, Mr. Nemeroff estimates, could reach more than 50 percent in four years.The successful shift to the cloud and the subscription sales model has pleased investors. Microsoft\u2019s shares have climbed roughly 40 percent in the past year. The company\u2019s share price slipped by 1 percent in after-hours trading on Thursday, after gaining 2 percent during the regular session.Not long ago, Microsoft was considered a faded power among big tech companies. Today its stock market value, while behind Apple, is neck and neck with Amazon\u2019s and slightly ahead of Google\u2019s.The personal computer software business, once Microsoft\u2019s mainstay, has been eroding for years, as people spend more of their computing time on smartphones. But personal computer shipments have held steady recently as businesses replace old PCs with new ones that use the latest Microsoft operating system, Windows 10.The Windows PC operating system business is in a division Microsoft calls \u201cmore personal computing,\u201d which grew by 13 percent.

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 A \u2018Geneva Convention\u2019 for cyberwar?\u2022 Did Goldman\u2019s trading business perform too well?\u2022 The U.S.-China fight has pushed deeper into tech.Goldman Sachs\u2019s strong first-quarter earnings raise a familiar dilemma for the bank.The results got a significant fillip from trading, a business Goldman must do well in, but not so well that investors think the bank is too dependent on it. And a breakdown of first-quarter revenue shows the dominance of trading. Revenue from trading in stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities and derivatives totaled $4.39 billion during the first three months of the year. That works out at 44 percent of total revenue, well above the 37 percent share that trading had in 2017.Stock and bond markets are unpredictable, even in relatively good times, so the helpful trading conditions this quarter may not last. What can Goldman\u2019s senior executives do to persuade investors that the bank is a lot more than a trading shop? They can point to the fact that David M. Solomon is in line to succeed Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman\u2019s current C.E.O. Mr. Solomon ascent took place in the bank\u2019s powerful investment banking division, not its trading operations.Goldman\u2019s leaders can continue to talk about the steps the bank is taking to widen its client base and diversify into other businesses that might have more stable revenue, like its relatively new consumer lending operations. But such businesses are going to take time to make a meaningful contribution.And it\u2019s important to remember that other major businesses at Goldman are also volatile. Investing and lending, which mostly involves making longer-term investments in companies, and whose revenue can be unpredictable, made up 21 percent of total revenue in the first quarter, the second largest contribution.Despite the bumper results in trading along with investing and lending, Goldman\u2019s shares slid slightly on Tuesday, suggesting investors are waiting on longer-term trends than one quarter\u2019s results.But the volatility of revenue is not the only reason investors are often skeptical about Wall Street firms. The huge amounts that they pay out in compensation is also a concern. When revenue rises, so does pay. As a result, money that could have fallen to the bottom line at other types of companies instead gets paid out to traders and bankers. Compensation at Goldman Sachs made up 45 percent of non-interest revenue in the first quarter, up from 44 percent the first quarter of 2017.\u2014 Peter EavisHere are the numbers:The move comes amid an outcry prompted by the arrests of two African-American men at a Starbucks location in Philadelphia last week.The two men were arrested after asking to use the restroom in the shop.

{"Headline": "Thousands of Indian Women Find Their American Dreams in Jeopardy", "Date": "2018-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLIVERMORE, Calif. \u2014 For seven years, Deepika Jalakam sat at home. Bored, unfulfilled and dependent on her husband for every dime, she struggled with the notion that her professional life was doomed in the land of opportunity.So when the employment card arrived in the mail in 2015, Ms. Jalakam did what she often does when good fortune comes her way: She placed it before the gods in the Hindu shrine mounted in her kitchen cabinet, blessed it with a dab of red \u201ckum kum\u201d powder and recited a prayer of gratitude.Within weeks, Ms. Jalakam, who has a degree in biotechnology, landed a job as an analyst at an insurance company. The next year, she and her husband, Vinay Kumar, a software engineer, bought a house. In 2017, the finances of the Indian immigrant couple were secure enough that they decided to have a second child.\u201cWe were happily working and feeling settled down with the life we wanted. Suddenly, this announcement came and there is instability,\u201d said Ms. Jalakam, 32, who now finds herself worrying about everything from day-to-day spending to vacation plans.Across the country, thousands of Indian families are caught in a similar dilemma because of the outsized role that they play in the H-1B visa program.The annual visa scramble began this week, with applications delivered by the truckload to government processing centers. The petitions represent tens of thousands of foreigners vying for the opportunity to work in the United States for three years or longer.Many are Indian software engineers and computer programmers recruited by American technology companies that say they cannot find enough talent in this country. Among the applicants are Indian math and science teachers headed for rural schools, as well as physicians and other professionals.But the H-1B program has spawned controversy. During his campaign, President Trump invited Americans displaced by H-1B workers to his rallies. Since taking office, he has ordered the program\u2019s overhaul, and his administration has taken steps to tighten scrutiny of applications.Still, demand for the visas continues unabated. In 2018, for the sixth consecutive year, the federal government was so flooded with petitions it stopped accepting them within a week. On Friday, officials announced they had reached their annual cap within five days and would resort again to a computer lottery to select the targeted 85,000 recipients. Universities and research organizations are exempt from the cap.Nearly 365,000 H-1B petitions were approved in the 2017 fiscal year. This number includes first-time applications subject to the cap and renewals, which are not capped. Three-quarters of them went to Indian nationals.Their success has been a mixed blessing. Tens of thousands of Indians on the temporary visas were later sponsored by their employers to remain permanently in the United States, but their families are in limbo, stuck in a ballooning backlog of green cards that are approved but cannot yet be issued.While skilled workers from most countries receive permanent residency a year or two after applying, Indians must wait a decade or longer because of their large numbers. The delays have meant that until recently thousands of women, many highly educated, remained at home while their husbands worked.Children must also wait. If their family\u2019s green card is not approved before they turn 21, the children are no longer eligible for legal residency as dependents and must leave the country, though they may have spent much of their lives in the United States. The much-debated legal protection for so-called Dreamers, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, applies to children who entered the country illegally, not to the offspring of legal immigrants.\u201cI felt like I was free from a cage to fly in any direction I want,\u201d Ms. Jalakam said of her work authorization that year.Last fall\u2019s announcement that the temporary work program would soon be scrapped has energized Indian women. Many who had sunk money into property and other investments with earnings from their jobs took to Twitter, using #standwithh4ead and #saveh4ead to raise awareness of their plight.\u201cWe\u2019re determined to save our jobs,\u201d said Jansi Kumar of Seattle, a founder of a Facebook page started in December, \u201cSave H4EAD,\u201d which has attracted nearly 5,000 followers. In early February, about 500 Indians descended on Capitol Hill to press for a solution to the green card backlog. At a rally, they hoisted posters that read, \u201cLegal Immigrants Matter Too\u201d and \u201c#H4EAD Let Spouses Work.\u201dOn the other hand, a group of information technology workers who lost their jobs to imported workers has filed suit to overturn the spousal work authorization program. The Department of Homeland Security, the federal agency which oversees the program, said it was completing an economic analysis and was likely to render its decision in June.L. Francis Cissna, director of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, the Department of Homeland Security agency that issues the permits, said the Trump administration\u2019s priority was to protect American workers. \u201cThe reason there is a lot of concern about Americans being displaced is because it is happening,\u201d he said in a recent interview.\u201cTheir valued, long-term employees will choose to leave their companies for other employment opportunities in countries that allow these workers and their families to raise their standard of living,\u201d the council warned.Doug Rand, former assistant director for entrepreneurship in the Obama administration, said Indian immigrants have long been \u201cessential for American technological innovation\u201d and offering work permits to spouses makes sense. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for these outrageous backlogs, they would be Americans already,\u201d he said.The backlog that is creating the problem is a byproduct of immigration laws drafted decades ago.In 1965, Congress established that no country could receive more than 7 percent of green cards issued in a year. In 1990, it determined that only 140,000 employment-based green cards could be granted annually, and each family member requires a separate card.Then the rise of the tech sector created a surge in demand for workers. Indians had the skills that American companies prized, so employers turned to the nonimmigrant H-1B visa to import them. Down the road, companies chose to sponsor many of the visa holders for green cards, which because of the annual caps created the current backlog.In June 2015, the latest year for which official data is available, about 300,000 Indians, including spouses and children, were waiting for their permanent residency cards. Indians in the green-card process since 2008 are only now receiving them.\u201cNo one should be stuck waiting more than 10 years for a green card. It hurts employers and employees and their families,\u201d said Stephen Yale-Loehr, a professor of immigration law at Cornell Law School. \u201cIndians are being held hostage by our broken immigration system.\u201dSome families have had to wait so long that they fear their children will reach adulthood and be forced to leave. Lakshmi Vishnubhotla, who has worked for 10 years as a teacher in Marion County, S.C., is currently sponsored for an H-1B by the school district. He was named teacher of the year for the district in 2015-16.Mr. Vishnubhotla\u2019s green card application, which includes his family, was approved in 2012. They are still waiting for the cards to be issued. Given that the wait time is 10 years, and getting longer, he is worried. In seven years, his 14-year-old daughter, Sivani, will be considered an adult. His son, Sarvan, will turn 21 in nine years. At that time, they will no longer be eligible for green cards as Mr. Vishnubhotla\u2019s dependents and could be forced to return to India.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to split our family,\u201d Mr. Vishnubhotla said.Teachers who arrived after him, including some whom he trained from Jamaica, Venezuela and elsewhere, already have permanent residency.Jigar Madlani, a software engineer in Parsippany, N.J., came on an H-1B and hisgreen card was approved in 2013. But none of the family\u2019s cards have been issued, and he fears his wife, Heta, will soon lose her ability to work.Armed with an H-4EAD permit, she was hired in late 2015 as a case manager for New Jersey\u2019s 211 line, handling calls from drug addicts, homeless families, victims of domestic violence and others in crisis seeking help.\u201cI had no identity in this country. I got it, and now they want to take it away from me,\u201d Ms. Madlani said.Back in California, Ms. Jalakam dreads returning to the days when she filled her time tutoring students in math and taking online technology courses.\u201cI would see a woman all dressed up as an executive and wonder, \u2018Will I ever be like that?\u2019\u201d recalled Ms. Jalakam, whose family\u2019s green card was approved in 2010 but is still unissued.Now that she has a well-paying job, Ms. Jalakam\u2019s main fear is losing it. She was pregnant with their second child when the administration announced plans to rescind the work authorizations. She began fretting about how they would afford their $4,800 monthly mortgage.She found like-minded women on the \u201cSaveH4EAD\u201d Facebook page, and felt better, she said. \u201cI realized there are strong-willed women like me who really want to work.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Ms. Simon spotted the problem right away: the client was using beige dishes and mugs on a white tablecloth.\u201cIt was an easy fix,\u201d Ms. Simon said. She suggested switching either the tablecloth or the dishware to a darker color to better define the objects.Marking stairs and cabinet doors with bright-colored tape can also help accentuate edges. \u201cBold colors and textured markings and walls help people identify where they are,\u201d Mr. Magnusson said.Many people will have to tackle small home improvement projects like these if they start to lose their vision, he said.Other practical household changes include using solid colors for floors or kitchen countertops instead of patterned tiles or designs to make it easier to find things that have dropped.\u201cYou take for granted how easy it is to clean something up\u201d when you have your vision, said Gerald Hayes, who became legally blind about nine years ago due to complications from glaucoma.Mr. Hayes, 74, said he liked to keep clear paths in the living room of his one-bedroom apartment in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, to avoid tripping. \u201cI know exactly how many steps it takes from my front door to the living room chair, but I certainly don\u2019t need things in my way,\u201d he said.Paula Dertouzos, who lost sight in both eyes as a teenager from congenital glaucoma, agreed, saying she kept her apartment at Selis Manor \u201copen and airy.\u201d Ms. Dertouzos bought a smaller couch and chairs for her living room, which are pushed up against the wall and window. She also got rid of her coffee table after \u201ckilling her legs\u201d one too many times.\u201cI call it creative modification,\u201d said Ms. Dertouzos, 68. \u201cIf you want to be independent, you need a home that\u2019s functional.\u201dMs. Dertouzos said she especially liked some of the new technological upgrades that were included in the overhaul at her building. A talking thermostat has made adjusting the temperature much simpler and a new intercom system has made it easier to contact the front desk.Although she hasn\u2019t ordered any goods using the Amazon Echo she received for Christmas, Ms. Dertouzos said she used the smart speaker to check the weather, play music and participate in what has turned into one of her favorite activities, a daily quiz game.Ruthie Aybar, who lost most of her sight because of a retinal degenerative disease, lives with three of her four children in a Downtown Brooklyn apartment. She said one of the most important changes she made involved the lighting in her home.\u201cI had track lighting but they\u2019re really not good,\u201d she said. She bought new lamps and installed LED light bulbs. Some of the lamps bend, so she can point them where she needs light, and blinds or shades that adjust easily help keep out the glare, she added.She\u2019d like more sunlight, though, after living in a unit that faced an indoor courtyard for 12 years. \u201cYour light source makes a huge difference,\u201d she said.Many of these agencies have occupational therapists and staff members who teach classes and make house calls to help determine what needs to be altered and what adaptive products might be needed to help people with impaired vision remain in their homes.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work correctly all the time,\u201d she said, \u201cbut the fact that I have a tool on my phone is simply amazing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Charitable Giving by Corporations Is Also About Getting, a New Study Finds", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneThe same goes for the Walmart Foundation\u2019s contributions to reduce carbon emissions in China and to protect wilderness areas in the United States, or the Dow Chemical Foundation\u2019s contribution to Habitat for Humanity. These companies might be ruthless in their lines of work \u2014 fighting against environmental regulations or more stringent labor standards \u2014 but their foundations are in it to do good to the world.Sifting through the donations to charity from 1998 to 2015 by foundations set up by the largest companies in the United States \u2014 those in the Fortune 500 or the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index \u2014 Marianne Bertrand of the University of Chicago\u2019s Booth School of Business; Matilde Bombardini and Francesco Trebbi of the University of British Columbia; and Raymond Fisman of Boston University detected a pattern of contributions to 1,087 charities linked to 451 members of Congress.Turns out that the spending is a little more self-serving than companies would have us believe. Some of the charitable giving looks a lot like corporate lobbying. Because companies get a break for such giving, it amounts to political spending at taxpayers\u2019 expense. \u201cFirms deploy their charitable foundations as a form of tax-exempt influence seeking,\u201d the researchers write.Think of it like this: One way a company could please Senator Chuck Grassley, the Iowa Republican who leads the Judiciary Committee and is a member of the committees on finance, agriculture, the budget and taxation, would be to have a corporate political action committee donate directly to his campaign.But there is another way, one that often slips below the radar of campaign-finance watchdogs. Why not donate to the Partnership for a Drug-Free Iowa, where the senator has been an honorary advisory board member?A corporation could also give to the University of Northern Iowa Foundation, on whose board Mr. Grassley sat as a trustee. Over the period covered by the study, the foundations of AT&T, ConAgra Foods, General Electric, Goldman Sachs, Medtronic, Merck, Monsanto, Nationwide Insurance, Principal Financial Group and Rockwell Collins all contributed to one or the other.Mr. Grassley\u2019s office, when asked about the corporate contributions to causes linked to the senator, said: \u201cSenator Grassley receives many requests to support various nonprofit organizations. He lends his name to some, but declines most.\u201dThe researchers who conducted the new study don\u2019t claim that any specific charitable contribution was meant to manipulate the political process. But their work lays bare the extent to which corporate donations may respond to political, rather than charitable, motivations.The new research uncovers patterns in the aggregate data that suggest corporate donations are often dictated by recipients\u2019 political clout. For instance, a company foundation will donate more to charities in districts where the representatives have gained seats on a committee that is important to the company. And when the member of Congress leaves office, corporate donations to charities in his or her district will dip.Corporations\u2019 philanthropy often flows to the same areas as their political action committee contributions: Charities in districts where companies favor a particular candidate tend to get more corporate donations.A charity need not have been founded by a member of Congress to get corporate money. But it helps. A nonprofit is more than four times more likely to receive grants from a corporate foundation if a politician sits on its board. And corporate foundation grants are even more likely if the politician happens to sit on a committee being lobbied by the firm.The authors of the study examined only a subset of corporate philanthropy, money flowing through corporate foundations that must disclose the recipients of their largess. But the research suggests that the impact of corporate contributions could be much bigger than even critics of campaign-finance practices realize.The researchers estimate that over 7 percent of charitable donations by corporate foundations are intended to buy political leverage. Applied to $18 billion worth of corporate philanthropy in 2014, that would amount to $1.3 billion, almost four times as much as total political action committee contributions that year and 40 percent more than the corporations\u2019 lobbying expenditures.There are a couple of lessons here. For those who favor campaign-finance reform, perhaps the most urgent message is that there are many doors that corporate America can use to buy influence. But the research also highlights the way that companies interact with society.Corporations are likely to tally their foundations\u2019 charity as a decided plus on the dashboard of corporate social responsibility. But politically motivated charitable giving meant to undercut regulations, promote a tax cut or otherwise gain a break could actually reduce total welfare.As the researchers write, \u201cIf corporations\u2019 good deeds (in the form of charitable contributions) cater to politicians\u2019 interests, who as a result put the interests of business ahead of those of voters, the overall welfare effects are ambiguous \u2014 society benefits via increased charity, at the potentially high cost of distorting laws and regulation.\u201dNone of this would happen, of course, if politicians weren\u2019t so hungry for corporate money. \u201cCompanies wouldn\u2019t do this if it didn\u2019t pay off,\u201d Professor Bombardini told me. \u201cPoliticians get good publicity by channeling funds that are valuable to the community. Whatever makes you look good, you want to take credit for it.\u201dBut with a new wave of scandals engulfing some of the nation\u2019s corporate titans, it would behoove them to honestly assess the ultimate purpose of their charity.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Investigating AT&T and Verizon Over Wireless Collusion Claim", "Date": "2018-04-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Justice Department has opened an antitrust investigation into potential coordination by AT&T, Verizon and a telecommunications standards organization to hinder consumers from easily switching wireless carriers, according to six people with knowledge of the inquiry.In February, the Justice Department issued demands to AT&T, Verizon and the G.S.M.A., a mobile industry standards-setting group, for information on potential collusion to thwart a technology known as eSIM, said two of the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details are confidential.The technology lets people remotely switch wireless providers without having to insert a new SIM card into a device. AT&T and Verizon face accusations that they colluded with the G.S.M.A. to try to establish standards that would allow them to lock a device to their network even if it had eSIM technology.The investigation was opened about five months ago after at least one device maker and one wireless carrier filed formal complaints with the Justice Department, two of the people said. The device maker was Apple, one of them said.Representatives for the Justice Department, and Apple declined to comment.In a statement, a Verizon spokesman confirmed that the carrier had been working with the Justice Department for several months on the inquiry because of \u201ca difference of opinion with a couple of phone equipment manufacturers regarding the development of eSIM standards.\u201d He said the issue was \u201cmuch ado about nothing.\u201dAn AT&T spokesman said the company was \u201caware of the investigation,\u201d had provided information to the government and was working \u201cto move this issue forward.\u201dG.S.M.A. confirmed that it had developed an eSIM standard that would allow a carrier to lock a device to its network but put the standard on hold pending the Justice Department\u2019s investigation. Under the pending standard, the G.S.M.A. said, a wireless carrier would need permission from a consumer to lock a device.\u201cThe G.S.M.A. is cooperating fully with the Department of Justice in this matter,\u201d the organization said in a statement.At the heart of the investigation is whether the nation\u2019s biggest wireless carriers, working with the G.S.M.A., secretly tried to influence mobile technology to unfairly maintain their dominance, in a way that hurt competition and consumers and hindered innovation in the wider mobile industry.AT&T and Verizon together control about 70 percent of all wireless subscriptions in the United States. A technology that made it easy to switch carriers could lead to more turnover and fewer subscribers for them.The investigation highlights a push by the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, to crack down on the opaque world of intellectual property, or I.P., standards. He has said the Justice Department will scrutinize potential coordination in standards-setting organizations that can hurt competition.Currently, most mobile phones use SIM cards, which contain unique identifying information about a user and are inserted into the devices so the phones can function. People typically have to buy a new SIM card when changing carriers.The eSIM technology, which was introduced in early 2016, is embedded in mobile phones and other devices so that people do not need SIM cards anymore.The push by the major carriers to restrict the flexibility of eSIM runs counter to a movement in which consumers were gaining more flexibility to move from carrier to carrier. In late 2013, under pressure by the Federal Communications Commission, the wireless industry agreed to let people take devices off any particular network without penalty once the devices were fully paid for.After the formal complaints against AT&T and Verizon were filed, several device makers and other wireless companies voiced similar concerns to the agency about the carriers\u2019 actions around eSIM, four people familiar with the investigation said. The investigation may also include other major American carriers, another person said.\u201cThe actions would limit choice for consumers and harm competition,\u201d said Ferras Vinh, a policy expert at the Center for Democracy and Technology.In a private meeting of a task force called G.S.M.A. North America this year, AT&T and Verizon pushed for the ability to lock phones to their networks, bypassing the purpose of eSIM technology, said Harold Feld, a senior vice president of Public Knowledge, a nonprofit consumer group, who was briefed on the meeting. Verizon has said it needed to be able to lock down phones to prevent theft and fraud.\u201cThere is a constant problem with industry standards-setting organizations that on the one hand allow the industry to come together for the purpose of efficiency but can be very anticompetitive and operate in secrecy,\u201d Mr. Feld said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Make Facebook More Accountable", "Date": "2018-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMr. Penn served as chief strategy officer for Microsoft from 2014 to 2016.Facebook is in a pickle. Its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, who is scheduled to testify before Congress this week regarding the privacy of users\u2019 personal data, is on a mea culpa tour. In media interviews, he has said that he is even open to some regulation. Here, then, is one idea that could fix a lot of the emerging problems with Facebook and other internet mega-platforms as they find themselves in congressional cross hairs.Dating back to 1912, America has had legislation regulating media ownership. At first the primary concerns were about public safety, but they evolved into concerns about the diversity of media ownership and the character of media operators. As late as 2013, the Federal Communications Commission did not allow broadcast stations to have more than 25 percent foreign ownership. The airwaves were considered a public good, with restrictions on its use and operations considered appropriate.But despite its government roots and public funding, the internet has been treated like a private commercial network. Now is the time to reconsider that approach, especially in light of the central role tech platforms play in hosting public debate, providing news and disseminating political ads.Facebook and other major platforms are driven by algorithms designed to increase clicks. If you don\u2019t like President Trump, you will be served more and more anti-Trump articles as the algorithm tries to maximize your engagement, which in turn increases potential ad dollars. Revenue tied to sensational but phony news articles proved good for the bottom line. Until, that is, people started to complain, prompting fact-checking schemes, which in turn generated complaints about the political biases of those fact-checkers. In our ideologically diverse world, it\u2019s impossible for any single news distributor to fact-check and rank the news with complete objectivity.Historically, editors and not algorithms made news judgments at TV networks, radio stations, newspapers and magazines. The biases of different editors were balanced by rules that limited the power, reach and ownership of any single outlet, thus ensuring diversity of content.Now, suppose we looked at the internet not as the private preserve of a few huge corporations, but as a public good to be treated no differently from how we treated the licensing of radio and TV stations. We could create new rules intended to force the major internet companies like Facebook and Google to choose one of two paths. They could be fully responsible for all the content on their networks, subject to libel laws (which they are not now). Or they could operate more like broadband providers that license \u201cchannels\u201d to media companies that are responsible for their own content, in the way that cable TV companies agree to carry selected channels. My guess is that they would choose the latter.To stay in news distribution and yet avoid greater liability, they could step back from the editorial ranking business and adopt a system similar to what the government helped create with TV and radio. Following this approach, Facebook and Google, because of their unique market power in social and search, would each create a limited number of promoted but ideologically diverse news channels that could be auctioned off to responsible publishers, who would in turn agree to stringent fact-checking and content-responsibility rules. Violations of the rules would cost them their status as a certified channel.Users then would select which channels they wanted in their feeds or allow the internet platforms to pick a selection of those channels on the basis of expressed ideology or interests \u2014 political, sports or celebrity news, liberal versus conservative. Search results from the certified channels would be listed first, and posting of items from these sources would carry special status and priority over nonlicensed sources. The revenue model would also be shifted from individual articles that draw clicks to channels that would have to meet standards and could pay annual licensing fees to the platforms. The channels would make money by selling ads or charging for premium content.Some things wouldn\u2019t need to change. Unlicensed publishers and websites would still operate the way they do now but would not have the same priority and visibility. Facebook and the other big platforms would also continue to monitor individual users\u2019 posts for offensive or violent content. They could, however, focus more on identifying masked and fraudulent accounts. Much fake news comes from fake accounts, after all. As a prod, Congress should consider increasing fines against platforms that fail to verify the identities of social media accounts.These measures would treat the internet like the public good it is and should remain. They would also return much of the editorial job of curating and ranking content to editors and media organizations. The big internet companies could voluntarily adopt the new system without facing significant new regulation.But if the major platforms continue to try to serve as full-blown news distributors without accepting the full responsibilities of publishers, Congress should intervene to preserve information diversity and accountability in our marketplace of ideas.Mark Penn is the author, with Meredith Fineman, of \u201cMicrotrends Squared.\u201d He served as chief strategy officer for Microsoft from 2014 to 2016, and was a pollster and strategist for Bill and Hillary Clinton from 1995 to 2008.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will Italy Leave the E.U.? Not So Fast", "Date": "2018-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Severgnini is\u00a0the author of \u201cLa Bella Figura: A Field Guide to the Italian Mind.\u201dMILAN \u2014 Eight weeks after Italy\u2019s election, it\u2019s still possible that a government will be formed by the Five Star Movement and the League, two parties that have campaigned passionately against Brussels and the European Union in the past. In the last few days they have quarreled, but it seems sure that one of them, maybe both, will be the force driving Italy\u2019s next government, with the question before it being whether to continue on that anti-European path.Speaking in the European Parliament in February, the League\u2019s leader, Matteo Salvini, likened the European Union to \u201cthe Titanic about to sink.\u201d The views of Five Star are less clear cut. Its leaders have changed their minds several times about the euro, and at the moment, it seems that they\u2019d like to stay in the union. But they might well change their minds again. After all, Beppe Grillo, the movement\u2019s founder and ultimate authority, once shouted, \u201cItaly should leave the euro as soon as possible!\u201d Others are on the record as saying that \u201cthe euro has destroyed us\u201d and that \u201cit will eventually make southern Italy a wasteland.\u201dOn March 4, Election Day, Five Star attracted 32 percent of the vote. The League got 17 percent, and a third, even more Euroskeptic party \u2014 the right-wing Brothers of Italy \u2014 polled 4 percent. That means that more than half of Italian voters turned against Europe.Does it follow that the European Union is now at risk? Well, not yet. Do not expect Italy to drop the euro or leave the union anytime soon. The price would be way too high. Nevertheless, it\u2019s a fact: The continent\u2019s most Europhile country has lost faith in Europe\u2019s ability to solve Italy\u2019s problems.A Euroskeptic Italy is almost an oxymoron. Italy is one of the six founding nations of the European Union, having signed the Treaty of Rome in 1957 with France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. For 60 years it has been a loyal member and has regularly led the polls that measure trust and good will toward the bloc.What\u2019s changed?Three things, mainly. One relates to European policies. Another involves Italian politicians. The third, a consequence of the first two that looks as if it would be the most difficult to fix, concerns Italian voters.No. 1: The European Union has disappointed Italy on immigration, a deeply sensitive issue. The Dublin Regulation, in force since 1997, states that the country where an asylum-seeker first enters the union is responsible for registering his or her asylum application. With the current decade\u2019s flood of migrants coming mostly from the Middle East and Africa, the two most exposed countries have been Greece and Italy. A look at a map is enough to tell you why.Making things worse for Italy, a costly agreement with Turkey to act as a sort of bouncer for Europe has almost totally shut down the eastern route through Greece. But in Libya, which lies just south of Sicily, there has been no government to deal with, so migrants from Africa kept coming. When Italy asked its European partners to share the burden, they first said no, then maybe, then yes to opening their borders to some migrants. But only a few hundred were accepted, and Italy felt betrayed.European insensitivity has shown up elsewhere. In a supposedly \u201ccommon\u201d market, Ireland, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Cyprus and Britain all offer tax havens to encourage international companies to set up their headquarters within them. Mr. Salvini, speaking in the European Parliament in February, described the European Commission\u2019s president, Jean-Claude Juncker, a former prime minister of Luxembourg, as \u201cthe head of government of a tax haven for 20 years.\u201d And a few weeks before the election, Embraco, a company in the Whirlpool group, announced that it would close its compressor plants near Turin, fire 500 people and move to Slovakia, where wages and employee benefits are much lower. Very bad timing for Europhiles.No. 2: Every country in the union has at least one political party that built its fortunes on bashing Europe. But in Italy, lately, this attitude has been adopted by even the historically pro-European parties, which couldn\u2019t resist blaming Brussels for their own failures. Matteo Renzi, first as a prime minister (2014 to 2016) and then as the leader of the center-left Democratic Party (2017), could hardly open his mouth without saying something unpleasant about the union. Did he think he could outsmart his opponents that way? Well, he failed. \u201cBlame it on Brussels!\u201d didn\u2019t pay off for him or his government. It compares with what happened in Britain before the Brexit referendum. David Cameron, while leading the campaign to remain in the bloc, chose to acknowledge the union\u2019s shortcomings; he did it so well that he persuaded his fellow citizens to leave it.No. 3: Italy, where feelings run high on these issues, senses an emotional disconnection between Europe and its citizens. For almost 60 years, Italian voters had seen the European Union as a dull but reliable babysitter who would ultimately take care of those rowdy Italian politicians. A former prime minister told me, \u201cIf not for Brussels, I could never resist pressure to expand public spending.\u201d All that is gone now. And a majority of Italians think the sitter is at least partly to blame.But what about the union\u2019s very substantial achievements? It\u2019s created common standards in areas from home safety to cellphone roaming; it\u2019s allowed people to trade, work and live where they please; it protects agriculture and fishing; it\u2019s helped millions of students spend time abroad. And it\u2019s enabled 28 countries to speak with one voice and be respected \u2014 as Microsoft, Google and Facebook know well.All forgotten? No. But most Italians, yearning for the supposed security of a lost age, find Brussels too distant. National, local and ethnic identities are more familiar, thus more reassuring.That remoteness is important. The European Union looks soulless. Its greatest flaw may be that it cannot communicate its achievements. Take Europe Day. Only a small fraction of the 510 million citizens of the union even know about the day, let alone celebrate it, and almost no one has any idea why it\u2019s May 9. In fact, it was on May 9, 1950, that Robert Schuman, then France\u2019s foreign minister, officially proposed placing French and German coal and steel production under one authority; can you see why those 510 million don\u2019t deck the halls?So here\u2019s an idea: Let\u2019s declare May 9 \u201cNo Europe Day\u201d and suspend all of the union\u2019s achievements for 24 hours. Border crossings will be reintroduced and trade barriers re-erected. People will exchange their currency for every trip, and soccer teams will field only players from their own countries.Oh, and war will be once again a very real threat. Not far away. Right at home.One day would be enough to remind its citizens what Europe is about. And in Italy, if they do form a government, Five Star and the League might understand the importance of our common European home.Sure, it\u2019s not perfect. So let\u2019s not demolish it. Let\u2019s fix it.Beppe Severgnini is the editor in chief of Corriere della Sera\u2019s magazine 7 and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "The clarion call for businesses to rethink their approaches to protecting customer data is being heeded by the European Union\u2019s General Data Privacy Regulation (G.D.P.R.), a set of guidelines that establishes a means for individuals to control their private data. Set to take effect on May 25, 2018, the rules specify data privacy rights, such as the right to have a company forget your data, and the right to export and move personal information from one company to another. Violators face stiff fines \u2014 up to 20 million euros or 4 percent of global revenue, whichever is higher. \u201cG.D.P.R. is about the change of the culture of processing data,\u201d said Eva Skornickova, a G.D.P.R. compliance consultant based in Prague. \u201cCompanies think all your personal data belongs to them. But it belongs to us as individuals. It is a part of our personal life. We should decide who is going to license our data and what they are going to do with it.\u201dIt may seem to some that the European Union reforms \u2014 and other data privacy protections popping up worldwide \u2014 are yet another regulatory burden for which companies must absorb the cost. But that doesn\u2019t have to be the case. Data privacy compliance can provide a distinct competitive advantage and business opportunity, Skornickova and other experts say.By choosing the right tools to protect customer privacy, companies can reshape their data practices in ways that reap cascading benefits. Compliance provides a way to win customer trust. And tackling inventory and discovery in a strategic manner can improve firms\u2019 agility and efficiency.Customers who understand how their data is being used will reward firms with trust and loyalty.\u201cG.D.P.R. compliance is not about the big, costly exercise,\u201d Skornickova said. \u201cIt\u2019s about your reputation. Microsoft, for instance, is investing heavily to ensure Microsoft 365 and its cloud tools are compliant with G.D.P.R., because this is a huge business advantage. That\u2019s being competitive.\u201dPricewaterhouseCoopers recently surveyed its clients and found that 64 percent plan to deploy Internet of Things-based solutions and 63 percent will roll out advanced predictive analytics over the next year. Data privacy and trust are critical to customers\u2019 acceptance of these new technologies, said Jay Cline, a privacy leader with PwC who helps clients comply with data privacy and security regulations.\u201cIf your predictive analytics is too accurate, if things are predicting my next move too much, the word people use is \u2018creepy,\u2019\u201d Cline said. \u201cIoT includes things like connected cars and smart homes, smart appliances, things that talk to each other. There\u2019s a group of people who think this is cool. They\u2019re going to buy those no matter what. But there are just as many people skeptical of where all this data goes, and they\u2019re concerned and want to know more about how their data is going to be safe.\u201dCustomers also want to know when their data is shared, if it\u2019s retained for an appropriate period of time and that it\u2019s secured throughout its use, Cline said. \u201cConsumers trust that the collection of their data is proportionate to the promise of its use,\u201d he said. Companies that demonstrate value so that customers opt in will have an advantage as technology evolves.In the post-G.D.P.R. world, companies that don\u2019t work to maintain a clear 360-degree view of consumer data will get left behind.In 2016, the Harvard Business Review reported that poor data quality cost the United States economy $3.1 trillion per year, mostly in misspent marketing dollars and wasted staff time. Among British executives surveyed in February 2017, 91 percent described their organization as \u201cplagued with data quality issues.\u201d The same report estimated that British businesses lost 20 percent of customers annually because of poor data.And security is equally important. A survey conducted by independent technology market research specialist Vanson Bourne found that more than three quarters of Americans said they would avoid companies with a number of data breaches. Globally, the average data breach now costs a firm $3.62 million; in the U.S., the figure is over $7 million, according to research by IBM and the Ponemon Institute.Compliance with G.D.P.R. and other data privacy regulations will require most firms to engage in long-overdue data cleansing. Businesses will have to gain a much clearer understanding of the data they collect and its purpose. \u201cThen you have to identify the data which you really don\u2019t need,\u201d Skornickova said. \u201cThe principle of data minimization will be simple, and regulatory authorities will go after that. They want to see you are only processing data you need for the activities you are doing.\u201dG.D.P.R.\u2019s right to be forgotten, for example, elevates the importance of high data quality. Because (with limited exceptions) companies will be required to delete certain personal data on demand of a data subject, they must achieve a clear view of the personal data they process or store on behalf of their customers.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen surveys that indicate one-third of U.K. customers plan to exercise their right to be forgotten as soon as G.D.P.R. goes live in May,\u201d said Cline.Suppose a company has 10 customers named Joe Smith, Cline said. If one of them exercises his right to be forgotten or to edit his data, the company has to be sure it\u2019s acting on data from the proper Joe Smith \u2014 or else they\u2019ve created another privacy issue.\u201cThere\u2019s a reward for high-quality data, but the cost of inaccurate data is also higher,\u201d Cline said.Data cleansing and restructuring can result in more robust governance models, with clear and consistent classification and labeling, which makes data secure and easier to access.The road to compliance can lead to a reliable, accurate inventory and transparent mapping of all data, which helps fuel innovation.\u201cCompanies think they have good knowledge of their data architecture, but taking that and mapping it to a business process has proven a much harder thing than just a physical I.T. transfer,\u201d said Chris Babel, the chief executive of TrustArc.Data privacy compliance brings the information technology department, legal teams, operations, marketing and the C-suite to the same table to inventory data assets and relationships across the enterprise. Nomenclature and formats can be more uniformly structured, allowing the business faster, more agile access to the information that really matters.Say a business team dreams up a mobile app idea to better serve customers. With a clear understanding of where databases lie, how data is classified, what its labels mean, which pieces of information will be used from each field, which geographic region the data comes from and, finally, what the ultimate data profile or product will be, design engineers and privacy teams can work together to ensure that data resources are auto-approved for that app and others like it.Outside of the information technology department, many firms lack a clear awareness of what data they collect, where it\u2019s stored and how it\u2019s accessed, Babel said. But mature firms are using the regulations and other privacy dictates to map their assets, because, Babel said, \u201cthat\u2019s where mature companies truly enable their business to develop processes much more quickly.\u201dCline\u2019s experience with PwC squares with Babel\u2019s. Despite the thirst for customer information, Cline said, only a few businesses truly understand how to use data to its full potential. \u201cWe\u2019ve done a lot of data inventories for clients,\u201d he said. \u201cOften, we\u2019re the first ones to show them how they make money with data. That changes the conversation to a business strategy conversation. This is a compliance issue that drives business innovation.\u201dChoosingComplianceWorking with a cloud partner that is G.D.P.R.-compliant will be critical in coming months, because today, almost all data moves through the cloud to a distributed workforce and mobile apps. Because data moves from onsite platforms across cloud services, devices and apps, data protection needs to persistently stick with the data, no matter where it goes. Yet personal data must be visible and easily accessible to the people from whom it was collected.Firms should also use tools that allow them to discover where sensitive or personal data exists and securely classify, label and archive that information. They should regularly test their compliance status to ensure their business units are doing their best to comply with existing and looming regulations.\u201cThis is really a global set of changes as different countries are thinking about how data can be used,\u201d Babel said. \u201cConsumers have a new avenue to display their displeasure with you and interact with you. You have to manage, monitor and use it as a way to build trust. You need to start with security and the legal issues of privacy, and then figure out how you use data to power business without violating that trust.\u201dAccelerate Your GDPR Compliance Journey with Microsoft 365.The news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}

His Twitter posts have carried with them the threat, sometimes explicit, that he is prepared to use the power of the presidency to undermine the companies that anger him.The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, long a booster of Republican presidents, is not happy. \u201cIt\u2019s inappropriate for government officials to use their position to attack an American company,\u201d said Neil Bradley, the executive vice president and chief policy officer of the chamber. Mr. Bradley, who did not specifically name Mr. Trump, added that criticism of companies from politicians \u201cundermines economic growth and job creation.\u201dMost presidents have clashed with business interests and industries, sometimes in ways that generated headlines. But Mr. Trump is unique in singling out individual companies for ridicule with regularity. And rarely have presidents done so because of a personal pique or grudge, as happens with Mr. Trump.\u201cThis is an unprecedented situation for companies. The president\u2019s tweets can cause significant reputational harm,\u201d said Dean C. Garfield, the president of the Information Technology Industry Council, which represents big technology companies like Amazon, Dell, Facebook, Google and IBM. \u201cWe are now at a place where about 90 percent of the companies we represent now have a presidential Twitter strategy in place.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s no laughing matter,\u201d he said.For many companies, that strategy comes down to waiting out the storm. In recent days, Amazon has all but ignored the president\u2019s taunts, which he issued in a flurry of tweets.\u201cThere\u2019s no real advantage going toe-to-toe with him,\u201d said Joe Lockhart, a press secretary for President Bill Clinton who was a spokesman for the National Football League, another favorite target of Mr. Trump. \u201cAnd his attention span is so short, he will move on. He\u2019ll find another target.\u201dLikewise, the president\u2019s interest in the AT&T merger with Time Warner largely stems from his repeated clashes with CNN, a subsidiary of Time Warner, which he regards as biased against him.As a private citizen, Mr. Trump has attacked companies, including calling several times for boycotts. The remarks served to raise his profile and fed the image of a no-holds-barred businessman who was unafraid to rebuke his rivals or his critics. But in those days, such comments had little ability to move stock prices or affect sales.As a candidate and as the president, Mr. Trump also uses his verbal assaults on companies to bolster his populist message that he is on the side of workers, not big business. (Still, Mr. Trump secured a large tax cut last year for corporate America.)Mr. Trump\u2019s most ardent supporters say they appreciate his willingness to criticize the corporate establishment.\u201cHe continues to go directly after the companies and not care about political correctness,\u201d said Terry Bowman, a former Trump campaign organizer who works at a Ford Motor parts factory in Ypsilanti, Mich. \u201cHe says things that a polished politician would never say. He says things that come directly from the American worker.\u201d\u201cThat is the height of irresponsibility,\u201d Mr. Obama said in 2009 without identifying specific companies. \u201cIt is shameful.\u201dMr. Clinton\u2019s Justice Department aggressively pushed to break up Microsoft on the grounds that it was abusing its monopoly position in personal computing to dominate the internet.President John F. Kennedy avoided naming individuals during a fight with the steel industry in 1962. He criticized \u201ca tiny handful of steel executives whose pursuit of private power and profit exceeds their sense of public responsibility.\u201dPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt on occasion assailed business executives as \u201cmalefactors of great wealth,\u201d attributing the memorable phrase to his cousin, Theodore Roosevelt. Neither president made a practice of identifying specific companies or executives.Mr. Trump has had no such reticence.\u201cA report just came out. They said $1.47, I believe, or about that for every time they deliver a package, the United States government \u2014 meaning the post office \u2014 loses $1.47,\u201d the president said.He added, ominously: \u201cSo Amazon is going to have to pay much more money to the post office. There\u2019s no doubt about that.\u201dWhen Merck\u2019s chief executive, Kenneth C. Frazier, quit a presidential business council last year in protest of some of the White House\u2019s policy positions, other members were initially reluctant to come to his defense for fear of a verbal attack by Mr. Trump. The council eventually disbanded but only after much internal negotiation among members to quit in force.The multiday decline of Amazon\u2019s stock price after Mr. Trump\u2019s repeated jabs at the company has exacerbated such fears, said Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management and president of the Chief Executive Leadership Institute.\u201cOther business leaders don\u2019t want to catch the contagion,\u201d he said.But he added that refusing to engage could also be risky. He said that Mr. Bezos\u2019s silence had hurt the company, leaving it exposed to Mr. Trump\u2019s accusations that it received subsidies from the Postal Service and was not paying its fair share of taxes.\u201cThe right answer for C.E.O.s is not to engage in a mud fight but to come with facts,\u201d Mr. Sonnenfeld said. \u201cU.P.S. and FedEx have their facts, but we haven\u2019t heard from Amazon.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Must Keep DACA and Accept New Applications, Federal Judge Rules", "Date": "2018-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the biggest setback yet for the Trump administration in its attempt to end a program that shields some undocumented young adults from deportation, a federal judge ruled Tuesday that the protections must stay in place and that the government must resume accepting new applications.Judge John D. Bates of Federal District Court for the District of Columbia said that the administration\u2019s decision to terminate the program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, was based on the \u201cvirtually unexplained\u201d grounds that the program was \u201cunlawful.\u201dThe ruling was the third in recent months against the Trump administration\u2019s rollback of DACA. Federal judges in Brooklyn and in San Francisco each issued injunctions ordering that the program remain in place. But neither of those decisions required the government to accept new applications.Judge Bates, who was nominated by President George W. Bush in 2001, described the Trump administration\u2019s decision to phase out DACA as \u201carbitrary and capricious because the department failed adequately to explain its conclusion that the program was unlawful.\u201dThe Obama administration established the DACA program on the premise that children brought to the United States as children should be treated as low priorities for deportation.About 700,000 of the young undocumented immigrants \u2014 who are known as Dreamers \u2014 have signed up but must renew their DACA status every two years. The program also gives them the opportunity to work legally in the United States. Immigrants must be 15 years old to apply.The Trump administration officially rescinded DACA in March, but the previous court orders allowed the Dreamers to file their renewal applications as challenges to the Trump administration\u2019s move made it through the legal system.The Supreme Court in late February declined an unusual White House request that it immediately decide whether the Trump administration can shut down the program.In a statement released Tuesday night, the Justice Department said that it would \u201ccontinue to vigorously defend\u201d the legality of its decision to end the DACA program and that it looked \u201cforward to vindicating its position in further litigation.\u201dThe Department of Homeland Security \u201cacted within its lawful authority in deciding to wind down DACA in an orderly manner,\u201d the Justice Department statement said. \u201cPromoting and enforcing the rule of law is vital to protecting a nation, its borders, and its citizens.\u201dImmigration advocates hailed Judge Bates\u2019s ruling, saying it highlighted the failure of the administration to justify the program\u2019s termination.\u201cEither President Trump finds another way to end the program, tossing hundreds of thousands of young people into deportation proceedings,\u201d said Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, an advocacy group in Washington, \u201cor he works with Republicans and Democrats to find a legislative solution.\u201dIn trying to close the program, the Trump administration argued that Mr. Obama had abused his authority and circumvented Congress to create DACA. President Trump urged Congress to find a legislative remedy to replace it and expressed support for giving the Dreamers a path to citizenship.In January, however, Judge William Alsup of the Federal District Court in San Francisco ordered that Dreamers must be allowed to renew their status. That lawsuit was filed by the University of California, which is led by Janet Napolitano, who was the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security when the program began.The next month, Judge Nicholas Garaufis of the Federal District Court in Brooklyn decided in favor of attorneys general from 15 states and several advocacy groups that sued to block the DACA rollback.Under Judge Bates\u2019s ruling, unless the administration can justify its decision within 90 days, the cancellation of the program will be rescinded.The latest lawsuit was brought by the N.A.A.C.P. as well as Princeton University and Microsoft.\u201cPrinceton higher education and our country benefit from the talent and aspirations that Dreamers bring to our communities,\u201d Christopher L. Eisgruber, the university president, said in a statement. \u201cWe continue to urge Congress to enact a permanent solution.\u201dStephen Yale-Loehr, a professor of immigration law at Cornell Law School, said that Judge Bates\u2019s ruling, if upheld on appeal, would \u201cbenefit tens of thousands of Dreamers.\u201dHasan Shafiqullah, director of the immigration law unit of the Legal Aid Society of New York, said the ruling ushered in hope, especially for younger siblings of DACA recipients who, as of last September were ineligible to apply because they were too young.In three months\u2019 time, they might be able to submit a new application, Mr. Shafiqullah said, \u201cand at last be able to come out of the shadows, register for DACA, and \u2014 like their older siblings \u2014 more fully integrate into the fabric of our society.\u201dLiz Robbins and Adam Liptak contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In a Trade War, China Might Boycott U.S. Goods. That Could Backfire.", "Date": "2018-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTAICANG, China \u2014 If China calls for a boycott of American goods, Chinese workers like David Xu could be in trouble.Mr. Xu is one of thousands of residents of this port town who cash paychecks from American companies. He works as a technician at a Procter & Gamble manufacturing and distribution center here, one of the company\u2019s biggest in China. Across town, Nike has opened a huge distribution center, its largest in Asia.In all, more than 40 other American companies have set up shop here, making chemicals, lighters and a broad range of other products for a Chinese market eager for American goods.\u201cThere is no deep hatred for American companies,\u201d said Mr. Xu, who has worked for Procter & Gamble for 13 years. \u201cThe impact of this trade conflict shouldn\u2019t be big. After all, American companies bring so many conveniences to the lives of Chinese people.\u201dA Boycott America plan could be much tougher to pull off.While competition from Chinese-made smartphones is rising, iPhones remain popular. Shopping mall developers, eager for the extra cachet, clamor for Starbucks to open stores. Nike dominates the sportswear market in China. Chevrolet is one of the country\u2019s most popular brands.And notably, many of those products are made by Chinese workers. Factories in China assemble iPhones, stitch up Nike apparel and footwear and make Chevrolets and Fords. It isn\u2019t clear how many jobs this creates, but the American Chamber of Commerce in China said that more than one-third of its 800-plus member companies have more than 1,000 employees in the country.\u201cChina needs the U.S., the U.S. needs China,\u201d said Max Baucus, a former United States ambassador to China. \u201cWe are joined at the hip economically.\u201dThe United States has also supplied much of the investment underpinning China\u2019s economic growth. Between 1990 and 2017, America pumped more than $250 billion into China, according to a report by the Rhodium Group and the National Committee on United States-China Relations.\u201cThe U.S. multinationals have been playing a very critical part of China\u2019s development story, providing investment, technology, brands,\u201d said Erlend Ek, trade research manager of China Policy, a Beijing-based advisory firm. \u201cThey have a very good relationship with each other.\u201dThere\u2019s another reason that Beijing may be reluctant to try a boycott: American multinationals are aiding the Chinese government in some important projects. IBM and Walmart, for example, are collaborating with the e-commerce company JD.com and Tsinghua University to improve food safety in China, a priority for Beijing.That isn\u2019t to say that the idea is off the table.\u201cThe patriotism and collectivism of the Chinese people will likely play a role,\u201d the newspaper said in an editorial last month. \u201cAnd the slogans to boycott American cars and other big commodities may ring through the Chinese internet and get a response.\u201dStill, China has other ways to strike back without involving consumers.Tu Xinquan, the dean of the China Institute for W.T.O. Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, warned that the possibility of a consumer boycott on American goods \u201ccannot be ruled out.\u201d\u201cBut perhaps once the battle begins, it\u2019s possible that we wouldn\u2019t even need the people to wage the boycott, because the government\u2019s measures could be powerful enough,\u201d Mr. Tu said.Consumers in China can be a potent force. In 2012, Chinese nationalists wrecked Japanese stores and car dealerships and boycotted Japanese cars because of a territorial dispute, hurting sales for years. In 2016, online vendors stopped selling dried mangoes from the Philippines after a United Nations tribunal ruled in favor of Manila in another territorial dispute.\u201cBecause of the structure of the government and the political power of the party, they can call for a boycott and get a pretty good response,\u201d Mr. Zarit said. \u201cSo that concerns me.\u201dTaicang, a 90-minute drive from Shanghai, underscores how interdependent the two economies are.Some of the biggest names in corporate America, like Honeywell and Exxon Mobil, have converged on this city of close to a million people. Its economy is growing faster than the country\u2019s as a whole. It is richer than Shanghai on a per-capita basis. Last year, Taicang topped a list of China\u2019s 10 happiest \u201ccounty-level cities\u201d for the second year in a row.In a sprawling factory, Procter & Gamble makes its Head & Shoulders, Pantene and Vidal Sassoon shampoos and then distributes them along with other cosmetics and skin care products. When the factory opened, the company said it would provide 1,500 jobs for Chinese workers. Across town is a 200,000-square-meter Nike logistics center, which that company has also said would employ 1,500 people.In total, 42 American factories are in the Taicang economic development zone, with a total annual output value of about $4.7 billion, the government of the much larger city of Suzhou, which administers Taicang, said in February.The influx of money can be seen in the relative affluence of the Procter & Gamble employees, most of whom drive Japanese-made cars to work. One female employee, surnamed Li, said workers were confident that what they made in the factory would appeal to Chinese consumers, who she said were rational about what they bought.\u201cDue to the integration of the economies, whatever China does to the U.S. will end up hurting itself,\u201d Ms. Cui said.Elsie Chen contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "G.E. Makes a Sharp \u2018Pivot\u2019 on Digital", "Date": "2018-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLast November, Mr. Flannery told investors that expenses at GE Digital would be cut this year by more than 25 percent, or about $400 million. While he insisted the digital initiatives at G.E. are \u201cvery key\u201d to the company, he added, \u201cwe want a much more focused strategy.\u201dBut the rethinking of GE Digital, with its future still under review by Mr. Flannery, points to the difficulty of producing modern software for industrial businesses as they adopt digital technology.No one disputes the overarching vision of the so-called industrial internet of things \u2014 which includes low-cost sensors and a flood of data and clever software that should deliver insights to cut costs, conserve fuel and design better products, faster. But the company greatly underestimated the challenges of creating all the software needed to achieve that grand vision, said analysts and former G.E. managers.G.E.\u2019s technical prowess, they said, lies in designing and manufacturing big machines like power-plant turbines, jet engines and medical-imaging equipment. Its traditional software skills have been in the specialized programs that control the machines and factory operations. GE Digital was a striking departure into cloud-based internet software, data analytics and artificial intelligence tools like machine learning.\u201cG.E. reached too far outside its expertise and too fast,\u201d said Steven Winoker, an analyst at UBS. \u201cAnd it became a financial black hole.\u201dG.E.\u2019s digital effort dates to 2011, when Mr. Immelt recruited William Ruh, an executive at Cisco Systems. Later that year, the company set up a center in San Ramon, Calif., east of San Francisco. At the time, Mr. Ruh announced big plans to hire as many as 400 software engineers to write code for the industrial internet.The San Ramon work force swelled sharply to 1,400 in the summer of 2016, and to a peak of 2,000 last summer \u2014 before coming down to about 1,800, after a round of cuts earlier this year.During the buildup, G.E. recruited veteran software managers who had worked at leading tech companies, including Google, Microsoft and Apple. With the cuts at GE Digital and its narrowed focus, some of them have departed.The product plan later broadened to include a cloud-based software platform for handling all kinds of sensor and machine data, and secure communications from the factory floor to data centers. G.E. even built its own data centers.The software platform under development was often referred to as an operating system for the industrial internet. When the product concept expanded, so did the Predix brand.Today, according to former G.E. engineers, Predix has been pared back to mainly a set of software tools to help write applications rather than being connected to layers of code for automating data analysis.The priority at GE Digital is now on selling products for specific industrial applications, sold as offerings in the \u201cPredix portfolio,\u201d and tailored for G.E.\u2019s roster of existing industrial customers. Less emphasis is being put on all-purpose software for the wider industrial world.In an interview, Mr. Ruh described the change at GE Digital as \u201ca pivot\u201d rather than a retreat. \u201cWe\u2019re still 1,000 percent behind our Predix portfolio,\u201d he said.The current strategy, Mr. Ruh said, \u201cis about industrial apps\u201d like those. It is a measured, step-by-step approach but one, Mr. Ruh said, that capitalizes on G.E.\u2019s strengths \u2014 its industry knowledge and deep customer relationships \u2014 and is lifting sales.GE Digital remains a large player in an increasingly crowded field of companies offering industrial internet software of various kinds, in different market niches. The entrants include the big cloud suppliers like Amazon, Microsoft and Google; major business software companies like Oracle, SAP, IBM and SAS Institute; G.E.\u2019s industrial peers such as Siemens, Honeywell and ABB; and start-ups like C3 IoT, Uptake and FogHorn Systems.The opportunity for G.E., analysts said, centers on its longstanding relationships with customers and selling to them. And so far, only 8 percent of its industrial customers are using Predix portfolio products, the company said.The New York Power Authority, the nation\u2019s largest state-owned utility, is one of them. The utility is working with GE Digital to build apps that improve the efficiency of its power generation and distribution network. In pilot projects, the partnership has saved or avoided $3 million in costs, said Gil Quiniones, chief executive of the state power authority. The goal is $500 million in savings over the next decade.But for a technology project to help its customers reduce energy consumption, the state authority went with a start-up, C3 IoT.Brian Hurst, chief analytics officer at Exelon Utilities, a large electric utility corporation based in Chicago, is also working on early-stage projects with GE Digital. Mr. Hurst said the progress was encouraging and he saw no evidence that the cuts at GE Digital had affected their joint work.But it is something he is watching closely. \u201cThe technology is moving so fast,\u201d Mr. Hurst said. \u201cToday\u2019s players may not be tomorrow\u2019s players.\u201dGE Digital, Mr. Ruh insisted, is building a business for the long term. Revenue from the Predix portfolio products reached $550 million last year, he said, and sales are growing rapidly. GE Digital\u2019s total revenue of $4 billion also includes all of G.E.\u2019s traditional industrial software, and the unit\u2019s global work force is more than 4,000.\u201cOur approach is heads-down,\u201d Mr. Ruh said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to show you success.\u201dFor his part, Mr. Flannery has consistently declared his support for G.E.\u2019s digital-industrial vision \u2014 but that does not guarantee the future for GE Digital. Mr. Flannery is selling off businesses to streamline the company. The lighting and railway locomotive divisions are up for sale, and others could follow.A smaller G.E. might not need a stand-alone digital unit. Some analysts recommend putting all the software in the industrial divisions, like power and aviation, closer to customers.\u201cSan Ramon shouldn\u2019t exist,\u201d said Scott Davis, chief executive of Melius Research, an independent financial analysis firm.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "San Francisco Conservatory of Music Gets $46 Million Gift", "Date": "2018-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCapping the celebration of its 100th anniversary, the San Francisco Conservatory of Music on Wednesday announced a gift of $46.4 million from the William K. Bowes, Jr. Foundation, among the largest donations ever to an American music school.The gift will help fund construction of a $185 million, 12-story building on a site just south of San Francisco City Hall. Designed by Mark Cavagnero Associates and scheduled to open in 2020, it will include two concert halls, rehearsal spaces, high-tech studios and classrooms, and will provide housing for the student body.\u201cIt will shape the future of the conservatory, in one of the most exciting pieces of real estate in the world,\u201d David H. Stull, the school\u2019s president, said in a phone interview.Founded in 1917 by Ada Clement and Lillian Hodghead, the San Francisco Conservatory is the oldest independent music school on the West Coast, with luminaries like Yehudi Menuhin and Isaac Stern among the alumni of its youth program. While the school has long emphasized risk-taking and an expansive view of the field, Mr. Stull has pushed it and its curriculum toward the future since becoming president in 2013. Its program in Technology and Applied Composition (TAC), which began offering courses in 2015, has been forging a new identity for the 21st-century composer.Though both composition and technology are fields dominated by men, the TAC program has managed the rare achievement of gender parity, with 13 women and 12 men in its most recently completed cohort. (The conservatory\u2019s traditional composition program had five women and 24 men in the same cohort.)Driving the program\u2019s development has been its executive director, MaryClare Brzytwa, a composer and educator who combines classical training as a flutist with a background in computer music. She led efforts to recruit as visiting faculty women at the top of their fields in tech-related musical careers. Teachers such as the Grammy-winning Leslie Ann Jones (who directs music recording and scoring at Skywalker Sound) and Jaclyn Shumate (an audio director at Microsoft), Ms. Brzytwa said, \u201callow my students to see it as normal for women to have these careers.\u201dTAC complements training in composition with special courses in software and studio technology to equip students for careers in such fields as film scoring and video game sound design, as well as in production. The new building, to be named the Ute and William K. Bowes, Jr. Center for Performing Arts, will house a special \u201ctechnology hall\u201d with a state-of-the-art recording studio and other equipment focused on TAC.\u201cOur students learn how to write classical music and real-world production skills at the same time,\u201d Ms. Brzytwa said. \u201cStylistically, they come from many perspectives \u2014 jazz, classical or electronic music \u2014 and there is a lot of leeway to plan a path of their own. But all of them seem to want rigor.\u201dEven students who are not pursuing composition in the TAC program recognize its influence on the school\u2019s direction. DuMarkus Davis, who is in his second year as a violin student, says he decided to move from his native Atlanta to San Francisco \u201cbecause I wanted to do something involving musical entrepreneurship and wanted to be surrounded by the tech in Silicon Valley. I knew that the TAC program was an element of SFCM. All of that ultimately sold me on the conservatory.\u201dBefore coming to the school for TAC\u2019s one-year professional studies program, Emily Pitts had earned a degree in software engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and then spent five years in the corporate world, pursuing a passion for writing music for film and video games on the side. Even before graduating, she has been hired at Facebook to work with its 360 Spatial Workstation team to design spatial audio for its video player.\u201cIt\u2019s a marriage between my engineering and audio interests,\u201d Ms. Pitts said.\u201cIn the real world, it can feel intimidating, like you\u2019re trying to get into this boys\u2019 club,\u201d she added. \u201cWorking with so many other women and seeing your peers succeed and excel has been great.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech Firms Sign \u2018Digital Geneva Accord\u2019 Not to Aid Governments in Cyberwar", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe principles, which have been circulating among senior executives in the tech industry for weeks, also commit the companies to come to the aid of any nation on the receiving end of such attacks, whether the motive for the attack is \u201ccriminal or geopolitical.\u201d Although the list of firms agreeing to the accord is lengthy, several companies have declined to sign on at least for now, including Google, Apple and Amazon.Perhaps as important, none of the signers come from the countries viewed as most responsible for what Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president, called in an interview \u201cthe devastating attacks of the past year.\u201d Those came chiefly from Russia, North Korea, Iran and, to a lesser degree, China.The impetus for the effort came largely from Mr. Smith, who has been arguing for several years that the world needs a \u201cdigital Geneva Convention\u201d that sets norms of behavior for cyberspace just as the Geneva Conventions set rules for the conduct of war in the physical world. Although there was some progress in setting basic norms of behavior in cyberspace through a United Nations-organized group of experts several years ago, the movement has since faltered.Mr. Smith said over the weekend that the first move needed to come from the American companies that often find themselves acting as the \u201cfirst responders\u201d when cyberattacks hit their customers. \u201cThis has become a much bigger problem, and I think what we have learned in the past few years is that we need to work together in much bigger ways,\u201d Mr. Smith said in an interview. \u201cWe need to approach this in a principled way, and if we expect to get governments to do that, we have to start with some principles ourselves.\u201dYet not all governments are likely to embrace the \u201cCybersecurity Tech Accord\u201d in part because the principles it espouses can run headlong into their own, usually secret efforts to develop cyberweapons.Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor who leaked documents about surveillance programs, revealed pictures suggesting that American officials intercepted some hardware that came out of Cisco Systems, a major manufacturer of the routers and switches that make up the spine of the internet, apparently so the equipment directed traffic back to American intelligence agencies. There is no evidence that Cisco cooperated, but the publication of the photos led some foreign customers to believe that American equipment had been broadly compromised by the N.S.A.Cisco is one of the firms that has signed the accord. Mark Chandler, Cisco\u2019s general counsel, said the company believed that \u201cwe need to say we will not be part of any effort that will undermine the security of the web, or undermine those who depend on it \u2014 our customers.\u201d Among the other signatories were Dell, Juniper Networks, the two parts of the recently-split Hewlett-Packard, Symantec and FireEye. Two foreign firms, Telephonica of Spain and Nokia of Finland, also signed. There are no Chinese or Russian companies on the list of initial signatories.The new technology accord vows that the 31 signers \u201cwill protect against tampering with and exploitation of technology products and services during their development, design, distribution and use.\u201d Among the companies that signed are Oracle, Symantec, FireEye and HP, along with the Finnish company Nokia and the Spanish company Telef\u00f3nica.The cybersecurity coordinator at the White House, Rob Joyce, is widely rumored to be considering leaving his post and returning to the National Security Agency, where he ran the most elite of the cyberforces that attack foreign networks. If Mr. Joyce departs, the White House will have lost its two most senior, and most knowledgeable, cybersecurity policymakers in the span of a few weeks.An earlier version of this story incorrectly referred to the name of one of the signatories on the technology accord.

{"Headline": "Looming China Trade Action Divides Industry and Roils Markets", "Date": "2018-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s promise to take tough action against China\u2019s unfair economic practices was one of his most popular campaign ideas. But as the United States prepares stiff trade measures and China retaliates, stock markets have plummeted and some of America\u2019s biggest companies are pushing back.Industry giants like General Electric and Goldman Sachs, as well as agricultural companies, have lodged objections with the White House, saying that tariffs on both sides of the Pacific and limitations on investments will cut off American companies from the world\u2019s most lucrative and rapidly growing market.Since then, the White House has announced another trade measure targeted at China that would place tariffs on at least $50 billion worth of products imported to the United States and would restrict investment flows between the two economic giants. This week, the Trump administration is expected to announce a list of Chinese imports subject to tariffs, which could include high-tech products like semiconductors as well as cheap electronics and other goods that many Americans buy.Josh Kallmer, the senior vice president for global policy at the Information Technology Industry Council, an advocate for companies like Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and IBM, said his group had been largely supportive of the administration\u2019s targeting of China\u2019s unfair trade practices. But the group had made it clear to the White House that it would not be pleased with any measure that had tariffs \u201cas the primary or even a significant remedy.\u201d\u201cThe reason is that it would be a tax on consumers,\u201d Mr. Kallmer said, \u201cprecisely the people we are trying to support.\u201dThat theory could make it more difficult for American companies to operate in a country that already puts up steep barriers.As Mr. Trump advances a series of tough trade measures to confront these behaviors, however, cracks have appeared in American industry\u2019s seemingly united front.Companies in technology, investment and other industries now say that the measures the administration is taking to help them may actually end up doing irreparable harm to supply chains they have built up over decades. Any American company that wants to be a global player cannot afford to lose access to China\u2019s growing market, executives say.The 25 percent tariff on pork that China imposed on Monday is expected to be particularly harmful, including in regions that supported the president, like Iowa, North Carolina and Indiana. Last year, American farmers sent more than a billion dollars\u2019 worth of pork to China, their largest export market by value after Japan and Mexico.\u201cBecause we\u2019re so blessed to have America feed the world, we\u2019re also the first industry to get slammed whenever there are trade difficulties between the U.S. and other countries,\u201d Denise Bode, the coordinator for the American Fruit and Vegetable Processors and Growers Coalition.\u201cAmerican farmers appear to be the first casualties of an escalating trade war,\u201d said Max Baucus, a former Democratic senator from Montana and a chairman of a group called Farmers for Free Trade. \u201cWith farm incomes already declining, farmers rely on export markets to stay above water. These new tariffs are a drag on their ability to make ends meet.\u201dHowever, analysts and companies involved in China said that these measures appeared unlikely to adequately resolve American concerns about China\u2019s longstanding encroachment on American intellectual property.Companies are waiting anxiously for the administration to release a list of Chinese products this week that will be subject to tariffs \u2014 most likely the kind of high-tech products that the administration has accused China of targeting. The retail industry, which lobbied the administration and Congress against an early plan to impose tariffs on Chinese-made apparel and footwear, is now cautiously optimistic that its products will be exempt.G.E. and IBM, which operate through joint ventures and other partnerships in China and around the world, have both lobbied against the expansion of Cfius over concerns that restrictions on joint ventures with foreign companies that include the transfer of valuable skills or technology could weaken the position of American companies abroad.Financial firms, including Goldman Sachs and the Carlyle Group, have also expressed concern about investment restrictions, saying they could provide a drag on the United States economy.White House advisers, in turn, have complained that previous approaches to dealing with China have not worked, and that companies are overreacting to legitimate trade measures.Speaking Monday on CNBC, the White House trade adviser, Peter Navarro, defended the administration\u2019s tough actions on China and said investors should not fear a trade war.\u201cEverybody needs to relax,\u201d Mr. Navarro said. \u201cThe economy is as strong as an ox.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Silicon Valley Shouldn\u2019t Work With the Pentagon", "Date": "2018-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMr. Malcomson is the author of \u201cSplinternet: How Geopolitics and Commerce Are Fragmenting the World Wide Web.\u201dIs Silicon Valley going to war? In 2013, Amazon beat IBM for a contract to host the United States intelligence community\u2019s data cloud. Microsoft now markets Azure Government Secret, its cloud-computing service designed specifically for federal and local governments, to the Defense Department and intelligence agencies. And last year, Google signed a contract with the Pentagon for Project Maven, a pilot program to accelerate the military\u2019s use of artificial intelligence.These partnerships might ease anxiety in the Defense Department about China\u2019s artificial-intelligence advances and ominous, state-led fusion of civil and military technology development. But a comparable fusion of the United States government and Silicon Valley would be a mistake.Narrowing the focus of the United States tech sector to the needs of the military would serve neither party. On the contrary, it would make the nation weaker.To be sure, defense contracts are hardly new in Silicon Valley, and Google\u2019s recent moves might be seen as heralding Silicon Valley\u2019s return to its natural home in defense contracting. But that would be to misunderstand both Silicon Valley history and today\u2019s technology.The internet and much of digital computing did indeed emerge from decades of United States defense contracts, beginning as long ago as World War I. Yet the Pentagon itself sloughed off the internet \u2014 not knowing quite what to do with it, and rightly judging it to be insecure \u2014 to the National Science Foundation. When the internet became a commercial concern, the National Science Foundation off-loaded it to the Department of Commerce. Government might have given birth to the internet, but it sure didn\u2019t raise it.The emergence of a civilian, entrepreneurial tech culture in the 1970s owed as much intellectually, if not (at first) financially, to the antiwar movement and the 1960s counterculture \u2014 hardly friends of the military-industrial complex. Out of this the dominant, highly creative ethos of geek antiauthoritarianism grew. It is hard to believe that closer ties with the military would perpetuate this culture of innovation.The technology involved in projects like Azure Government Secret and Project Maven is also very different from the data-sharing projects of the 1960s. Those older technologies would not have been created in the absence of government funding. Today\u2019s projects, in contrast, are all basically A.I. plays. Very little of this is defense-specific, but all of it is useful for defense and espionage. Unlike, say, weapons development, A.I. research is inherently dual-use. United States tech giants would be pursuing it with or without government contracts. Silicon Valley does not need the Pentagon to initiate these endeavors.The Pentagon is in a different position. It came around very reluctantly to the idea that it is dependent on private industry for the defense of the country and the projection of American power. But come around it has, in no small part thanks to China.The United States military seems to have been spooked. In a 2017 memo, the deputy secretary of defense, Robert O. Work, wrote that while the Defense Department had made \u201ctentative steps\u201d in A.I., \u201cwe need to do much more, and move much faster.\u201d The memo announced the formation of Project Maven to do just that. This month, Gen. Stephen Wilson, the vice chief of staff for the Air Force, said that China is taking a \u201cwhole of nation\u201d approach to A.I. and the United States should, too.Yet we shouldn\u2019t forget that civil-military antagonism and the deep American tradition of distrusting the state have been crucial to the United States\u2019 ability to innovate. There are good reasons why defense-tech giants of the 1960s, \u201970s and \u201980s like Raytheon and Grumman missed out on such major tech advances as Web protocols, the smartphone, personal computers and various types of encryption \u2014 all of which would eventually have great military significance. The biggest reason was that none of these advances were directed at waging war; indeed, many aimed at transcending the power of the state.After the Cold War, the Soviet Union\u2019s extraordinary technological capacity dissipated in large part because it had been so reactive: The Soviets had let their adversary determine the pace and scope of their own innovation. The United States should not make that mistake.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "White House Turf Battle Threatens to Delay Tax Law Rollout", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A power struggle between two of President Trump\u2019s top cabinet members threatens to delay implementation of the new tax law and could give lobbyists and political hands in the White House greater ability to shape critical decisions about which types of businesses benefit from the law.The White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget, headed by Mick Mulvaney, and the Treasury Department, run by Steven Mnuchin, are at odds over whether to end Treasury\u2019s traditional independence in writing tax regulations and to give the budget office more oversight of those rules. If an agreement is not reached soon, the president may have to weigh in and make the decision himself.Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Mulvaney, who are among Mr. Trump\u2019s top economic lieutenants, have largely been in sync on the shape and direction of the tax law. Both supported lowering corporate taxes and using the tax code to discourage companies from shifting operations overseas.Where they differ, however, is over who has the ultimate authority to interpret the many lingering questions that will need to be answered in the coming months and years, including which types of companies qualify as \u201cpass-through\u201d businesses eligible for the 20 percent deduction and how broadly the international tax provisions aimed at preventing profit shifting should apply.The Treasury Department, which issues tax regulations through the Internal Revenue Service and offers guidance that dictates how the tax code is applied, will have broad discretion in determining the effects of the law. It has long been exempt from the type of cost-benefit analysis that the Office of Management and Budget performs on most rules that government agencies issue.Some congressional Republicans are rooting for Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s office to wield greater oversight of the tax law, in the hopes that it would push for the most lenient interpretations of regulations that enable the largest number of businesses to pay lower rates under the law. Other lawmakers and business groups are pulling for Mr. Mnuchin, believing that adding review by the Office of Management and Budget could slow down the creation of regulations that businesses say they need to make investment and tax planning decisions this year.Mr. Mulvaney has taken the view that tax regulations issued by the Treasury are of significant economic importance and that decisions that determine the fate of hundreds of millions of dollars are being made without sufficient scrutiny by his office. The budget office analyzes regulations issued by agencies across the federal government, with its Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs determining whether agencies have sufficiently addressed problems during rule-making and either accepting regulations or sending them back to be reworked.The Treasury Department does consult the budget office on some of its rule-making, but since a 1983 memorandum of understanding, the office has not had the authority to review the Treasury\u2019s tax guidance, on the theory that it is not economically significant enough to warrant it.Greater accountability, however, could come with costs.If Mr. Mulvaney wins the argument, \u201cit will slow the process down,\u201d said John A. Koskinen, a former I.R.S. commissioner whose term ended last year. \u201cIf you had all the regulations coming out of Treasury and I.R.S. subject to more review and delays, it would not be making taxpayers, accountants and lawyers happy. They are pushing to get that information as quickly as they can.\u201dSince the passage of the tax bill late last year, negotiations between Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Mulvaney have grown increasingly vigorous, with both sides laying claim to being the law\u2019s final arbiter.A change would be seen as a win for Mr. Mulvaney, who has made deregulation a priority in the White House. It would also be a blow to Mr. Mnuchin, who has been the tax bill\u2019s most public defender on behalf of Mr. Trump, diminishing his department\u2019s authority under his watch.The potential change in regulatory oversight could have major implications, both logistical and political.Adding a cost-benefit analysis by the budget office into the process would potentially add another layer of red tape \u2014 which Mr. Trump famously hates in other areas of regulation \u2014 to a process that is already proceeding too slowly for many business groups\u2019 liking. Treasury officials are concerned that the budget office lacks the resources and tax expertise to properly assess tax guidance and that the process will get bogged down, potentially delaying rules to clarify the law for months. One early hurdle would be hiring; the budget office does not currently employ its own team of tax lawyers.\u201cThere\u2019s a moderate level of concern that it could potentially slow down the guidance process,\u201d said Ken Spain, a partner at CGCN Group, a lobbying firm with a number of tax-related clients. \u201cAny time you blur the lines on what is already a tricky process to navigate, it\u2019s going to give the business community some degree of heartburn.\u201dOfficials from previous administrations also say that opening the tax regulation effort beyond Treasury would invite not just comments from the budget office, but from the White House political team and other advisory groups in the government.\u201cMidlevel political appointees get their fingers in there, find out when the meetings are and have their opinions,\u201d said Adam Looney, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution who served in President Barack Obama\u2019s Treasury Department.Such an expansion, Mr. Looney said, also offers more avenues for lobbyists to press their case for why their clients should receive more preferable tax treatment. \u201cThe swamp is going to be enriched by this one,\u201d he said.Budget office officials say the desire for final oversight over the tax bill is in line with the administration\u2019s deregulatory push and that a more uniform approach to rule-making would benefit the federal government. They point to a 2016 Government Accountability Office report concluding that the agreement that has made Treasury an exception is outdated and that the department has been inconsistent in documenting its guidance process.Republican leaders in Congress have walked a delicate line as the dispute plays out. Julia Slingsby, a spokeswoman for Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said last week that Mr. Brady \u201cappreciates the different, complementary roles that O.M.B. and Treasury play with respect to tax code regulations.\u201d\u201cThe Ways and Means Committee has partnered with Treasury on developing the pro-growth tax reform legislation and we look forward to it continuing the partnership as Treasury and O.M.B. do their work on the regulations,\u201d she said.Administration officials have suggested that a compromise could be reached within weeks.\u201cWe have been working productively with O.M.B. and are very pleased with the process,\u201d said Tony Sayegh, assistant secretary for public affairs at the Treasury. \u201cWe look forward to a resolution in the near future.\u201dMeghan Burris, a budget office spokeswoman said, \u201cWe do not discuss ongoing, pre-decisional processes and negotiations.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Microsoft, No. 17-2, had seemed poised to be one of the most important of the current term. It posed the question of whether a 1986 law, enacted before the dawn of the big-data era, applied to digital information stored outside the nation\u2019s borders.When the case was argued, several justices said Congress rather than the court should act to define the limits of privacy in the digital age.\u201cIf Congress takes a look at this, realizing that much time and innovation has occurred since 1986, it can write a statute that takes account of various interests,\u201d Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said. \u201cIf Congress wants to regulate in this brave new world, it should do it.Congress did. On March 23, it enacted the Cloud Act \u2014 more formally, the Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act. The new law, unlike the one from 1986, clearly applied to data held overseas.The dispute arose from a federal drug investigation in which prosecutors sought a suspect\u2019s emails that were stored in a Microsoft data center in Dublin. They said they were entitled to the emails because Microsoft is based in the United States. The suspect\u2019s nationality has not been made public.A federal magistrate judge in New York granted the government\u2019s request to issue a warrant for the data under the 1986 federal law, the Stored Communications Act. A federal district judge agreed.Microsoft challenged the warrant, arguing that prosecutors could not force it to hand over customer emails stored abroad.After the new law was passed, the government withdrew the earlier warrant and obtained a new one. In recent Supreme Court filings, both sides told the justices that the case was moot.\u201cThere is no reason,\u201d Microsoft\u2019s lawyers wrote, \u201cfor this court to resolve a legal issue that is now of only historical interest.\u201d\u201cCongress was always the proper forum for updating the 1986 law,\u201d they wrote, \u201cand Congress has now acted.\u201dThe Supreme Court agreed, saying the case was moot and vacating the appeals court\u2019s decision.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is Putin a C.I.A. Agent?", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistPresident Trump\u2019s steadfast reluctance to say anything negative about Russia is so striking that a former director of national intelligence, James Clapper, once observed that Vladimir Putin manages Trump as if he we were a Russian intelligence \u201casset.\u201d He may be. But if I were a Russian citizen, I\u2019d be asking this question: Is Putin a U.S. agent?Why? Because Putin has undertaken so many actions in recent years that contributed to the weakening of Russia\u2019s economy and human capital base that you have to wonder whether he\u2019s secretly on the C.I.A.\u2019s payroll.Beginning around 2007 or 2008, Putin appears to have decided that rebuilding Russia by nurturing its tremendous human talent and strengthening the rule of law was just too hard \u2014 it would have required sharing power, holding real, competitive elections and building a truly diverse, innovation-based economy.Instead, Putin decided to look for dignity for Russia in all the wrong places: by tapping his oil and gas wells, not his people; by strengthening the Russian military, instead of the rule of law; and by enriching himself and his circle of oligarchs while wrapping himself in a cloak of Russian Orthodoxy and Russian nationalism that appealed to his base.For all his shirtless bravado, and despite all the recent talk about how Putin is proving to be a successful authoritarian, I have one question: Then why is Putin so insecure about his real popularity in Russia that even after nearly 20 years at Russia\u2019s helm, he was afraid to allow a single credible independent candidate to run against him in the latest presidential election?Here\u2019s the real truth: Putin consistently acts like a farmer who sells his most valuable beef in return for cubes of sugar. That is, he looks for short-term sugar highs to boost his popularity with his Russian nationalist base because he is insecure, and pays for it by giving up real beef, leaving Russia weaker in the long term.Beef for sugar \u2014 not a good trade.For instance, in 2014 Putin seized Crimea and invaded Eastern Ukraine with disguised Russian troops \u2014 to get a short-term sugar boost with the Russian electorate \u2014 and in return, he has had to live with long-term economic banking sanctions imposed by the West that help to slow Russia\u2019s growth.In 2015, to prove that Russia was still a superpower \u2014 another short-term sugar high for his base \u2014 Putin sent advisers, Russian Air Force jets, special operations teams and surface-to-air missile batteries to Syria to prevent the toppling of Russia\u2019s Cold War ally, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Putin\u2019s support, along with the help of Iran, has just barely kept Assad upright, but for now Putin is stuck in the middle of Syria and can\u2019t get out, lest Assad falls and Putin looks foolish.In Syria, Russia is discovering that winning the war might be easier than winning the peace. Each time President Putin declares victory or announces a drawdown of Russian forces, like he did in December, the fighting flares up with a new intensity and Moscow is required to fly in reinforcements \u2026 Moscow is now struggling to parlay its military gains into an internationally legitimate political settlement that would help Russia recoup its investments in the conflict. For now, Syria remains ungovernable and splintered into fiefdoms run by regional players with their own interests.Putin\u2019s latest beef-for-sugar trade was his apparent ordering of the use of a military-grade nerve agent, produced only in Russia, to poison the former Russian spy Sergei V. Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, in the English city of Salisbury. The Western response has been what British Prime Minister Theresa May described as the biggest collective expulsion of alleged Russian intelligence officers ever \u2014 over 100 from more than 20 countries.Whether timed or coincidental, the poisoning attack and the Western backlash helped Putin run up his vote totals in his latest phony presidential re-election \u2014 another sugar high. But the morning after, Putin\u2019s Russia is more isolated than ever. Also, Putin\u2019s cronies and other Russian oligarchs \u2014 whose game is to make tons of dirty money in Russia and then take it to London, where it can be laundered for safekeeping \u2014 are now getting more scrutinized than ever by British authorities.Putin\u2019s troubles are nothing I celebrate. I was against NATO expansion; I wanted Russia integrated into the family of European democracies. A weak, isolated and humiliated Russia is a dangerous animal. But to thrive in the long term, Russia needs a \u201creset,\u201d and it can come only from within, but Putin won\u2019t press the button.It\u2019s sad to see a country that gave us Tchaikovsky, Tolstoy, Spassky, Sakharov, Stravinsky, Shishkin, Dostoyevsky, Solzhenitsyn, Pushkin, Nureyev and the Google co-founder Sergey Brin become better known for giving the world Novichok, the deadly Russian nerve agent used in Britain; \u201clittle green men,\u201d the disguised Russian soldiers who seized Eastern Ukraine; and Guccifer 2.0, the Russian cyberagent who hacked the Democratic National Committee in 2016.It\u2019s all beef for sugar \u2014 and that\u2019s Putin\u2019s legacy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Mr. Gates Went to Washington", "Date": "2018-04-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Mark Zuckerberg show in Washington this past week stirred memories for Senator Orrin G. Hatch. The global interest, the overflow crowds and the gavel-to-gavel media coverage, the 84-year-old Utah Republican observed, was \u201cthe most intense public scrutiny I\u2019ve seen for a tech-related hearing since the Microsoft hearing.\u201dTwenty years ago, the tech titan in the Senate hot seat was another Harvard dropout, Bill Gates, co-founder and chief executive of Microsoft. At the time, Microsoft was the most feared corporate powerhouse in America, and the target of government investigations for uncompetitive practices. Mr. Gates was its fearless leader \u2014 and he made it clear that he wouldn\u2019t change his ways for Washington.If Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s conciliatory performance in front of multiple congressional committees was any guide, he took the history lesson to heart. It also showed how many debates about the technology industry have evolved from traditional antitrust issues to more complex issues like privacy and the companies\u2019 role in democracy.Mr. Gates used the forum to explain Microsoft\u2019s role at the forefront of an \u201cindustry that has revolutionized the world in only 25 years.\u201d At times, he seemed to be lecturing the less intelligent. And any criticism of Microsoft he seemed to regard as a personal attack. \u201cWhat do you mean me, too?\u201d he snapped at one point.The policy issue, according to Mr. Gates, was clear: \u201cWill the United States continue its breathtaking technological advances?\u201d T he question \u201ccan be answered resoundingly yes \u2014 if innovation is not restricted by government,\u201d he said.\u201cAs I hope my testimony today has made clear, the computer software industry is not broken, and there is no need to fix it,\u201d Mr. Gates said.He wasn\u2019t alone. The company\u2019s leadership could be downright belligerent in its public statements. At a company event, Steve Ballmer, then a top executive and later Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, made a memorable personal attack on the attorney general of the United States.\u201cTo heck with Janet Reno,\u201d Mr. Ballmer said, a sentence that still makes current and former Microsoft executives cringe two decades later.A spokesman for Microsoft declined to comment, as did representatives for Mr. Gates and Mr. Ballmer.It was clear from the start of Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony that he had arrived in Washington with a different message. Shedding his hoodie for a suit, and intensively coached, he appeared humbled and deferential to his congressional interlocutors, even when facing the types of technically unsophisticated questions that easily vexed Mr. Gates during his time in the hot seat.Mr. Zuckerberg, 33, apologized repeatedly for not doing enough to halt the issue at hand \u2014 the spread of misinformation on Facebook and the unauthorized use of personal data by outside firms.\u201cWe didn\u2019t take a broad enough view of our responsibility, and that was a big mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was my mistake, and I\u2019m sorry.\u201dThe difference was clear, said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, who has seen both Facebook and Microsoft up close. He questioned Mr. Zuckerberg in Congress, and in the 1990s, as Connecticut\u2019s attorney general, he helped lead the states\u2019 antitrust assault on Microsoft.\u201cFacebook has already taken very much to heart the clear lessons of Microsoft, which is to engage fully and aggressively in dialogue with federal powers,\u201d he said by phone. \u201cMicrosoft basically refused to have any real conversations with D.O.J. or the states before we filed suit. Essentially, it stonewalled negotiations before there was a judgment by the courts.\u201dAsked if the example of Microsoft had guided any of Facebook\u2019s strategy in dealing with federal powers, a Facebook spokeswoman said, \u201cAs Mark told Congress, we made mistakes and we\u2019re taking action to make sure that they don\u2019t happen again.\u201cEverything we\u2019re doing has been guided by the understanding that we need to do better,\u201d the spokeswoman, Vanessa Chan, added.By March 1998, when Mr. Gates appeared in Congress, Microsoft seemed all but invincible, its market dominance and ambitions at their peak. It had made forays into online commerce, media and advertising, and executives in one industry after another anxiously awaited the company\u2019s next move.Bankers raised the specter of a new online rival: The First National Bank of Redmond they called it, referring to Microsoft\u2019s headquarters in Redmond, Wash. Rupert Murdoch declared that the company he feared most was Microsoft. Microsoft had its own online magazine, Slate, as well as newsroom and programming studios, and it joined forces with NBC to help start MSNBC.The first internet boom was also in full swing, and Microsoft\u2019s Windows software \u2014 the operating system on 90 percent of the world\u2019s personal computers \u2014 controlled that gateway to the future with its browser, Internet Explorer.But there was an insurgent in Microsoft\u2019s world, the Silicon Valley start-up Netscape, creator of the first commercially successful internet browser. The browser had the potential to be the on ramp to the internet, undermining Windows. Microsoft portrayed Internet Explorer as a mere feature of its operating system. The software giant was intent on winning the \u201cbrowser war\u201d with Netscape, using every weapon it had to squelch the upstart.The federal government and several states investigated Microsoft\u2019s behavior. Years of tangles with competition regulators in Europe followed, along with a string of private antitrust lawsuits.After it lost the federal antitrust case in America, Microsoft, with little choice, sued for peace, spending billions of dollars in settlements and fines. It submitted to monitors who would file regular reports on the company\u2019s compliance with its settlements. Several years later, Mr. Gates gave up day-to-day control of the company and became the country\u2019s leading philanthropist.\u201cThe view was that government was irrelevant and we can do anything we want,\u201d said David Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School, who has studied Microsoft for years. \u201cThere was little respect for government, and that was the culture inside Microsoft at the time.\u201dToday, Facebook finds itself squarely in the public spotlight, but confronting a different set of policy challenges.The concern about Microsoft was economic. Consumers might pay somewhat higher prices, but mainly they would suffer because future innovations would be thwarted.Facebook is under attack because of privacy concerns, its data-handling practices and its vulnerability to be used by others to spread lies, hatred and political propaganda. The main worry is that the social network is being manipulated to shape human behavior. And Facebook\u2019s data harvesting and the potential impact are far more personal than anything Microsoft did.Tom Rubin, a former senior lawyer at Microsoft who is now a lecturer at Stanford University, sees many parallels between the government scrutiny of Microsoft and of Facebook, which he discussed with a class on tech policy at the school this past week.\u201cThey both involve an allegation that a digital gatekeeper, with insufficient internal controls, drove for dominance by harming the ecosystem in which it operates,\u201d said Mr. Rubin, who was an assistant United States attorney before joining Microsoft.But the stakes now, he said, are higher than in the days when the public was still figuring out how to get onto the internet. \u201cCompetition in the marketplace for browsers pales in comparison to protecting personal privacy and a functioning democracy,\u201d Mr. Rubin said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to conceive of a higher priority for legislators and regulators than that.\u201dOne risk for Facebook could come from an emerging group of antitrust experts who advocate expanding the definition of consumer welfare beyond pricing and innovation, to include the impact on workers, small retailers and privacy. The German antitrust authorities are pursuing a case against Facebook alleging that its market dominance essentially forces users to accept a service that violates their privacy.But that approach, most experts say, is a stretch, particularly in the United States.\u201cThe idea is that they\u2019re big, so antitrust should be used to address the problem,\u201d said Andrew I. Gavil, a law professor at Howard University. \u201cBut if you\u2019re looking for a privacy remedy, antitrust is not the right tool.\u201dAn alternative threat is much stricter privacy regulation, following the European lead. The European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, which goes into effect next month, is far more restrictive than data collection and trading practices in America. It requires companies to collect and store only the minimum amount of user data needed to provide a specific, stated service.In the United States, that would mean stronger laws and more resources for privacy and data-protection enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission and states.\u201cThat is arguably a much more effective solution to this kind of problem \u2014 get the privacy regime right,\u201d said William Kovacic, an antitrust expert at the George Washington University Law School and a former chairman of the F.T.C.But like the antitrust concerns, any major overhaul of privacy law in Washington appears unlikely anytime soon.Still, the smart move for Facebook, said A. Douglas Melamed, who was a senior antitrust official in the Justice Department during the Microsoft case, would be to depart from the old Microsoft playbook of resistance and embrace new, tougher rules on privacy and data-handling practices \u2014 and help guide them.\u201cThat would move the conversation away from \u2018Are these bad guys?\u2019 to \u2018How can we work together to solve these problems?\u2019\u201d Mr. Melamed, a professor at Stanford Law School, said. \u201cAnd if Facebook really does that, Mark Zuckerberg is likely to get answers he can live with and that actually might be helpful.\u201dWhat Facebook wants to avoid, said Charles Fitzgerald, a former Microsoft strategist who is now an angel investor in tech start-ups, is what happened to Microsoft: The double whammy of government and legal entanglements and a stock price in the dumps had consequences for Microsoft\u2019s ability to hold on to talent.Facebook, he said, could see the same phenomenon if its growth slows and employees tire of oversight and constant attacks on the company\u2019s reputation.\u201cThe combination of a flat or declining stock price and having to spend lots of time on miserable legal issues instead of building product made a lot of people rethink how they wanted to spend their days,\u201d Mr. Fitzgerald said. \u201cAnd Facebook employees may have a harder time gazing in an ethical mirror.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Three Reasons Deutsche Bank Didn\u2019t Exit Wall Street Earlier: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Thursday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Deutsche Bank is finally, and drastically, shrinking itself.\u2022 Facebook can afford to clean up its act.\u2022 Is the problem with I.P.O.s a \u2018middle-market tax\u2019?\u2022 On today\u2019s earnings calendar: Amazon, Microsoft, PepsiCo and Lazard.Since the financial crisis a decade ago, the German institution\u2019s giant investment banking operations have lagged well behind those of its rivals. And Deutsche Bank\u2019s problems had relevance well beyond the trading desks of Wall Street; its difficulties have at times pumped uncertainty into the global financial system. Deutsche Bank\u2019s post-crisis behavior stands in contrast to that of other European investment banks that had also become risky and bloated before the 2008 meltdown. Switzerland\u2019s Credit Suisse and UBS made hard decisions several years ago that helped them adapt to new realities. But Deutsche Bank wavered and delayed. And since this probably won\u2019t be the last time that a too-big-to-fail bank takes too long to fix itself, it\u2019s worth asking why Deutsche Bank dragged its feet. Some reasons follow:- Peter EavisDeutsche Bank\u2019s decision to end its Wall Street ambitions should benefit its American rivals.The German lender said on Thursday that it was scaling back operations such as trading and providing services to hedge funds. According to a note from Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Deutsche Bank\u2019s decision to shrink its investment banking business should \u201chelp industry pricing and provide a revenue opportunity\u201d for United States banks.Deutsche Bank\u2019s scale of tradingLast year Deutsche Bank had a 7.7 percent share of the trading in bonds, currencies and commodities, and a 5.1 percent share of stock trading.Deutsche Bank reported \u20ac4.4 billion in revenue from fixed-income trading last year and another \u20ac2.1 billion from equity trading. Of the combined \u20ac6.5 billion in revenue it generated, 40 percent came from the United States, according to a note from Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.Which banks stand to benefitJPMorgan, Bank of America and Citigroup should get a lift from Deutsche Bank\u2019s pull back from fixed-income trading. The three banks\u2019 market share of fixed-income trading is nearly 50 percent.For stock trading, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan have about 45 percent of the market.Amazon\u2019s profit more than doubled during the first quarter, while Microsoft\u2019s earnings jumped 35 percent. A driver for both companies was their cloud-computing businesses.Amazon\u2019s numbers\u2022 The e-commerce giant reported a profit of $1.6 billion, up from $724 million a year ago.\u2022 Earnings per share came in at $3.27. Analysts expected $1.26 per share, according to Thomson Reuters.\u2022 Revenue jumped 43 percent to $51 billion, beating analysts\u2019 expectations of $49.78 billion.\u2022 Operating income increased 92 percent to $1.9 billion in the first quarter.\u2022 Sales for Amazon Web Services, its cloud-computing business, increased 49 percent to $5.4 billion.Critic\u2019s corner\u201cSales have more than doubled in five years, but it\u2019s taking more fixed assets to get there. Amazon now uses property and such with less efficiency than Walmart.\u201dMicrosoft\u2019s numbers\u2022 The software giant posted a profit of $7.42 billion, up from $5.49 billion a year ago.\u2022 Earnings per share came in at 95 cents. Analysts expected 85 cents per share.\u2022 Revenue rose 16 percent to $26.82 billion, beating expectations of $25.77 billion.\u2022 Operating income rose 23 percent to $8.3 billion.\u2022 Revenue at Azure, Microsoft\u2019s could-computing business, surged 93 percent.Shares of Amazon climbed 7 percent after hours, while Microsoft\u2019s stock rose 2.1 percent.Critics\u2019 cornerSince hitting an intraday low of $150.80 on March 28, the stock has climbed 15 percent and reclaimed more than $60 billion in market value.Ross Sandler, an analyst at Barclays, writes:\u201cWe don\u2019t think 1Q marks the \u201call clear\u201d for FB shares by any means, but given the drubbing over the past two months, we think it may start an overdue stabilization period (next week\u2019s f8 should also help move the conversation back to innovation to some degree). Stepping back, FB\u2019s valuation is attractive vs. its peers, and while we fully expect more tape-bombs in 2018 we think patient investors will be rewarded at current levels when sentiment eventually improves.\u201dFacebook\u2019s first-quarter earnings featured a 63 percent jump in profit and a 49 percent rise in revenue. And roughly 70 million new monthly active users.Peter Eavis\u2019s take: If Facebook wants to spend more on protecting its community, it can: Its operating earnings are equivalent to 46 percent of its revenue. But its expense numbers haven\u2019t provided clear evidence that the company is going the extra mile yet.The key assessment, from the Pivotal analyst Brian Wieser:\u201cAll the data privacy issues, the congressional hearings, none of that will get as much scrutiny from investors as the bottom line.\u201dThe chipmaker reported results Wednesday that topped Wall Street\u2019s expectations. The conference call that followed provided analysts an opportunity to ask about where Qualcomm\u2019s acquisition of NXP stands. The deal is awaiting approval from Chinese regulators, but growing trade tension between China and the United States has increasingly put the deal in doubt.Here is what Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm\u2019s chief executive, said on the call:\u201cWe continue to work closely with China. The environment is obviously quite difficult from a geopolitical point of view, at least right now. However, we expect to ultimately receive approval. And I\u2019ll just remind folks that we have 8 of 9 jurisdictions that have already ruled on it. So although we \u2014 we remain committed to it. And we think it\u2019s going to get done. However, if it does not get done, as you mentioned, we think we have the ability to move very rapidly on a buyback as we communicated earlier in the January time frame. I\u2019ll just remind everyone that we did a 90-day extension to the merger agreement. And we\u2019re going to work very hard to get that done. And if it doesn\u2019t get done, we\u2019re going to move on to another approach. So hopefully, that answers the question.\u201dA bit later in the call Mr. Mollenkopf added:\u201cWith respect to MOFCOM and remedies, our evaluation of the environment is such that really, I think the issue is probably more related to the higher-level discussions between the countries as opposed to any individual issue related to MOFCOM. Of course, we continue to work with the regulators and work through any issues that pop up. But I think the environmental issues between the countries are probably more the situation today than anything else. But obviously, we work closely with the regulator.\u201dIt\u2019s not just regulations like Sarbanes-Oxley that put smaller companies off public listings, argues Rob Jackson, a Democratic S.E.C. commissioner \u2014 it\u2019s the fact that they pay on average 7 percent of proceeds raised in their offerings, way more than bigger clients.\u201cWith the deck stacked against them, it\u2019s no wonder that middle-market I.P.O.s have been on a steady decline. And this has had real effects across our economy, which is now dominated by fewer, and larger, public companies than ever before.\u201dHe suggests the S.E.C. should make underwriters disclose more about the costs of going public, including companies\u2019 potential losses from underpricing, and that bankers should do more to explain why they\u2019re worth their fees.What Jeffrey Lurie, the owner of the Philadelphia Eagles, said, according to the NYT:\u201cWe\u2019ve got to be careful not to be baited by Trump or whomever else.\u201dBob Kraft of the New England Patriots, a friend of Mr. Trump, said:\u201cThe problem we have is, we have a president who will use that as fodder to do his mission that I don\u2019t feel is in the best interests of America.\u201dThere\u2019s no question that it will help make sense of Randall Stephenson\u2019s expansion of AT&T into the pay-TV market and improve AT&T\u2019s positioning and value proposition.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Seattle Radio Station KEXP Celebrates a $10 Million Gift", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Monday, the 46-year-old station announced a bequest of just under $10 million from an anonymous donor known as Suzanne. The station\u2019s executive director, Thomas Mara, believes it is the largest-ever gift to a single U.S. public radio station. The donation will create a permanent endowment, secure six months\u2019 continuous cash reserves and fund a full-time education and outreach team.While the nature of a 24-hour live radio station doesn\u2019t easily allow for an all-hands office meeting, Mr. Mara, 54, described the jubilant atmosphere at the station after informing the staff via email. \u201cIt was deeply moving to simply watch people\u2019s expressions,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of smiling, head shaking, even some tears.\u201dSuzanne died in 2016 and her estate lawyers informed the station of the gift in February 2017. For the last year, the station\u2019s leadership and board kept the gift under wraps while they received a crash course in setting up a permanent endowment.\u201cThere is not a manual for this,\u201d Mr. Mara said. The gift is larger than the station\u2019s average two-year cash budget of $8 million, half of which comes from individual donations. In addition to providing financial stability, he intends for the gift to allow more musician workshops on topics like securing festival bookings, understanding contracts and staying healthy on tour.\u201cThanks to Suzanne we\u2019ll be able to play a better role as a guide to musicians,\u201d Mr. Mara said.Suzanne toured the facility while it was under construction and signed her name on an interior wall that was later covered. \u201cAs staff we know her name is literally on the walls of KEXP,\u201d Mr. Mara said.On Monday, the afternoon D.J. Kevin Cole, one of several staff members who knew the donor\u2019s tastes in soul, new wave, punk and ska, played a 45-minute tribute with songs by the English Beat, Sharon Jones and the Cure. \u201cWe are humbled and honored to receive this incredible generosity from Suzanne,\u201d he said after starting the set with Leonard Cohen\u2019s \u201cSuzanne.\u201d\u201cBecause our D.J.s have been given the exclusive responsibility to select the music that you hear, you get to know our D.J.s by listening to the songs they think need to be heard,\u201d Mr. Mara said. \u201cThat creates a powerful connection and I think that was a major reason why Suzanne connected so strongly with us.\u201dSuzanne, who lived out of state but has Seattle-area family, was a listener since the 1990s. She described KEXP\u2019s role in her life in a testimonial that she recorded before her death and that was broadcast during the tribute.\u201cWhen I told my uncle that my favorite radio station had just gone off the air, he turned me on to KEXP,\u201d she said. \u201cMusic is one of the best ways to unite people globally, and I love an organization which spreads that goodness.\u201dShe concluded with donors\u2019 customary signoff during testimonials, whatever their gift: \u201cI\u2019m Suzanne, and I power KEXP.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "Today, the answers are increasingly nuanced, characterized by a cycle of changes in the workplace \u2014 in large part catalyzed by tech \u2014 that provoke the anticipation of even more change. No longer is there a simple binary view of the old, traditional way of doing work typified by corner offices and strict dress codes, and the new, modern worker that does what they want, from wherever they are.A more enlightened view of how work is evolving takes cues from more than a century of office culture, while also incorporating cutting-edge advances in collaboration. These forces may seem paradoxical, even oppositional, but they can also be complementary. We\u2019ll take a look at how some of the most drastic changes in the modern workplace have evolved to redefine what it means to work smarter.The truth is, except for a blip from 1995 to 2005, overall productivity in Western economies has been largely stagnant for the past 50 years. Workers may feel more free, but, at least according to traditional measures, they\u2019re not producing much more.And for many workers, separated from the interpersonal exchange of traditional offices, mobility has left them feeling disoriented. People want autonomy but, it turns out, they still crave structure and social interaction.After IBM sold its PC manufacturing division, for example, it encouraged its employees to work from wherever they wanted. Eventually, those employees quipped that IBM stood for \u201cI\u2019m By Myself.\u201d They wanted an office to go to \u2014 at least part of the time.\u201cThat\u2019s the surprise,\u201d said Arvind Malhotra, a professor at the Kenan-Flagler Business School at the University of North Carolina who has studied workforce dynamics for over 20 years. \u201cIt\u2019s a tacit admission that human contact has value in building organizational culture.\u201dIronically, the workers who most expect mobility \u2014 younger employees \u2014 are most adversely affected by it. One of the greatest causes of workplace anxiety, according to Malhotra, is a lack of mentorship.\u201cAround 2001,\u201d Malhotra said, \u201cI started to hear young employees saying, \u2018I feel like my boss doesn\u2019t know that I\u2019m working on really good stuff\u2019 and \u2018I\u2019m not getting the one-on-one time with my mentor.\u2019\u201dOn-the-job training is most intense in the early years of a career. Working from a cafe might result in great coffee options, but it robs young workers of crucial learning opportunities and mentorship when they need those most.Albert H. Segars, Malhotra\u2019s collaborator and the PNC Distinguished Professor of Strategy and Entrepreneurship at the University of North Carolina, said he believes, at least in the case of millennials, there\u2019s a sociological factor involved: One of the things that make millennials different from other generations is a deeper level of parental involvement.Source: Gallup\u201cParents were deeply engaged with their well-being: the things millennials did or did not do growing up,\u201d Segars said. \u201cWhen they can\u2019t get that at work, they get frustrated and think nobody is interested in them. When they do get it, it\u2019s amazing what they can do. But they need some of the structure and feedback found in traditional workplaces.\u201dNewer collaboration technology, however, can enable the very feedback loops young workers are missing, said Lisette Sutherland, an expert on working remotely and the author of the upcoming book \u201cWork Together Anywhere.\u201d\u201cYou have to make communicating with each other so easy that it\u2019s like talking to someone right next to you,\u201d Sutherland said. \u201cIt sounds really simple, but most multinational  workers don\u2019t even have headsets. Another big part of it is turning the video on. People don\u2019t realize how much team building you can do just by turning on the screen.\u201dSutherland said that the richer, real-time interface provided by a new wave of technological advances will help quell the isolation people feel when working at home. Robotic cameras that move through the halls of an office and pivot to look around a conference room will help remote workers feel more connected. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is replicate the human experience as much as possible,\u201d she said.At a minimum, companies should supplement face-to-face leadership by teaming younger workers with digital mentors \u2014 someone in the organization with whom they can chat regularly for guidance and support \u2014 to eliminate anxiety fueled by greater mobility.The arrival of millennials and other digital natives in the workforce over 15 years ago triggered some anxiety among older generations \u2014 how could they ever catch up? \u2014 but simultaneously generated high expectations.Indeed, 15 years ago young people entering the workforce had their own ideas about the future of work. They assumed their fluency with mobile devices and remote communications would free them to work on meaningful projects at their own discretion.In fact, the democratization of data \u2014 and their familiarity with how to access it \u2014 did allow younger employers to fuel their ambitions with information. Prior to digitalization, the ability to access information signaled power; in the new workforce, it signals ability.As early as 2015, millennials made up the majority of the global workforce, a trend expected to continue beyond 2025. Generation Z (not included in this graphic because of limited data available) will grow to become the demographic shaping the workplace.2015Source: Pew Research CenterBut as young workers forged new pathways, older managers struggled to evaluate their performance. The younger employees\u2019 autonomous, remote work demanded new schemes for effective monitoring. Historically, much of how work got done depended on who knew whom in the organizational hierarchy, Malhotra said. But new ways of working meant managers had to promote group performance while also recognizing individual rewards \u2014 a dynamic most companies still struggle with.Younger workers clearly suffer from the waning of traditional monitoring and management. In a recent Gallup poll, only 21 percent of employees strongly agreed that their performance is managed in a way that motivates them to do outstanding work.Also, technology that allows people to share information with exactly the co-workers they want to \u2014 eliminating the endless CC\u2019ed email chains, for instance \u2014 builds confidence in virtual communications. Providing intuitive, clear, seamless sharing tools helps workers of all ages become more comfortable in the way they interact. This allows firms to create teams of multigenerational workers, optimizing the skill sets of each generation and forging a functional melting pot for the ages.In the next wave of automation, robots will take on the routine, freeing humans to handle only the exceptions.But new weaving machines did not condemn England\u2019s textile workers to massive unemployment \u2014 any more than ATMs mothballed bank tellers in the 1980s. (In spite of ubiquitous robotic cash dispensers, there are more human bank tellers today than ever.)\u201cFor 200 years, there has been the fear the machine will replace people,\u201d said Harry Holzer, the LaFarge SJ Professor at the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University and a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution. \u201cIt\u2019s never happened because the economy always has ways of generating new jobs to replace the ones that go away.\u201dThe benefits of automation are underestimated in the public imagination, Holzer said, while the negatives are generally overblown.\u201cThis prediction of doom and gloom, the fear of artificial intelligence that can do vastly more than machines in the past, so far we see very little evidence of this happening,\u201d Holzer said. \u201cMachines will do some of the tasks that workers did. That might free people up to be more complementary to machines than they used to be.\u201dHistorically, automation has replaced physically repetitive jobs, particularly in manufacturing. New automation featuring machine learning will affect different employee skills sets, augmenting many. Future workers will need to cultivate more social, emotional, creative and logical capabilities to work productively alongside machines.Net change in work hours due to automationSource: McKinseyThe next wave of automation will do even more routine tasks, allowing workers to pay attention to exceptional tasks. Machines, for instance, may soon read test results and diagnose a pathology as accurately as a doctor. Freed from that diagnostic work, doctors would be able to consider a patient\u2019s personal factors \u2014 family or financial circumstances, say \u2014 to customize treatment options.\u201cThe problems, the projects, the things people are working on today have become much more complex,\u201d Segars said.He and other experts agree that increased complexity is best addressed with even better technology. In the future workplace, winners and losers will be determined by the ability of companies to identify and adopt technologies that facilitate digital leadership and mentorship to enable seamless feedback.\u201cThe technology that enables us to fulfill our capacity as individuals and then fulfill our role on a team is of maximum value,\u201d Segars said.Get the Practical Guide to the Modern WorkplaceThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}

{"Headline": "Markets That Climbed the Trump Bump Are Tumbling Down From It", "Date": "2018-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Trump Bump is becoming the Trump Slump.In the first year of Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidency, ebullient investors propelled stock markets to one record high after another. And Mr. Trump was the bull in chief, celebrating the record-breaking march as validation of his economic policies.Those days are done.Even after a fast start to 2018, stock markets finished the first quarter down for the year \u2014 the first quarterly decline since 2015. It suggested that a period of calm and steadily rising markets had given way to a turbulent new era with a bearish bent.The plunge continued Monday, with the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index sinking 2.2 percent. Investors jettisoned shares of financial, technology and many other businesses, spooked at least in part by a tweet from Mr. Trump aimed at one of the country\u2019s biggest companies: Amazon.Monday\u2019s decline left stocks down more than 4 percent so far in 2018. They are now down more than 10 percent from their peak in late January. That means the market has entered a so-called correction \u2014 a term used to indicate that the downward trend is more severe and lasting than simply a few days of bearish trading.The stock market is still up more than 20 percent since Nov. 8, 2016, the day Mr. Trump won the White House \u2014 a roller-coaster ride driven in part by expectations about what a Trump presidency could bring to Washington.At first, the prospect of Republicans controlling the White House and both houses of Congress thrilled investors. They anticipated a wave of regulatory rollbacks and the slashing of corporate and personal tax rates. Many of those dreams have been realized, culminating in Mr. Trump signing a huge tax cut into law in December. When the S.&P. 500 notched its high-water mark of 2872.87 on Jan. 26, it represented a roughly 325 percent increase since the bull market began in March 2009.But since February, a toxic stew of factors \u2014 many but certainly not all of them emanating from Washington \u2014 has polluted what had been the market\u2019s placidly rising waters. And there\u2019s little prospect of the messes dissipating anytime soon.First there was the risk that the economy might be growing too fast, which could prompt central banks to hike interest rates sooner than expected. Then there was the risk of a trade war ignited by the White House imposing tariffs on certain products, an action that quickly prompted countries like China to erect trade barriers of their own. Next came the threat of a government crackdown on technology companies, after revelations of their misuse of customer data.Monday\u2019s dose of unnerving news was a presidential tweet aimed at Amazon, which Mr. Trump accused of hurting the United States Postal Service. Mr. Trump\u2019s feud with the company has been going on sporadically since before he became president, but the onslaught has accelerated lately. On Monday, Mr. Trump tweeted that the Post Office loses money by working with Amazon \u201cand this will be changed.\u201dIn the face of these factors, the optimism of just two months ago has all but evaporated.\u201cIt certainly adds to uncertainty, and the market doesn\u2019t like uncertainty,\u201d said Ed Clissold, chief United States strategist at Ned Davis Research, a stock market research firm.One thing is clear: The days of calm markets marching steadily higher, shattering one record after another, are gone for now. That carries risks for Mr. Trump, who spent the first year of his presidency as a stock-market cheerleader but in recent months has been mostly silent about the market\u2019s gyrations.It also could be a danger for the United States economy. Academic research suggests that long-term market declines can rub off on consumers, leading them to feel less affluent and therefore spend less money. That is bad news for an economy that hinges largely on zesty consumer spending.The market\u2019s decline over the past two months has been broad based. Six of the 11 sectors included in the S.&P. 500 index are down more than 10 percent from the market high in late January.On any given day, a particular sector might be clobbered. One day it could be industrial companies such as Boeing or Caterpillar, which export lots of products and therefore could be harmed in a trade war. Another day could bring declines to technology companies like Facebook and Twitter, whose profits are vulnerable to tougher government regulation of social media networks. The next day it could be energy and financial companies, whose fortunes would be diminished if the economy slows.On Monday, just 13 stocks in the S.&P. 500 rose.The meat producer Tyson dropped more than 6 percent, after China imposed duties on pork and fruit from the United States in response to the tariffs that the Trump administration has imposed on products imported from China. China is one of Tyson\u2019s most important export markets. Lean hog futures \u2014 which reflect the anticipated prices of pig carcasses \u2014 were down 3.9 percent.After Mr. Trump\u2019s complaint about Amazon, it too, was a big loser, falling 5.2 percent. Other giant tech firms were sucked into the downdraft. Microsoft dropped 3 percent. Facebook tumbled 2.8 percent, bringing its year-to-date decline to 14.4 percent. And Intel dove 6 percent after a Bloomberg News report that Apple was planning to use its own chips in its computers instead of Intel processors.And Tesla, reeling amid doubts about its ability to churn out electric vehicles, tumbled more than 5 percent.The tech sector has been the epicenter of stock market pain in recent weeks, hurt by concerns about trade friction with China \u2014 a key market and supplier for tech firms \u2014 and fears of tighter government regulation. Even before Monday\u2019s fall, some $457 billion had been wiped off the sector\u2019s total market value.\u201cPeople think that tech is going to go from the Wild West to a much more regulated, scrutinized environment,\u201d said Dan Suzuki, an equity strategist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Even the shares of financial institutions \u2014 the companies that would most likely benefit from a looser regulatory environment favored by Republicans \u2014 have been battered. The sector dropped 2.1 percent Monday, with investors worried about an unfavorable lending environment.For markets, nothing is for sure. They could rebound mightily later this week and shake off jitters about a trade war. But some observers believe conditions may have to get worse before they can get better \u2014 and there could be more declines before that happens.\u201cIn order for the market to bottom, there probably has to be more consternation and more pessimism about the current environment,\u201d said Mr. Clissold, of Ned Davis Research.Advertisement"}
