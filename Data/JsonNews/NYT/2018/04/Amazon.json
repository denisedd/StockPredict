{"Headline": "\u2018You Are the Product\u2019: Targeted by Cambridge Analytica on Facebook", "Date": "2018-04-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChristopher Deason stumbled upon the psychological questionnaire on June 9, 2014. He was taking a lot of online surveys back then, each one earning him a few dollars to help pay the bills. Nothing about this one, which he saw on an online job platform, struck him as \u201ccreepy or weird,\u201d he said later.So at 6:37 that evening, Mr. Deason completed the first step of the survey: He granted access to his Facebook account.Less than a second later, a Facebook app had harvested not only Mr. Deason\u2019s profile data, but also data from the profiles of 205 of his Facebook friends. Their names, birth dates and location data, as well as lists of every Facebook page they had ever liked, were downloaded \u2014 without their knowledge or express consent \u2014 before Mr. Deason could even begin reading the first survey question.The information was added to a huge database being compiled for Cambridge Analytica, the political data firm with links to Donald J. Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. None of the people whose data was collected knew it had happened, not even Mr. Deason. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would have gone forward with it if I had,\u201d Mr. Deason, 27, said in a recent interview.But The Times, which has viewed a set of raw data from the profiles that Cambridge Analytica paid an academic researcher to obtain, contacted nearly two dozen affected Facebook users in recent weeks. Some were angry \u2014 one woman compared it to being robbed \u2014 while others were annoyed but unsurprised, having grown cynical about tech giants\u2019 use of the data they collect. They are some of the first known affected Facebook users to be publicly identified. And nearly all said the misuse of their data had given them second thoughts about staying on Facebook.\u201cI\u2019ve come to grips with the fact that you are the product on the internet,\u201d said Mark Snyder, 32, who lives in Pompano Beach, Fla., and was among Mr. Deason\u2019s friends whose data was collected.\u201cIf you sign up for anything and it isn\u2019t immediately obvious how they\u2019re making money, they\u2019re making money off of you,\u201d said Mr. Snyder, who maintains computer networks for a living.Until April 2015, Facebook allowed some app developers to collect some private information from the profiles of users who downloaded apps, and from those of their friends. Facebook has said it allowed this kind of data collection to help developers improve the \u201cin-app\u201d experience for users. But Facebook appears to have done little to verify how developers were using the data or whether they were providing any kind of experience on Facebook at all.The questionnaire used to collect data for Cambridge Analytica was not actually on Facebook. It was hosted by a company called Qualtrics, which provides a platform for online surveys. It consisted of dozens of questions often used by psychology researchers to assess personality, such as whether the respondent prefers to be alone, tries to lead others and loves large parties (the answer choices range from \u201cdisagree strongly\u201d to \u201cagree strongly\u201d). The questionnaire took about 10 to 20 minutes to complete.Facebook has said that people who took the quiz were told that their data would be used only for academic purposes, claiming that it and its users were misled by Cambridge Analytica and the researcher it hired, Aleksandr Kogan, a 28-year-old Russian-American academic. But the fine print that accompanied the questionnaire may have told users that their data could be used for commercial purposes, according to a draft of the survey\u2019s terms of service that was reviewed by The Times.Selling users\u2019 Facebook data would have been an outright violation of the company\u2019s rules at the time. Yet the company does not appear to have regularly checked to make sure that apps complied with its rules. And the final wording of the survey\u2019s terms of service is now most likely unknowable: Facebook executives said they deleted the app in December 2015 when they found out about the data harvesting.The uproar over Cambridge Analytica\u2019s misuse of the data has added to questions Facebook was already confronting over the use of its platform by those seeking to spread Russian propaganda and fake news.\u201cCambridge Analytica is the big story on the topic, but there have been numerous stories about Facebook either selling user data or giving third parties access and using it to help advertising,\u201d Mr. Deason said.He was especially irked by the ways Facebook and other social media directed advertisements based on what users posted or viewed online.If he recommends, say, a Dell laptop to a friend, he said, \u201cI go to the next page on Facebook and there\u2019s a Dell ad.\u201d\u201cThat bothers me,\u201d he said.Mr. Deason, who runs a computer business in Roanoke, Va., is probably among Facebook\u2019s more tech-savvy users. He is keeping his account open for now because his business has its own page and he moderates Facebook groups dedicated to computers.\u201cBut if I were just working my 9-to-5 at the local bank or whatever, and coming home and getting on Facebook to check on my friends and whatnot, yeah, I would delete Facebook,\u201d he said.Many people who took the survey do not have a background in technology, including Jim Symbouras, 56, a municipal worker in New York City.His data was collected dozens of times after 52 of his Facebook friends were directed to the psychological questionnaire, many by a site called Swagbucks. The site lets people earn gift cards to Amazon and other retailers in exchange for taking surveys or watching video advertisements.Mr. Symbouras does not personally know any of the Facebook friends who granted the app access to his data. He met them in Facebook groups where Swagbucks users traded tips for finding good deals.Amy Risner, 52, of Collinwood, Tenn., was one of those Facebook friends. Ms. Risner, who does not work full time, vaguely recalled the questionnaire \u2014 \u201cIt was real long, that\u2019s what I remember\u201d \u2014 but was certain she never saw any notice that her data or that of her friends would be collected.\u201cIf it would have said anything like that about taking my information \u2014 my personal information \u2014 I would have backed out of it and not done it,\u201d Ms. Risner said.Facebook, though, is a tough habit to kick. Asked if she was thinking about deleting her account, Ms. Risner said, \u201cI\u2019m just too nosy to stay off it.\u201dMalachy Browne contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s Profit Swells to $1.6 Billion, Lifted by Its Cloud Business", "Date": "2018-04-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder and chief executive, long ago figured out how to keep Amazon\u2019s sales figures shooting skyward. Now he is doing the same with profit.The company, which once seemed to have only a passing interest in turning a profit, said its net income for the first quarter more than doubled. Although Amazon is best known as an internet shopping destination, its cloud computing and advertising businesses were big contributors to the jump in profit.Mr. Bezos singled out the performance of the company\u2019s cloud computing business \u2014 known as Amazon Web Services, or A.W.S. \u2014 referring in a statement to a \u201cremarkable acceleration\u201d in growth in the segment for a second consecutive quarter.Amazon often boasts of its commitment to lowering prices \u2014 part of the reason its profits have been so limited until now \u2014 but on Thursday it announced a price hike for one of its most important offerings. The company said it was raising the price of its Prime membership service 20 percent, to $119 from $99. Prime memberships include two-day shipping at no extra cost, a video streaming service and other benefits.Amazon\u2019s shares surged 7 percent in after-hours trading following the release of the quarterly news.The company reported that its net income for the first quarter, which ended March 31, was $1.63 billion, or $3.27 per share, compared with net income of $724 million, or $1.48 per share, in the same period last year. Revenue jumped 43 percent to $51 billion, up from $35.7 billion a year earlier.The average estimate of financial analysts, compiled by Thomson Reuters, was for revenue of $49.87 billion and earnings of $1.27 a share.\u201cThis was an unusually strong quarter for Amazon, where results came in both better for revenue and profits across the board,\u201d said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.Like Facebook, which has faced a grilling in Congress over its data protection practices, Amazon has faced criticism in Washington. President Trump has regularly slammed the company, saying it was killing jobs and not collecting enough taxes.But as with Facebook\u2019s users, Amazon\u2019s customers have apparently not been swayed by criticism of politicians, though many of Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks happened after the end of the quarter.Amazon\u2019s revenue received a big lift from the company\u2019s acquisition of Whole Foods Markets last year. The company\u2019s physical stores business, most of which is from Whole Foods, added $4.26 billion in revenue for the quarter.Revenue from A.W.S., meanwhile, rose 49 percent to $5.44 billion from the same period a year earlier.That increase is larger that what the A.W.S. business was seeing just a few quarters ago. It is unusual to see revenue growth increase significantly at Amazon\u2019s size and in a hypercompetitive market, and it seems to have prompted Mr. Bezos to single out the business in his statement.Mr. Mahaney, the RBC analyst, said, \u201cThat\u2019s rare to see him say something like that.\u201dThe increase in the cost of Prime memberships came shortly after Mr. Bezos announced, in the company\u2019s annual shareholder letter, that Amazon had more than 100 million Prime subscribers globally. During the first quarter, revenue from subscription services, including Prime, jumped 60 percent to $3.1 billion.Amazon said the price on Prime will go up on May 11 for new members, and starting June 16 for renewals of membership for existing members. The company said the increase, the first for its annual plan in four years, was the result of significantly increased costs for the service.Those include the billions of dollars that Amazon has poured into financing new television shows and movies which have been added to its video streaming service. On Thursday, it announced with the National Football League a renewed agreement for Amazon to exclusively stream Thursday night football games to Prime subscribers.In a call with financial analysts, Brian Olsavsky, Amazon\u2019s chief financial officer, said that four years ago, Prime members could receive free two-day shipping on about 20 million products from Amazon. Now that figure is 100 million.\u201cThere\u2019s all kinds of new features that we\u2019ve continually added to the Prime program,\u201d Mr. Olsavsky said. \u201cIt\u2019s much different than it was in 2014.\u201dAdvertisement"}

On his first trip, Mr. Vallejo made photographs for a catalog of traditional plants in the community\u2019s herbarium.Members of the community who had left to study have returned to apply their newly acquired skills and help preserve their culture and the environment. The financial settlement they reached with the government allowed them to set up a local bank, and they have also undertaken projects to provide each home with a solar panel that can power a light and radio.And while they may be far from the city, they are not cut off. An administration building has a satellite internet connection and a generator, which attracts people who want to charge their phones, tablets or laptops (which, apart from connecting them to supporters and allies in the environmental movement, are also good for watching movies).Though outsiders would call them poor, considering their isolation and lack of amenities, they do not. Mr. Vallejo learned this when he went out with them on a five-day hunting trip into the jungle. They set out with no food, except salt, and the knowledge that the jungle would provide. After catching a deer and a caiman one night, they ate it for breakfast.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "J Sainsbury and Asda, Leading British Grocers, in Talks to Merge", "Date": "2018-04-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwo of Britain\u2019s grocers are in talks to merge, potentially creating the country\u2019s biggest supermarket operator amid continued upheaval in the retail industry.The move reflects how retailers have been forced to cast about for ways to deal with a rapidly changing retail industry. In Britain alone, chains like the electronics store Maplin and the department store BHS have filed for bankruptcy in recent years.Asda has struggled financially. In 2016, the last year for which figures are available, its sales fell 3 percent from the same time a year ago, to \u00a321.7 billion. Profit fell 17 percent during that period, to \u00a3656 million.Putting Asda together with Sainsbury, one of Britain\u2019s biggest grocery chains, could help the combined business negotiate lower prices from suppliers, one of the primary goals of many retail mergers.That acquisition helped push up sales, with its 2017 revenue rising 11 percent, to \u00a326.2 billion. But profits for the period fell nearly 20 percent, to \u00a3377 million.The biggest hurdle to a merger could be Britain\u2019s competition regulator, which may be wary of allowing two of the country\u2019s biggest grocery chains to combine.The companies may argue that they serve different consumers: Asda caters more to cost-conscious customers, while Sainsbury aims for wealthier ones. Their stores are also largely located in different parts of Britain, with Asda more prevalent in the north and Sainsbury in the south.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Navigate the Complicated World of Credit Card Points", "Date": "2018-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrugal TravelerCredit card points are generally more valuable than points or miles attached to a specific airline or hotel group. The reason? Flexibility.There\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch, but investing in a credit card rewards program can land you pretty close to the mark. Credit card points are generally more valuable than points or miles attached to a specific airline or hotel group. The reason? Flexibility. With a trove of credit card points, you can get flights, hotel rooms or even cruises. While Capital One and Bank of America are coming into their own, the three major players in the travel rewards game are American Express, Chase and Citi. Here\u2019s a basic rundown of their current programs.How much points are worth is relative, but generally speaking, you should avoid redemption options that attach a value of less than a penny per point. That means while you certainly can redeem your points for Marriott or Walmart gift cards, you\u2019ll be getting fewer than .7 cents per point, which is not optimal.Many of the same principles as American Express apply to Chase: While you can redeem your points for things like gift cards or a statement credit (one cent per point) or purchases on Amazon (less than one cent per point), that\u2019s not your best value proposition. Sapphire Preferred cardholders can redeem points toward travel at a value of 1.25 cents per point; Sapphire Reserve cardholders fare even better, getting 1.5 cents out of each point, or a 50 percent bonus. That means a $600 flight will cost you only 40,000 points \u2014 not bad.Amassing value becomes even easier when you use multiple cards in tandem for everyday purchases, like a Sapphire Reserve card with a Chase Freedom or Freedom Unlimited card. The Chase Freedom earns quintuple points (up to $1,500) on rotating quarterly categories that can include department stores, PayPal, and gas stations. The next part is a little tricky: Freedom cards are technically cash back cards that earn points redeemable at a penny each. But those points become much more powerful when you transfer them to a Sapphire or Business Preferred card (which is done easily on the Chase website), as you can then redeem them for a bonus in the travel portal and transfer them to travel partners.This quarter (April through June), for example, those categories include grocery stores. That means $100 worth of groceries earns you 500 points, or five percent back on your spending. But those points can be transferred to your Sapphire Reserve and redeemed for travel at a 50 percent bonus, meaning it\u2019s an effective return rate of 7.5 percent. The Freedom Unlimited, which is uncapped and gives you a 1.5 percent return on all categories, can also transfer points to the Sapphire Reserve, earning that 50 percent bonus. This equates to a 2.25 percent return on all spending when you redeem for travel. As with American Express and Chase, I\u2019d generally recommend forgoing the use of points to pay for purchases, merchandise and gift cards. A couple of things to keep in mind: Some cards have high annual fees \u2014 Chase Sapphire Reserve is $450, American Express Platinum is $550 \u2014 that only are offset if you manage to collect the bonus. Always make sure you can hit the target spend amount before signing up. Most importantly, I don\u2019t recommend juggling a bunch of new credit cards to anyone who can\u2019t pay their balance in full every month. The point is to make money, not give it back to the banks.I\u2019m fastidious about avoiding interest and late fees, and don\u2019t feel guilty canceling high annual fee cards once I\u2019ve collected my bonus, thus I rarely hesitate to jump on a good sign-up offer. If the banks want to help pay for my next trip, at little or no cost to me, I\u2019m all for it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In This Space Race, Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk Are Competing to Take You There", "Date": "2018-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionLaunch Pad 39A, just north of Cape Canaveral, Fla., was the storied site where America\u2019s space dreams and the imaginations of its youth were sent soaring. The first manned mission to the moon blasted off from there in 1969, as did the last, in 1972; so did the first space shuttle mission, in 1981, and the last, in 2011. But by 2013, with the shuttle program grounded and America\u2019s half century of space aspirations having ended with bangs and whimpers, 39A was rusting away and weeds were growing through its flame trench. A crippled NASA was eager to sell it.The space agency knew there was a natural customer: Elon Musk, the cheeky PayPal co-founder and Tesla creator whose SpaceX venture had become the first private rocket company to launch into orbit with a payload. Musk\u2019s mesmerizing style \u2014 skittering on the border between visionary and eccentric \u2014 made it seem at times that his obsession with space travel involved a desire to return to some celestial home, but his Falcon rockets had won NASA\u2019s respect. Surprisingly, a second bidder emerged: Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, who pursued his passion for all things, including space travel, with an awesome talent for being both exuberant and methodical. His company, Blue Origin, was building a reusable launch vehicle that, among other things, planned to take tourists into space.Musk won the bidding for Launch Pad 39A, but a few months later Bezos bought the nearby Launch Complex 36, from which missions to fly by Mars and Venus had been launched. The transfer of these hallowed pads represented, both symbolically and in practice, John F. Kennedy\u2019s torch of space exploration being passed from government to the private sector \u2014 from a once-glorious but now sclerotic federal agency to a new breed of boyish billionaires who embodied the daring passion and imagination of history\u2019s great pioneers, adventurers and innovators.Two new books chronicle this fascinating transition. \u201cThe Space Barons,\u201d by Christian Davenport, a Washington Post reporter, is an exciting narrative filled with colorful reporting and sharp insights. The book sparkles because of Davenport\u2019s access to the main players and his talent for crisp storytelling. \u201cRocket Billionaires,\u201d by Tim Fernholz, a reporter for Quartz, is not quite as vibrant a narrative and lacks some of Davenport\u2019s memorable scenes, but it provides smart analysis of the New Space sector as well as historical context about NASA\u2019s triumphs and failures.In the class that I teach on the history of the digital revolution, the students discuss whether innovation is driven more by big government projects or by nimble entrepreneurs. The answer, of course, is that it usually involves a symbiotic mix, like the semiconductor industry, which arose out of the Pentagon and NASA\u2019s need to put guidance systems in the nose cones of rockets. Vannevar Bush was the dean of engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a co-founder of Raytheon, and oversaw the government science programs that resulted in the atom bomb and electronic computer. He wrote a seminal paper in 1945, called \u201cScience \u2014 the Endless Frontier,\u201d which described how a collaboration of all three sectors he had been part of \u2014 academia, business and government \u2014 would drive innovation. Government funding of basic research in university labs would lead to discoveries in fundamental science that would be the \u201cseed\u201d for future inventions.Many innovations have progressed along that path. The ENIAC computer funded by the United States Army and built at the University of Pennsylvania was the genesis for UNIVAC and then most other electronic computers. The network funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and designed by a consortium of academic and private labs led eventually to today\u2019s internet. The National Science Foundation, started based on Vannevar Bush\u2019s paper, created a multiagency Digital Library Initiative that funded the academic research of Larry Page and Sergey Brin, which led to Google. The sequencing of the human genome, largely funded by the National Institutes of Health, planted the seeds for the biotech industry.Now space endeavors are following this \u201cinnovation progression,\u201d as we can call it. \u201cJust as Darpa served as the initial impetus for the internet and underwrote a lot of the costs of developing the internet in the beginning, it may be the case that NASA has essentially done the same thing by spending the money to build sort of fundamental technologies,\u201d Musk said a year after launching SpaceX. \u201cOnce we can bring the sort of commercial, free enterprise sector into it, then we can see the dramatic acceleration that we saw in the internet.\u201dOne of the first private pioneers was Burt Rutan, a mutton-chopped aircraft designer who regarded NASA as a bloated and unimaginative bureaucracy and in 1982 founded a company called Scaled Composites that designed aircraft so innovative that, as Davenport writes, \u201cit was as if his inspiration came not just from the laws of aerodynamics but from Picasso.\u201d One of his ideas was for a manned aircraft that could reach the edge of space and then fold its wings upward to act as a feather allowing the craft to re-enter the earth\u2019s atmosphere, land on a runway, and be reused. It would become his entry in the Ansari X Prize, which offered $10 million for the first private company that could launch a reusable vehicle to space twice within two weeks.Rutan attracted two billionaire partners. The first was the Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, who as a schoolboy in Seattle yearned to become an astronaut but, being nearsighted, realized that was impossible so spent his time coding in the school\u2019s computer room with his friend Bill Gates. Rutan\u2019s second partner was the toothy goldilocked Richard Branson, a thrill-addicted serial adventurer and entrepreneur who was as enthusiastic about publicity as Allen was averse to it. Branson\u2019s personal motto for his company, Virgin, was \u201cScrew it, let\u2019s do it,\u201d which was no longer a guiding principle at NASA, and he created Virgin Galactic with the goal of taking tourists into space. \u201cPaul, isn\u2019t this better than the best sex you ever had?\u201d Branson asked Allen during one test flight as the spaceship climbed higher.In 2004, Rutan\u2019s craft (with a Virgin logo on its tail) flew twice to space and back to win the X Prize. At the celebration, Rutan took a shot at NASA. \u201cI was thinking a little bit about that other space agency, the big guys,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they\u2019re looking at each other now and saying, \u2018We\u2019re screwed.\u2019\u201d Branson began selling tickets at prices that started at $200,000 to those who wanted to ride in a similar plane he began building, the launch date of which always seems to be about a year away.Elon Musk\u2019s love of adventure came partly from his maternal grandfather, an accomplished amateur pilot in South Africa who in 1952 completed a 22,000-mile journey across the globe with no electronic instruments. Musk founded SpaceX in 2002 with the eventual goal of colonizing Mars. \u201cThe more Musk studied, the more he realized that there had been very little advancement in rocket technology in the past 40 years,\u201d Davenport writes. \u201cTo a self-made Silicon Valley tech entrepreneur, this was stunning.\u201d His company\u2019s mantra was, \u201cSet audacious, nearly impossible goals and don\u2019t get dissuaded.\u201dMusk\u2019s entrepreneurship had a social purpose. SpaceX, Tesla, his electric car company, and SolarCity, his renewable energy company, Fernholz writes, \u201cwere explicitly intended to further human civilization.\u201d Along the way, he developed a cultlike following. When SpaceX managed to launch a space capsule into orbit and dock it at the International Space Station in 2012, something NASA could no longer do on its own, the employees at his headquarters broke into a chant, \u201cWe love Elon!\u201dBezos was likewise inspired by his own maternal grandfather. Lawrence Preston Gise, an upright but loving naval commander, helped develop the hydrogen bomb during a stint at the Atomic Energy Commission and then retired to his sprawling Texas ranch to enjoy his family \u2014 and in particular his insatiably curious little grandson with very big ears, smile and laugh. Bezos\u2019 passion for space began when he was 5 and he watched with his family the launch of Apollo 11, the manned moon mission commanded by Neil Armstrong. \u201cIt really was a seminal moment for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember watching it on our living room TV, and the excitement of my parents and my grandparents. Little kids can pick up that kind of excitement.\u201dBezos spent every summer at his grandfather\u2019s ranch, where he fixed windmills, castrated cattle and geeked out on the tiny county library\u2019s surprisingly large sci-fi collection. His high school valedictorian speech was about space: how to colonize planets, build space hotels and save our fragile planet. \u201cSpace, the final frontier, meet me there!\u201d he concluded.When Bezos founded Blue Origin in 2000, naming it after that pale blue planet where humans originated, he called upon one of his favorite science fiction writers, Neal Stephenson, to be an adviser. They kicked around wildly novel ideas, such as using a bullwhip-like device to propel objects into space. Eventually Bezos focused on reusable rockets. \u201cHow is the situation in the year 2000 different from 1960?\u201d Stephenson asked him. \u201cWhat\u2019s different is computer sensors, cameras, software. Being able to land vertically is the kind of problem that can be addressed by those technologies that existed in 2000 that didn\u2019t exist in 1960.\u201dBezos began putting together a huge tract of ranch land in Texas where he could build his reusable rockets in secret. One of the great scenes in Davenport\u2019s book is the description of the helicopter trip Bezos took to find the land, which ended with a terrifying crash. He survived, and it conditioned him to the fact that flying machines sometimes fail. Among Bezos\u2019 many strengths is to be exuberant patiently, to have a long-term horizon, as he has done at Amazon. At his Texas ranch, he has begun construction of a 10,000-year \u201cClock of the Long Now\u201d designed by the futurist Danny Hillis, which has a century hand that advances every hundred years and a cuckoo that comes out every millennium. In the mission statement for his space company, he wrote, \u201cBlue will pursue this long-term objective patiently, step by step.\u201d As Elon Musk pushed forward with very public fits and starts, Bezos advised his team, \u201cBe the tortoise and not the hare.\u201dAt the end of 2015, within a month of each other, Musk and Bezos both launched rockets that returned safely to earth and were reusable. For the moment, Musk the hare had darted ahead: His powerful Falcon 9 rocket had lifted a payload into orbit, whereas Bezos\u2019 smaller New Shepard craft had merely gone up into the edge of space and returned. But as happens with scrappy entrepreneurial business competitors, in contrast to government bureaucracies, Bezos and Musk were goading each other on. And unlike the race between the tortoise and the hare, they can both triumph \u2014 as can, one hopes, Richard Branson and others.Indeed, even NASA and its big corporate contractor, the United Launch Alliance, a venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing, can come out winners from competition. As is often the case with the innovation progression, the greatest technological advances come when a symbiosis is reached that combines the resources of a visionary government and the scrappiness of risk-taking entrepreneurs, each spurring the other onward and upward.Walter Isaacson is a professor of history at Tulane.

{"Headline": "European Regulators Ask if Facebook Is Taking Too Much Data", "Date": "2018-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byData. It is the gasoline that fuels advertiser-supported internet giants like Facebook and the gold that companies mine for their algorithms.Now regulators in Europe are asking whether Facebook is excessively collecting details about the online activities of internet users \u2014 in effect, forcibly extracting a valuable commodity from consumers.Until recently, few consumers stopped to consider the value of their personal information or how much of it they were forking over in exchange for free online services.They say consumers in Germany have little choice of social networks, forcing users to consent to Facebook\u2019s collection of their web-browsing data if they want Facebook accounts. According to the regulators\u2019 analysis, Facebook has a 95 percent market share of social networking in Germany.Because users in Germany lack a real choice, he added, Facebook in effect is able to extract whatever data it wants from them. \u201cThe Facebook case is really about excessive pricing vis-\u00e0-vis the consumer,\u201d Mr. Mundt said.The regulators are not trying to quantify the specific monetary value of data. German, Italian and Belgian regulators are arguing in different ways that certain Facebook data practices are unfair or misleading, not directly causing financial harm to consumers.\u201cLike Facebook, many of those services are supported by ads and offer tools to other apps and websites, then use information they collect to improve people\u2019s experience,\u201d Mr. Steinfeld said in a statement. \u201cThis is not the picture of an internet dominated by a single renegade company.\u201dHe said the company looked forward to answering questions from regulators in Italy.Marketers have long contended that consumers willingly trade their data for more customized ads and personalized services.Ms. Sekar, the start-up employee, said she had long accepted that using Facebook and Facebook-owned services like Instagram meant that the company would collect information about her for ads.But that exchange has become more complicated, she said, as new questions emerge about how consumers\u2019 data could be mined to profile and potentially manipulate them. While she is still using Facebook and Instagram and has a \u201cdecent sense\u201d of what the company collects, she added, \u201cit\u2019s probably worse than I know.\u201d\u201cIt really frustrates me that all of this is done under the guise of: \u2018Well, you made this choice. Nobody is making you sign up for Facebook,\u2019\u201d Ms. Sekar said.Some industry experts, however, said it was illogical to suggest that Facebook was overcharging in data \u2014 because consumer data does not have a face value like a dollar bill. It\u2019s a commodity with a fluctuating value, they said, depending on what it is used for.Facebook made about $84 on average per user in the United States and Canada last year and about $20 on average from users globally, up from $13.50 and $5 in 2012, the year it went public. Targeting ads to its 2.2 billion users helped Facebook generate revenue of $40.6 billion in 2017.The consumer-tracking techniques underpinning that revenue are not unique to Facebook. But the Cambridge Analytica revelations and Facebook\u2019s gargantuan online reach have put the social network in the hot seat. The company has compounded its problems by being unclear about its practices.In two days of questioning during congressional hearings this month, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, told legislators that he did not know how many data points Facebook collected about individual users or how many non-Facebook sites the company tracked users on, and he offered incomplete answers about how the tracking worked.Although Facebook allows users to opt out of seeing ads based on their use of other sites and apps, they cannot opt out of the company\u2019s collection of details about their activities on those services.\u201cWe can and will do more to help people understand how Facebook works and the choices they have,\u201d Mr. Steinfeld, the Facebook spokesman, said.Ms. Sekar\u2019s ambivalence lines up with a sense of resignation that researchers at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Annenberg School for Communication found when they asked Americans about their feelings on sharing unknown quantities of their data with companies.While much of the ad industry views the consumers from whom it extracts information as willing and informed participants, the Penn researchers say users are in the dark about what they\u2019re giving up.This year, 63 percent of consumers who responded to the researchers\u2019 questions said they wanted to have control over what companies can learn about them online, but have come to accept they have little control over that. That\u2019s up from 58 percent in 2015.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Focusing on a Manager\u2019s Best Stock Ideas May Not Be a Good Idea", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStock funds with concentrated portfolios \u2014 30 or 40 holdings, tops \u2014 are supposed to contain only the managers\u2019 best investment ideas.It turns out, though, that those ideas generally haven\u2019t been good enough to help the funds beat more diversified rivals.In the first quarter, and in the one, three and five years that ended on March 31, the average such stock fund, known as a focus fund, failed to beat at least half of the funds with the same objective \u2014 large-company growth, Asian smaller companies, whatever \u2014 according to Morningstar.At our request, Morningstar examined all actively managed stock funds that had no sales load, a minimum investment of $10,000 or less and at least $100 million in assets. A focus fund was defined as being in the 10 percent of funds with the fewest portfolio holdings, meaning it owned fewer stocks than any of the other 90 percent.Despite the so-so performance of focus funds as a group, some did exceptionally well, and that reveals the good and bad news about them: Their portfolio concentration can accentuate the gap between the best and worst.\u201cConcentration can propel you to greater heights and drive you to greater depths,\u201d said Christopher Davis, a senior analyst specializing in equity strategy for Morningstar. \u201cA concentrated fund is harder to own.\u201dAmid the ordinariness, or worse, there were many apparent standouts. A greater number of concentrated funds performed in the top 10 percent within their respective investment objectives in each period than would be expected by chance, the Morningstar data reveals.In the year through March, for instance, in a universe of 1,938 funds, 19 or 20 in the group with the 10 percent fewest holdings should be in the top 10 percent of returns, strictly by chance, but 26 were.Todd Rosenbluth, director of exchange-traded fund and mutual fund research at CFRA, views the wide performance range among focus funds as a silver lining.\u201cConcentrated funds put only their best ideas into the portfolio and tend to stick with them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can be more volatile, as they are driven by a smaller number of stocks and tend to be more concentrated in certain sectors.\u201dThat may give any of them a chance to beat the market. Diversified portfolios, in contrast, may not deviate much from benchmark stock indexes, he said, and so \u201care more likely to lag a considerably cheaper Vanguard index mutual fund.\u201dThe potential to substantially outperform allows providers of focus funds to charge more money. The average focus fund has annual expenses of 1.06 percent, compared with 0.98 percent for the average actively managed stock fund, according to Morningstar. Focus funds also typically have smaller asset bases, providing fewer economies of scale.\u201cConcentrated funds start off deeper in the expense hole and have a deeper expense gap to traverse,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cIf you bet on the right one, your upside potential is all that much greater. Investors choose to make that bet. If they choose well, the expense ratio doesn\u2019t really matter. If they don\u2019t, the additional expenses will add insult to injury.\u201dThere have been clear, consistent winners among focus funds, even if their inherent volatility can cause periodic weakness. Many names appear on several lists of top concentrated portfolios this year and over one, three and five years, with seven funds on all four.One of those, Guinness Atkinson Global Innovators, maintains a portfolio of about 30 stocks. They are often the same ones because the managers like to hold positions for many years.As the fund\u2019s name suggests, its managers \u201ctry to identify companies that use innovation to drive their growth,\u201d said Matthew Page, one of those managers. \u201cWe believe that, ultimately, companies like that should outperform because they\u2019re smarter and better than their average peers. That means higher growth prospects and profits.\u201dAmong the themes that appeal to him are big data and machine learning. The first refers to the storage, processing and analysis of immense sets of related data. The second involves developing programs that allow computers to learn from and make predictions about data almost instantaneously, a skill that will be needed for technologies such as self-driving cars.It\u2019s hard to invest in these areas directly, Mr. Page said, so the portfolio holds stocks in related ones, including Nvidia, which makes graphics processing units, Fanuc, a Japanese robotics business, and Infineon, a German maker of semiconductors for the automotive industry that is expanding into chips for electric and self-driving vehicles.The Baron Fifth Avenue Growth fund, another that appears on all four lists of top-performing focus funds, favors large companies that sell for less than their intrinsic worth because investors misunderstand their businesses, Alex Umansky, the fund\u2019s manager, says. He adds that there are so few mispricings among these well-researched companies that the fund usually holds just 30 to 35 stocks.He keeps most of them for long periods \u2014 \u201cour time horizon is forever,\u201d he said \u2014 and accepts price swings that other managers try to avoid by maintaining bigger portfolios.\u201cWe think overdiversification has been massively value-destructive over the last decade because people are worried about managing volatility,\u201d Mr. Umansky said.The fund\u2019s largest constituent, accounting for 15 percent of its assets, is hardly obscure \u2014 Amazon \u2014 but Mr. Umansky contends that its price is too cheap, even at 235 times its earnings for the last four quarters. That extravagant valuation is misleading, he said, because Amazon has a history of forgoing earnings today by investing in new business lines that will pay off tomorrow.Other portfolio holdings include Alibaba, a Chinese e-commerce giant; and Mastercard and Visa, which dominate the credit card business. Mr. Umansky called Mastercard \u201cthe digital railroad\u201d taking financial transactions from paper to the electronic world, a process that he expects to be larger and more lucrative than investors anticipate.Mr. Rosenbluth recommends the Guinness Atkinson and Baron funds. Others that he likes and that appear on at least one of the lists of top-performing focus funds include Columbia Select Large-Cap Value, Axa Loomis Sayles Growth and Parnassus Endeavor.Mr. Davis is a fan of the Baron and Parnassus funds, though he is agnostic about focus funds generally.\u201cWe haven\u2019t been able to discern a real advantage investing in concentrated portfolios, but there\u2019s not a big disadvantage, either,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should expect to have a range of outcomes the more concentrated the portfolio is,\u201d he added. \u201cEven some of the best performers over the last five years underperform their peers sometimes.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Another bank takes steps toward gun safety.\u2022 The next steps in the tariffs tit-for-tat.\u2022 Investigators are looking into the motive behind the shooting at YouTube\u2019s headquarters.Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union provides pointers for investors as President Trump ratchets up trade tensions with China.In the weeks following Britain\u2019s vote in 2016 for \u201cBrexit,\u201d fears grew that the post-war economic order was under serious threat. But European stock markets recovered, including Britain\u2019s. Investors came to see that the European Union was not going to break up, and Britain was not going to erect tall walls around its economy. Looking back, the panicky early reaction to Brexit seems to have sprung more from a fear of the unknown than any big threats to the global trading system. Investors took a deep breath and gained some perspective.Movements in the United States stock market suggests the same thing is happening in response to President Trump\u2019s trade policies. China on Tuesday evening announced the tariffs it plans in retaliation against those President Trump is threatening. Reacting to China\u2019s announcement, the S.&P. 500 index plunged early on Wednesday but recovered strongly to close up 1.2 percent.Investors may believe China\u2019s move will lead to drawn-out negotiations. Here, Brexit is again illustrative. As the back and forth between the European Union and Britain has gone on, investors have gained more clarity and confidence. If talks between the U.S. and China gain steam, the uncertainty now clouding relations between the two countries may gradually clear.But the standoff between the U.S. and China differs in important ways from the Brexit tensions. The U.S., for instance, is in a much stronger position than Britain. China exports far more to the U.S. than the U.S. does to China. Limiting access to the U.S. economy could hurt China\u2019s growth at a time when it is trying to overhaul important economic sectors. If investors believe that the U.S. can successfully exploit its advantages to make China more friendly to foreign businesses, they may even see the trade skirmish as positive for the global economy.But Brexit also flashes a warning to those expecting a big win for Mr. Trump. One of the reasons that the European Union has presented a united front is that it sees Brexit as a threat to its values and goals. Similarly, China may believe that Mr. Trump\u2019s trade attack puts some of its most deeply held aspirations under threat \u2013 and will fight back hard.- Peter EavisAfter Citigroup announced plans to limit firearms sales by business customers, the question was which lenders would be the next to make a move on guns.

Leon of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, who is presiding over the case, is expected to take about a month before giving his opinion.For Mr. Bewkes, 65, the courtroom appearance was a rare public pleading to salvage a career-defining deal. The media titan is a 39-year veteran of Time Warner and has been chief executive since 2008, overseeing the spinoff of Time Warner Cable a year later, the rise of HBO and the turbulent evolution of CNN and the Warner Bros. movie studio.Confident and congenial, Mr. Bewkes engaged directly with Judge Leon, leaning forward in his chair and making eye contact as he explained how the media industry is being challenged by Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google and Netflix. He described the Justice Department\u2019s theory that the merged company would threaten to withhold Time Warner content from rival cable operators as \u201cridiculous.\u201dAmong the biggest problems for Time Warner as a stand-alone television and movie producer is that it does not have access to viewer data to target advertising and other valuable customer information the same way that Amazon and Netflix do, Mr. Bewkes said.\u201cWe don\u2019t have emails, contact information, billing information \u2026 any of these things,\u201d he said.At the center of the antitrust trial are arguments over consumer and competitive harms, with attention focused on economic analyses presented by both sides last week. The Justice Department and several consumer groups said the deal would hurt consumers, who would have to pay bigger bills as a result of higher prices for Time Warner programs.The companies have argued that the Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit is at least a decade behind the times. Time Warner said companies like Google and Facebook have the most valuable data on users but they are not willing to share that information.Mr. Bewkes said he has also unsuccessfully tried to buy data on viewers from distributors like Comcast, which was only willing to sell limited sets.These trends prompted Mr. Stephenson and Mr. Bewkes in the summer of 2016 to meet to discuss business options, Mr. Bewkes said Wednesday. In late August 2016, over a three-hour lunch on the 10th-floor dining room of the Time Warner building in New York, they agreed a merger made the most sense. The companies\u2019 boards approved the plan soon after.Judge Leon, who has not commented much throughout the trial, has said the action was a \u201crare breed of horse\u201d but not a \u201cunicorn.\u201dMr. Bewkes and Mr. Stephenson have previously suggested that the Justice Department was influenced to block the deal by presidential politics. President Trump said during his election campaign that the deal should be denied. Mr. Trump has also repeatedly bashed CNN for its coverage of his administration.The Justice Department has denied any political interference in its suit to block the deal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "One Goal of Amazon\u2019s HQ2: Learn the Lessons of Seattle", "Date": "2018-04-29", "News": "Amazon has surprised officials in cities vying for the company\u2019s new headquarters by asking how to avoid soaring housing costs and paralyzing traffic.Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 When 10 representatives from Amazon visited the Denver area in late January, they did what you\u2019d expect from a company scouting for a place to put its second headquarters. They toured more than a half-dozen potential sites for a new campus and talked about the technical talent available in the area.But they also did something that surprised local officials: Quiz them on how, if Amazon chooses to settle there, the company could avoid the problems it confronts in Seattle, the only hometown it has ever known.If Amazon moves in, bringing up to 50,000 high-paying jobs to town over time, how would the officials deal with traffic on its roads? And how would the company\u2019s tax dollars contribute to the creation of affordable housing in the region?\u201cI think they feel in Seattle they\u2019re the scapegoat every time there\u2019s an issue in the community and traffic,\u201d said Sam Bailey, vice president of economic development at the Metro Denver Economic Development Corporation, which is managing the area\u2019s bid for Amazon\u2019s second headquarters.Amazon wrapped up its visits in mid-April to all 20 finalist locations for its HQ2, as Amazon calls its second headquarters. The company is now following up with the cities, from Los Angeles to Indianapolis to Toronto, seeking further information as it narrows its search.The company has a long wish list, including plentiful flights at local airports, a stable, business-friendly government and nearby recreational opportunities for employees.But local officials did not anticipate Amazon\u2019s interest in how to tackle some of the troubles that have turned it into a polarizing symbol of Seattle\u2019s booming economy. The e-commerce giant is celebrated by many in Seattle for being the city\u2019s biggest employer and adding tremendous wealth to the area. But it is villainized by others for bringing too much change, too quickly.In Denver, Amazon and local officials talked at length about public transit options and the creation of bike lanes, said Mr. Bailey. They even discussed the possibility of Amazon financing a new light-rail station for its system, though no commitments were made, he said.In Atlanta, the company spoke to a representative of the Westside Future Fund, a nonprofit working to prevent displacement in an area being redeveloped. The fund will pay for the increases in property taxes for residents who have lived in the area since at least 2016 so that they\u2019re not priced out of their homes.In Amazon\u2019s visit to Toronto, the company discussed its potential impact on the labor market and the affordability of housing, said Ed Clark, the business adviser to Kathleen Wynne, the premier of the province of Ontario.\u201cWe\u2019re all concerned about what could be gentrification or displacement, how do we deal with that,\u201d said Aisha Glover, president and chief executive of the Newark Community Economic Development Corporation, which is involved in the New Jersey city\u2019s bid.Adam Sedo, a spokesman for Amazon, confirmed that public transport and housing affordability were important topics in conversations with the finalist locations but declined to elaborate further.While Amazon is not the only reason for all the change, it has become the most convenient target for groups worried about home prices and paralyzing traffic.\u201cThere was clearly a sensitivity both to the real and to the perceived impact when they come in to a place,\u201d Mr. Clark said, referring to Amazon\u2019s discussions in Toronto.\u201cThe pace of change has been so fast and housing supply has not kept up and the transit system has not kept up,\u201d said Alan Durning, executive director of Sightline Institute, a nonprofit research group in Seattle focused on sustainability. \u201cThere\u2019s a visceral public reaction to the whole rapid pace of change in the city symbolized by, and perhaps blamed too much on, Amazon.\u201dIn May, Seattle\u2019s City Council plans to vote on a tax \u2014 dubbed the \u201cAmazon Tax\u201d by locals \u2014 on the city\u2019s largest employers. The tax is expected to raise $75 million annually, with most of the money being funneled into building affordable housing. The remainder will go to support services for the homeless.\u201cIt\u2019s because they\u2019re getting massive pushback from ordinary people in Seattle,\u201d said Ms. Sawant.Growing cities with thriving local tech scenes are already grappling with affordable housing challenges, even without Amazon. Mr. Clark, the adviser involved in Toronto\u2019s bid, said it helps that Amazon isn\u2019t ducking the problem.\"To have someone coming in and worried about this issue and wanting to work with you to solve the issue is a big plus,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 T-Mobile and Sprint have their eye on regulators.\u2022 HNA is set to drop its pursuit of SkyBridge Capital\u2022 How close are the U.S. and Europe to a trade war?But from that, Mr. Legere sought to change the way U.S. wireless providers did business:\u2022 Lowering prices\u2022 Ending some long-term contract requirements\u2022 Offering unlimited data plans\u201cThe company took off like a rocketship and has sustained that momentum ever since the AT&T merger was blocked,\u201d the analyst Craig Moffett of the research firm MoffettNathanson told me in an interview.More on the legacy of Mr. Legere, from my and Cecilia\u2019s story on the deal:Those policies helped T-Mobile add nearly 40 million customers over the last five years, with 5 million new customers added last year alone. AT&T, Verizon and Sprint all followed suit, and in recent years the overall price of basic wireless plans has stayed flat or fallen, according to Obama-era regulators.The Un-carrier campaign helped propel T-Mobile ahead of Sprint in 2015. As of Dec. 31., the company had 58.7 million retail subscribers, compared to Sprint\u2019s 40.9 million. T-Mobile\u2019s market value also outstripped that of Sprint\u2019s, contributing to the structure of Sunday\u2019s deal: Mr. Legere would become C.E.O. of the combined company, which would keep the T-Mobile name.In an ironic twist, completion of the Sprint deal would put T-Mobile ahead of its former suitor, AT&T, in terms of retail subscribers. AT&T had 93.2 million at the end of 2017.But Mr. Moffett said that the very success of Mr. Legere and T-Mobile could pose problems for the Sprint deal, since it proves that regulators\u2019 opposition to the two companies\u2019 effort to merge in 2014 was justified.When I asked about the tweet in a phone interview on Sunday \u2014 which also involved Marcelo Claure, Sprint\u2019s C.E.O. \u2014 Mr. Legere chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re expecting me to remember tweets from 2014?\u201d he responded.\u2014 Michael de la Merced\u201cThe 5G aspects that are critical for the country and critical for us really was the flipping point as to this is the time.\u201d\u201cServices are going to be broadened, prices are going to go down, speeds are going to go up. The 5G capability is going to be beyond anything the United States has seen before. Jobs are going to go up from day one.\u201cIf you liked the competition before, you\u2019re going to love what\u2019s coming with this one. \u201dT-Mobile agreed to buy Sprint in an all-stock deal, which valued Sprint at $26.5 billion or $6.62 a share. At that deal price, Mr. Claure\u2019s long-term award of 10 million Sprint shares is worth $66.2 million. Those shares \u201cwill fully vest if he\u2019s terminated within 18 months of the deal\u2019s completion, or if his responsibilities change materially.\u201dHe also \u201cis eligible for cash severance of about $11.6 million and $54,000 of other benefits.\u201dSo far this year, companies and other buyers have announced $1.68 trillion of acquisitions, according to Dealogic. That\u2019s the biggest total through the first four months of a year on record, topping the $1.64 trillion of deals struck in 2007.Merger activity is also on a record pace in the United States. Acquirers have struck $674 billion of deals for U.S. companies through April 30, the highest level on record and exceeding the $607 billion agreed to through the same period in 2007.Whether they will succeed is another matter. Michael and Cecilia Kang point out that while the F.C.C. commissioner, Ajit Pai, has signaled an open mind toward mergers, many antitrust staffers at the Justice Department are the same people who opposed the deal in 2014.No matter how much hyperbole Sprint and T-Mobile expend, it is hard to see how the deal will pass muster with regulators.\u201cIt would not surprise me if they can come up with an economist with a model that says this is all unicorns and cupcakes,\u201d said Michael Kades, a former lawyer at the F.T.C. who is now the director of markets and competition policy for Washington Center for Equitable Growth. \u201cBut the market concentration is presumptively anticompetitive.\u201dFrom AnnaMaria Andriotis, Telis Demos and Emily Glazer of the WSJ:The financial companies have explored creating a new credit-card code for firearms dealers, similar to how they code restaurants, or department stores, according to people familiar with the matter. Another idea would require merchants to share information about specific firearm products consumers are buying, some of the people said.If the credit card companies and banks agreed, they could come up with a series of subcodes that would identify retailers that sold guns under a \u201cbest practices\u201d policy \u2014 like the policy that Citigroup proposed or the one that Walmart and Dick\u2019s follow \u2014 and the ones that don\u2019t. It would add transparency to the process, and it would give banks that issue credit cards the opportunity to decide which retailers they wanted to associate with.But such a move might concern opponents of gun control, who worry that keeping tabs on firearms sales would be contrary to the government\u2019s hands-off approach to monitoring such transactions. And then there are general privacy concerns: Adam Levitin, a law professor at Georgetown, told the WSJ: \u201cThere\u2019s the slippery slope danger if it\u2019s guns today maybe it is pornography tomorrow and the day after it\u2019s right-wing literature.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la MercedThe country says it will refuse to discuss President Trump\u2019s two toughest trade demands when American officials arrive in Beijing this week, potentially derailing the high-level talks.Keith Bradsher of the NYT reports:The Chinese government is publicly calling for flexibility on both sides. But senior Beijing officials do not plan to discuss the two biggest requests that the Trump administration has made over the past several months, according to people involved in Chinese policymaking. Those include a mandatory $100 billion cut in America\u2019s $375 billion annual trade deficit with China and curbs on Beijing\u2019s $300 billion plan to bankroll the country\u2019s industrial upgrade into advanced technologies like artificial intelligence, semiconductors, electric cars and commercial aircraft.What\u2019s behind China\u2019s stance? Beijing feels its economy has become big enough and resilient enough to stand up to the United States.Mr. Koum, who co-founded WhatsApp and had insisted that strong encryption be built into the service, was perturbed by the amount of data that Facebook collected on people and had advocated for stronger protections of that information, the executive said.Mr. Koum\u2019s exit is the highest-profile departure from Facebook after months of controversy at the social network.The gathering reliably draws leaders from Wall Street, Hollywood and sports to Los Angeles to discuss trade, health care, investing and more. This year\u2019s conference will touch on hot topics like the trade tensions between the U.S. and China, the #MeToo movement, the planned talks with North Korea, and the backlash against Silicon Valley.Attendees include Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Tim Sloan of Wells Fargo, Leon Black of Apollo Global Management and Eric Schmidt of Google.The worries of some critics, according to Nathaniel Popper:Countries that devote more resources to the process could successfully push their preferred cryptographic algorithms to be the standards, potentially creating so-called back doors that could be used in the future to spy on blockchain activity.More from Julie Creswell, Kevin Draper and Rachel Abrams:While Nike executives have told investors that the women\u2019s category was a crucial part of its revenue growth strategy, former employees said it was not given the budget it needed to roll out the sophisticated marketing campaigns that were the hallmark of traditional men\u2019s sports, like basketball.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018The Business of War\u2019: Google Employees Protest Work for the Pentagon", "Date": "2018-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Thousands of Google employees, including dozens of senior engineers, have signed a letter protesting the company\u2019s involvement in a Pentagon program that uses artificial intelligence to interpret video imagery and could be used to improve the targeting of drone strikes.The letter, which is circulating inside Google and has garnered more than 3,100 signatures, reflects a culture clash between Silicon Valley and the federal government that is likely to intensify as cutting-edge artificial intelligence is increasingly employed for military purposes.\u201cWe believe that Google should not be in the business of war,\u201d says the letter, addressed to Sundar Pichai, the company\u2019s chief executive. It asks that Google pull out of Project Maven, a Pentagon pilot program, and announce a policy that it will not \u201cever build warfare technology.\u201dThat kind of idealistic stance, while certainly not shared by all Google employees, comes naturally to a company whose motto is \u201cDon\u2019t be evil,\u201d a phrase invoked in the protest letter. But it is distinctly foreign to Washington\u2019s massive defense industry and certainly to the Pentagon, where the defense secretary, Jim Mattis, has often said a central goal is to increase the \u201clethality\u201d of the United States military.Google employees have circulated protest petitions on a range of issues, including Google Plus, the company\u2019s lagging competitor to Facebook, and Google\u2019s sponsorship of the Conservative Political Action Conference.Employees raised questions about Google\u2019s involvement in Project Maven at a recent companywide meeting. At the time, Diane Greene, who leads Google\u2019s cloud infrastructure business, defended the deal and sought to reassure concerned employees. A company spokesman said most of the signatures on the protest letter had been collected before the company had an opportunity to explain the situation.But improved analysis of drone video could be used to pick out human targets for strikes, while also better identifying civilians to reduce the accidental killing of innocent people.Without referring directly to the letter to Mr. Pichai, Google said in a statement on Tuesday that \u201cany military use of machine learning naturally raises valid concerns.\u201d It added, \u201cWe\u2019re actively engaged across the company in a comprehensive discussion of this important topic.\u201d The company called such exchanges \u201chugely important and beneficial,\u201d though several Google employees familiar with the letter would speak of it only on the condition of anonymity, saying they were concerned about retaliation.The statement said the company\u2019s part of Project Maven was \u201cspecifically scoped to be for non-offensive purposes,\u201d though officials declined to make available the relevant contract language. The Defense Department said that because Google is a subcontractor on Project Maven to the prime contractor, ECS Federal, it could not provide either the amount or the language of Google\u2019s contract. ECS Federal did not respond to inquiries.Google said the Pentagon was using \u201copen-source object recognition software available to any Google Cloud customer\u201d and based on unclassified data. \u201cThe technology is used to flag images for human review and is intended to save lives and save people from having to do highly tedious work,\u201d the company said.An uneasiness about military contracts among a small fraction of Google\u2019s more than 70,000 employees may not pose a major obstacle to the company\u2019s growth. But in the rarefied area of artificial intelligence research, Google is engaged in intense competition with other tech companies for the most talented people, so recruiters could be hampered if some candidates are put off by Google\u2019s defense connections.The employees\u2019 protest letter to Mr. Pichai, which has been circulated on an internal communications system for several weeks, argues that embracing military work could backfire by alienating customers and potential recruits.\u201cThis plan will irreparably damage Google\u2019s brand and its ability to compete for talent,\u201d the letter says. \u201cAmid growing fears of biased and weaponized AI, Google is already struggling to keep the public\u2019s trust.\u201d It suggests that Google risks being viewed as joining the ranks of big defense contractors like Raytheon, General Dynamics and the big-data firm Palantir.Like other onetime upstarts turned powerful Silicon Valley behemoths, Google is being forced to confront the idealism that guided the company in its early years. Facebook started with the lofty mission of connecting people all over the world, but it has recently come under fire for becoming a conduit for fake news and being used by Russia to influence the 2016 election and sow dissent among American voters.Paul Scharre, a former Pentagon official and author of \u201cArmy of None,\u201d a forthcoming book on the use of artificial intelligence to build autonomous weapons, said the clash inside Google was inevitable, given the company\u2019s history and the booming demand for A.I. in the military.\u201cThere\u2019s a strong libertarian ethos among tech folks, and a wariness about the government\u2019s use of technology,\u201d said Mr. Scharre, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security in Washington. \u201cNow A.I. is suddenly and quite quickly moving out of the research lab and into real life.\u201dScott Shane reported from Washington, and Daisuke Wakabayashi from San Francisco.

{"Headline": "Trump, Having Denounced Amazon\u2019s Shipping Deal, Orders Review of Postal Service", "Date": "2018-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump abruptly issued an executive order on Thursday demanding an evaluation of the Postal Service\u2019s finances, asserting the power of his office weeks after accusing Amazon, the online retail giant, of not paying its fair share in postage.In the executive order, issued just before 9 p.m., Mr. Trump created a task force to examine the service\u2019s \u201cunsustainable financial path\u201d and directed the new panel to \u201cconduct a thorough evaluation of the operations and finances of the U.S.P.S.\u201dThe president does not mention Amazon in the order, but it is clear that he intends for the panel to substantiate his repeated claim that the financial arrangement between the Postal Service and Amazon, its biggest shipper of packages, is a money loser.Postal Service experts and even Mr. Trump\u2019s own advisers have privately urged him to back off the accusations, noting that the huge number of packages shipped by Amazon is actually helping to keep the Postal Service financially solvent.While the service has consistently reported net losses for a decade, much of its financial woes are the result of a prolonged decline in the volume of marketing mail and first-class mail. The service makes money on packages, and Amazon is the service\u2019s biggest single shipper of packages.\u201cThat amounts to Billions of Dollars,\u201d he continued.Mr. Trump\u2019s repeated attacks on Amazon have focused in part on the company\u2019s billionaire owner, Jeff Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post. People close to Mr. Trump have said the president\u2019s tirades against the retailer often come after The Post has published negative articles about him.At one point last month, Amazon\u2019s stock price tumbled after Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets and a suggestion that he might direct the government to take action against the company.Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment late Thursday.But until Thursday night, Mr. Trump had limited his attacks to ones on Twitter. The White House had said the president did not have immediate plans to take any action against Amazon and had given no warning that the executive order was coming.In the order, the president calls on the task force to examine various parts of the Postal Service\u2019s business, including ones that appear to directly involve large parts of Amazon\u2019s business.That includes the \u201cexpansion and pricing\u201d of the package delivery market and the service\u2019s role in competing with other, private delivery companies. The task force should look at the decline in mail volume and the implications for the service, Mr. Trump said.The order also calls for the task force to look at the service\u2019s \u201cuniversal service obligation,\u201d which requires the service to deliver to everyone in the United States, given changes in technology and e-commerce.Some parts of the order appear to hint at further privatization of the Postal Service, indicating that members of the task force should examine \u201cthe U.S.P.S. role in the U.S. economy and in rural areas, communities, and small towns.\u201dIn the order, Mr. Trump said that the longstanding financial problems at the Postal Service demand some kind of action.\u201cA number of factors, including the steep decline in First-Class Mail volume, coupled with legal mandates that compel the U.S.P.S. to incur substantial and inflexible costs, have resulted in a structural deficit,\u201d Mr. Trump says in the order. \u201cThe U.S.P.S. is on an unsustainable financial path and must be restructured to prevent a taxpayer-funded bailout.\u201dIt is unclear how quickly the task force will be assembled, or when its review might result in changes at the Postal Service that could directly affect Amazon and other shippers.In May, Mr. Trump created a similar commission to examine what he said was evidence of large-scale voter fraud in the 2016 election \u2014 a claim that was repeatedly debunked by election experts from both major political parties.But he dissolved the commission in January after several legal challenges and a lack of cooperation from Democratic and Republican election officials in a number of states.In the case of the Postal Service order on Thursday night, Mr. Trump demanded that a report of findings be delivered to him by summer\u2019s end. He urged the task force to recommend administrative and legislative changes that could be made.Mr. Trump\u2019s task force does not address the president\u2019s other complaint about Amazon: that the online retailer fails to pay sales taxes, giving it an unfair advantage over brick-and-mortar businesses.In fact, while Amazon used to benefit from tax-free sales, it now charges sales tax on the sale of virtually all of its own products. Many third-party merchants who use the service to sell their own goods on Amazon\u2019s sites still do not charge sales tax.Emily Cochrane contributed reporting from Washington, and Nick Wingfield from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Shipping Costs Have Put Amazon in a Bind: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Good Friday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Does Amazon have its shipping costs under control?\u2022 What will come out of the Merkel-Trump meeting?\u2022 Why Deutsche Bank was so late to make necessary cuts.\u2022 More complaints have emerged about NBC News\u2019s response to harassment allegations.Amazon\u2019s shipping costs have suddenly become a hot subject, not just to President Trump, but also to the 100 million people who have Amazon Prime.Higher shipping costs are a reason Amazon is raising the cost of Prime membership to $119 a year from $99.But a 20 percent hike is a lot for even a popular service, and it could turn customers off. So why did Amazon do it? The e-commerce giant\u2019s results provide some clues.Members of Prime get free shipping, though their membership fees partially pay for that perk. As the Prime program covers more goods, it\u2019s getting more expensive for Amazon. \u201cOur two-day shipping, it\u2019s now available on over 100 million items, up from 20 million as recently as 2014,\u201d Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon\u2019s C.F.O., said on a conference call Thursday when announcing the increase in the Prime membership fee.The cost pressures from shipping are getting uncomfortable for Amazon. Worldwide shipping costs totaled $6.1 billion in the first quarter of this year, equivalent to 22.5 percent of Amazon\u2019s sales from its online stores during the period. That\u2019s up from 2017, when quarterly shipping costs averaged 19.9 percent of online sales. By bringing shipping costs back down to 20 percent of online sales, Amazon could, in theory, save over $2.5 billion a year (2.5 percent of annualized first-quarter sales comes to roughly $2.8 billion.)To save money, Amazon could offer free shipping on fewer goods, but that could undermine the company\u2019s efforts to bolster sales. And Amazon doesn\u2019t need to do that if it can increase its Prime fees, to help recoup the higher shipping costs. But the fee increase may not be enough. Charging 100 million Prime members an extra $20 per year, in theory, raises \u201conly\u201c $2 billion.- Peter EavisMore on her challenge, from the NYT:Few leaders seem less personally in sync with Mr. Trump than Ms. Merkel. Estranged by widely diverging temperaments and leadership styles, the two leaders have also clashed on substance \u2014 from climate change and military spending to Germany\u2019s chronic, yawning trade surplus with the United States, a particular bugbear of the president.Or as a former State Department official told the NYT, \u201cMerkel is going to Washington and it looks like the U.S. just doesn\u2019t care.\u201d But a foreign relations expert said, \u201cNever underestimate Merkel.\u201dA combination of the two companies would complete one of the telecommunications industry\u2019s most long-awaited transactions and would create the third-largest wireless carrier in the United States, with more than 127 million customers. Sprint and T-Mobile have tried to negotiate a merger twice before.Analysts have argued, and Sprint and T-Mobile themselves have acknowledged, that the companies need greater scale and more resources to better compete against the industry\u2019s leaders, Verizon and AT&T.Should the deal be completed, only three companies would dominate the market in the United States for cellphone service. It is unclear whether the transaction would get regulatory approval. A previous round of merger talks ended in 2014, having drawn strong opposition from the Obama administration.\u2014 Michael de la MercedWhat Mr. Ubben had to say: \u201cThe management and board of FOX has done a superb job of steering the company through a time of transition for the entertainment industry.\u201dWhat Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch had to say: \u201cJeff has been an important partner during a transformational period. Our board and, ultimately, our shareholders, have benefited enormously from his many contributions.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la Merced\u2022 Nonresidential fixed investment \u2014 what businesses spend on equipment, software, buildings and intellectual property \u2014 increased at a solid 6.1 percent.\u2022 Business spending on equipment climbed 4.7 percent, down from 11.6 percent in the fourth quarter.Bigger pictureEconomists on Wall Street and in Washington have repeatedly warned that the economy\u2019s upward streak is unlikely to extend beyond the next year or two.Over the longer term, the Fed expects real annual growth in the United States to fall to 1.8 percent. The Congressional Budget Office\u2019s 10-year outlook comes to the same disappointing conclusion.The nation\u2019s debt has topped $21 trillion and is growing, a level many view as unsustainable. And if the Federal Reserve follows through on its plan to raise interest rates, the cost of paying off that debt will grow larger.\u2022 Hubris: Unlike rivals, Deutsche Bank didn\u2019t raise capital after the financial crisis, ultimately leaving it significantly weaker. By the end of last year, its tangible equity capital ratio was still below JPMorgan Chase in 2011. (Perhaps Germany\u2019s banking regulator should have applied more pressure, as Switzerland\u2019s did.)\u2022 Fear: Did Deutsche Bank\u2019s leaders worry about scaling back the investment bank because of its huge importance for revenue? (Last year, it provided 54 percent.) And about the cost of unwinding some trades?The news organization asserted that the complaints that led to Matt Lauer being ousted from the \u201cToday\u201d show were the first of their kind. Others disagree:What NBC News has done: Brought in a consultant for in-person sexual harassment prevention seminars and pledged to share the results of an internal review.The online video giant has largely avoided the political heat that has burned Facebook, but it has still lurched from crisis to crisis, particularly over upsetting videos.The idea is that someday humans will be able to train the machines, in a similar manner, to sniff out misinformation, smut, and abuse.Sure, there\u2019s logic to it, in the face of the threat from Netflix and Amazon. But as the two companies continue to bicker over price and executive chairs, is there another reason Shari Redstone is pushing the idea so hard, when other CBS shareholders seem uninterested?What seems to be driving Shari Redstone is familial score-settling, a quest for victory over her father, who never wanted her to have a role in either Viacom or CBS. \u201cIt\u2019s the story of a person who was mistreated by her father,\u201d said the source who recently noted Sumner\u2019s physical condition, and has known the father and daughter for an extensive period of time.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Supreme Court Divided on Sales Taxes for Online Purchases", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A closely divided Supreme Court struggled on Tuesday to decide whether internet retailers should have to collect sales taxes in states where they have no physical presence.Brick-and-mortar businesses have long complained that they are disadvantaged by having to charge sales taxes while many of their online competitors do not. States have said that they are missing out on tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue under a 1992 Supreme Court ruling that helped spur the rise of internet shopping.Several justices expressed concerns about imposing crushing burdens on small businesses that sell goods on the internet and about making them liable for back taxes. Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the case before the court, South Dakota v. Wayfair, No. 17-494, raised \u201ca host of questions\u201d and \u201ca whole new set of difficulties.\u201dSounding almost plaintive, she added that Congress, rather than the Supreme Court, was the right forum in which to settle the matter.\u201cIs there anything we can do to give Congress a signal that it should act more affirmatively in this area?\u201d Justice Sotomayor asked.But Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said that \u201cit would be very strange for us to tell Congress it ought to do something in any particular area.\u201dBoth he and Justice Elena Kagan said the fact that Congress has so far chosen not to act was itself a telling indication that it was satisfied with the current system.The chief justice added that the marketplace may already be addressing the problem.\u201cThe bigger e-commerce companies find themselves with a physical presence in all 50 states,\u201d he said, \u201cso they\u2019re already covered.\u201dJustice Gorsuch seemed prepared on Tuesday to reconsider the Quill decision. \u201cWhy should this court favor a particular business model?\u201d he asked.\u201cIt is unwise to delay any longer a reconsideration of the court\u2019s holding in Quill,\u201d he wrote. \u201cA case questionable even when decided, Quill now harms states to a degree far greater than could have been anticipated earlier.\u201dSouth Dakota responded to Justice Kennedy\u2019s invitation by enacting a law that required all merchants to collect a 4.5 percent sales tax if they had more than $100,000 in annual sales or more than 200 individual transactions in the state. State officials sued three large online retailers \u2014 Wayfair, Overstock.com and Newegg \u2014 for violating the law.\u201cThe South Dakota law is obviously a test case,\u201d Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said on Tuesday. \u201cIt was devised to present the most reasonable incarnation of this scheme.\u201d\u201cBut do you have any doubt,\u201d Justice Alito asked a lawyer for the federal government, \u201cthat states that are tottering on the edge of insolvency and municipalities, which may be in even worse position, have a strong incentive to grab everything they possibly can?\u201dThe lawyer, Malcolm L. Stewart, who argued in support of South Dakota, did not disagree.\u201cMany states would adopt regimes that are less hospitable to retailers\u201d if the court allowed them to require the collection of taxes, he said, \u201cunless they were stopped from doing that by Congress.\u201dJustice Alito suggested that a decision from the Supreme Court could short-circuit a more nuanced legislative consideration of the issue. \u201cAs things stand now,\u201d he said, \u201cit seems that both the states and internet retailers have an incentive to ask for a congressional solution to this problem.\u201dLower courts ruled for the online retailers in the South Dakota case, citing the Quill decision.At Tuesday\u2019s argument, Marty J. Jackley, South Dakota\u2019s attorney general, argued that the Quill decision did not make sense in the digital era. He said that the major practical problem it had identified \u2014 that it would be burdensome for out-of-state retailers to calculate and collect taxes for thousands of state and local jurisdictions \u2014 had been solved by modern software.But that assertion was hotly disputed by George S. Isaacson, a lawyer for the three internet retailers, who said a ruling against his clients would impose burdens on small online merchants. A national solution, he said, should come from Congress rather than the Supreme Court.Some justices complained that they lacked fundamental information about how hard it is to collect the taxes and how much money is at stake. The two sides, Justice Stephen G. Breyer said, were of little help. Estimates of how much it would cost internet businesses to comply with the tax laws of what were said to be 12,000 state and local jurisdictions varied from $12 to $250,000.Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said there could be a market solution, too. \u201cIf we did overrule Quill,\u201d she said, \u201centrepreneurs would produce software that would meet the market need.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fighting to Save America\u2019s Bats", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMr. Taylor is the author of several books on caves.Four scientists in Tyvek suits and rubber boots carried an aluminum fishing boat toward an opening in a granite rock face in northern Georgia. Mist cascaded from surrounding mountains, curling over swollen streams, obscuring signs for turnoffs like Warwoman Road. This was \u201cDeliverance\u201d country; the 1972 film was shot nearby.Along with a half-dozen researchers, I stood in the rain on the last day of an unusually warm February as the white-clad figures entered Black Diamond Tunnel, a segment of a never-completed railway begun in the 1850s that is now partly flooded. They set the boat beside a makeshift landing, climbed aboard, switched on helmet lamps and set off down a black river.\u201cIt\u2019s taken me years to get to this point,\u201d he said.At the Black Diamond Tunnel, scientists had been testing an antifungal agent called B23, derived from an unlikely source, the stem tissues of wild pineapples growing in the Bolivian Amazon basin. With a commercial mosquito fogger bolted to a remote-controlled boat, christened Batilda by Dr. Cornelison\u2019s team, researchers had sprayed several applications of B23 in the tunnel during the previous year.\u201cIf the numbers are too low today, we may have to abandon the project,\u201d Pete Pattavina, a bat biologist for the federal government, told me as we drove to the site. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to justify the continued expense if we only have a few survivors.\u201dI don\u2019t agree. While targeted cures like the one being tested in Black Diamond would likely be impractical for most wild caves, they could potentially slow the leading edges of the disease. Kelly Lutsch, a first-year graduate student of Dr. Cornelison, has been surveying concrete culverts along Interstates 75 and 95 through Georgia\u2019s coastal plains. She believes that infected bats using the culverts could be carrying the pathogen south into cave-rich zones near the Florida panhandle. If so, spraying the culverts with B23 might be warranted. One Georgia cave near the Florida border hosts a robust colony of 90,000 southeastern myotis bats.At the Black Diamond Tunnel, the results of the spraying were encouraging. After an hour, the team slowly paddled back to share its results: 178 bats, up by 26 from the last count.Dr. Cornelison cautioned against interpreting this as a success for B23, since other factors could affect the count. Still, he declared himself \u201cecstatic\u201d that the number was higher, not lower, and plans to test B23 again in the tunnel.\u201cI don\u2019t think we will ever know the full ecological effect\u201d of white-nose syndrome, Mr. Pattavina said. \u201cWe only realize the value of biodiversity when catastrophe happens.\u201dBut for the moment, for one tiny group of survivors in a Georgia tunnel, there is a glimmer of hope amid the catastrophe.Advertisement"}

Revenue rose 16 percent to $26.8 billion in the quarter, exceeding the Wall Street consensus forecast of nearly $25.8 billion.Microsoft\u2019s earnings per share increased 36 percent to 95 cents a share, well above the analysts\u2019 average estimate of 85 cents a share, compiled by Thomson Reuters.Since Satya Nadella became chief executive in 2014, the cloud portion of Microsoft\u2019s revenue has soared from 3 percent to more than 21 percent this year, according to estimates by Credit Suisse.Azure, the company\u2019s unit supplying cloud-based computer processing and storage, grew by 93 percent compared with the same quarter a year ago. Microsoft is now a strong No. 2, behind Amazon, in this market for the foundation layer of cloud technology. Microsoft finished 2017 with 13 percent of the cloud infrastructure services market, according to Synergy Research Group, a gain of three percentage points during the year.Microsoft\u2019s broader commercial cloud division, which includes Azure and customer and operations management software for corporations, grew by 58 percent.The cloud transition is changing the company\u2019s business model to one with a rising share of steady, recurring revenue from cloud subscriptions rather than traditional software sales. Including contributions from cloud-based versions of its Office productivity software and online gaming subscriptions, recurring revenue streams now account for about 30 percent of Microsoft\u2019s sales, said Michael Nemeroff, an analyst at Credit Suisse.That share, Mr. Nemeroff estimates, could reach more than 50 percent in four years.The successful shift to the cloud and the subscription sales model has pleased investors. Microsoft\u2019s shares have climbed roughly 40 percent in the past year. The company\u2019s share price slipped by 1 percent in after-hours trading on Thursday, after gaining 2 percent during the regular session.Not long ago, Microsoft was considered a faded power among big tech companies. Today its stock market value, while behind Apple, is neck and neck with Amazon\u2019s and slightly ahead of Google\u2019s.The personal computer software business, once Microsoft\u2019s mainstay, has been eroding for years, as people spend more of their computing time on smartphones. But personal computer shipments have held steady recently as businesses replace old PCs with new ones that use the latest Microsoft operating system, Windows 10.The Windows PC operating system business is in a division Microsoft calls \u201cmore personal computing,\u201d which grew by 13 percent.

The figures are sobering, even in a political climate where deficit concerns appear to be receding.This fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, the budget deficit is expected to total $804 billion, up from $665 billion last fiscal year, according to the C.B.O. projections. In a decade, the red ink is expected to reach $1.5 trillion.\u2014 Thomas KaplanWhen he goes before Congress this week, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, will issue a broad apology for letting the website be used as a conduit for fake news, election meddling by foreign entities, hate speech and privacy abuses, according to a copy of his testimony released on Monday.Mr. Zuckerberg, in his prepared remarks, addresses the scandal, saying that Facebook must do more to protect its users\u2019 personal information. The company, he says, will block app developers from gaining access to the data of users who have been inactive for three months; restrict the ability of users to inadvertently share information about others in their networks; and adopt stricter permissions guidelines and search features.Democrats are expected to grill Mr. Zuckerberg about the privacy scandals, and how the social network is guarding against possible interference in this fall\u2019s midterm elections. Republicans are expected to be more reticent about privacy regulations, and may use the hearings to raise suspicions of political bias on the social network.More from The Information:\u201cOverall, there has never been a time where we have seen so much focus on diversity.

{"Headline": "Goldman\u2019s Gains in Trading Raise a Familiar Dilemma: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Tuesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 A \u2018Geneva Convention\u2019 for cyberwar?\u2022 Did Goldman\u2019s trading business perform too well?\u2022 The U.S.-China fight has pushed deeper into tech.Goldman Sachs\u2019s strong first-quarter earnings raise a familiar dilemma for the bank.The results got a significant fillip from trading, a business Goldman must do well in, but not so well that investors think the bank is too dependent on it. And a breakdown of first-quarter revenue shows the dominance of trading. Revenue from trading in stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities and derivatives totaled $4.39 billion during the first three months of the year. That works out at 44 percent of total revenue, well above the 37 percent share that trading had in 2017.Stock and bond markets are unpredictable, even in relatively good times, so the helpful trading conditions this quarter may not last. What can Goldman\u2019s senior executives do to persuade investors that the bank is a lot more than a trading shop? They can point to the fact that David M. Solomon is in line to succeed Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman\u2019s current C.E.O. Mr. Solomon ascent took place in the bank\u2019s powerful investment banking division, not its trading operations.Goldman\u2019s leaders can continue to talk about the steps the bank is taking to widen its client base and diversify into other businesses that might have more stable revenue, like its relatively new consumer lending operations. But such businesses are going to take time to make a meaningful contribution.And it\u2019s important to remember that other major businesses at Goldman are also volatile. Investing and lending, which mostly involves making longer-term investments in companies, and whose revenue can be unpredictable, made up 21 percent of total revenue in the first quarter, the second largest contribution.Despite the bumper results in trading along with investing and lending, Goldman\u2019s shares slid slightly on Tuesday, suggesting investors are waiting on longer-term trends than one quarter\u2019s results.But the volatility of revenue is not the only reason investors are often skeptical about Wall Street firms. The huge amounts that they pay out in compensation is also a concern. When revenue rises, so does pay. As a result, money that could have fallen to the bottom line at other types of companies instead gets paid out to traders and bankers. Compensation at Goldman Sachs made up 45 percent of non-interest revenue in the first quarter, up from 44 percent the first quarter of 2017.\u2014 Peter EavisHere are the numbers:The move comes amid an outcry prompted by the arrests of two African-American men at a Starbucks location in Philadelphia last week.The two men were arrested after asking to use the restroom in the shop. An employee refused their request, because the men had not bought anything, according to officials. The men sat down and were asked to leave, and an employee eventually called the police. The prosecutor\u2019s office in Philadelphia reviewed the case and declined to pursue charges against the men because of \u201ca lack of evidence that a crime was committed,\u201d according to a spokesman.Some may be optimistic that the $1.5 trillion tax cut will extend the business cycle.The strategists at Morgan Stanley are not among them.\u201cWhile there\u2019s a fair amount of debate about how much this fiscal expansion extended the economic cycle, for markets our analysis suggests we\u2019re closer to the end of the day than the beginning. Hence, there\u2019s less reason to behave like it\u2019s \u2018morning in America\u2019 than \u2018happy hour in America.\u2019\u201dKey points\u2022 Morgan Stanley argues that while the tax cuts will help lift growth in the near term, its benefits are already priced into the markets.\u2022 The new tax law creates economic cliffs, as many key provisions in the law are not permanent and end in just a few years.\u2022 The tax cuts may make it more difficult for the government to turn to fiscal stimulus to fight the next downturn.In conclusion\u201cWhile this policy supports growth in the near term, it may worsen the next downturn while limiting the fiscal reaction to it. Even if those concerns are unfounded, we think much of fiscal stimulus\u2019 \u2018good news\u2019 is already in the price of key markets.\u201dThe streaming video company added 7.41 million subscribers during the first quarter. Its profit jumped 62 percent, and sales grew 40 percent.Netflix also said it plans to spend $10 billion on content and marketing this year.Shares are up 8.6 percent Tuesday and 75 percent this year. That easily beats the S.&P. 500, which has gained just 0.2 percent this year. It also tops the performance of its fellow FANG stocks. Facebook is off 4.5 percent this year, Google-parent Alphabet is up about 3 percent, and Amazon has risen 28 percent.Stephen Ju, an analyst over at Credit Suisse, writes in a note titled \u201cGetting Closer and Closer to Achieving Escape Velocity\u201d:\u201cNetflix continues to reap the benefits of its programming win streak, as it wields its large content acquisition budget as a weapon to put greater distance between itself and its competitors (especially as Disney prepares to exit the platform). And we find it hard to argue with the accelerated pace of subscriber additions as the conceptual proof of its capital allocation decision, and we also expect the Street to continue to underwrite the investments.\u201dTwitter is having an even better day.The stock is up 87 percent over that period.The NYT\u2019s David Sanger says the impetus came largely from Microsoft\u2019s president, Brad Smith, \u201cwho has been arguing for several years that the world needs a \u2018digital Geneva Convention\u2019 that sets norms of behavior for cyberspace just as the Geneva Conventions set rules for the conduct of war in the physical world.\u201dAlso striking: Who hasn\u2019t yet signed, including Google, Apple and Amazon.More from Michael:Ms. Massenet and Mr. Brown are counting on Ms. Massenet\u2019s Net-a-Porter experience and contacts to help Imaginary Ventures stand out. The firm has already invested in companies like Glossier and Everlane, an upstart clothing brand.Mr. Ballmer said of the latest report, \u201cPublic companies owe this level of transparency to shareholders; I think citizens, as America\u2019s shareholders, deserve the same.\u201dAs more financial firms move to pressure gun makers and sellers into self-regulation, the advocacy group (backed by Mike Bloomberg) plans to ask them to press for more policy positions and operational changes.Among them: Requiring background checks for all gun sales; more funding for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; having gun makers require sellers to adopt a code of conduct; and adopting smart-gun tech.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Year I Learned to Quit", "Date": "2018-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI took two weeks off running, diligently doing the daily exercises prescribed by my physical therapist. Upon return I managed two easy short runs and a 10-miler, but the pain came back.But I finally gave myself permission to give up \u2014 and realize it\u2019s very much in keeping with the rest of my life right now, as I am learning the lost art of quitting.So un-American, right?And yet. Last year I walked away from what, on paper, was the dream job I had been striving toward for most of my career: I had been working in corporate social responsibility for 15 years, and got the chance to lead that function for Amazon.But it turned out not to be the perfect fit, not least because during my 22-month tenure in the role my twins morphed from speechless baby lumps into wondrous compelling little people. (They\u2019re now 5.) My hours were manageable, but I wasn\u2019t as present as I wanted to be when I was home.Could I have \u201chad it all\u201d? Sure: I had a supportive stay-at-home husband, a corporate salary, and plenty of working parent role models in friends, colleagues and my own upbringing.But when I paused to really pay attention \u2014 and stopped busily managing logistics and proverbially running through the pain \u2014 I knew it wasn\u2019t right.So I quit.It pained me to walk away from the team I had built and what we might have achieved together, but the quality and quantity of time I\u2019ve had with my family and for myself since then has far outweighed my regrets.Turns out my quitting didn\u2019t stop there. For the first time, I\u2019ve walked away from half-finished drafts of writing that didn\u2019t flow. I\u2019ve turned down consulting projects that I could have done with my eyes closed \u2014 because I don\u2019t want to do anything with my eyes closed anymore.I know that it is an enormous luxury to be able to choose not to work for even a short period of time. But I also realize that it is a necessity to hit the pause button once in awhile.Mr. Muller pointed out to me that cycles of rest and activity aren\u2019t optional in the natural world. \u201cThe bears don\u2019t go, \u2018Oh, man, I gotta hibernate, I don\u2019t have time! I\u2019m a little too busy to go dormant this year, but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll do it next year.\u2019\u201dPlants and animals do not defer dormancy until they cross off just one more thing on their to-do list; they have to shut down in order to live another season. Our hyperactive culture is starting to acknowledge the importance of getting enough sleep and unplugging from our devices.Maintaining what Ms. Cecil calls a \u201csteady diet of spaciousness\u201d is particularly important for people (like me) who find themselves at a crossroads, and might be tempted to think and plan their way into what\u2019s next. \u201cYou can\u2019t plan your way into a life where the externals \u2014 what you\u2019re doing and who you\u2019re with and where you are \u2014 match up with your soul,\u201d she said. \u201cThat congruence is only accessible by deeper listening. Planning precludes a certain level of listening, because the answers come usually when there\u2019s some spaciousness. A plan often isn\u2019t alive.\u201dAm I still angry about bailing on Big Sur after months of prep, and experiencing regular waves of doubt about quitting that and everything else that I\u2019ve quit in the past year? Of course.And I know that I\u2019ll be overcome with jealousy on race day when my dad and husband board the runners\u2019 bus before dawn and come home with medals.But I\u2019m learning to be content with putting my feet up, and rest in what Mr. Muller calls the \u201chammock of sufficiency.\u201d I can always try again next year. Or not.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Knowledge Gap Hinders Ability of Congress to Regulate Silicon Valley", "Date": "2018-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cI think we need to be careful,\u201d cautioned Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican. \u201cI think there are a number of different ideas, but I don\u2019t think anything has coalesced in terms of a consensus.\u201dFor the public, watching the many bursts of fireworks from Congress and the quick after-fizzle can be dizzying. But Representative Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey, the ranking Democrat on the House committee responsible for internet regulation, warned voters not to expect much.\u201cI hate to be such a pessimist, but I don\u2019t believe the Republicans will end up doing anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI just don\u2019t have any faith in their willingness to regulate to protect privacy in the context of Facebook.\u201dBeyond the typical political gridlock that has stymied action in Congress, technology and the companies that sell access to it are particularly protected.Inaction does not reflect a lack of will so much as a failure of expertise.\u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen an issue where everybody seemed to be on the same sheet of music,\u201d Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said Thursday.If Congress does not follow through with new rules for internet companies, \u201cwe\u2019ll look like a bunch of idiots,\u201d Mr. Graham added.Avoiding that dunce cap will be difficult. Lawmakers will confront Silicon Valley\u2019s powerful new lobbying establishment. Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple now hold the biggest corporate lobbying budgets in Washington and spent a combined $49.7 million in 2017 on direct lobbying, which does not include their outside lobbying trade groups, up 24 percent from the previous year. They have hired top privacy experts into their lobbying troops to defeat privacy and other internet laws.Facebook has said it would embrace some regulation, with Mr. Zuckerberg saying this week that rules for internet companies were \u201cinevitable.\u201d But he also indicated that it would have to be the \u201cright\u201d regulations, and he was not willing to commit on the spot to several ideas posed by lawmakers.The hearings spurred new momentum for the introduction of privacy laws. On Thursday, Senators Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, and John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, introduced legislation that would allow consumers to opt out of getting tracked on a site. The bill would also mandate simpler privacy policies.One new bill would restrict data collection of students using classroom technology, and another would require companies to get permission before collecting and sharing user data. That would move the United States closer to rules about to take effect next month in Europe. An earlier bill would mandate more disclosure on Facebook advertising purchases.Nevertheless, the creation of any regulations in coming months is doubtful. Most lawmakers said in the hearings that they were concerned about privacy and foreign interference on social media during the 2016 election. But several Republicans also expressed anxiety over regulations that could slow the growth of Silicon Valley, a beacon for the American economy.\u201cThese are tough ones. Privacy versus innovation versus security versus freedom \u2014 these are always tough questions,\u201d said Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona. He said he would most likely support the political ad disclosures bill but added, \u201cWhen we step in, are we always late?\u201dThis week, Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, introduced the Consent Act, which would require companies to get permission before tracking and sharing data. But even he pointed to Washington\u2019s short attention span. Companies like Facebook, he said, would try to stand in Congress\u2019s way.\u201cThey will try to make it more complex than it is,\u201d he said.\u201cThe question is timing,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal added, pointing to the difficult midterm elections in November and the desire by many legislators to do as little as possible until then. \u201cThis session, everybody says, is over as far as serious legislating is concerned.\u201dMr. Graham, who said regulations were necessary, also acknowledged the pitfalls of moving too fast.\u201cI\u2019d hate to be the senator that killed an effort to have reasonable regulation,\u201d Mr. Graham said. But, he conceded, \u201cYou really need to know what you are signing up for.\u201dBeyond the short term, the hearings may have laid the foundation for broader privacy regulations in coming years, analysts said. The most likely action to follow Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s grilling is the passage of a bill that requires financial disclosures of political advertising on social media, a law similar to broadcast television and radio political ad disclosures.Narrow regulatory ideas could gain momentum that prevent online location tracking, strengthen privacy protections for children and teens and require stronger disclosures for data breaches. But the government\u2019s light hand on Silicon Valley will continue for some time even as the European Union prepares to enact comprehensive privacy rules that limit data collection and push companies to ask permission before sharing information about users.Even if seats in the House and Senate shift after the midterm elections, any privacy laws would be at least a couple of years away, said Paul Gallant, a technology policy analyst at the Cowen Group.\u201cIf Democrats win the House in November, the chances of legislation would rise, although a likely Republican Senate would still make passage an uphill battle,\u201d Mr. Gallant said.A big problem is the lack of technological expertise in Congress, and the informational imbalance with the tech companies\u2019 lobbyists.In 2011, tech lobbyists blanketed the Senate Judiciary Committee after former Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, introduced a geolocation privacy bill.Internet firms brought in engineers and deployed their outside lobbying groups to warn lawmakers that Mr. Franken\u2019s bill was dangerous and technically flawed, said Alvaro Bedoya, a former staff member for Mr. Franken who is now the executive director of the Georgetown Center for Privacy and Technology.Another obstacle to action is a disagreement on regulatory priorities.Indeed, Mr. Graham identified a grab bag of problems that he wanted addressed with Facebook, most of which are not being addressed by any current legislative proposals.He mentioned terrorism content, Facebook\u2019s \u201cmonopoly\u201d and political bias as regulatory targets. At Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s hearings on Tuesday and Wednesday, other lawmakers brought up data breaches, foreign interference and censorship, particularly of the pro-Trump internet personalities Diamond and Silk.\u201cI want somebody to look at how they set these machines up, not just for Facebook, but other people, to make sure that the algorithms are not being politically motivated,\u201d Mr. Graham said.The lack of technological knowledge was glaring. Members mostly comprised lawyers or former business people, and many are just getting acquainted with social media, artificial intelligence, autonomous self-driving cars, drones and other technologies that they are charged to oversee.Diversity in government has become a platform issue for Brianna Wu, a former software designer who is running for the 8th House district in Massachusetts.Ms. Wu watched Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s hearings and was struck by the basic lack of knowledge members had in how the site works, such as the business model of ad-supported websites and how messaging apps like Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp works. Before the hearings, many of the members brought in technology experts from academic institutions to prepare them for Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s appearance.\u201cMost people can understand why guns are a threat,\u201d she said. \u201cWith technology, people don\u2019t understand fundamentally what the threat is. That is a threat to democracy.\u201dA photo caption with an earlier version of this article misidentified a member of the Senate attending the hearing. It was Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, not Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana.videovideoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon Tries a New Delivery Spot: Your Car", "Date": "2018-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Amazon packages get delivered to all sorts of places.Front porches? Naturally. Cubicles? Of course. Inside locked homes? Yes, that, too.Now add a new one: the trunk of your car.Starting Tuesday, people in dozens of cities across the United States can start getting their Amazon orders delivered to a parked car, provided their vehicle has the proper technology. With a few taps on a smartphone screen, the courier can unlock the car and drop the box inside the trunk or on the back seat.The new service is aimed at anyone who doesn\u2019t want to risk having their package swiped from their front porch or who can\u2019t receive an Amazon order at work, perhaps because an employer doesn\u2019t allow it or because the company mailroom is not secure.On Monday, the company showed how it worked: An Amazon driver fetched a box from the back of a van and headed toward her delivery destination \u2014 the trunk of an empty, gleaming Volvo S90 sedan in a parking lot. After she hit a couple of buttons on an app, the trunk was unlocked and the package went inside, then was locked in the car, where \u2014 had this not been a staged demonstration \u2014 it would have waited for its owner.Amazon has dived into delivery convenience and security with gusto. To reduce package theft, it has installed lockers outside physical stores where customers can pick up orders. And last year, it introduced Amazon Key, which lets its couriers unlock customers\u2019 front doors and drop packages inside.The new in-car delivery service, which will be available in 37 cities and surrounding areas, is a variation of Amazon Key.For in-car delivery to work, customers must have a 2015 or later Chevrolet, Buick, GMC or Cadillac vehicle with an active account with OnStar, the roadside assistance and navigation service from General Motors. Car owners with 2015 or newer Volvos with a similar service, On Call, can also receive in-car deliveries from Amazon.Couriers can use those assistance services to find the cars through satellite location-tracking and unlock the trunk.The company says its systems will allow couriers to unlock vehicles only once for each scheduled delivery, to prevent unauthorized access. Still, the service will require a hefty amount of trust that a courier won\u2019t swipe any valuables. The in-car service requires fewer protections than Amazon\u2019s in-home delivery service, which requires customers to have an internet-connected front door lock and security camera to deter any shenanigans by couriers once they\u2019re inside.\u201cWe believe in offering customers choices,\u201d said Rohit Shrivastava, general manager of Amazon Key. \u201cThis product may not be for everyone.\u201dJames McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research, said Amazon has for years been ferociously tackling every obstacle it can identify to customers buying more goods online. \u201cThis goes back to one-click ordering,\u201d he said. \u201cThe company knows that the less friction you have, the better.\u201dCustomers won\u2019t be able to get in-car deliveries if they park inside gated and underground parking garages where satellite signals often can\u2019t penetrate. The service seems aimed especially at people who leave their vehicles in the lots of large, easily accessible suburban office parks.Car owners, who are frequently discouraged from leaving valuables in their vehicles, may rightly be concerned receiving an Amazon package to their cars when they\u2019re not present could make them a target. Amazon said customers shouldn\u2019t worry \u2014 it will take care of a broken window or lock that happens as a result of a delivery to a car.\u201cIf the damage is caused by a delivery and a customer calls, we will make sure it\u2019s right,\u201d Mr. Shrivastava said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Harvey Karp Turned Baby Sleep Into Big Business", "Date": "2018-04-18", "News": "FeatureThis generation\u2019s Doctor Spock popularized the swaddle and simple techniques for soothing infants. Why is he now selling a $1,160 robotic bassinet?Supported byKarp is the author of \u201cThe Happiest Baby on the Block,\u201d the 2002 book on newborn sleeping and soothing techniques that has sold more than a million copies and remains on Amazon\u2019s 10 best-selling parenting books \u2014 a \u201ccategory killer,\u201d in the words of its publisher. An accompanying DVD, released the following year, is the most watched child-rearing DVD ever. These days, Karp, who no longer practices medicine, is hoping to capitalize on the trust he has won from parents and sell them on his new product: a $1,160 robotic bassinet called SNOO that he invented with his wife, Nina Mont\u00e9e, and for which they have raised $30 million in two rounds of funding. One Saturday afternoon last summer, Karp found himself riding an empty elevator to the 10th story of a boxy high-rise on Manhattan\u2019s East Side, on a speaking tour to promote the four-figure bed that he is convinced could prevent postpartum depression by improving babies\u2019 \u2014 and parents\u2019 \u2014 sleep.The elevator doors opened, and Karp stepped into the Motherhood Center, where women who have postpartum depression and anxiety can take their babies for support groups that cost $25 a session and for full-day therapy treatment. The floor-through space had parquet floors, plush nursing chairs and industrial-size windows. Books were stacked on a side table: \u201cDown Came the Rain,\u201d \u201c[Expletive] Feelings.\u201d The center was inspired by the \u201csleep schools\u201d that are ubiquitous in Australia, places where parents (mothers, usually) check in with their babies for several nights and learn from nurses how to help their infants sleep. But in order to adapt such a center to the sensitivities of American parents, the concept of an overnight stay had to be scrapped. \u201cWe\u2019re just not that advanced,\u201d Catherine Birndorf, a reproductive psychiatrist and co-founder of the center, said as she gave Karp a tour. \u201cPeople will do all kinds of things. They get night nurses. They\u2019ll do anything. But they will not go into a facility. It\u2019s too stigmatizing.\u201dKarp treats baby sleep like hard science. He argues that babies have an innate ability to be calmed \u2014 a reflex, as he sees it. There at birth and universal, it disappears after about four months. Just as with the knee-jerk reflex, \u201cyou have to hit the knee hard enough in the right place, or else nothing happens,\u201d he told me. \u201cPeople have accused me of saying that there\u2019s only one way to calm a crying baby. That you have to do it Karp\u2019s way, or it doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s not \u2018Karp\u2019s way.\u2019 This is physiology.\u201d He and Birndorf walked into a room used for breast-feeding mothers, with teal poufs scattered around. \u201cThe thing with pediatrics is that, for years, we used to say there\u2019s nothing you can do to get babies trained to sleep better,\u201d Karp said. \u201cThat you just have to wait three, four months and let them cry it out.\u201d\u201cAnd?\u201d Birndorf stopped and turned to him. \u201cIs that true?\u201dI found myself nodding like the recent convert I had become. Having grown up in Israel, where child rearing is learned primarily by watching extended family members, I was determined not to have to read a single book on the subject when I was pregnant. Then the baby came, and with it came Karp: Within days of my son\u2019s birth, my husband and I received two copies of \u201cThe Happiest Baby Guide to Great Sleep\u201d (Karp\u2019s 2012 follow-up), as well as a streaming link for Karp\u2019s DVD, with an imperative to watch and \u201coverlook the dopey music.\u201d So we did.Birndorf told Karp that a pediatrician had recently visited the center and suggested that babies not be put to sleep on nursing pillows or on bouncing chairs \u2014 a reversal of previous pediatric guidelines. The advice of parenting experts \u2014 many but not all of whom are doctors \u2014 kept changing, she complained. The contradictions she recounted, from conveying to women that motherhood is a natural state to instructing them on exactly how and where their babies should sleep, all while nullifying earlier recommendations, seemed to get at an inherent paradox at the heart of a profession whose stated goal is to empower parents. \u201cHighlights from 100 years of expert solicitude confirm the dirty little secret of child rearing: Though parenting gurus preach the supreme importance of consistency, their own shifting wisdom is proof of its impossibility,\u201d Ann Hulbert, the author of \u201cRaising America\u201d (2003), a sweeping history of child-rearing advice, wrote in this magazine.Karp nodded at Birndorf sympathetically. That he is one of those gurus, peddling parenting products, didn\u2019t seem to discomfit him. Whenever someone points out the hypocrisies of today\u2019s parenting industry, which happens often enough, Karp doesn\u2019t try to defend it, or himself. He commiserates, and it sounds genuine \u2014 the ambivalent doctor trying to help parents make sense of a chaotic world. That\u2019s one reason many parents find his approach so reassuring. Unlike other parenting books, Karp\u2019s doesn\u2019t feel preachy or berating. His tips can be applied just as easily by fathers as by mothers, and his pragmatic advice and suggested baby schedules don\u2019t feel like more than what they are: suggestions. But as I trailed him on his rounds, his suggestions invariably seemed to crescendo toward a pitch.\u201cWell,\u201d he told Birndorf, \u201cthis is where they would use a SNOO.\u201dBy his second year at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, Karp knew that he wanted to care for children, whom he considered more \u201coptimistic and resilient\u201d than adults. He moved to Los Angeles for a residency at Children\u2019s Hospital, meeting and marrying a woman who was studying to become a family counselor. At night, he pored over his wife\u2019s textbooks about family dynamics. He trained under Barbara Korsch, a pediatrician who was among the first to study the field of doctor-patient communication and to call for \u201creducing the power gap\u201d between physicians and parents. \u201cBeing smart is important, but you can\u2019t get through the door by being an arrogant, smart doctor, unless you want to be a surgeon or a radiologist or something like that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re dealing with patients, you\u2019re knocking at the door and you\u2019re being invited in. You have to be a good guest.\u201dIn the early 1980s, he began working at U.C.L.A. hospital\u2019s child-abuse team. He watched as babies were wheeled into the hospital in the middle of the night because their parents didn\u2019t know how to soothe them or had badly shaken them when they screamed uncontrollably. \u201cIt was perplexing to me, because I thought: We could put a man on the moon. We could cure some types of cancer. We could make long-distance phone calls around the world. But we don\u2019t know why babies cry, and we don\u2019t know how to help them sleep.\u201dThis issue of infant colic \u2014 of otherwise healthy babies who cry for more than three hours a day, at least three days a week, in the first three months of life \u2014 gnawed at him, and he immersed himself in books on evolution and anthropology. He learned about a Pygmy tribe that passes around babies between different community members all day long so that children develop multiple relationships early. He read the fieldwork of the anthropologist Melvin Konner about the infants of the !Kung San people in the Kalahari, who are carried in slings and rarely cry for more than a minute at a time. In the West, about 15 to 20 percent of babies have colic. \u201cSo either the !Kung babies were mutant babies \u2014 different from others \u2014 or those parents knew something.\u201dOne day, when he was 29, Karp felt a dull pain in his neck as he was heading back to the hospital from lunch. He asked an intern to perform an EKG on him, but the intern didn\u2019t know how to read the results. \u201cSo I\u2019m showing him, \u2018Here \u2014 oh, my God, this is cardiac ischemia.\u2019\u2009\u201d What he was reading was his own heart attack. He was kept in the hospital for a week for observation and advised to eat half a pound of salmon a day to reduce his cholesterol. The incident was mild enough that it didn\u2019t have lasting effects, but it left him with a greater sense of urgency. \u201cIt was a crystalline moment,\u201d he told me, of coming to terms with his own limitations. From then on, whenever he went for a run in Santa Monica and reached an area with outdoor stairs, he forced himself to think, as he descended, that at the very bottom \u201cis the end of my life and to prepare for that.\u201dBefore the heart attack, he had planned on going into child-development research, but now he thought the demands of academia would be too taxing. Instead, he joined a practice in Los Angeles with two other pediatricians and began to develop a local following. He threw himself into the job. Early in his career, he resolved never to do a checkup for less than half an hour. On some days, he visited six different hospitals to meet his newborn patients. As his work got more demanding, Karp and his wife grew apart and divorced.Karp was beginning to develop his concept of the \u201cmissing fourth trimester.\u201d Human babies are born about three months prematurely, the theory goes, because their heads, which grow rapidly, need to be able to fit through the birth canal. Some scientists dispute Karp\u2019s notion that human gestation is too short. \u201cSadly, the evidence doesn\u2019t support that,\u201d Daniel Lieberman, an evolutionary biologist at Harvard, told me. But Karp insists that this explains why during the first months of life, babies can be lulled back into a womblike \u201ctrance\u201d through the use of certain cues that Karp calls the 5 S\u2019s: a combination of swaddling, shushing, placing the baby on her side or stomach, swinging her and letting her suck. He noticed that for each baby the \u201csymphony of sensations\u201d was slightly different \u2014 some babies needed extra movement, others a light jiggle \u2014 though all the infants responded well to swaddling, even if they seemed resistant at first.By the early 1990s, Karp was running his own clinic, with a playground out back, and eventually he hired four pediatricians to work with him. \u201cAt the time, if you could get in to see Dr. Karp, then you\u2019ve got it made,\u201d Elaine Hall, whose son became a patient of Karp\u2019s in 1996, told me. \u201cHe had a kind of hippie vibe to him then. He was gentle and comforting, and he had a long ponytail.\u201d Karp gave her son a diagnosis of severe autism when he was 2. \u201cDr. Karp took me aside, and I\u2019ll never forget \u2014 I get teary \u2014 he said: \u2018You\u2019re going to go on a journey. It\u2019s a different path than you envisioned, but I can promise you you\u2019re going to have lots of experiences that are going to make your life richer than you even imagined.\u201dKarp became famous for what were then unconventional methods for bonding with infants. Deena Goldstone, the mother of one of Karp\u2019s first patients, remembers Karp suggesting that she swaddle her newborn at night, \u201cwhich I thought made no sense,\u201d she told me. Karp also advised Goldstone\u2019s husband to hold their baby against his bare chest, in what doctors now tout as the importance of skin-to-skin contact. As his reputation grew, Hollywood celebrities took their children to see him; he treated the kids of Madonna, Michelle Pfeiffer and Larry David.He also had a new family. He and Mont\u00e9e met at a party in Hollywood in 1991, when he was 40, divorced with no children. She was 11 years younger, with a 7-year-old daughter, Lexi, from a previous marriage. Mont\u00e9e is from Belgrade and has a highly polished complexion and the kind of thick, open-syllabled accent in English that makes \u201cbest\u201d sound like \u201cbast.\u201d (Her uncle is Milan Panic, a pharmaceutical multimillionaire and former prime minister of Yugoslavia.) Karp appeared to her so unassuming that when he told her that he took care of the hosts\u2019 son, \u201cI thought, Oh, he\u2019s their \u2018manny,\u2019\u2009\u201d Mont\u00e9e told me.Karp\u2019s agent turned down a $450,000 advance for the manuscript, and Karp grew apprehensive that they wouldn\u2019t get a better offer. That morning, Mont\u00e9e gave her husband a pep talk. \u201cAct like you have a million dollars in your backpack,\u201d she told him, a joke that is now part of the family lore. She turned out to be right: Karp ended up securing a $1.1 million advance for \u201cThe Happiest Baby on the Block,\u201d along with a sequel for toddlers. Karp describes Mont\u00e9e as the one in the household who \u201cseals the deal.\u201d At Happiest Baby Inc., she is in charge of business strategy and creative direction (\u201cAs a co-founder, Ruth, I\u2019m so excited,\u201d she told me more than once, having mastered the marketing technique of first-name repetition).A segment on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d in 2002 helped cement Karp\u2019s success, and Mont\u00e9e had the idea of bringing the book\u2019s testimonial sections to life by recording Karp\u2019s interactions with his patients on DVD. Their timing couldn\u2019t have been better. \u201cThe Happiest Baby on the Block\u201d came out just as parenting literature was undergoing a transition of its own.For years, the prevailing philosophy on child rearing had been Dr. Benjamin Spock\u2019s rallying call to parents: \u201cTrust yourself. You know more than you think you do.\u201d Spock\u2019s \u201cThe Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care,\u201d which was published in 1946 and sold more than 50 million copies worldwide, was so thoroughly embraced that some women kept copies of his paperback all over the house, including in their glove compartments. Detractors later blamed him for the permissiveness that they argued set the stage for the 1960s counterculture \u2014 for children being \u201cSpocked when they should have been spanked.\u201d In the late \u201960s, Spock\u2019s involvement in the anti-Vietnam War movement caused some of his readers to turn on him. His sales figures soon dropped by half, though he remains, to this day, the world\u2019s most famous pediatrician.As Spock lost ground, the field of expert advice became more polarized between a \u201chard\u201d camp, which stressed discipline and conformity, and a \u201csoft\u201d camp, which believed in the importance of bonding and individuality. The issue of baby sleep was particularly contentious. In 1985, Dr. Richard Ferber, who founded what is now known as the Sleep Center at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, published a sleep manual so popular that his name became a verb. To \u201cFerberize\u201d is now synonymous with letting a child cry it out (even though his book doesn\u2019t quite advocate that). Following Ferber\u2019s best seller, child-rearing literature was inundated with sleep guides, each with its own impossibly alluring title \u2014 \u201cTwelve Hours Sleep by Twelve Weeks Old,\u201d \u201cThe No-Cry Sleep Solution.\u201dThe soaring popularity of sleep guides may have been propelled by an observable, objective deterioration in baby sleep, which can be traced back to a single year, 1992, when the American Academy of Pediatrics, upon reviewing research on sudden infant death syndrome, or SIDS, came out with the recommendation that parents put babies to sleep exclusively on their backs in the first year of life. The number of SIDS cases did in fact fall \u2014 by half, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. But the change came at a price. Babies sleep significantly worse on their backs, a fact that pediatricians openly acknowledge.As baby sleep came to be seen as a national problem, the pressure intensified on parents to enforce stricter regimens. Champions of \u201chard\u201d advice became known as parent-centered. Many of these advocates were from the Christian right, including Gary Ezzo, whose \u201cOn Becoming Baby Wise,\u201d published in 1995, promoted rigid feeding schedules, \u201chighchair manners\u201d and physical punishment, or \u201cchastisement\u201d \u2014 preferably with a rubber spatula. (These recommendations have since changed.) Ezzo\u2019s and other parent-centered advice books grew in direct opposition to the \u201cideological humanists\u201d of the child-centered approach, with their insistence on feeding on demand, co-sleeping and a shunning of schedules and training methods.Karp\u2019s manual represented a welcome middle ground. \u201cI try to be an omnivore and just reflect on each issue and judge it on its own merit or lack of merit, but I\u2019m much closer to the Dr. Sears approach,\u201d he said. He emphasizes the benefits of breast-feeding but argues that experts have become \u201cdogmatic and inflexible about it to the point where we could be hurting kids and certainly hurting mothers.\u201d He includes sections in his books on weaning \u2014 from swaddling, pacifiers, rocking \u2014 even as he dismisses professionals who warn that children could become addicted to these crutches. (\u201cAre we \u2018addicted\u2019 to sleeping on a bed with a pillow?\u201d he retorts.)Karp \u201ckind of serves the purpose that Grandma would have served in the past,\u201d Alison Gopnik, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, and author of the book \u201cThe Philosophical Baby,\u201d told me. \u201cBut what science tells us is that variability is the most distinctive feature in terms of what children are like, what parents are like and what caregiving is like. So it\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019re going to find one piece of advice that\u2019s going to suit all the different varieties of children and cultures.\u201dKarp\u2019s manner is open, engaging, empathetic, inviting confession; ask him about his work, though, and the layers of humility begin to peel off. \u201cNobody else noticed this stuff in the whole world!\u201d he told me at the end of dinner one evening when we talked about the 5 S\u2019s. \u201cNo one knew about swaddling. Nobody knew about sleep.\u201d As \u201cThe Happiest Baby on the Block\u201d began to take off, Karp left his pediatric practice and with Mont\u00e9e turned the \u201cHappiest Baby\u201d into a franchise that now includes three books, two DVDs, a line of swaddles and white noises for purchase on iTunes, as well as SNOO, which rocks and plays white noise continuously and has sensors that respond to a baby\u2019s cry by changing intensities; it keeps the baby swaddled and fastened inside the crib and can be controlled from afar on a smartphone.Karp earnestly compares the $1,200 bassinet to the advent of penicillin \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m not here to promote a product, but I am saying if someone developed penicillin, wouldn\u2019t it be important to tell people about it?\u201d \u2014 and insists that it can save lives by stopping babies from rolling into an unsafe position in their sleep. Raising the money for SNOO, Karp drew on his celebrity appeal: Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel are investors, as are Scarlett Johansson, Gwyneth Paltrow and Zoe Saldana. (Or, as Mont\u00e9e put it, \u201cWe have Justin and Jessica and Gwyneth and Scarlett and Zoe.\u201d)So far, 30,000 beds have gone into production, and of those, some were given free or at a steep markdown to social \u201cinfluencers\u201d \u2014 a far cry from Karp\u2019s days of working with abused children. Hulu and Activision have begun offering discounted SNOOs as a benefit to their employees. Karp says he hopes to take SNOO beyond the gated precincts of Los Angeles and Silicon Valley: \u201cOnce we get medical studies, we can get insurance companies and employers to subsidize this. It will be like breast pumps ultimately. That\u2019s the goal.\u201dOther \u201cHappiest Baby\u201d innovations can be viewed as truly helpful or slightly ominous, depending on your level of credulity. Its engineers are aiming to update the SNOO app to serve as a dutiful personal assistant, providing parents a full report on their child in the morning, like \u201cBaby Sophie\u2019s diaper is full; she had a runny nose; the humidifier is on,\u201d Mont\u00e9e explained one morning when I visited the company\u2019s headquarters in a squat building on a main drag in Santa Monica. She saw my face. \u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the beginning I thought, Come on, really? But then I see Lexi\u2019s friends, and they turn to an app just to tell them which breast they fed from last. It\u2019s a different generation.\u201dKarp has devoted his entire career to babies, so it came as a surprise to learn that he has never raised one of his own. For two years after he and Mont\u00e9e married, they tried to conceive but couldn\u2019t. Devastated, they considered surrogacy or adoption but in the end decided against it. \u201cWe had Lexi,\u201d Karp explained. He came back to that decision in a later conversation. \u201cI kind of feel like everyone is my child,\u201d he told me, his eyes glistening. \u201cI don\u2019t feel the barriers. There\u2019s this passage in \u2018Siddhartha,\u2019 by Hermann Hesse, where Siddhartha\u2019s friend Govinda looks into his face and sees the flow of thousands of human faces like a procession. It\u2019s our joining of humanity.\u201d Does this mean that he views all the children he has treated over the years as, in some sense, his own? \u201cAnd their parents,\u201d he said keenly.Part of the appeal of Karp\u2019s methods for calming babies was that they didn\u2019t require anything fancy, not even the pre-made swaddles that are sold today \u2014 any old blanket would do. As he himself noted in his book, \u201cFor thousands of years, the most skilled parents have used the 5 S\u2019s to soothe their babies.\u201d Now he was suggesting that, actually, the best way to improve your baby\u2019s sleep required splurging on a sensory bed. Effective as his invention may be, its forbidding price reflects an old-fashioned idea: that child rearing is inherently tied to social status, that you have to spend in order to care.As the sun began to set over the ocean, the light glinting on the water like sequins, Karp and Mont\u00e9e still had a long night of work ahead. \u201cWe can stay up more than any youngsters and do \u2014 how do you say? Overnighters?\u201d Mont\u00e9e said. In the coming months, they would launch SNOO in China, and Karp would go on the Home Shopping Network to advertise it. For him, though, that was just the beginning. He mused about Gutenberg\u2019s invention of movable type and how his contemporaries had been alarmed that people wouldn\u2019t memorize anything anymore because of it. He chuckled. \u201cYou can\u2019t get in the way of progress,\u201d he said. Then, standing by the patio with his hands in his pockets, he put it differently: \u201cThe idea is that I could be in every nursery in America.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Redstones\u2019 Voting Power Leaves Moonves and CBS Few Options: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Friday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Lending in the first quarter is set to disappoint.\u2022 JPMorgan reported record revenue and profit.\u2022 Why is President Trump considering rejoining the TPP?\u2022 What the U.S.P.S. inquiry means for Amazon.Chief executives with Mr. Moonves\u2019s record don\u2019t often find themselves in this position, but he is there because of CBS and Viacom\u2019s unique corporate governance structure: namely, the super-voting powers of the Redstone family\u2019s vehicle, National Amusements.Let\u2019s recap the kind of power that National Amusements has over the corporate siblings, thanks to its dual classes of stock:\u2022 Despite owning just over 10 percent of the outstanding shares at CBS and just under 10 percent at Viacom, the Redstones have about 80 percent of the voting power at both companies.\u2022 With that kind of power, National Amusements could replace the board at either company at any point in time.It is that power that allows Shari Redstone to compel CBS and Viacom to explore a merger for the second time.CBS said in a statement Wednesday: \u201cThe industry and the marketplace know Leslie Moonves\u2019 record and we think it speaks for itself.\u201d Viacom declined to comment.Thanks to the dual-class stock structure \u2014 something CBS and Viacom share with the likes of Facebook, Alphabet and The New York Times Company \u2014 there\u2019s little that regular shareholders, or management of either company, can do.Legal experts say that National Amusements has fiduciary duties to shareholders of each company, but that the Redstones unquestionably have the power to replace board members.\u201cYou can stack the board,\u201d said John Coffee of Columbia Law School, though he added that \u201cit might be poor form to stuff the board\u201d before pushing through a merger or C.E.O. change.Charles Elson, director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware, said that companies controlled by a dual-class structure can sometimes opt for other shareholders to have a voice. But that isn\u2019t a requirement.Professor Elson said that Ms. Redstone has the ability to force through a deal or a board change. But, he added, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t mean that these things go without litigation.\u201d\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedTax cuts, bank deregulation and a recovering global economy were expected to unleash a surge of bank lending that could stoke an even stronger expansion. But lending in the first quarter is set to disappoint, at least going by the results of the four big banks that reported Friday.JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and PNC Financial had a combined $2.78 trillion of loans at the end of the first quarter, up 3 percent from $2.7 billion at the end of the same period a year ago. How does that growth rate stack up? It\u2019s more or less in line with the 2.9 percent increase in loans the banks notched up last year, but it is well below the 4.6 percent and the 4.4 percent rates that they together achieved in 2016 and 2015.Each quarter, much attention is paid to the performance of the big banks\u2019 Wall Street operations. But activities like trading are only remotely related to the real economy. As a result, to assess whether banks are assisting the wider economy, it makes more sense to look at trends in their lending, which directly finances consumer spending, home purchases and corporate investments.Investors may have been disappointed at the first-quarter lending numbers. Despite the four banks\u2019 strong profits, their stock prices on Friday slid.The unexceptional first-quarter loan growth may, of course, give way to bigger increases later this year as confidence builds. And beneath the aggregated loan totals are some numbers that suggest things could improve. Citigroup\u2019s loans grew 7.1 percent in the first quarter, compared with the year-ago period. The increase was driven by a 13 percent surge in corporate lending, much of which took place in Europe and Asia. And the first-quarter total for the four banks was held back by a 1.1 percent decline at Wells Fargo, which is operating under a strict regulatory edict.\u2014 Peter Eavis\u201cWe\u2019ve got a deal\u201d already, said Steven Ciobo, Australia\u2019s trade minister, who added, \u201cI can\u2019t see that all being thrown open to appease the United States.\u201dShares of the biggest banks are faring worse than the broader stock indexes.The KBW Bank Index, made up of 24 of the largest banks, is off nearly 1 percent while the S.&P. 500 is essentially flat in early trading.JPMorgan was down 1.1 percent, Citigroup was off 1.5 percent, and Wells Fargo fell 2.3 percent.The declines come despite JPMorgan announcing record profits and Citi reporting its highest earnings since 2015.Following widespread missteps at the bank, the Fed in February told Wells Fargo that, until sufficient improvements were made, it could not increase the amount of assets it holds. Some analysts said the cap need not stop the bank from making more loans, because it could sell securities and then use that money to do more lending. But loans did not grow in the first quarter. At the end of March, Wells Fargo had $947 billion of loans, down from $958 billion a year earlier, and also down from $957 billion at the end of 2017.But the decline is not large, and it\u2019s not clear how much the Fed\u2019s cap is to blame. Wells Fargo\u2019s loans had not been growing strongly in recent quarters.And here are Wells Fargo\u2019s numbers:\u2022 Wells Fargo\u2019s profit rose to $5.94 billion.\u2022 Earnings per share came in at $1.12 a share. Analysts had expected earnings of $1.06 a share, according to Thomson Reuters.\u2022 Revenues fell to $21.9 billion from $22.3 billion in the first-quarter 2017.\u2022 Costs rose 3% to $14.24 billion from $13.79 billion a year ago.\u2014 Peter EavisJPMorgan reported record revenue and profit for the first three months of this year.Here are the numbers:\u2022 The bank reported earnings of $8.71 billion, up 35 percent from a year ago.\u2022 That comes to $2.37 a share. Analysts had expected earnings of $2.28 a share, according to Thomson Reuters.\u2022 Revenue increased to $28.5 billion, up 10 percent.\u2022 Return on equity, a measure of profitability, hit 15 percent, up from 11 percent a year ago.\u2022 Trading revenues rose to $6.57 billion, up 13 percent from the first quarter of 2017.\u2022 Equities trading revenue rose 26 percent to $2.02 billion.\u2022 Bond-trading revenue rose 8 percent to $4.55 billion.\u2022 Earnings rose to $4.6 billion, up from $4.1 billion a year ago.\u2022 Earnings per share came in at $1.68. Analysts expected $1.61 a share, according to Thomson Reuters.\u2022 Revenue increased to $18.9 billion for the quarter, up 3% from a year earlier.\u2022 Revenue from fixed-income trading fell 7 percent to $3.4 billion.\u2022 Equity trading revenue jumped 38% to $1.1 billion.\u2022 Fees from investment banking fell 10 percent to $1.1 billion.One way to gauge the crosswinds blowing through financial markets and the global economy is by examining the results of JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo, which report their first-quarter earnings today.\u2022 Are trade tensions reducing demand for credit?\u2022 How concerned should we be with the volatility in the stock and bond markets?\u2022 Are regular Americans borrowing more, potentially boosting the U.S. economy?\u2022 How much will deregulation help the banks?\u201cI, maybe a bit na\u00efvely, believed that there was a need for someone in high elected office to be more open-minded and willing to not only govern from the middle but to try to shame everyone else into going to the middle.\u201dAlas, his company agreed to buy most of 21st Century Fox for $52.4 billion, and that was that.One intriguing possibility: Elliott pushing to be involved in a sale of some or all of the business through its private equity team, Evergreen Coast Capital.The deals flyaroundAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "James Comey Opens Up About Ego, Distrust and More", "Date": "2018-04-20", "News": "The former F.B.I. director was interviewed for \u201cThe Daily\u201d podcast. Here are five takeaways from the conversation.Supported byHere are five takeaways from the interview.It seemed like his decision to itemize his own shortcomings before recounting his role in the investigation of Hillary Clinton and Mr. Trump over the past two years might be an acknowledgment that those flaws help explain his conduct. But Mr. Comey quickly rejected the idea that his ego had played a role in how he managed the investigation into Mr. Trump. He conceded, instead, that it might have influenced how he treated the inquiry into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s private email server \u2014 in particular his unusual news conference, in July 2016, condemning how she had handled classified government emails as \u201cextremely careless.\u201d It was his own children, he said, who had told him that the news conference was flawed, because he dwelled for so long on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s misdeeds, before finally \u2014 and suspensefully \u2014 announcing he would not charge her with any crime. They called that delayed delivery of the most important information \u201cSeacresting.\u201d In their mind, he had acted like Ryan Seacrest, as host of \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d seemingly prepared to announce a singer\u2019s elimination or victory, but first taking a long, unwanted commercial break. \u201cI think that criticism is actually valid,\u201d he told me. \u201cThe reason I associate it with ego is I think I thought I knew the right way to do it and in hindsight,\u201d he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think I did.\u201d\u201cI knew I was communicating with someone who might not tell the truth about it if it ever became an issue,\u201d Mr. Comey said. From that point on, Mr. Comey decided to document his one-on-one interactions with the new president in case there was ever any question about what had transpired during such sessions. \u201cNormally I wasn\u2019t even much of a note taker,\u201d he said. \u201cBut here I thought given those factors that I would need a detailed account in the event I need to draw on it in the future.\u201d Which, of course, is exactly what happened. I asked Mr. Comey why, after his firing in May 2017, he had deliberately shared the contents of one of his memos with a reporter, in the hopes of producing news coverage that would alarm the public about Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct and therefore prompt the appointment of a special counsel. In his mind, Mr. Sessions would soon be recused from the Russia investigation, rendering him ineffectual, and Mr. Rosenstein had shown himself to be untrustworthy because of his role in firing Mr. Comey. It was Mr. Rosenstein who had written a memo to the president laying out the reasons Mr. Comey should be fired. \u201cI did not have confidence that it would be done in the right way,\u201d Mr. Comey said. \u201cMy plan was to stay,\u201d Mr. Comey told me, when I asked if he wished he were still the director of the F.B.I. He might have eventually been fired over a different clash with Mr. Trump, he said. But as attacks on the F.B.I. have mounted, including from the president, Mr. Comey said, his desire to protect the agency has grown. These days, he said, he tries to read about 20 pieces of mail a day from current and former F.B.I. agents, who write to him about their experience. \u201cI could only read them about 20 at a time before I got a pain in my chest from their sadness and my sadness of not being with them,\u201d he said. \u201cReading about their grief, which reflects my grief, is the hardest part.\u201dDuring his book tour, Mr. Comey has described Mr. Trump as morally unfit for the office of the presidency \u2014 a profoundly damning judgment from a former director of the F.B.I. I wondered whether Mr. Comey feared that his comments risked further politicizing the bureau at a time when it is the subject of intense scrutiny. \u201cI worry a little bit,\u201d he said. But his goal, he said, is to prompt a conversation that will ultimately benefit the F.B.I. and the country. I asked what, exactly, that conversation is. \u201cMost broadly,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019d like to have a conversation about what are the values at the core of this country and about our expectations that our leaders reflect those values? And encourage people to rise above their partisan passions, their policy passions and realize that without that collection of values and without leaders who are tethered to those values and held accountable by us to those values, we\u2019re lost.\u201d If you don\u2019t see an audio player on this page or to subscribe to The Daily for free, follow the instructions below.From your mobile device:From a desktop or laptop:Click the \u201cplay\u201d button above to start the show.

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Genius\u2019 Paints Picasso by the Numbers", "Date": "2018-04-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn its first season, \u201cGenius\u201d introduced Albert Einstein hard at work with his secretary, who yelled \u201cOh God, oh God\u201d as the great physicist pinned her against a blackboard. Season 2 begins Tuesday with the agonized cries of Pablo Picasso\u2019s mother as she gives birth to the great artist. The background music of male genius, apparently, is female screaming.The most salient feature of \u201cGenius,\u201d however, is its adherence to Hollywood tradition in the depiction of great artists and thinkers, which is to say that it\u2019s about everything but genius.It\u2019s often about sex, which makes Picasso, with his multifarious, overlapping wives and lovers, a perfect subject. It also continues to be about Nazis, a shared experience for the contemporaneous Picasso and Einstein (born two years apart).The story toggles back and forth in time, juxtaposing scenes of the headstrong student and the comfortable art-world star to make points about fame and complacency. Dates and locations are put onscreen to help us navigate and to signal historical scrupulousness. The sense of veracity is reinforced by the inclusion of famous biographical anecdotes, though the execution sometimes betrays the production\u2019s tinselly soul.If you don\u2019t mind its superficialities, \u201cGenius\u201d can be enjoyed for its surface attributes, including Mr. Banderas\u2019s impressive makeup and expectedly seductive performance. (If he suffers in comparison to Mr. Rush, it\u2019s because the show\u2019s conception of Einstein, focused less on seduction, was more interesting.)The semi-repertory casting means the welcome return of the arresting British actress Samantha Colley, this time as Maar. And Season 2 has the considerable visual advantage of taking place in Spain and France, with gorgeous locations in and around M\u00e1laga, Barcelona and Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "This Is the Beirut We Wish You Could See", "Date": "2018-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe film, which comes out Wednesday, is set in 1982, a critical point in the war, and was primarily shot thousands of miles away in Morocco. None of the top-billed actors are Lebanese, and the trailer is rife with menacing accents, none of which are Lebanese.Luckily, nuanced depictions of Lebanon, its people and the realities of its civil war have for years existed in movies, on television and in books.For us and our families, the war is deeply personal: Maya, born in 1980, spent her earliest years in Beirut before her family left for the United States, and Joumana\u2019s parents and family lived in Lebanon off and on throughout the conflict.Here are nine ways to help you connect with the real Beirut.Ziad Doueiri\u2019s most recent film \u2014 the first Lebanese movie to be nominated for an Oscar \u2014 centers on what at first seems to be a small dispute between an apartment\u2019s Lebanese tenant and a Palestinian foreman overseeing work near the building. The conflict turns out to be anything but minor, escalating into a trial that captivates the whole country, and leading to a nationwide reckoning with lingering wounds from the civil war.Mr. Doueiri\u2019s first film captures the early days of the civil war in 1975 through the eyes of a mischievous teen, Tarek, played by Mr. Doueiri\u2019s brother, Rami.Tarek\u2019s city is being torn in half, East Beirut for Christians and West Beirut for Muslims. But for him, war feels like freedom: freedom to walk the streets and do as he pleases.Mr. Doueiri, who began his career working as a cameraman for Quentin Tarantino, manages to evoke wide-ranging emotions in this film, from humor to hopelessness, by showing the daily trials of war endured by a typical family.How to watch: The film can be seen free on YouTube, though the quality is low.While the story touches on postwar tensions, it doesn\u2019t dwell on them. It is instead focused on the struggles that these women, who converge at a beauty salon, grapple with in society: premarital sex, aging, infidelity, repression and same-sex attraction.How to watch: \u201cCaramel\u201d is available to rent or buy on Amazon Prime.The writer and chef Anthony Bourdain loves Beirut. He loves it so much, he even considered naming his daughter after it. His passion for the city, its people and its food (the pulse of Lebanese culture) has been evident over the years in his television series \u201cNo Reservations\u201d and \u201cParts Unknown.\u201dIn his first of two Beirut visits for \u201cNo Reservations,\u201d he and his crew were filming when rockets began to drop on Beirut\u2019s airport. The Israeli airstrike accelerated what is known as the 2006 Lebanon War, a monthlong conflict that killed about 1,200 people. Mr. Bourdain and his crew, trapped in the city for more than a week, documented the experience.\u201cLike South Beach,\u201d he said in the episode, \u201cthere were people drinking vodka and Red Bull, even while Israeli jets flew overhead.\u201dThe installment earned an Emmy nomination for outstanding informational programming.A 2015 episode of his current show \u201cParts Unknown\u201d upends some Arab stereotypes. \u201cThere\u2019s no place else even remotely like it,\u201d he says in the episode. \u201cEverything great \u2014 and all the world\u2019s ills \u2014 all in one glorious, messed-up, magical, maddening, magnificent city.\u201dHow to watch: Episodes of \u201cNo Reservations\u201d are available for purchase on Amazon Prime. \u201cParts Unknown\u201d airs on CNN and streams on Netflix.Written in the early years of the conflict, this novel is told from the perspectives of three characters: a militia fighter, a civil servant and an intellectual. The title refers to Ashrafieh, a Christian enclave of Beirut, and the author Elias Khoury describes the conflict in luminous, staccato prose.Mr. Khoury, a Lebanese novelist, journalist and critic, often draws on his background in his writing: After growing up in Beirut in the 1960s, he became involved with the Palestinian cause during the war, and has remained vocal on the subject of Lebanese politics.Etel Adnan, the celebrated Lebanese writer and artist, wrote what many consider to be a defining novel of the war with \u201cSitt Marie Rose.\u201d First published in France, the book, based on a true story, details the fate of a Christian woman kidnapped and tortured for her support of Palestinians. Narrated by a rotating cast of characters, the story offers a number of perspectives on the conflict; the novel has been praised for its frank discussions of gender, power and sectarian violence.In contemporary Beirut, 72-year-old Aaliya lives alone in an apartment stuffed with books. Literature is her main window to the outside world, and was her solace during years of war: She writes of reading Italo Calvino by candlelight \u201cwhile people killed each other outside my window.\u201dThe interweaving of Lebanon\u2019s history and Aaliya\u2019s life adds up to a complex portrait of Beirut in the hands of Rabih Alameddine, a Lebanese-American writer.Rebuilding Beirut after the war ended was a long, costly and contentious affair, and parts of the city remained ravaged for years.Uncovering a trove of old photographs from around Lebanon, the journalist Zaven Kouyoumdjian spent two years tracking down the people and places from the images. Mr. Kouyoumdjian, working with the photographer Hayat Karanouh, sought to capture the same people and places; the collection shows in stark terms the devastation of war.Advertisement"}

Ms. Simon spotted the problem right away: the client was using beige dishes and mugs on a white tablecloth.\u201cIt was an easy fix,\u201d Ms. Simon said. She suggested switching either the tablecloth or the dishware to a darker color to better define the objects.Marking stairs and cabinet doors with bright-colored tape can also help accentuate edges. \u201cBold colors and textured markings and walls help people identify where they are,\u201d Mr. Magnusson said.Many people will have to tackle small home improvement projects like these if they start to lose their vision, he said.Other practical household changes include using solid colors for floors or kitchen countertops instead of patterned tiles or designs to make it easier to find things that have dropped.\u201cYou take for granted how easy it is to clean something up\u201d when you have your vision, said Gerald Hayes, who became legally blind about nine years ago due to complications from glaucoma.Mr. Hayes, 74, said he liked to keep clear paths in the living room of his one-bedroom apartment in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, to avoid tripping. \u201cI know exactly how many steps it takes from my front door to the living room chair, but I certainly don\u2019t need things in my way,\u201d he said.Paula Dertouzos, who lost sight in both eyes as a teenager from congenital glaucoma, agreed, saying she kept her apartment at Selis Manor \u201copen and airy.\u201d Ms. Dertouzos bought a smaller couch and chairs for her living room, which are pushed up against the wall and window. She also got rid of her coffee table after \u201ckilling her legs\u201d one too many times.\u201cI call it creative modification,\u201d said Ms. Dertouzos, 68. \u201cIf you want to be independent, you need a home that\u2019s functional.\u201dMs. Dertouzos said she especially liked some of the new technological upgrades that were included in the overhaul at her building. A talking thermostat has made adjusting the temperature much simpler and a new intercom system has made it easier to contact the front desk.Although she hasn\u2019t ordered any goods using the Amazon Echo she received for Christmas, Ms. Dertouzos said she used the smart speaker to check the weather, play music and participate in what has turned into one of her favorite activities, a daily quiz game.Ruthie Aybar, who lost most of her sight because of a retinal degenerative disease, lives with three of her four children in a Downtown Brooklyn apartment. She said one of the most important changes she made involved the lighting in her home.\u201cI had track lighting but they\u2019re really not good,\u201d she said. She bought new lamps and installed LED light bulbs. Some of the lamps bend, so she can point them where she needs light, and blinds or shades that adjust easily help keep out the glare, she added.She\u2019d like more sunlight, though, after living in a unit that faced an indoor courtyard for 12 years. \u201cYour light source makes a huge difference,\u201d she said.Many of these agencies have occupational therapists and staff members who teach classes and make house calls to help determine what needs to be altered and what adaptive products might be needed to help people with impaired vision remain in their homes.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work correctly all the time,\u201d she said, \u201cbut the fact that I have a tool on my phone is simply amazing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Big Forests Solve Global Problems", "Date": "2018-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsMr. Reid has pioneered the use of economic insights to conserve forests and other ecosystems globally. Mr. Lovejoy has worked in the Amazon (the largest tropical forest) since 1965.Sit on a log by the Madidi River in Bolivia at dusk and you can hear what an Amazon forest should sound like. The music includes red howler monkeys, breathy thumps from the mutum jungle fowl, droning cicadas, eerie calls locals attribute to deadly bushmaster vipers and the unhinged excitement of elusive titi monkeys. Around your feet, the beach is crisscrossed by jaguar tracks and those of the pony-size tapir, a shy beast that, if you keep quiet, will saunter out of the forest and swim across the river.Carbon has been fashioned by evolution into a staggering array of plants and animals, many of which are threatened by the current spasm of extinctions. The great intact forests host the most diverse ecosystems and robust populations of top predators, wide-ranging migrants and undiscovered species. They are evolutionary workshops still going full tilt. In places like the western Amazon, intact forests climb mountainsides, giving species altitudinal ladders to survive climate change.Third, the adage that you can\u2019t manage what you don\u2019t measure applies here. A continuous, near-real-time system of monitoring must be put in place to track where intact forests are being cut so that governments, forest communities and private organizations can react early.But for funds to flow, climate policies need to adapt. They now provide little incentive to conserve large, often remote forest areas. That\u2019s because the forests are beyond the immediate frontier of expanding agriculture and therefore not recognized by climate protection regimes as targets for campaigns to avoid deforestation. It\u2019s difficult to project the baselines of intact forest loss and degradation far into the future, and those predictions are needed to calculate the climate benefits of protecting them. But the United Nations Green Climate Fund and forested countries and donors should embrace that challenge and fill the funding gap.It takes four days and a balsa wood raft to get to that beach in the Bolivian Amazon, which is a big part of the reason its big trees are still standing. Similarly epic journeys will get you to forest gems around the world, where, if you listen, you\u2019ll understand a little more about where we came from and where we need to go from here.Thomas E. Lovejoy is a professor of environmental science and policy at George Mason University. John Reid is the founder and former president of Conservation Strategy Fund and advises Nia Tero and the Field Museum in Chicago on economic and policy dimensions of protecting natural ecosystems and indigenous territories.Advertisement"}

William\u2019s future father-in-law, played by the great Peter Mullan, has his doubts about Westworld, saying he doesn\u2019t want to underwrite some \u201cinvestment banker\u2019s voyage of self-discovery.\u201d William counters that the park offers guests the ostensible freedom to do whatever they want without fear of being judged for it, which has extraordinary value. \u201cThis is the only place in the world where you get to see people for who they really are,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you don\u2019t see the business in that, then you\u2019re not the businessman I thought you were.\u201dThe other key takeaway from the episode: Dolores has seen everything. There was reason to believe, as the season started, that the host revolt would be short-lived. Not only are the hosts hugely outnumbered, but we assume they don\u2019t know anything about the world outside the park, much less how they\u2019ll carve out a place for themselves in it. Over the multiple timelines in \u201cReunion,\u201d however, we see that Dolores has been absorbing information through multiple builds and an array of different experiences, some of them outside the park. In the opening scenes, as Bernard and (an offscreen) Ford are readying the androids for a demonstration for Delos, Dolores gets a clear view of the city. She even has some canned dialogue about how the city lights looks like \u201cthe stars have been scattered across the ground.\u201dThe pattern continues as the episode unfolds. Dolores witnesses the postcoital scene outside Logan\u2019s bedroom on the night of the demo, as Angela (Talulah Riley), the host who will later welcome William to the park, seals the deal. Dolores is frozen in her loop as William sells his father-in-law on the investment in Sweetwater, but the episode\u2019s director, Vincenzo Natali, makes certain to note her presence at the end of the conversation, unmoving but eyes open, listening. Dolores also appears in yet another timeline as the pianist at the father-in-law\u2019s retirement party, which doubles as William\u2019s \u201ccoronation\u201d as the head of the company. She listens to a drunk Logan bitterly predict the end of the species. And she turns up again behind the scenes with William, who unwittingly reveals the \u201cweapon\u201d she later intends to use against humanity.That\u2019s a lot of timelines. The William/Man in Black timelines in the first season now seem like training wheels that have been taken off. In \u201cReunion,\u201d only two story lines \u2014 one following Dolores, Teddy and company as they assemble an army and have a run-in with Maeve, the other following the Man in Black and Lorenzo as they start their search for the Door \u2014 take place in what we might call \u201cthe present,\u201d unfolding in continuity with the revolt that began at the end of last season.All other story lines, meanwhile, exist somewhere along a continuum of staggered flashbacks: We see Arnold with an early version of Dolores. We see William before and after he convinces his father-in-law to invest. We see Logan as the confident master-of-the-universe type who\u2019s wowed by the demonstration and then later at the retirement party, as the broken man who anticipates human extinction. Some of these story lines do or might already overlap, and some or all of their respective timelines may converge or disappear. But it may be wise to invest in graph paper in order to follow along at home.Paranoid Androids: \u2022 The first two episodes have been filled with callbacks in the dialogue, which could be defended as a reminder of the host\u2019s loops or derided as indulgent self-reference. But Bernard\u2019s line about getting used to the city lights (\u201cAfter a while, it doesn\u2019t look like anything at all\u201d) cleverly brings us back to Dolores\u2019s father glitching over a picture of the outside world. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like anything at all\u201d is what hosts say when they don\u2019t understand something. But we know now that Dolores was absorbing more than perhaps even she realized.\u2022 \u201cYou\u2019re too perfect to be one of us,\u201d says Logan to Angela during the host presentation. On that count he\u2019s correct, but not until much later does he realize the threat that perfection poses.\u2022 Dolores and Maeve at loggerheads is an interesting development, and speaks to the comparative narrowness of Maeve\u2019s goals. Her mission isn\u2019t revolution, but the search for a more personal form of satisfaction. For now, the two women can go their separate ways, but the truce might not last for long.\u2022 The Man in Black\u2019s Easter egg hunt is the least compelling thread so far \u2014 ditto last season\u2019s Easter egg hunt \u2014 but Giancarlo Esposito\u2019s appearance as El Lazo is a treat for fans of \u201cBreaking Bad.\u201d His monologue about circus elephants being held by a stake lingers as a statement on the human tendency to stay within our loops.\u2022 For more Peter Mullan, it\u2019s worth checking out his turn as an unemployed alcoholic in Ken Loach\u2019s superb 1998 drama \u201cMy Name Is Joe,\u201d which is currently streaming on Amazon Prime Video. Mullan specializes in working-class tempestuousness, so it\u2019s both in and out of character that he would do a rich investor\u2019s tempestuousness on \u201cWestworld.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hollywood\u2019s Ambassador, Schooled in Diplomacy and the Muppets", "Date": "2018-04-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Charles H. Rivkin began his Hollywood career in 1988, when Jim Henson hired him to plot a business future for Kermit the Frog.Depending on your perspective \u2014 and whether or not you see opportunity in upheaval \u2014 Mr. Rivkin\u2019s timing either is perfect or couldn\u2019t be worse.But Hollywood has changed immensely in the time he has been away.Attendance at theaters in the United States and Canada dropped 6 percent in 2017, to a 22-year low. Yet studios are more reliant than ever on the box office. Squeezed by the rise of subscription streaming services like Netflix, the six major studios reported an 18 percent drop in home-video rental and sales revenue, including video-on-demand purchases, in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with the 2016 period.Digital TV Research, a British media consultancy, estimated in October that piracy would cost the global movie and television business $37.4 billion in lost revenue this year, an 18 percent increase from 2017. Losses in 2022 were projected to reach $51.6 billion.Mergers could lead to budget cuts for the nonprofit Motion Picture Association. Under the current setup, the six member studios chip in more than $16 million apiece annually to fund the association\u2019s global operations, according to tax filings.\u201cI do not think we have punched our weight in terms of influence \u2014 the power that we should have, given the jobs we support,\u201d said Jeff Shell, chairman of the Universal Filmed Entertainment Group, which includes Universal Pictures, DreamWorks Animation and Focus Features. Mr. Shell added that the M.P.A.A. is \u201ca big, complicated organization and needs an executive to go in and rethink every part as a business \u2014 what should be invested in and grown, what should be scaled back.\u201dMr. Rivkin acknowledged that the organization faces challenges big and small, including questions about its identity and its structure. Netflix plans to release 80 original movies this year but is not a member. Should it be? But he spoke about solutions with a confidence that felt genuine, calling the association \u201ca dust-covered diamond that can easily shine again.\u201d\u201cReinvigorated at every level,\u201d he said of the association.At the same time, Mr. Rivkin aggressively disputed the notion that Mr. Trump and Hollywood are on opposite sides.\u201cPresident Trump probably knows this industry better than any president since Reagan,\u201d he said. \u201cI think he understands that entertainment is important both as an economic force \u2014 jobs in every single state \u2014 and as a projection of American values. It\u2019s our soft power. It\u2019s showing the world what America is capable of.\u201dHerding studio chiefs is harder than it used to be. In Mr. Valenti\u2019s era, the film factories were stand-alone entities whose interests were in lock step. Today, the studios are owned by sprawling conglomerates, which employ their own lobbyists and often have competing interests.One of Mr. Rivkin\u2019s cousins, the Democratic fund-raiser and education advocate Jamie Alter Lynton, is married to Mr. Lynton, the former Sony chief.Brian Henson, chairman of the Henson Company and Jim Henson\u2019s son, agreed \u2014 with a twist.\u201cI think that putting his ego aside actually is part of his ego,\u201d he said. \u201cCharlie wants to be the guy who makes things happen for others.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Amazon has 560,000 employees, and the company added 130,000 jobs in 2017 alone. For context, that means that Amazon added more than a Facebook\u2019s worth of employees during every quarter last year.The company also disclosed, for the first time, the number of Prime subscribers it has: more than 100 million. Those members bought five billion items in 2017, making it the company\u2019s biggest year on record.Other notable findings from Mr. Bezos\u2019 letter:\u25a0 Amazon doesn\u2019t allow PowerPoint slides during meetings. \u201cInstead, we write narratively structured six-page memos,\u201d then silently read them before meetings begin, Mr. Bezos wrote.\u25a0 Mr. Bezos spent a lot of time talking about his standards \u2014 specifically, high ones. \u201cI believe high standards are domain specific,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand that you have to learn high standards separately in every arena of interest.\u201d He continued: \u201cYou can consider yourself a person of high standards in general and still have debilitating blind spots.\u201d\u25a0 Mr. Bezos gave updates on Amazon\u2019s acquisition of Whole Foods, and said Amazon was working on ways to \u201crecognize Prime members\u201d at Whole Foods checkout counters, which sounds both exciting and extremely creepy.\u25a0 Mr. Bezos took inspiration from an unlikely source \u2014 a \u201chandstand coach\u201d who helped a friend of his learn how to do a full handstand. The coach, he wrote, warned his friend that realistically, she would need to spend six months practicing. The story taught him that \u201cto achieve high standards yourself or as part of a team, you need to form and proactively communicate realistic beliefs about how hard something is going to be.\u201dA few other tech stories of note this week:Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Trade War Will Test Corporate America\u2019s Openness: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Friday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Investors should get ready to feel \u201ca little pain.\u201d\u2022 Is the inflation scare over?\u2022 Hiring slowed in March.\u2022 The U.S.-China trade fight is getting hotter.\u2022 The Treasury Department sanctioned Russian mogul Oleg Deripaska.President Trump has supported combative trade policies for years, and in recent months, his administration has begun to pursue them. The actions have weighed on the stock prices of large international corporations, and if implemented, could hurt their bottom lines.But global companies mostly have not detailed the potential impact of Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policies. Will that now change? With first-quarter earnings imminent, and tensions with China escalating, shareholders may want companies to make specific disclosures. The companies may be tempted to say little. After all, Mr. Trump\u2019s trade restrictions have merely been threatened, and may not occur if deals are struck. But in the past, companies have refreshed their outlooks in the face of circumstantial economic and geopolitical events, like the Gulf War. And investors will likely press firms to estimate the impact of a trade war and describe the measures they will take to protect their businesses.Still, the prospect of a trade war raises questions about the adequacy of corporate disclosure. Those of G.M., contained in its latest annual report, seem quite detailed. They offer quite specific warnings about the risks of doing business in China, and the company even mentions the possibility of trade agreements falling apart. But financial reports from Boeing and Apple arguably have less on potential problems in China and trade disputes.Boeing\u2019s annual report did mention tariffs and embargoes as threats. But the report, released in February, also sounded a bullish note on the global economy that now almost sounds like it was from a different era:\u201cThe long-term outlook for the industry continues to remain positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel growth: economic growth and the increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization, and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries.\u201dWill such language remain in Boeing\u2019s reports?- Peter EavisFor years, investors had a singular focus on the Federal Reserve and its plans to raise rates.Any indication that the Fed could move more aggressively than expected to tighten monetary policies and stocks would pull back.Now the Fed has company in sending jitters through the market: Trade.A one-two punch from the White House and the Fed pushed stocks on Wall Street down Friday. The S.&P. 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average both finished off more than 2 percent.Markets began to slide at the start of trading after President Trump\u2019s threat on Thursday to heap fresh tariffs on China. Investors took little comfort in statements from the administration\u2019s top economic policymakers, Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary. Both men sought to tamp down the contentious back-and-forth between the two economic giants.Comments from Mr. Powell in the early Friday afternoon added to the unease. In a speech in Chicago, Mr. Powell highlighted the strength of the United States economic recovery and gave little indication that the Fed planned to deviate from its gradual path of lifting interest rates.On WABC Radio\u2019s \u201cBernie & Sid in the Morning\u201d show, Mr. Trump said:\u201cNow we could\u2014the easiest thing for me to do would be just to close my eyes and forget it.\u201d\u201cIf I did that, I\u2019m not doing my job. So, I\u2019m not saying there won\u2019t be a little pain but the market\u2019s gone up 40 percent, 42 percent \u2014 so we might lose a little bit of it\u2014 but we\u2019re going to have a much stronger country when we\u2019re finished. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m all about. We have to do things that other people wouldn\u2019t do.\u201dThe president also took to Twitter to defend his approach to trade policy. Mr. Trump, in a tweet, criticized both China and the World Trade Organization, saying that the Chinese \u201cget tremendous perks and advantages, especially over the U.S. Does anybody think this is fair. We were badly represented. The WTO is unfair to U.S.\u201dThat followed another early morning tweet, in which Mr. Trump boasted that the new metals tariffs he has put into effect on China and other nations had not hurt American consumers as his critics predicted.More from what a representative for China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce said:\u201cWe feel America is very arrogant. They have taken a wrong action. The result is that they will hurt themselves.\u201dThe Chinese official said that the two sides can\u2019t negotiate under the current conditions. And in an interview with Bloomberg on Friday, Larry Kudlow \u2014 who has been national economic adviser for just under a week \u2014 said he could not predict when talks would begin. He added:Earlier this year, stocks sold off after the jobs report for January showed a 2.9 percent annual increase in wages, a relatively strong rise. Investors feared that a sustained increase in earnings could prompt consumers to buy more goods and services, pushing up prices in the process. Concerns receded after February\u2019s report showed a 2.6 percent jump in wages, and March\u2019s rise of 2.7 percent is not likely to stir up more worries.The March report contained data that could do even more to quell investors\u2019 nerves over inflation. While the report revised February\u2019s gain higher to 326,000 jobs from 313,000, it sharply reduced the January figure to 176,000 from 239,000. The January revision prompted Jim Vogel, of FTN Financial, to write:\u201cThat collapsed what had been an upward slope to the last two years of payroll growth and implicitly reduced the upward pressure on wages that so many are still certain will arrive this year.\u201d\u2014 Peter EavisThe headline numbers The takeaways\u2022 \u201cThat\u2019s something I get no credit for, by the way,\u201d he says. \u201cI have been for equal opportunity in gay marriage for the last 12 or 13 years.\u201d\u2022 \u201cSee this?\u201d he says. \u201cThese are front-stabbing knives.

Deripaska has said that he does not separate himself from the Russian state. He has also acknowledged possessing a Russian diplomatic passport, and claims to have represented the Russian government in other countries. Deripaska has been investigated for money laundering, and has been accused of threatening the lives of business rivals, illegally wiretapping a government official, and taking part in extortion and racketeering. There are also allegations that Deripaska bribed a government official, ordered the murder of a businessman, and had links to a Russian organized crime group.\u2014 Michael de la Merced\u2022 A new exchange-traded fund that focuses on favorable environmental, social and governance (E.S.G.) standards and excludes firearms-related companies.

White roses bloomed along a path leading to the cottage where Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh changed into their \u201cGone With the Wind\u201d costumes. You half expected Cecil B. DeMille to come bounding out of the nearby studio administration building, a mansion modeled after Mount Vernon, to bawl out an underling.Yet a gathering here last week was not about Hollywood\u2019s past as much as its future. The official purpose was to commemorate the $12 million restoration of four studio buildings. But the visitors may as well have come to cut the ribbon on a new era in the entertainment industry \u2014 one marked by the ascent of streaming giants like Amazon Studios, the compound\u2019s new tenant.\u201cSo exciting!\u201d Ms. Salke said, shaking Mr. Cooper\u2019s hand.

You can no longer separate one from the other.\u201cThis is mixing old media and new media in a completely harmonious way,\u201d Michael Hackman, chief executive of Hackman Capital Partners, said by phone on Wednesday.\u201cI like the sense of history because it holds us to a standard,\u201d Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder and chief executive, said when a reporter asked him about the Culver Studios move at an Oscar-season cocktail party.Culver Studios may have a grand past \u2014 \u201cRaging Bull\u201d and \u201cE.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\u201d were made here, along with the pilot for the original \u201cStar Trek\u201d television series \u2014 but the complex also epitomizes the troubles the movie business has encountered over the decades.By 2004, when a struggling Sony sold the property, years of underinvestment had taken a toll. The old star bungalows were in poor repair. Soundstages were outdated. The mansion smelled like Grandma\u2019s house. \u201cIt needed a lot of work, to say the least,\u201d Mr. Hackman said.

More will follow as buildings are completed.\u201cIt\u2019s about recognizing the traditions and legacy of Hollywood, while also recognizing that we have the ability to reshape it,\u201d Mr. Cheng, chief operating officer of Amazon Studios, said of the decision to make Culver Studios the unit\u2019s headquarters.But nothing quite matches the restoration of Culver Studios, in part because Hackman Capital has paid lavish attention to detail.\u201cThey even took pains to recreate the same texture and color of the cement,\u201d said Margarita Jerabek, director of historic resources at ESA, a planning firm involved in the project. She pointed to steps leading into the bungalow once used by Gable and Leigh as a dressing room.\u201cI personally have not seen him yet,\u201d Mr. Cheng said. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure he\u2019s happy.

Mr. Salakhutdinov studied at the University of Toronto under Geoffrey Hinton, who helps oversee the Google Brain lab.Apple has taken a strong stance on protecting the privacy of people who use its devices and online services, which could put it at a disadvantage when building services using neural networks.Researchers train these systems by pooling enormous amounts of digital data, sometimes from customer services. Apple, however, has said it is developing methods that would allow it to train these algorithms without compromising privacy.\u201cWhat I object to is this assumption that we will leap to some kind of superintelligent system that will then make humans obsolete,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand why people are concerned about it but I think it\u2019s gotten way too much airtime.

{"Headline": "Sam Fuller and Fritz Lang: Audacious Auteurs of Noir", "Date": "2018-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWritten, directed and produced by Fuller, \u201cUnderworld U.S.A.\u201d initiated the luridly stylized, expertly crafted B-movies \u2014 blunt and punchy as a tabloid front page \u2014 that make up Fuller\u2019s trilogy of despair. (The other two, \u201cShock Corridor,\u201d from 1963, depicting America as a madhouse, and \u201cThe Naked Kiss,\u201d from 1964, in which seemingly wholesome small-town America proves too corrupt for a retired prostitute, are available from Criterion.)The narrative arc owes something to \u201cThe Big Heat,\u201d Fritz Lang\u2019s 1953 film noir about an ex-cop who destroys a crime syndicate while avenging his wife\u2019s death. The protagonist of Fuller\u2019s bleak world is not an F.B.I. man but a rogue safecracker, Tolly Devlin (Cliff Robertson), who is motivated by vengeance to bring down the criminals who killed his father.Opening with a tight close-up of the teenage Tolly\u2019s eyes as he prepares to roll a drunk in a back alley, \u201cUnderworld U.S.A.\u201d ends some 20 years later in the same alley. Robertson, given an early starring role, plays Tolly with an incredulous smirk. His fixed sneer is as stylized as a Kabuki mask in his love scenes with the vulnerable gang moll known as Cuddles (Dolores Dorn, bleached blond and poignantly frowzy).Neither is nearly as flavorsome or kinetic as \u201cUnderworld U.S.A.\u201d although \u201cWhile the City Sleeps,\u201d in which a juvenile delinquent serial killer stalks Manhattan, does build to a rattling finale, and \u201cBeyond a Reasonable Doubt,\u201d about a man who lands himself on death row, has a powerful kicker.\u201cWhile the City Sleeps\u201d and \u201cBeyond a Reasonable Doubt\u201d are urban crime stories with newspaper backgrounds, both starring a bored-looking Dana Andrews as a star journalist. (\u201cWhile the City Sleeps\u201d compensates with a strong supporting cast that includes Ida Lupino, George Sanders and Thomas Mitchell as exaggerated newshound types, with Vincent Price as their paper\u2019s ungainly, epicene owner.) Both movies feature familiar Lang characters, kin to the serial killer introduced in \u201cM\u201d and the trapped innocents of \u201cYou Only Live Once\u201d and \u201cScarlet Street.\u201d\u201cWhile the City Sleeps\u201d updates \u201cM\u201d to include references to the presumed malign influence of violent comic books and has a reporter use television to taunt the so-called Lipstick Killer (absurdly played by John Barrymore Jr. wearing a leather jacket and motorcycle cap \u00e0 la Marlon Brando in \u201cThe Wild One\u201d).\u201cBeyond a Reasonable Doubt\u201d pares down the \u201cwrong man\u201d premise of earlier films noir to have the Andrews character planting self-incriminating clues to an unsolved murder. Intending to expose the flaws in the criminal justice system, he winds up on death row when his carefully documented alibis go up in flames.Visually barren and somewhat enervated, the movie nevertheless has a powerful sense of implacable fate \u2014 Lang\u2019s not least. \u201cBeyond a Reasonable Doubt\u201d might have been named for his 1920 melodrama, \u201cThe Weary Death\u201d; set in Weimar Berlin it could have been a gem.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s Critics Get New Life With Trump\u2019s Attacks on the Company", "Date": "2018-04-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne of Amazon\u2019s antagonists seized the moment last month with an unusual newspaper advertisement addressed to President Trump. The ad, from a nonprofit that advocates less government, attacked a Defense Department technology contract that Amazon intends to bid on, calling it a lucrative handout for the company.A top think tank critic of Amazon\u2019s market power also credited Mr. Trump on Twitter this month for blasting the internet retailer\u2019s relationship with the United States Postal Service. And the head of a leading labor union said more Americans in both parties should speak out, as Mr. Trump has, about Amazon\u2019s harmful effect on jobs.Now \u201cwhat Trump is essentially doing is telling the political ecosystem: Here is how you achieve your business ends,\u201d said Blair Levin, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former chief of staff for the Federal Communications Commission. \u201cHe is signaling: If you want to go after Amazon, go ahead. Load up your guns.\u201dBut while Amazon\u2019s opponents now have the country\u2019s most powerful bullhorn on their side, they aren\u2019t entirely comfortable with the association.Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute, a think tank that has become a vocal critic of the power of tech companies, said he believed Amazon was worthy of action by regulators in part because of its power in the book market. But he also said he found Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to \u201cpersonalize law enforcement\u201d troubling.\u201cWhat he\u2019s doing is a threat to democracy, but so is Amazon,\u201d Mr. Stoller said. \u201cThat\u2019s the dilemma.\u201dStill, early this month, after Mr. Trump launched another Twitter tirade against Amazon\u2019s deal with the Postal Service, Mr. Stoller jumped on board on Twitter.\u201cOn the post office shipping charges Trump is correct and oddly aligned with postal employees while Bezos isn\u2019t, so I\u2019m going to stick with the postal employees,\u201d he wrote.The most direct effort to tap Mr. Trump\u2019s hostility toward Amazon was an advertisement last month about the contract to provide cloud computing services to the Defense Department \u2014 worth up to $10 billion, by some estimates. The ad, with a picture of Mr. Bezos looking chummy next to Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, appeared in the president\u2019s favorite hometown tabloid.\u201cPresident Trump: Your Defense Department is set to award a no-bid, ten-year contract for all its IT infrastructure to Administration-enemy Jeff Bezos\u2019 Amazon,\u201d read the ad in The New York Post.\u201cI had never seen that before,\u201d Katell Thielemann, an analyst who follows the government technology contracting market for the research firm Gartner, said of the attack ad.The contract came up in a dinner this month with Mr. Trump and Safra Catz, co-chief executive of Oracle, according to a person briefed on the matter, who asked not to be identified because the details are confidential. Ms. Catz told the president that the way the Defense Department had written the contract, awarding it to just one vendor, was an advantage to Amazon, the person said.So far, Mr. Trump hasn\u2019t publicly expressed concern about Amazon\u2019s bid for the contract. The White House didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.Mr. Trump recently escalated his attacks on Amazon with a presidential order to review the Postal Service\u2019s financial model, which he has denounced on Twitter as money-losing because of favorable deals worked out with Amazon. (The Postal Service denies that deals like its one with Amazon are unprofitable.)\u201cThe playing field has to be leveled,\u201d he told reporters this month, promising to take a serious look at policies that might affect Amazon.Mr. Trump\u2019s Amazon attacks have amplified criticisms that have been building for years among research groups and trade organizations that represent Amazon\u2019s rivals.The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, one of the largest private-sector unions in the country, representing 1.3 million workers in grocery stores and related industries, said Amazon\u2019s investments in automation would hurt workers. Since it bought Whole Foods last year, Amazon has become one of the union\u2019s top concerns.Asked about Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on Amazon, Marc Perrone, president of the union, said: \u201cAllowing Amazon\u2019s unchecked growth to continue will lead to the destruction of millions of American jobs. Which begs the question: Why aren\u2019t all Democrats and Republicans speaking out?\u201dA spokesman for Amazon declined to comment.Amazon\u2019s defense is that \u2014 even as it has swelled into a giant, with over $177 billion in revenue last year \u2014 its share of overall retail sales is still small, estimated to be in the mid-single digits in the United States. This, along with Amazon\u2019s emphasis on keeping prices low, has made it challenging for opponents to spark action under current antitrust law, which is primarily focused on consumer harm.It\u2019s unclear if Mr. Trump can do much to get antitrust enforcers at the Federal Trade Commission or Justice Department, which are supposed to keep politics out of competition cases, to act against Amazon. But his executive order asking for a review of the Postal Service, including its relationship with customers like Amazon, could lead to changes unfavorable to the company.Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Do You Count Endangered Species? Look to the Stars", "Date": "2018-04-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesThe conversation started over a fence dividing two backyards. On one side, an ecologist remarked that surveying animals is a pain. His neighbor, an astronomer, said he could see objects in space billions of light years away.And so began an unusual partnership to adapt tools originally developed to detect stars in the sky to monitor animals on the ground.The scientists developed a system of drones and special cameras that can record rare and endangered species on the ground, day or night. Computer-vision and machine-learning techniques that help researchers study the universe\u2019s oldest and most distant galaxies can now be used to find animals in video footage.But cameras made for daylight can miss animals or poachers moving through vegetation, and the devices don\u2019t work at night. Infrared cameras can help: Dr. Wich had been using them for decades to study orangutans.These cameras yield large amounts of footage that can\u2019t be analyzed fast enough. So what do animals and stars have in common? They both emit heat. And much like stars, every species has a recognizable thermal footprint.\u201cThey look like really bright, shining objects in the infrared footage,\u201d said Dr. Burke. So the software used to find stars and galaxies in space can be used to seek out thermal footprints and the animals that produce them.To build up a reference library of different animals in various environments, the team is working with a safari park and zoo to film and photograph animals. With these thermal images \u2014 and they\u2019ll need thousands \u2014 they\u2019ll be able to better calibrate algorithms to identify target species in ecosystems around the world.The experts started with cows and humans in England. On a sunny, summer day in 2015, the team flew their drones over a farm to see if their machine-learning algorithms could locate the animals in infrared footage.For the most part, they could.But accuracy was compromised when drones flew too high, cows huddled together, or roads and rocks heated up in the sun. In a later test, the machines occasionally mistook hot rocks for students pretending to be poachers hiding in the bush.Last September, the scientists honed their tools in the first field test in South Africa. There, they found five Riverine rabbits in a relatively small area. These shy creatures are among the world\u2019s most endangered mammals. Only a thousand have ever been spotted by people.The tests helped the scientists calculate an optimal height to fly the drones. The team also learned that animals change shape in real time (rocks don\u2019t) as drones fly over. And the researchers found that rain, humidity and other environmental, atmospheric and weather conditions can interfere with proper imaging.The scientists are refining their system to account for these issues. And in two years, Dr. Burke said, they plan to have a fully automatic prototype ready for testing. Within five years, she hopes to sell systems at cost \u2014 today, just around $15,000.In the meantime, these astro-ecologists are also working with search and rescue groups to help find people lost at sea or in fog. And starting in May, they will collaborate with conservation groups and other universities to look for orangutans and spider monkeys in the dense forests of Malaysia and Mexico, as well as for river dolphins in Brazil\u2019s murky Amazon River.An earlier version of this article misstated the animal order to which Riverine rabbits belong. They are lagomorphs, not rodents.Advertisement"}

One reliable measure of how similar two cities are is their job mix, which reflects both local advantages and history (coal, a port, great universities) and local demand (a young population that needs teachers, or an older population that needs nurses).On a 100-point scale, where zero would mean completely non-overlapping distributions of job postings and 100 would be identical ones, the similarity between Dallas and Atlanta is 85. Often, the highest-similarity pairings are nearby or even in the same state: Miami and Orlando; Los Angeles and San Diego; Columbus and Cincinnati; and New York and Boston.Midsize and smaller metros, though, tend to look more like their neighbors. Contrast San Francisco with, say, Rochester. The three places most similar to Rochester are Syracuse, Buffalo and Albany, all in upstate New York. Granted, there are more nearby cities in the dense Northeast than in the more sparsely settled West, but the general pattern still holds. For the largest metro areas, the most similar counterparts are 403 miles away, on average, compared with 176 miles for smaller ones.Some metros show up often as being similar to others. Kansas City, Mo., for instance, comes closest to being not just the Albuquerque of the Midwest, but also the Cape Coral of the Midwest, the Fresno of the Midwest, the New Haven of the Midwest, and more. Its mix of job postings looks most like the United States over all, with relatively few job titles either over-represented or under-represented.After Kansas City, the places most like the nation over all are Atlanta, Dallas, Chicago and St. Louis.In contrast, San Jose, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., are the large metro areas that look least like the United States over all. They all stand out for particular industries: tech in the Bay Area, and government in Washington. One thing that many large metros with an unusual job mix have in common is a higher cost of living. In the most expensive places, some jobs get priced out: It may not be worth it to put a back office or call center in Manhattan or San Francisco if it can as easily go somewhere cheaper.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Reviews of Times Employees\u2019 Books, the Only Guarantee Is Integrity", "Date": "2018-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut it doesn\u2019t always happen that way. Even for a Times reporter\u2019s book, a positive review is never guaranteed. In fact, as with any book, there\u2019s no guarantee it will be reviewed at all.\u201cWe\u2019re judging on the book\u2019s merits or newsworthiness,\u201d said Pamela Paul, the editor of The New York Times Book Review. \u201cNot only in our own assessment as editors and critics here, but also in what we think will be of interest and relevance to Times readers.\u201dOnce a book has been selected, the next task is finding a reviewer \u2014 and the editors of the Review take very seriously the mandate not to assign a review to anyone who has any personal affiliation with a book\u2019s author. \u201cYou can disagree with a reviewer\u2019s assessment, but you shouldn\u2019t distrust it,\u201d Ms. Paul said. \u201cSo, for that reason, conflict of interest and fact-checking are two of the most important things that we worry about here.\u201dIf a book was written by a Times employee, that means The Times\u2019s daily critics \u2014 Dwight Garner, Parul Sehgal and Jennifer Szalai, all of whom are full-time employees at the paper \u2014 cannot review it; nor can anyone from a directly competing news organization. Beyond that, Ms. Paul said, the editors apply the same standards they would to any other book. A reviewer cannot review a book by anyone with whom he or she shares an agent, publisher or editor; anyone the reviewer has blurbed, or been blurbed by; anyone, even, with whom the reviewer has shared a contentious moment on a panel or at a conference. Friends are out, as are enemies.The ubiquity of social media has complicated these assessments. \u201cIf you\u2019re following someone on Twitter or if you\u2019re \u2018Facebook friends,\u2019 I think that we have all been disabused of the notion that that actually constitutes a friendship,\u201d Ms. Paul said. Those relationships aren\u2019t necessarily seen as a conflict of interest that would preclude a review.Of course, the literary world is a small one \u2014 as are the fields represented by many of the books the Review covers. \u201cIn certain areas, everyone knows everyone,\u201d Ms. Paul said, citing politics, science and even British literature. (\u201cIt\u2019s an island nation,\u201d she added.)It can be difficult to find a reviewer who has never been in the same room as a book\u2019s author; and on a case-by-case basis, some passing familiarity can be acceptable. A handshake at a party is fine; a sexual relationship \u2014 even years ago, as at least one prospective reviewer has tried to emphasize \u2014 is not.In the case of \u201cChasing Hillary,\u201d Ms. Chozick, the author, had never met Ms. Alter, the reviewer, who is a radio host and a national correspondent at Time magazine. In choosing her, Ms. Paul sought a reviewer who could \u201cunderstand the political landscape but who would also be able to assess the book as a memoir,\u201d she said.Without exception, the reviewer must be able to answer \u201cyes\u201d to the question: \u201cIf need be, would you feel free to criticize the book?\u201dAnd criticize they do. Though it wasn\u2019t the case this time, Times employees have received plenty of negative reviews in the past. The Books desk doesn\u2019t edit opinions, nor does it kill and reassign a review if it comes back negative.\u201cThere have been instances where writers, both in the newsroom and on the opinion side, have had very negative assessments in the Book Review,\u201d Ms. Paul said. \u201cYou just hope that you don\u2019t run into that person in the elevator.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Conrath said the key difference between AT&T and tech companies is that AT&T is in a powerful position as the company that provides broadband access to the internet \u2014 a service that Netflix and Amazon don\u2019t offer.Mr. Conrath also presented a friendly email from June 2017 between Mr. Stephenson and Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, in which Mr. Zuckerberg offered to help build AT&T\u2019s ad platform.

Mr. Zuckerberg was following up on a casual meeting the executives had during an annual media industry gathering of executives in Sun Valley, Idaho, he said.The key disadvantage that AT&T and Time Warner face is their slow start in behavioral advertising and marketing, Mr. Stephenson said. Both companies do not collect or analyze the habits of television and web users in the same way that Comcast does with cable subscribers and that Google and Facebook do on their platforms.Mr. Stephenson said Netflix, Amazon, Google and Facebook are all investing in premium video content to collect increasing amounts of data on users who would spend longer times on their sites and visit more often.The AT&T chief spent much of his time talking about the history of the company.

This question may become more pressing if labor shortages start to force companies to up their pay to attract and retain employees.Amazon does not disclose its total compensation expense, so it\u2019s not possible for outsiders to accurately compute what would happen to profits if it raised pay.But the disclosure of median pay provides a little insight. Under S.E.C. rules, public companies must now disclose the median pay figure for all their employees. In annual filings, that number is then compared with the pay of the chief executive. In Amazon\u2019s case, the $1,681,840 that Jeff Bezos earned in 2017 was 59 times that of the median employee, a lower ratio than exists at other large public companies.One way to get a rough proxy for a company\u2019s overall compensation expense is to multiply its median pay number by its total number of employees. For Amazon, that would produce a purely hypothetical compensation expense of $16.1 billion (566,000 employees times $28,466.)Increasing Amazon\u2019s median pay number by 10 percent would bump the $28,466 up to $31,313, and the putative compensation expense would rise to $17.7 billion. Such an increase would have cut Amazon\u2019s $3.8 billion of pretax income in 2017 by 42 percent to $2.2 billion. A 20 percent raise would have slashed those earnings by 85 percent.How does Amazon stack up against Walmart?

That sum was 1,188 times as large as the median employee\u2019s pay of $19,177 (a number that excludes some foreign employees.)At Walmart, increasing the hypothetical compensation expense would have less of an impact on earnings. A 10 percent increase would reduce Walmart\u2019s latest annual pretax profits by 28 percent, while a 20 percent pay increase would lower profits by 56 percent.There are two ways to view such numbers. One is that retail is a cutthroat business and wages cannot rise by much if a company is going to be healthily profitable. The other is that large retailers have used their heft to lower as many of their costs as possible, including wages.\u2014 Peter Eavis\u2022 Net profit jumped 73% to $9.4 billion in the first quarter, up from $5.4 billion a year ago.\u2022 Earnings per share came in at $13.33 per share, beating analyst estimates of $9.28 per share.\u2022 The company reported a $3 billion, or about $3.40 a share, gain on equity securities in the first quarter.\u2022 Sales rose to $31.1 billion, beating the consensus estimate of $30.3 billion.Shares of Alphabet bounced around after hours. The stock rose as much as 2.2 percent but is now down slightly.Critics\u2019 cornerRobert Cryan of Breakingviews writes:\u201cThe tech group\u2019s $9.4 billion of earnings in the first quarter came with new noise after it adjusted the way it accounts for investments like ride-hailing app Uber, moved some smart-home appliances into Google and started stressing \u201cimpressions\u201d over clicks. Investors wanting concrete measurements are getting squishy ones instead.\u201dShares of Sears Holding are up about 4 percent in recent trading on Mr. Lampert\u2019s latest attempt to save the troubled retailer.In a letter to the Sears board, Mr. Lampert, whose ESL Investments hedge fund owns a controlling stake in the company, said ESL would also be willing to buy the retailer\u2019s home-services and its appliance-parts units.Mr. Lampert offered to pay Sears $500 million for the home-services and appliance-parts units, but did not mention a price for the Kenmore brand or the real estate. He noted that the company had been trying to sell the assets for nearly two years, but had failed to find other buyers.Mr. Lampert is Sears\u2019s chief executive. Any deal involving Sears and Mr. Lampert is complicated by his dual roles running both the retailer and the hedge fund, which is also a major Sears lender.Mr. Lampert said in his letter that he would recuse himself from any board discussions about his proposal. Any deal would need to be approved by a majority of Sears shareholders not affiliated with ESL, the letter said.\u2014 Michael CorkeryMargrethe Vestager, the European Union\u2019s competition commissioner, said in a statement:\u201cThe way people listen to music has changed significantly in recent years, with more and more Europeans using music streaming services. Our investigation aims to ensure that music fans will continue to enjoy attractive music streaming offers and won\u2019t face less choice as a result of this proposed merger.\u201dThe European Commission is concerned that Shazam\u2019s strong position in music recognition would enable Apple to \u201cobtain access to commercially sensitive data about customers of its competitors.\u201d\u201cAccess to such data could allow Apple to directly target its competitors\u2019 customers and encourage them to switch to Apple Music. As a result, competing music streaming services could be put at a competitive disadvantage.\u201dThe European Commission has until Sept. 4 to finish its investigation.Apple reached a deal to buy Shazam for roughly $400 million in December.Why it\u2019s important: Both Walmart and Amazon have hungrily watched India, where the e-commerce market trails only the U.S. and China in terms of size but where foreign retailers have struggled. But don\u2019t expect Amazon, Flipkart\u2019s biggest rival, to give up.What the parties said about the deal\u2022 Michael Polk, Newell\u2019s C.E.O.: \u201cThis agreement will enable the Company to now focus exclusively on the execution of our transformation plans and our efforts to strengthen our financial and operational performance.\u201d\u2022 Mr. Icahn: \u201cI am pleased that we were able to facilitate peace between the company and Starboard. Given that the company has so many more pressing priorities, this is clearly the best outcome for all shareholders.\u201d\u2022 Jeff Smith, Starboard\u2019s C.E.O.: \u201cWe are confident this newly reconstituted board will bring a refreshed sense of urgency, oversight, and accountability to Newell.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la MercedThe former N.Y.C. mayor has shown he has no problem speaking out on his personal causes, even if they\u2019re in opposition to President Trump\u2019s policies. And he\u2019s willing to put his own money to work as well.Mike Schroepfer, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, will appear on Thursday before the British government committee investigating fake news and social media following the Cambridge Analytica scandal. (No Mark Zuckerberg this time.)The issue: Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks appear rooted in personal animus, clouding what others feel are legitimate criticisms. Matt Stoller of the Open Markets Institute told the NYT, \u201cWhat he\u2019s doing is a threat to democracy, but so is Amazon.\u201dThe problem: Customers often aren\u2019t notified when money is transferred; customers are subjected to phishing attacks that drain money from their accounts; buyers have no protections if sellers don\u2019t provide paid-for goods.Why it matters: Banks want their share of digital payments, and 18 so far have signed up with Zelle.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Twitter, Facebook, Slack: Using Every Tool to Hear What Readers Think", "Date": "2018-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech We\u2019re UsingHow do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Hanna Ingber, editorial director of The Times\u2019s Reader Center, discussed the tech she\u2019s using.We use a variety of tools to listen to our readers and respond to them. We need that variety because readers are talking about our coverage on so many different platforms \u2014 our own site, Twitter, Facebook and more. Plus, there are readers contacting us directly by email and phone. We even received a letter in the mail \u2014 which I promptly Instagrammed.Twitter can be very useful for quickly knowing how readers are reacting to our coverage, but it\u2019s also very noisy. The social media dashboard Tweetdeck makes a big difference. I set up columns that help me sort through the high volume of tweets and find the ones that are most important to me. For example, I have a column that shows me every time a tweet mentioning The New York Times is getting a lot of attention.Facebook is also crucial to our work. We can use it to get feedback on our coverage and reach out to our readers, asking them about the news or their communities.We also use email, and the comments system on our site. Plus, our colleagues send us interesting or useful feedback they spot through our Reader Center Slack group.And then there\u2019s text message. My brother-in-law happens to be very good at spotting criticism of our coverage that is bubbling up on Twitter and probably will deserve our attention. On the weekends, when I am less active on Twitter, he\u2019s my early warning system.What could be better?Many of our colleagues wish they had a better sense of what our readers are saying about their coverage. There is a lot of feedback to keep up with and sort through. We\u2019d love to have a tool that would enable us to aggregate reader feedback (emails, social media posts, comments and more) in a faster and more systematic way.You\u2019ve invested time in coming up with creative ways to use social media. What are some of your favorite uses of social media sites like Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat or Instagram? Twitter is also an indispensable tool for journalists and just about anyone else to be part of a conversation about the news as it\u2019s unfolding.While journalists are on Twitter, the bulk of our readers are on Facebook. At The Times, we regularly use Facebook to reach our readers and ask them to participate in our coverage.I also prefer Facebook for its sense of community. Facebook groups tend to be closed, so people are writing posts to a segment of people. Perhaps because the posts are not for the wider public, there seems to be a lot less posturing on Facebook than on Twitter.Do you have a personal favorite Facebook group?My guilty pleasure is scrolling through the Maplewood Moms* Facebook group. (I live in a neighboring New Jersey town.) Local parents post questions that are incredibly relevant to my life, like how to get your toddler to brush his teeth. There are discussions on managing a commute and bedtimes, and horror stories of lactation rooms that don\u2019t lock.Even though I don\u2019t know all of the mothers, or even most of them, I feel a sense of shared values and experiences. We can so easily relate to one another, battling toddler meltdowns and long waits at the pediatrician\u2019s office. And this leads to an online environment that feels both intimate and supportive.What other tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life?I tried the Apple Watch and could barely figure it out. So I\u2019ll say my phone (an iPhone 7 with a maroon and purple case).My entire life exists on my phone. For nonwork purposes, I love that I have a camera and video recorder with me wherever I am \u2014 crucial for a parent of young children.I do my banking, listen to podcasts, read, and jot down funny things my 4-year-old, Isaac, says. And I wrote out these answers on my phone (in the Notes app) while getting my hair cut.Smartphones now also make for easy house stalking. I love going to a dinner party and then checking out the person\u2019s home on Zillow. My husband and I often play a game to guess how much we think the house sold for. (Life in the suburbs is underrated.)In our own home, our kids love using our Amazon Echo. Isaac asks it all sorts of important life questions (like \u201cAlexa, do you like bubbles?\u201d). He also orders up his favorite songs, then he and his little brother dance around the kitchen.I wish there were a feature on my phone that could make it quickly obvious to others what I am doing on it. I grew up watching my parents read the newspaper over breakfast. I wish that when I was reading the news, my kids could tell. Instead, they just see my head in my phone. That is the major reason I still get the Sunday paper.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Workers of Silicon Valley, It\u2019s Time to Organize", "Date": "2018-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftDear tech workers,Long year, huh?I get it. Your industry is under siege. Whether you work at an established giant like Facebook or Google, a private company like Uber or Palantir, or a lesser-known start-up, it feels like you\u2019re being attacked from a thousand directions. People are comparing your companies to Big Tobacco, and Congress is accusing your executives of undermining democracy, poisoning users\u2019 brains and censoring content.All of a sudden, Silicon Valley \u2014 once the golden child of American industry \u2014 has become a villain.Some of the backlash probably feels excessive. After all, the tech industry still creates useful things and employs lots of decent and ethical people. But I\u2019ve talked to a number of tech workers recently, and I\u2019ve seen you wrestling with your consciences. Some of you have stopped wearing your company T-shirts around town, fearing dirty looks from strangers. Others have taken extended vacations after a particularly shameful scandal, or asked for a transfer within a company. More than a few of you have had awkward conversations with your parents.Here\u2019s the thing, though. You don\u2019t have to keep your concerns bottled up.You are your employers\u2019 most valuable assets, and your bosses are desperate to keep you happy. As tech companies take on increasingly vital roles in global commerce and culture, you have the power to shape the way they operate and the ethical standards they uphold.If you want change, all you have to do is organize and speak up.In most industries, rank-and-file workers don\u2019t have much say. The power of organized labor in America has been shrinking since the 1980s, and other than a few notable teachers\u2019 strikes this year, large-scale collective action is rare these days.\u201cTech workers are the only point of leverage on these big companies,\u201d said Maciej Ceg\u0142owski, the founder of the social bookmarking service Pinboard.Mr. Ceg\u0142owski, who has started an advocacy organization called Tech Solidarity, said that the typical instruments used to rein in corporate misbehavior \u2014 customer boycotts, shareholder activism and outside regulation \u2014 aren\u2019t likely to work on the largest Silicon Valley companies.Instead, change at these companies will need to come from the inside.\u201cEven a couple hundred employees working in concert could bring a site like Google to its knees,\u201d Mr. Ceg\u0142owski said.But these are just warm-up skirmishes. For maximum impact, tech workers will need to scrutinize not just their employers\u2019 government ties, but their products, business models, and basic standards. And they\u2019ll need to do it in public.Without Ms. Fowler\u2019s brave disclosure \u2014 and her colleagues\u2019 willingness to back her up after she went public \u2014 it\u2019s entirely possible that Mr. Kalanick would still be Uber\u2019s chief executive and the company would still be run by boorish bros.Typically, when workers speak out or organize, it\u2019s because they want higher wages, better working conditions or stronger job security. Those aren\u2019t your problems. You probably work manageable hours in tastefully decorated buildings with free food, ergonomic desk furniture and plentiful amenities. Your compensation is generous. And you\u2019re in little danger of being fired or retaliated against, especially if you\u2019re part of a large group.And that\u2019s before we even get to the thorny ethical debates surrounding technologies like artificial intelligence, in which companies\u2019 goals \u2014 amass huge amounts of data to help train increasingly sophisticated machine learning models \u2014 may be at odds with what\u2019s good for society.That leaves an opening for you.\u201cIt\u2019s not clear where the pressure\u2019s going to come from otherwise,\u201d said Leslie Berlin, a Stanford historian who has studied Silicon Valley\u2019s labor culture.These groups are still small, and none has produced concrete results yet. But they are early signs that greater political consciousness is stirring in the industry.In a tech-dominated world, when the decisions made by a handful of Silicon Valley executives have the ability to reshape nations and transform billions of lives, there\u2019s no better time to stand up. Together, you can encourage your employers to behave in ethical and humane ways, and blow the whistle publicly when they fall short.Organizing yourselves to push for change isn\u2019t just a viable option \u2014 it might be the only way out of this mess.Godspeed,KevinAn earlier version of this column misstated when Tech Action began meeting in New York. It was last year, not this year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Broadcast of Mets Game Runs Into Glitches and Complaints", "Date": "2018-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the Mets and Phillies faced off at Citi Field on Wednesday, they also played the role of guinea pigs in a new Major League Baseball experiment, participating in its first digital-only national broadcast.The game was shown on Facebook, which partnered with M.L.B. to exclusively produce and broadcast 25 games this season as part of baseball\u2019s efforts to appeal to a younger audience and tap into fans\u2019 online discussions.The Mets-Phillies game was the first of the 25 games set to be aired on Facebook \u2014 one per week \u2014 and the early feedback was largely negative. Fans quickly voiced their displeasure with the newfangled broadcast and its glitches, and not just because they couldn\u2019t watch their teams as they normally would: the Mets on SportsNet New York and the Phillies on Comcast SportsNet Philadelphia.Several viewers complained that the onscreen scoreboard and statistics banner blocked too much of the screen, as did the comments bar on the side. And in the fifth inning, as the broadcast showed a montage of the Mets\u2019 oft-injured captain David Wright, the feed froze.Much like any new way of viewing sports, this debut broadcast appealed to some fans and estranged others.\u201cI\u2019m standing in my kitchen watching on my cellphone because it wasn\u2019t working well on my TV,\u201d Mike Schulman, a high school teacher on Long Island, said by telephone during the ninth inning of the Mets\u2019 4-2 victory. \u201cIt worked but it was lagging. The image got really pixelated at points. It worked fine on my cellphone and laptop.\u201dSome lag time could be attributed to the speed of viewers\u2019 internet connections or cellphone data, but the glitch in the fifth inning on Facebook Watch, as the platform\u2019s video service is called, was a widespread technical problem. It was quickly fixed.\u201cWe\u2019re still in the early days of having live sports on Facebook Watch and are learning with every broadcast we have on the platform,\u201d a Facebook spokesman said in a statement. \u201cFortunately, we have a great partner in Major League Baseball innovating on our platform and listening to feedback from fans to adjust the broadcast in real time.\u201dM.L.B. added in a statement, \u201cToday marked a historic and important step as we experiment with new platforms for fans to watch games. Our fans provided great feedback throughout their experiences today, which will continue to help us as we present these social-first broadcasts on Facebook each week.\u201dThe viewing experience for the Mets-Phillies game was certainly different. Instead of the traditional commercial breaks in between half-innings, there were short segments about players and teams, and interviews with Mets pitcher Matt Harvey and the comedian Jim Breuer, a Mets fan. At times during game action, a viewer\u2019s comment would be highlighted on a banner across the top of the screen.\u201cI know they\u2019re trying to bring in a new audience, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the best way to bring them in,\u201d Schulman said.After receiving many complaints, producers of the stream told viewers how to hide the comments bar via the comment section, as well as on the broadcast itself. They also reduced the size of the onscreen graphics, which were originally designed for cellphone screens.Of the big four professionals sports leagues in the United States, M.L.B. has the audience that skews the oldest. A study by Magna Global, a marketing research company, found that the average age of television viewers of M.L.B. in 2016 was 57.Schulman considers himself to be part of the target audience for M.L.B.; he is 30 years old and a die-hard fan of the Mets. His television wasn\u2019t compatible with the Facebook app, but he figured out how to use a different streaming device.Although he and his 60-year-old father are Facebook users, Schulman said his father struggled to load the game, so he had to walk him through directions on the phone during the game. \u201cFor me it was fine, but for an older man or woman who is not as tech savvy, might be more difficult,\u201d Schulman said.Nearly 69,000 comments streamed across the bar on the side of the viewing screen. They ranged from harsh criticism to compliments for the teams and players, as well as complaints about the broadcast and even about privacy concerns facing Facebook. Viewers said they were watching from as far away as Sweden.\u201cWatching on the train in Queens NY. Loving this!\u201d wrote one viewer.\u201cWhy did syndergaard leave early?\u201d asked another.\u201cWorst viewing experience ever,\u201d a different viewer said.M.L.B. first aired a handful of games on Facebook last year, using the local broadcast\u2019s feed on the social media platform. Last month, M.L.B. announced that 25 games this season would be produced by MLB Network and its broadcasters solely for Facebook Watch, joining a wave of new broadcasting efforts in live sports by companies like Twitter and Amazon. Facebook reportedly paid over $30 million for the games.The deal means that fans who usually tune in to their local regional cable network or have purchased M.L.B.\u2019s smartphone At Bat app or MLB.TV service cannot watch the 25 Facebook-broadcast games there.The attendance and ratings are usually lighter for a midweek day game early in the season, and the hour and forty-five minute rain delay on Wednesday most likely didn\u2019t help. The Mets announced a paid crowd of 21,328 people. At one point, over 80,000 viewers watched the Facebook broadcast.Next week, the St. Louis Cardinals and Milwaukee Brewers will get their turn on Facebook.Advertisement"}

He has given revealing interviews on every major news network, drawing angry tweets from President Trump, which in turn prompted more news coverage of the book. That cycle will likely drag on as Mr. Comey continues his book promotion tour this week with an appearance at a CNN Town Hall and an interview on Fox News Channel.In a sign of how fraught and politicized the conversation surrounding the book has become, Amazon limited reviews of \u201cA Higher Loyalty\u201d to Amazon customers who have purchased the book through the site, presumably to prevent trolls and cheerleaders who haven\u2019t read the book from skewing the ratings. Normally, anyone can leave a review of a book without having to purchase it through Amazon. The filter suggests that Amazon noticed that people were flooding the site with political opinions rather than straight book reviews.\u201cThis product currently has limitations on submitting reviews,\u201d a message on the site says. \u201cThis may be because we detected unusual review behavior on this product.\u201dAmazon said that its action in limiting reviews for Mr. Comey\u2019s book wasn\u2019t that unusual, and noted that reviews aren\u2019t suppressed simply for being nasty. \u201cWe never reject reviews based on star rating or sentiment,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWhen numerous reviews post in a short amount of time that are unrelated to the product, we suppress all non-Amazon Verified Purchase (AVP) reviews.\u201dStill, the bulk of the reviews on Amazon are overwhelmingly positive. Of the more than 800 reviews posted as of Tuesday morning, 90 percent were five stars. Perhaps Mr. Comey\u2019s staunchest detractors don\u2019t want to buy and read the book after all.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Bans Online Bible Sales as It Tightens Religious Controls", "Date": "2018-04-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 The Chinese government has banned online retailers from selling the Bible, moving in the wake of new rules to control the country\u2019s burgeoning religious scene.The retailers did not respond to requests for comment, although Thursday is the start of a long holiday weekend in China.The move aligns with a longstanding effort to limit the influence of Christianity in China. Among China\u2019s major religions \u2014 which include Buddhism, Taoism, Islam and folk beliefs \u2014 Christianity is the only one whose major holy text cannot be sold through normal commercial channels. The Bible is printed in China but legally available only at church bookstores.\u201cIt sounds like the opposition force within the Chinese authorities who oppose the Vatican-China relations have their voice,\u201d said Yang Fenggang, head of the Center on Religion and Chinese Society at Purdue University. \u201cIt clearly shows that they worry or are concerned about Catholics as well as Protestants.\u201dBoth Christianity and Islam, however, have come under heavy government pressure.The report shows that most religions in China have been quickly increasing their reach. The number of Buddhist or Taoist believers was not counted because those faiths lack membership rolls, but their growth can be seen in the increasing number of temples \u2014 to 33,500 and 9,000 today from 13,000 and 1,500 in 1997.Christianity presented a more bifurcated picture. Catholicism grew during the same period to six million worshipers from four million, while Protestantism increased to 38 million adherents, from 10 million. Most surveys and experts, however, believe that these figures represent only about half the total number of believers, because each has a strong underground church that roughly matches the number of believers in government-run churches.In China, Islam is defined as being practiced by most members of 10 non-Chinese ethnic groups, especially the Hui and Uighurs. Their populations totaled 20 million in 2018 versus 18 million in 1997, according to the report.Both Christianity and Islam were singled out for contributing to problems in China. According to the report, government-appointed Muslim figures condemned violence, especially in the heavily Muslim region of Xinjiang, which is the site of longstanding unrest against control by Beijing.Christianity was linked to historic troubles, especially China\u2019s decline in the 19th century \u2014 the \u201ccentury of humiliation\u201d that Mr. Xi has vowed to reverse.

{"Headline": "They Tried to Boycott Facebook, Apple and Google. They Failed.", "Date": "2018-04-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHow did Mr. Knight post the message? He used an iPhone.As the reach and influence of Silicon Valley\u2019s tech giants have increased, so have the calls to boycott their products and services. The problem is that pulling off a boycott is not exactly easy: The tech companies\u2019 products are so pervasive that they are difficult to avoid.\u201cIt\u2019s exactly the same company. I realize it\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d said Sachi Cunningham, a documentary filmmaker in San Francisco who deactivated her Facebook last week and shifted her attention to Instagram, where, she said, the conversation is less toxic.Ms. Cunningham, who has freelanced for The New York Times, added that she had immediately begun missing Facebook as a research tool for her documentaries. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can get out of the ecosystem,\u201d she said.People looking to punish major tech companies by abstaining from their products have been bedeviled time and again by the difficulty in escaping them. After Google fired an engineer, James Damore, for criticizing the company\u2019s diversity efforts last year, hundreds of people on social media called for a boycott of the company. But an analysis of nearly 7,000 tweets using the hashtag #BoycottGoogle since August showed that 26 percent of the tweets came from devices using Google\u2019s Android software, according to Keyhole, a social-media research firm.One Twitter account named Milton Prescott tweeted on Aug. 8: \u201cGoogle\u2019s firing of James Damore proves his point completely. I will no longer be using Google for any services. #BoycottGoogle.\u201d The tweet came from an Android device. A message to the account went unreturned.Marisa Richardson, a program manager at a life-sciences company, said she began boycotting Amazon recently after learning that it offered the NRA channel on its streaming-video service. So when she needed laundry detergent, she avoided the e-commerce site and instead braved the crowds and traffic \u2014 and spent a few dollars more \u2014 at a nearby Target.But a few days later she shopped at the Whole Foods near her home in Oakland, Calif. \u201cI completely forgot that they\u2019re owned by Amazon,\u201d she said.After the shooting in Parkland in February, gun-control activists called for a boycott of certain Apple and Amazon services because they hosted the NRA channel.\u201cHad I sent the same tweets from an Android phone, the same issue would apply. There is an NRATV app for Android phones,\u201d Ms. Milano said through a spokeswoman. \u201cWe are only just beginning to understand how these companies have infiltrated not only our ideologies, but also our lives in the most in-depth way imaginable.\u201dNearly a third of the 4,700 tweets using the #BoycottApple hashtag since August came from iPhones, according to Keyhole.\u201cI do have an iPhone, but as a customer of Apple\u2019s, am I not allowed to hold them accountable?\u201d Mr. Knight, the activist who used an iPhone to call for an Apple boycott, said in an interview.Many of those who recently abandoned their Facebook accounts are still in the company\u2019s orbit, not only with Instagram but also with the company\u2019s popular messaging apps WhatsApp and Messenger.When Cher recently deleted her Facebook page, she said on Twitter, \u201c2day I did something VERY HARD 4 me.\u201d But her Instagram account, with 768,000 followers, was still active.Stephen Cox, 39, a woodworker in Los Angeles, recently posted on Facebook that he was deactivating his account in favor of Instagram. When someone commented that the two sites were owned by the same company, he replied, \u201cIt\u2019s a double-edged sword, but for me one edge is slightly more blunt than the other.\u201dRayven Bruzzese, 26, a sign-language student in Philadelphia, said she had been a frequent user of Facebook for years but deleted her account in March because she found it upsetting and a drain on her time. Now she spends her time on Instagram.While she acknowledged the irony of moving to another Facebook-owned service, she said her options were limited. Few of her friends are on Twitter, and many have stopped using Snapchat.\u201cWhere am I supposed to go?\u201d she said. \u201cI wish there was something else.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Disappearing Doctor: How Mega-Mergers Are Changing the Business of Medical Care", "Date": "2018-04-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIs the doctor in?In this new medical age of urgent care centers and retail clinics, that\u2019s not a simple question. Nor does it have a simple answer, as primary care doctors become increasingly scarce.\u201cYou call the doctor\u2019s office to book an appointment,\u201d said Matt Feit, a 45-year-old screenwriter in Los Angeles who visited an urgent care center eight times last year. \u201cThey\u2019re only open Monday through Friday from these hours to those hours, and, generally, they\u2019re not the hours I\u2019m free or I have to take time off from my job.\u201cI can go just about anytime to urgent care,\u201d he continued, \u201cand my co-pay is exactly the same as if I went to my primary doctor.\u201dPeople are flocking to retail clinics and urgent care centers in strip malls or shopping centers, where simple health needs can usually be tended to by health professionals like nurse practitioners or physician assistants much more cheaply than in a doctor\u2019s office. Some 12,000 are already scattered across the country, according to Merchant Medicine, a consulting firm.There\u2019s little doubt that the front line of medicine \u2014 the traditional family or primary care doctor \u2014 has been under siege for years. Long hours and low pay have transformed pediatric or family practices into unattractive options for many aspiring physicians.And the relationship between patients and doctors has radically changed. Apart from true emergency situations, patients\u2019 expectations now reflect the larger 24/7 insta-culture of wanting everything now. When Dr. Carl Olden began watching patients turn to urgent care centers opening around him in Yakima, Wash., he and his partners decided to fight back.They set up similar clinics three years ago, including one right across the street from their main office in a shopping center.The practice not only was able to retain its patients, but then could access electronic health records for those off-site visits, avoiding a bad drug interaction or other problems, said Dr. Olden, who has been a doctor for 34 years.\u201cAnd we\u2019ve had some folks come into the clinics who don\u2019t have their own primary care physicians,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been able to move them into our practice.\u201dThe new deals involving major corporations loom over doctors\u2019 livelihoods, intensifying pressure on small practices and pushing them closer to extinction.The latest involves Walmart and Humana, a large insurer with a sizable business offering private Medicare plans. While their talks are in the early stages, one potential partnership being discussed would center on using the retailer\u2019s stores and expanding its existing 19 clinics for one-stop medical care. Walmart stores already offer pharmacy services and attract older people.While both CVS and UnitedHealth have large pharmacy benefits businesses that would reap considerable rewards from the stream of prescriptions generated by the doctors at these facilities, the companies are also intent on managing what type of care patients get and where they go for it. And the wealth of data mined from consolidation would provide the companies with a map for steering people one way or another.On top of these corporate partnerships, Amazon, JP Morgan and Berkshire Hathaway decided to join forces to develop some sort of health care strategy for their employees, expressing frustration with the current state of medical care. Their announcement, and Amazon\u2019s recent forays into these fields, are rattling everyone from major hospital networks to pharmacists.Doctors, too, are watching the evolution warily.\u201cWith all of these deals, there is so much we don\u2019t know,\u201d said Dr. Michael Munger, president of the American Academy of Family Physicians. \u201cAre Aetna patients going to be mandated to go to a CVS MinuteClinic?\u201dDr. Susan Kressly, a pediatrician in Warrington, Pa., has watched patients leave. Parents who once brought their children to her to treat an ear infection or check for strep, services whose profits helped offset some of the treatments she offered, are now visiting the retail clinics or urgent care centers.What is worse, some patients haven\u2019t been getting the right care. \u201cSome of the patients with coughs were being treated with codeine-based medicines, which is not appropriate at all for this age group,\u201d Dr. Kressly said.Even doctors unfazed by patients going elsewhere at night or on weekends are nervous about the entry of the corporate behemoths.\u201cI can\u2019t advertise on NBC,\u201d said Dr. Shawn Purifoy, who practices family medicine in Malvern, Ark. \u201cCVS can.\u201dNurse practitioners allow Dr. Purifoy to offer more same-day appointments; he and two other practices in town take turns covering emergency phone calls at night.And doctors keep facing new waves of competition. In California, Apple recently decided to open up its own clinics to treat employees. Other companies are offering their workers the option of seeking medical care via their cellphones. Investors are also pouring money into businesses aiming to create new ways of providing primary care by relying more heavily on technology.Dr. Mark J. Werner, a consultant for the Chartis Group, which advises medical practices, emphasized that convenience of care didn\u2019t equal quality or, for that matter, less expensive care.\u201cNone of the research has shown any of these approaches to delivering care has meaningfully addressed cost,\u201d Dr. Werner said.Critics of retail clinics argue that patients are given short shrift by health professionals unfamiliar with their history, and may be given unnecessary prescriptions. But researchers say neither has been proved in studies.\u201cThe quality of care that you see at a retail clinic is equal or superior to what we see in a doctor\u2019s office or emergency department,\u201d said Dr. Ateev Mehrotra, an associate professor of health care policy and medicine at Harvard Medical School, who has researched the retail clinics. \u201cAnd while there is a worry that they will prescribe antibiotics to everybody, we see equal rates occurring between the clinics and doctor\u2019s offices.\u201dStill, while the retail clinics over all charge less, particularly compared with emergency rooms, they may increase overall health care spending. Consumers who not long ago would have taken a cough drop or gargled with saltwater to soothe a sore throat now pop into their nearby retail clinic for a strep test.Frustration with the nation\u2019s health care system has fueled a lot of the recent partnerships. Giant companies are already signaling a desire to tackle complex care for people with a chronic health condition like diabetes or asthma.\u201cWe\u2019re evolving the retail clinic concept,\u201d said Dr. Troyen A. Brennan, the chief medical officer for CVS. The company hopes its proposed merger with Aetna will allow it to transform its current clinics, where a nurse practitioner might offer a flu shot, into a place where patients can have their conditions monitored. \u201cIt requires new and different work by the nurse practitioners,\u201d he said.Dr. Brennan said CVS was not looking to replace patients\u2019 primary care doctors. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to buy up an entire layer of primary care,\u201d he said.But people will have the option of using the retail clinic to make sure their hypertension or diabetes is well controlled, with tests and counseling provided as well as medications. The goal is to reduce the cost of care for what would otherwise be very expensive conditions, Dr. Brennan said.If the company\u2019s merger with Aetna goes through, CVS will initially expand in locations where Aetna has a significant number of customers who could readily go to CVS, Dr. Brennan said.UnitedHealth has also been aggressively making inroads, adding a large medical practice in December and roughly doubling the number of areas where its OptumCare doctors will be to 75 markets in the United States. It is also experimenting with putting its MedExpress urgent care clinics into Walgreens stores.Big hospital groups are also eroding primary care practices: They employed 43 percent of the nation\u2019s primary care doctors in 2016, up from 23 percent in 2010. They are also aggressively opening up their own urgent care centers, in part to try to ensure a steady flow of patients to their facilities.HCA Healthcare, the for-profit hospital chain, doubled its number of urgent care centers last year to about 100, according to Merchant Medicine. GoHealth Urgent Care has teamed up with major health systems like Northwell Health in New York and Dignity Health in San Francisco, to open up about 80 centers.\u201cThere is huge consolidation in the market right now,\u201d said Dr. Jeffrey Le Benger, the chief executive of Summit Medical Group, a large independent physician group in New Jersey. \u201cEveryone is fighting for the primary care patient.\u201d He, too, has opened up urgent care centers, which he describes as a \u201closs leader,\u201d unprofitable but critical to managing patients.Eva Palmer, 22, of Washington, D.C., sought out One Medical, a venture-backed practice that is one of the nation\u2019s largest independent groups, when she couldn\u2019t get in to see a primary care doctor, even when she became ill. After paying the annual fee of about $200, she was able to make an appointment to get treatment for strep throat and pneumonia.\u201cIn 15 minutes, I was able to get the prescriptions I needed \u2014 it was awesome,\u201d Ms. Palmer said.Patients also have the option of getting a virtual consultation at any time.By using sophisticated computer systems, One Medical, which employs 400 doctors and health staff members in eight major cities, allows its physicians to spend a half-hour with every patient.Dr. Navya Mysore joined One Medical after working for a large New York health system, where \u201cthere was a lot of bureaucracy,\u201d she said. She now has more freedom to practice medicine the way she wants and focus more on preventive health, she said.By being so readily available, One Medical can reduce visits to an emergency room or an urgent care center, said Dr. Jeff Dobro, the company\u2019s chief medical officer.As primary care doctors become an \u201cincreasingly endangered species, it is very hard to practice like this,\u201d he said.But more traditional doctors like Dr. Purifoy stress the importance of continuity of care. \u201cIt takes a long time to gain the trust of the patient,\u201d he said. He is working with Aledade, another company focused on reinventing primary care, to make his practice more competitive.One longtime patient, Billy Ray Smith, 70, learned that he needed cardiac bypass surgery even though he had no symptoms. He credits Dr. Purifoy with urging him to get a stress test.\u201cIf he hadn\u2019t insisted,\u201d Mr. Smith said, \u201cit would have been all over for me.\u201d Dr. Purifoy\u2019s nurse routinely checks on him, and if he needs an appointment, he can usually see the doctor that day or the next.\u201cI trust him 100 percent on what he says and what he does,\u201d Mr. Smith said.Those relationships take time and follow-up. \u201cIt\u2019s not something I can do in a minute,\u201d Dr. Purifoy said. \u201cYou\u2019re never going to get that at a MedExpress.\u201dAdvertisement"}

As Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt, professors at Harvard, wrote in their recent book \u201cHow Democracies Die,\u201d President Vladimir Putin of Russia turned the tax authorities on Vladimir Gusinsky, owner of an independent television network, NTV, which was considered bothersome. Gusinsky eventually signed NTV over to a government-controlled company. Under Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, Venezuelan authorities accused Guillermo Zuloaga, owner of Globovisi\u00f3n, a TV station frequently critical of the government, of illegal profiteering. In 2013, Zuloaga sold Globovisi\u00f3n to allies of Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s successor, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.Now Donald Trump is going after Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon and owner of The Washington Post.Like the F.B.I., another regular Trump target, Amazon is hardly blameless.

Many independent retailers feel bullied by the company, she tells me, but have no choice but to use its platform because it\u2019s so dominant.Sinclair\u2019s regime-friendly propaganda, which seems meant to erode trust in competing sources of information, is also familiar from other nations that have slid into authoritarianism.\u201cWhen you look at many of these countries, it\u2019s been a two-pronged attack on the media,\u201d Daron Acemoglu, a Turkish-born M.I.T. economist and a co-author of \u201cWhy Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity and Poverty,\u201d told me. \u201cEven before the attacks against the Dogan group started in Turkey, or even before the attacks against a few remaining independent TV stations and newspapers had started under Putin, you had these troll-like media outlets that were flooding the market with what we are now calling fake news.\u201dBy the time those regimes moved against unsympathetic media companies, much of the population had been disoriented by disinformation.

{"Headline": "Retailers Race Against Amazon to Automate Stores", "Date": "2018-04-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySoon, though, more technology-driven businesses like Amazon Go may be coming to them.A global race to automate stores is underway among several of the world\u2019s top retailers and small tech start-ups, which are motivated to shave labor costs and minimize shoppers\u2019 frustrations, like waiting for cashiers. They are also trying to prevent Amazon from dominating the physical retail world as it does online shopping.Companies are testing robots that help keep shelves stocked, as well as apps that let shoppers ring up items with a smartphone. High-tech systems like the one used by Amazon Go completely automate the checkout process. China, which has its own ambitious e-commerce companies, is emerging as an especially fertile place for these retail experiments.In addition, the efforts have raised concerns among privacy researchers because of the mounds of data that retailers will be able to gather about shopper behavior as they digitize their locations. Inside Amazon Go, for instance, the cameras never lose sight of a customer once he or she enters the shop.Retailers had adopted technologies in their stores long before Amazon Go arrived on the scene. Self-checkout kiosks have been common in supermarkets and other stores for years. Kroger, the grocery chain, uses sensors and predictive analytics tools to better anticipate when more cashiers will be needed.But the opening of Amazon Go in January was alarming for many retailers, who saw a sudden willingness by Amazon to wield its technology power in new ways. Hundreds of cameras near the ceiling and sensors in the shelves help automatically tally the cookies, chips and soda that shoppers remove and put into their bags. Shoppers\u2019 accounts are charged as they walk out the doors.\u201cUnanimously, there was an element of embarrassment because here is an online retailer showing us how to do brick and mortar, and frankly doing it amazingly well,\u201d said Martin Hitch, the chief business officer of Bossa Nova Robotics, a company that makes inventory management robots that Walmart and others are testing.Nowhere are retailers experimenting more avidly with automating store shopping than in China, a country obsessed by new tech fads.One effort is a chain of more than 100 unmanned convenience shops from a start-up called Bingo Box, one of which sits in a business park in Shanghai. Shoppers scan a code on their phones to enter and, once inside, scan the items they want to buy. The store unlocks the exit door after they\u2019ve paid through their phones.Alibaba, one of China\u2019s largest internet companies, has opened 35 of its Hema automated grocery stores, which blend online ordering with automated checkout. Customers scan their groceries at checkout kiosks, using facial recognition to pay electronically, while bags of groceries ordered by customers online float overhead on aerial conveyors, headed to a loading dock for delivery to shoppers.Not to be outdone, JD, another big internet retailer in China, said in December that it had teamed up with a developer to build hundreds of its own unmanned convenience shops. The businesses put readable chips on items to automate the checkout process.At its huge campus south of Beijing, JD is testing a new store that relies on computer vision and sensors on the shelves to know when items have been taken. The system tracks shopping without tagging products with chips. Payment, which for now still happens at a kiosk, is done with facial recognition.JD and Alibaba both plan to sell their systems to other retailers and are working on additional checkout technologies.Back in the United States, Walmart, the world\u2019s largest retailer, is testing out the Bossa Nova robots in dozens of its locations to reduce some tedious tasks that can eat up a worker\u2019s time. The robots, which look like giant wheeled luggage bags, roll up and down the aisles looking for shelves where cereal boxes are out of stock and items like toys are mislabeled. The machines then report back to workers, who restock the shelves and apply new labels.At 120 of Walmart\u2019s 4,700 American stores, shoppers can also scan items, including fruits and vegetables, using the camera on their smartphones and pay for them using the devices. When customers walk out, an employee checks their receipts and does a \u201cspot check\u201d of the items they bought.Kroger, one of the country\u2019s largest grocery chains, has also been testing a mobile scanning service in its supermarkets, recently announcing that it would expand it to 400 of its more 2,700 stores.New start-ups are seeking to give retailers the technology to compete with Amazon\u2019s system. One of them, AiFi, is working on cashierless checkout technology that it says will be flexible and affordable enough that mom-and-pop retailers and bigger outlets can use it. In the United States, venture capitalists put $100 million into retail automation start-ups in each of the past two years, up from about $64 million in 2015, according Pitchbook, a financial data firm.\u201cThere\u2019s a gold rush feeling about this,\u201d said Alan O\u2019Herlihy, chief executive of Everseen, an Irish company working with retailers on automated checkout technology that uses artificial intelligence.While such technologies could improve the shopping experience, there may also be consequences that people find less desirable. Retailers like Amazon could compile reams of data about where customers spend time inside their doors, comparable to what internet companies already know about their online habits.\u201cIt\u2019s combined with everything else Amazon might know about you,\u201d said Gennie Gebhart, a researcher at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an online civil liberties organization. \u201cAmazon knows what I buy online, what I watch and now how I move around a space.\u201dDepending on how heavily retailers automate in the years to come, job losses could be severe in a sector that has already experienced wave after wave of store closings by the likes of Macy\u2019s, Toys \u201cR\u201d Us and Sears.\u201cWe see this as helping our associates,\u201d said John Crecelius, vice president of central operations at Walmart. \u201cWe are a people-led business that is technology enabled.\u201dSome traditional retailers are also skeptical about whether the sort of automation in Amazon Go can move to large stores. They say the technology may not work or be cost effective outside a store with a small footprint and inventory.\u201cThat\u2019s probably not scalable to a 120,000-square-foot store,\u201d said Chris Hjelm, executive vice president and chief information officer at Kroger.But he said it was just a matter of time before more cameras and sensors were commonplace in stores. \u201cIt\u2019s a few years out,\u201d he said, \u201cbefore that technology becomes mainstream.\u201dNick Wingfield reported from Seattle, Paul Mozur from Shanghai, and Michael Corkery from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: In Shaw\u2019s \u2018Saint Joan,\u2019 a Sane and Sensible Martyr", "Date": "2018-06-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWho is Joan?It\u2019s harder to answer that question than to itemize who she isn\u2019t.Nor is she the sorceress and strumpet Shakespeare depicts in \u201cHenry VI, Part 1\u201d or the romantic lass in petticoats Mark Twain imagines in his final novel, \u201cPersonal Recollections of Joan of Arc.\u201dShaw structures \u201cSaint Joan\u201d as a picaresque chronicle: six scenes and an epilogue that mark turning points in Joan\u2019s life and reputation. The play is also picaresque as to genre, sampling theatrical styles along the way. It begins with light comedy, as Joan outwits or browbeats squires, soldiers, courtiers and even an archbishop into letting her have her way.In these arguments \u2014 the whole play is argument \u2014 Ms. Rashad\u2019s Joan is always relaxed, never riled or cowed. She stares straight into the faces of her superiors, even the military captain (Patrick Page) who stands bare-chested in front of her, trying to intimidate her with machismo. He fails miserably as Joan twists his words to prove her points, all the while gesturing with just one hand as if using both would be wasteful.But as is often the case with Shaw, fidelity to his intentions is not unequivocally good for productions of his plays. So although it\u2019s a relief to experience a phlegmatic instead of a violent Joan, it\u2019s also a perplexity because the choice robs her of psychology. A hero and genius she may be, but somehow also inert: not much different from a statue if it were blessed with leadership abilities.That blank quality in Ms. Rashad\u2019s Joan leaches the play of drama as the scenes darken from comedy to adventure (she helps raise the successful Siege of Orl\u00e9ans) to pageant (the crowning of the Dauphin) to legal procedural. And if her calm perseverance suggests well enough how she manages to convince the king and the generals, it provides little evidence of how she could inspire the troops and, beyond them, the populace.Still, when the play reaches its tragic sixth scene \u2014 Joan\u2019s trial and burning \u2014 all that withholding pays off.By now we know that this Joan is sound, faithful and temperate. This makes the trial more dangerous, not less, because the ridiculous charges against her are so easily dismissed. We can take it as mere comic relief when the spectacularly dimwit assessors played by Robert Stanton and Maurice Jones keep saying that she is a witch, that she stole the Bishop\u2019s horse and, worst, that her voices speak in French instead of English.As a result, her complete vulnerability to the graver charges of sedition, idolatry, disobedience, heresy and pride is more harshly revealed. She is fatally unprepared by her sincere innocence to understand the moral danger that the presiding Bishop (Walter Bobbie) and Inquisitor (Mr. Page, again) instruct her to acknowledge and that even her most sympathetic supporter, a liberal Dominican played powerfully by Max Gordon Moore, must beg her to resist.That danger is, in essence, presumption: \u201cWhat other judgment can I judge by but by my own?\u201d Joan asks, casually assuming supremacy over churchmen and kings. From this idea comes not only the necessary sentence of a perfectly fair proceeding but also, in the fullness of time, Protestantism, nationalism, individualism and, as Shaw would have it, the Great War, which had recently concluded as he started writing the play.The brilliant scene in which he winds all of these ideas into a noose can hardly fail if it is done properly, and here it is a marvelous highlight. Mr. Page, never better, makes of his rumbling basso something that is somehow both terrifying and loving; he uses every theatrical trick in his arsenal to convince Joan to spare herself by recanting. And Ms. Rashad, as if the weight of her fate were only now hitting her, along with the weight of the play itself, finally explodes in emotion. It\u2019s devastating.I can\u2019t tell whether the withhold-and-release effect is deliberate; not much else about the production suggests a focus on the big picture. Certainly not Scott Pask\u2019s set, a phalanx of cheap-looking organ pipes that regroup to indicate different locales. Worse, they lead you to hope for thrilling toccatas and fugues when all you get from Bill Frisell\u2019s music is misty watercolor pop.Instead it just seems modest: surely the last thing any one ever accused Shaw or \u201cSaint Joan\u201d of being.Advertisement"}

He did,\u201d Mr. Comey said flatly.Mr. Stephanopoulos asked if that scene in the White House constituted obstruction of justice. \u201cPossibly,\u201d Mr. Comey said. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s certainly some evidence of obstruction of justice.\u201d\u201cI thought, \u2018It\u2019s crazy to fire me.\u2019 I\u2019m leading the investigation of Russian influence.\u201d\u201cWow, was my reaction,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst of all, what are the Russians doing in the Oval Office? One, as a counterintelligence person, I\u2019m thinking, \u2018That\u2019s crazy,\u2019 without any Americans being present, one. And, two, the pretense is melting away.\u201dMr. Stephanopoulos asked Mr. Comey what he would think if Mr. Trump were to fire the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.\u201cIt would I hope set off alarm bells that this is his most serious attack yet on the rule of law,\u201d Mr. Comey said. \u201cThat is higher than all the normal fights about policy.\u201dToward the end of Sunday\u2019s broadcast, Mr. Stephanopoulos said it was stunning that Mr. Comey could not rule out the possibility that Russia has compromising material on the president.\u201cIt is stunning, and I wish I wasn\u2019t saying it, but it\u2019s just, it\u2019s the truth,\u201d Mr. Comey said. Mr. Comey used several portions of the interview to defend his decisions about revealing the closing and reopening of the F.B.I.\u2019s investigation into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server. Having announced an end to the inquiry in July 2016, Mr. Comey revealed on Oct. 28, just days before the election, that the F.B.I. was again investigating the case.Those days leading up to the election \u201csucked,\u201d Mr. Comey said. \u201cI walked around vaguely sick to my stomach, feeling beaten down.\u201d\u201cWhat I would hope is that they would, by reading the book, come with me to Oct. 28. Come with me, and sit there with me,\u201d he said.Would he have still sent the letter, Mr. Stephanopoulos asked, if he knew it would get Mr. Trump elected? Mr. Comey said he would have.\u201cIf I ever start considering whose political fortunes will be affected by a decision, we\u2019re done,\u201d Mr. Comey said of the F.B.I. \u201cWe\u2019re just another player in the tribal battle.\u201dAsked if he believes Mr. Trump is unfit for office, Mr. Comey was quick to say yes, but not for reasons of his mental state.Instead, Mr. Comey called Mr. Trump \u201cmorally unfit.\u201d\u201cA person who sees moral equivalence in Charlottesville, who talks about and treats women like they\u2019re pieces of meat, who lies constantly about matters big and small and insists the American people believe it \u2014 that person\u2019s not fit to be president of the United States, on moral grounds,\u201d Mr. Comey said.Advertisement"}

Mr. Appel, the managing editor of the local newspaper, The Press Democrat, had to act fast.\u201cI pulled reporters out of bed,\u201d Mr. Appel said, thankful that he\u2019d been alerted to the inferno by the veteran photographer Kent Porter. \u201cWe posted our first story at 12:35 and updated it 18 times by 6 a.m.\u201dThe PD, as the daily is known, quickly had 14 reporters and four photographers in the field. \u201cOur people,\u201d he said, \u201cwere in the teeth of it.\u201dThe firestorm lasted 30 days, killing 40 people and destroying more than 6,100 homes.

{"Headline": "Trump Doubles Down on Potential Trade War With China", "Date": "2018-04-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump said Thursday that the United States would consider slapping tariffs on an additional $100 billion in Chinese goods, escalating a potentially damaging trade dispute with Beijing.\u201cRather than remedy its misconduct, China has chosen to harm our farmers and manufacturers,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding that he had instructed the United States trade representative to determine whether tariffs on an additional $100 billion in goods were warranted and, \u201cif so, to identify the products upon which to impose such tariffs.\u201dThe move is a high-stakes gamble aimed at cowing China into backing down and forcing it to make the kinds of changes that the United States is seeking \u2014 namely reducing the coercive tactics American officials say Beijing uses to try to dominate leading-edge industries like artificial intelligence, robotics and autonomous vehicles. But the move could ultimately bring about the kind of retaliation from Beijing that has spooked stock markets.It also means that the United States would be somewhat more likely to place levies on Chinese products that American households routinely purchase, like furniture, clothing or shoes \u2014 an outcome the Trump administration said it sought to avoid with its initial round of tariffs.The president\u2019s announcement was immediately criticized by manufacturers, retailers and politicians from states whose economies depend on agriculture.Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, said Mr. Trump was \u201cthreatening to light American agriculture on fire.\u201d\u201cHopefully the president is just blowing off steam again, but if he\u2019s even half-serious, this is nuts,\u201d Mr. Sasse said. \u201cLet\u2019s absolutely take on Chinese bad behavior, but with a plan that punishes them instead of us. This is the dumbest possible way to do this.\u201dIn a statement, Robert Lighthizer, the trade adviser who is carrying out an investigation into Chinese practices, described the president\u2019s threat as \u201can appropriate response,\u201d saying China should have responded to the initial tariffs levied by the United States by changing its behavior.On Friday, a spokesman for China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce accused the United States of starting the conflict and said that \u201cthe Chinese position has been made very clear. We do not want to fight, but we are not afraid to fight a trade war.\u201dHe added that if the United States followed through with its threats, \u201cThe Chinese side will follow suit to the end and will not hesitate to pay any price and will definitely fight back. It must take a new comprehensive response and firmly defend the interests of the country and the people.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s effort to raise the stakes on Thursday seemed poised to send financial markets spinning, with futures on the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-index down and the yen climbing against the dollar. Markets were tame in Asia midday on Friday, which was a holiday in China.The U.S. and China have both demonstrated a willingness to offer concessions \u2014 and escalate tensions \u2014 to get what they want.Companies potentially caught in the middle of a trade war called on the Trump administration to back down and try to work with the Chinese.\u201cThe announcement that the administration may issue $100 billion in additional tariffs on Chinese products is irresponsible and destabilizing,\u201d said Dean C. Garfield, the chief executive of the Information Technology Industry Council, which represents companies such as Amazon, Apple and IBM. \u201cWe call on both sides to halt unproductive and escalatory rhetoric, recognizing that these words and actions have global consequences.\u201dChina experts have questioned whether Mr. Trump\u2019s aggressive negotiating style will leave Chinese leaders with enough political room to make concessions to the Americans. Bowing to the president\u2019s demands could be seen internally as weakness, and the changes that the administration wants \u2014 reducing China\u2019s dominance in cutting-edge manufacturing and technology \u2014 is not something Beijing is likely to agree to.Including this most recent action, the United States would be placing tariffs on a total of $153 billion of Chinese products. The $100 billion threat came on top of the tariffs on $3 billion in Chinese steel and aluminum that he imposed last month and the tariffs on a further $50 billion in Chinese goods that he has threatened to impose in recent days.The total is now so large that China would have trouble finding enough American goods to penalize if it sought to impose a proportional retaliation. China bought only $130.4 billion worth of American goods last year, while the United States bought $505.6 billion worth of Chinese goods.The National Retail Federation blasted the move as a dangerous game of chicken that would put the United States on the losing end of a trading relationship that has benefited American companies and consumers.\u201cThis is what a trade war looks like, and what we have warned against from the start. We are on a dangerous downward spiral, and American families will be on the losing end,\u201d Matthew R. Shay, the president and chief executive of the retail group, said in a statement. \u201cWe urge the administration to change course and stop playing a game of chicken with the nation\u2019s economy.\u201dThe Chinese have tools other than tariffs at their disposal, including limiting the operations of American banks and other service providers in China. The government could also urge the Chinese public not to buy American-brand cars like Chevrolets and Fords, even though those are built almost entirely from Chinese-made parts and assembled in factories in China.The biggest question would be whether China would start retaliating not commercially but through geopolitical actions. While Trump administration trade officials appear to have been operating with considerable autonomy from those responsible for issues like North Korea and Taiwan, policymaking is much more unified in China.Chinese experts have made clear that they perceive the ever-larger rounds of American tariffs as part of a broad American challenge that goes beyond dollars and cents. \u201cIt is more than just a trade issue: It involves geopolitical reasons,\u201d Wu Xinbo, the chief of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai, said in an interview this week. \u201cTrump has mentioned before, if China doesn\u2019t agree on economy and trade, the U.S. will reconsider China issues \u2014 that includes the South China Sea and Taiwan.\u201dPresident Xi Jinping of China is scheduled to give a major speech on Tuesday at the Bo\u2019ao Forum on the Chinese island of Hainan, which may give more clues to China\u2019s response. The speech has been billed by other Chinese officials as a moment when Mr. Xi would lay out a blueprint for China\u2019s economic overhaul and liberalization, a potential peace offering to the Trump administration, said Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s move may throw a small monkey wrench into Xi\u2019s plans,\u201d Mr. Kennedy said. \u201cHe may now need to couple such a proposal with the warning that China will continue to defend itself against foreign pressure.\u201dAna Swanson reported from Washington, and Keith Bradsher from Shanghai.

More importantly, Americans are preparing to spend more on fuel, eating into whatever savings they are expected to receive on average from the tax cuts.Americans are expected to spend an average of $400 per household more on fuel this year than in 2016, as the rebound in crude prices is reflected in the cost of petrol at the pump. By contrast, middle-income US households will on average gain $930 each from the tax cut bill passed at the end of last year, according to the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.And Michael Lynch of Strategic Energy & Economic Research had this to say to Bloomberg:\u201cNinety-eight percent of what politicians say about oil should just be disregarded immediately and this falls in there.\u201dIn February, the Justice Department issued demands to AT&T, Verizon and the G.S.M.A., a mobile industry standards-setting group, for information on potential collusion to thwart a technology known as eSIM, said two of the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details are confidential.The technology lets people remotely switch wireless providers without having to insert a new SIM card into a device. AT&T and Verizon face accusations that they colluded with the G.S.M.A. to try to establish standards that would allow them to lock a device to their network even if it had eSIM technology.The investigation was opened about five months ago after at least one device maker and one wireless carrier filed formal complaints with the Justice Department, two of the people said.Representatives for the Justice Department, AT&T, Verizon and the G.S.M.A. declined to comment.\u2014 Cecilia KangShares of General Electric jumped nearly 4 percent Friday after the company reported better-than-expected earnings and reaffirmed its guidance for the year.Though G.E. reported a first-quarter loss on Friday, there were also signs that the struggling industrial giant is beginning to stabilize its business.G.E.\u2019s big power-generator division continues to drag down the company\u2019s overall performance, and it is still burdened with financial liabilities that linger from the conglomerate\u2019s pared-back finance arm, GE Capital.But G.E.\u2019s other major industrial divisions, led by aviation and health care, delivered solid results in the quarter. That should provide some assurance to investors as the company charts a future dependent on its industrial lines.Especially heartening for investors, G.E. reaffirmed its profit outlook for the year, predicting earnings per share of $1 to $1.07, though likely at the lower end of that range. Analysts had been skeptical that G.E. could do that well. The average analysts\u2019 forecast for the year was 95 cents a share, as compiled by Thomson Reuters.To recap: Wells Fargo has already paid $185 million over its fake accounts scandal and set aside $4.25 billion for liabilities tied to other infractions. And the Fed has prevented the bank from expanding its balance sheet.Yes, the upcoming $1 billion fine is the most stringent bank penalty imposed by the Trump administration to date. (The C.F.P.B., under pressure from Mick Mulvaney to go easier on financial firms, is involved here.)But Mr. Stewart writes, \u201cAt this point it\u2019s hard to imagine what more Wells Fargo can do (or how much more it can spend) to make amends.\u201dThat\u2019s the contention of the reporter Jonathan Greenberg, who, as a Forbes reporter in 1984, spoke with \u201cJohn Barron\u201d about Donald Trump\u2019s net worth. Mr. Barron \u2014 a now well-known alter ego of the real estate executive \u2014 contended that Mr. Trump had bought out most of his father\u2019s stake in their business.Over time I have learned that he should not have been on the first three Forbes 400 lists at all. In our first-ever list, in 1982, we included him at $100 million, but Trump was actually worth roughly $5 million \u2014 a paltry sum by the standards of his super-monied peers \u2014 as a spate of government reports and books showed only much later.Mr. Greenberg writes that the White House and the Trump Organization declined to comment.The Justice Department, which wants to block the deal, argued that AT&T is different because it\u2019s also a broadband internet provider, and that relations with Silicon Valley are chummier than Mr. Stephenson asserts.A big takeover would give Takeda more scale \u2014 the combined company would have some $30 billion in annual sales \u2014 and a bigger international footprint. But it would also be the company\u2019s biggest takeover by far, and perhaps too expensive.The Japanese drug maker said it intended to maintain its credit rating, which could be difficult if it bids too high \u2014 or is pressured to do so by yet another suitor.With its $16 trillion economy and reputation for tough negotiating, the E.U. could have been the immovable object in President Trump\u2019s trade fight. But that is looking less likely, Peter Eavis writes.Among the lessons if the E.U. concedes: The U.S.\u2019s large trade deficits can give it leverage.The sometimes controversial data consultant cut its teeth working for the Pentagon and the C.I.A. Now it\u2019s hoping that its latest product will attract more commercial clients.The company needs to figure out how to be rewarded on Wall Street without creeping out Main Street. It might not be possible. For all of Palantir\u2019s professed concern for individuals\u2019 privacy, the single most important safeguard against abuse is the one it\u2019s trying desperately to reduce through automation: human judgment.Victor Orlovski, Fort Ross\u2019s founder and managing partner, told Michael that the current state of U.S.-Russian political relations should not affect his firm\u2019s ability to operate. \u201cThe nature of start-ups is all about risk,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a political tension, but not when you\u2019re talking to start-ups.\u201dThe tech flyaroundThe only potential obstacle: Arturo Di Modica, the artist who made the bull, doesn\u2019t want it moved.An earlier version of this article, relying on information in a Bloomberg report, misstated the amount of Sumner Redstone\u2019s compensation that a court ruled CBS shareholders could challenge.

{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Privacy Changes Leave Developers Steaming", "Date": "2018-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For years, Cubeyou made a business out of personal data on Facebook. The company had unfettered access to Facebook users\u2019 information, which it gathered up through quizzes and later sold as reports to clients.Federico Treu, Cubeyou\u2019s chief executive, told The New York Times that his company had done nothing wrong, and that it had followed Facebook\u2019s rules in disclosing that it was using profile data for both academic and business purposes. He said Cubeyou was just collateral damage as Facebook has overzealously scrambled to show that it cares about data privacy.\u201cFacebook threw us under the bus,\u201d said Mr. Treu, who added that he intended to boycott a Facebook event for developers this week. \u201cFacebook became what it was because of us developers. Now they want to blame us for everything that has happened to them.\u201dSome, like Cubeyou, said they have been unfairly blocked from accessing Facebook users. Tinder, the dating app, discovered that its users were no longer able to log into the app using their Facebook accounts. Pod, a calendar syncing app, found that its users could no longer see Facebook events within their calendars. And Job Fusion, a jobs app that allowed users to see where their Facebook friends worked, announced that it was not longer able to offer its services within Facebook.Facebook said it expected roughly 5,000 people \u2014 a record high \u2014 to be at the developer conference, which is known as F8. But the company also said it has tweaked the event with an eye toward data privacy. For example, the social network canceled the announcement of a Facebook smart home speaker to challenge Amazon\u2019s Echo and Google\u2019s Home amid worries that the device would raise more questions about the amount of data the company collects.Ime Archibong, Facebook\u2019s vice president of product partnerships, said developers are \u201cincredible partners\u201d for the company, but also added that it must \u201cstrike the right balance between creating compelling social experiences, protecting people\u2019s data, and supporting an innovative developer ecosystem.\"Bhaskar Chakravorti, senior associate dean at The Fletcher School at Tufts University, said Facebook had to walk a fine line. \u201cThey have taken a blunt instrument approach, which is the right thing to do from a public relations standpoint,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now they need to reach out to developers and smooth things over.\u201dFacebook announced a series of privacy changes in early April. Under the new measures, developers can only see a Facebook user\u2019s name, profile photo and email address; previously, the could see more information, like users\u2019 Facebook posts. Facebook is also cutting off developers\u2019 access to user accounts if someone has not used their apps for three months or longer. That policy is intended to prevent developers from collecting information in the background for months or years after people stop using their apps.Facebook also announced that it was investigating apps that had gained access to large amounts of its data in the past, and said it was conducting an audit of any company that it believed has shown suspicious activity.Cubeyou got caught up in the dragnet in early April. At the time, CNBC reported that the company, which is based in Redwood City, Calif., had collected users\u2019 Facebook information for academic purposes and then sold the data to commercial firms without informing users. Facebook said it was conducting an audit of Cubeyou to determine if there was any wrongdoing.Mr. Treu said Cubeyou fully complies with Facebook\u2019s requirements of disclosing the data it collects and what that data is used for. He added that Cubeyou strips out any personally identifiable information that it gets from Facebook. Cubeyou is simply being singled out as part of \u201ca witch hunt\u201d by Facebook, he said.\u201cWe did everything by the rules, and we are ready to prove that,\u201d said Mr. Treu, who said his company has repeatedly reached out to Facebook to talk. \u201cThere is no way to talk to them, to find out anything.\u201dAn earlier version of this story misstated the given name of CubeYou\u2019s chief executive. He is Federico Treu, not Frederico.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Mark Zuckerberg is back on Capitol Hill.\u2022 Why would a trade war with China be good for the United States economy?\u2022 Has Facebook opened itself up to regulation?\u2022 Bank of America\u2019s move on gun sales.\u2022 Why did the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of N.Y. recuse himself from the Michael Cohen raid?Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s second day of Congressional grilling lifted its shares again.The stock rose 0.8 percent, even as the broader market dropped 0.6 percent.While it remains to be seen whether Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s performance will keep regulations at bay, his testimony was certainly a tonic for investors. Facebook\u2019s two-day rise of more than 5 percent added over $24 billion to its market capitalization, according to Bloomberg data.\u201cZuckerberg appears willing to work with lawmakers on possible regulations, which may create a barrier to entry in the social network space and help Facebook maintain its market leadership.\u201d\u2014 Matt PhillipsMark Zuckerberg is back on Capitol Hill for a second day of congressional testimony.Here are some highlights :\u2022 Representative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon and chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee, kicked off the hearing by declaring that \u201cwhile Facebook has certainly grown, I worry it has not matured.\u201d Mr. Walden floated the prospect of regulation, saying that \u201cI think it is time to ask whether Facebook may have moved too fast and broken too many things.\u201d\u2022 Mr. Walden also asked: \u201cWhat exactly is Facebook?\u201d The definitions matter. If Facebook is viewed as a telecommunications service that is more like a utility, it may be regulated by the Federal Communications Commission. If lawmakers define Facebook as a publisher, it could also fall under regulations at that agency. \u201cI consider us to be a technology company,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg answered. \u201cThe primary thing we do is have engineers that write code and build services for other people.\u201d\u2022 Representative Frank Pallone, a New Jersey Democrat, pressed Mr. Zuckerberg on whether Facebook would agree or refuse to change Facebook\u2019s default settings to minimize collection and use of users\u2019 data. \u201cThis is a complex issue that deserves more than a one-word answer,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg answered. \u201cThat\u2019s disappointing to me,\u201d Mr. Pallone responded.\u2022 California Democrat Anna Eshoo put it more bluntly, asking Mr. Zuckerberg: \u201cAre you willing to change your business model to protect users\u2019 privacy?\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg was noncommittal, saying: \u201cCongresswoman, I\u2019m not sure what that means.\u201d\u2022 Representative Joe Barton, Republican of Texas, pressed Mr. Zuckerberg on why Facebook has been allegedly censoring content from conservative organizations and Trump supporters such as Diamond and Silk. Mr. Barton also asked Mr. Zuckerberg if he would agree that Facebook would work to ensure it is \u201ca neutral public platform.\u201d \u201cI do agree that we should give people a voice,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.\u2022 Rep. Gene Green, a Texas Democrat, and Jan Schakowsky, an Illinois Democrat, pressed Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s promise to give users worldwide the same privacy controls required by a tough new data protection law which will go into effect in the European Union next month. Mr. Green also asked Mr. Zuckerberg if Facebook planned to comply with the provision in the European law that allows individuals to obtain a copy of the data companies hold about them.\u2022 A number of lawmakers have tried to draw a comparison between the Obama campaign\u2019s use of a Facebook app to scrape data from users and their friends in 2012 and Cambridge Analytica. Those lawmakers have failed to mention one very important distinction between the Obama campaign\u2019s app and Cambridge Analytica\u2019s app: The Obama app was actually on Facebook itself, and it was very clear about who and what the data would be used for. The app used to scrape data for Cambridge Analytica was accessed through a personality questionnaire hosted on a site outside of Facebook, and it appeared to users to be for academic research, not for a political data company owned by a wealthy Republican donor and dedicated to reshaping the American electorate.Mr. Musk told co-host Gayle King:\u201cI think whenever something is \u2013 whenever there\u2019s something that affects the public good then there does need to be some form of public oversight. \u2026 I do think there should be some regulations on AI. I think there should be regulations on social media to the degree that it negatively affects the public good. We can\u2019t have like willy-nilly proliferation of fake news, that\u2019s crazy. You can\u2019t have more types of fake news than real news. That\u2019s allowing public deception to go unchecked. That\u2019s crazy.\u201dAndrew writes: These were the most important words from Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s five-hour testimony: \u201cI agree we are responsible for the content.\u201d They may come back to haunt him, given his previous rejection of calling Facebook a publisher. He later backtracked and called his business a tech company, but his acknowledgment may fundamentally shift the conversation \u2014 and how the company operates. (All in all, Mr. Zuckerberg did better than anyone had expected.)Lawmakers now seem much more aware of how much power large technology companies have. This was encapsulated in questions posed by Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina. He framed Facebook as a monopoly and brought up the possibility of regulating Facebook, asking Mr. Zuckerberg: \u201cBut you as a company welcome regulation?\u201dAnd Facebook may now only be one big scandal away from a more stringent government response.Critics\u2019 corner\u201cUnder a symbiotic U.S.-China relationship, America became a preeminent technology leader, and its brands are today the envy of the world. China improved the standard of living of its citizens with a tenfold increase in per capita gross domestic product over the past 20 years.\u201dBut that relationship will change over the next two decades, Mr. Ma said:\u201cChina is shifting its economy from the world\u2019s largest exporter to the world\u2019s largest consumer. Chinese citizens now have the wealth and income to pursue discretionary spending. They want to buy high-quality imported food, cosmetics, fashions and health and wellness products for themselves and their children.\u201dMr. Ma goes on to write:\u201cIt is therefore ironic that the U.S. administration is waging a trade war at a time when the largest potential consumer market in the world is open for business. Is America going to forfeit this opportunity?Instigating a trade war is the wrong solution because it will only provoke retaliation. The Chinese government responded to U.S. tariff threats with its own tariffs on American agricultural products, such as soybeans. China is the largest export market for American soybeans, worth $14 billion annually and accounting for 65 percent of all U.S. soybean exports.The U.S. has been a consistent defender of free and open markets, but this time it is resorting to protectionism that will not improve American competitiveness. Any country seeking to increase exports would do better to focus on developing good products and channels to access foreign markets rather than putting up trade barriers.\u201dShari Redstone, whose National Amusements controls CBS and Viacom, is seeking to combine the two media companies.From Reuters:\u201cHer longtime friend and business ally, powerful CBS Chief Executive Les Moonves, has emerged as one of the biggest obstacles to a potential CBS-Viacom tie-up, according to people familiar with the matter. Concerns are that his objections could either doom the transaction or that he might not lead the new entity, the people said.\u201cMoonves is chafing at Redstone\u2019s insistence on installing Viacom\u2019s CEO as his second-in-command and likely successor of a merged company, the people say.\u201dBank of America works with \u201cjust a handful\u201d of such manufacturers, according to its vice chairwoman Anne Finucane. Their reactions? \u201cMixed,\u201d she said.It\u2019s not exactly a surprise. SoftBank\u2019s Masa Son bought control of Sprint planning to merge it with T-Mobile, the better to fight Verizon and AT&T. And most analysts agree that both companies need to become bigger to survive.Advertisement"}

Because the labor market for engineers in the Bay Area is so tight, and because companies live and die on their ability to attract and retain talent, these employees have much more say in how a company like Google governs itself than, say, regulators or outside activists. If an antiwar group protests outside Google\u2019s headquarters, it\u2019s an annoyance. But if 3,000 engineers walk out, it\u2019s a crisis. And as the tech industry goes through its moral reckoning, executives of these companies should bear in mind that their biggest risk isn\u2019t regulation, it\u2019s rebellion from within.It\u2019s a tragic reminder that social platforms aren\u2019t just websites anymore.

{"Headline": "Nursing Election Grievances, Hillary Clinton Supporters Curse Comey", "Date": "2018-04-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 When it comes to James B. Comey\u2019s book-tour crusade against President Trump, the question for hard-core Hillary Clinton fans boils down to this: Curse Mr. Comey, or cheer him?Curse him, mostly.They may be card-carrying members of \u201cthe Resistance,\u201d who oppose everything that the president stands for, but Mrs. Clinton\u2019s former aides and advisers are still too angry at Mr. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, to see past what they view as egregious actions that handed the White House to Mr. Trump.\u201cThe damage Comey did to the country by the role he played in the election far, far surpasses any credit he now gets for calling Trump out,\u201d said Jared Bernstein, who served as one of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s senior economic advisers during the campaign. \u201cHistory will remember and judge him for the former, not the latter.\u201d\u201cSpeak or conceal \u2014 both terrible options,\u201d he writes in the book, which is coming out on Tuesday. \u201cNo matter what we found, that act of concealment would be catastrophic to the integrity of the F.B.I. and the Department of Justice. Put that way, the choice between a \u2018really bad\u2019 option and a \u2018catastrophic\u2019 option was not that hard a call. We had to tell Congress that things had changed.\u201dMrs. Clinton\u2019s most fervent supporters disagree, to say the least.Some, like Philippe Reines, a longtime and trusted Clinton confidant, are eager to dig through the pages of Mr. Comey\u2019s book, if only to dissect it, point by point, looking for inconsistencies or misstatements.\u201cIt would be rare for someone\u2019s book to say, \u2018This is how I screwed up,\u2019\u201d Mr. Reines said. \u201cBut his answers to some really fundamental stuff are just at the very best incomplete. At the worst, they are just flat-out unacceptable.\u201dLike the rest of his former campaign colleagues, Mr. Reines is not unaware that Mr. Comey is assailing the president\u2019s moral character, his inability to tell the truth and his actions that could amount to obstruction of justice. And for the record, Mr. Reines does not disagree with any of it.\u201cI bought the book. I can\u2019t wait for it to come from Amazon tomorrow. I do believe Trump is orange and wears tanning glasses,\u201d he said. But that doesn\u2019t take away, he said, from the \u201cacute frustration with Jim Comey and wanting to hold him to an accountable standard.\u201dMr. Trump has seized on that frustration to rant about Mr. Comey, tapping into \u2014 and twisting \u2014 the Democratic angst.In a tweet Monday morning, the president claimed that Mr. Comey had drafted a memo exonerating Mrs. Clinton \u201clong before\u201d the email investigation was over. The president referenced Mr. Comey\u2019s handling of the investigation into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state.Mr. Trump\u2019s accusations about Mr. Comey\u2019s handling of the email investigation are different from the ones lodged by her former supporters. But together, Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s advisers are diverting the conversation away from Mr. Comey\u2019s allegations against the president.Mr. Comey also said the president \u201clies constantly about matters big and small.\u201dThere is not much about which Mrs. Clinton\u2019s supporters agree with Mr. Trump. But that assessment of Mr. Comey is one of them.Lanny J. Davis, a lawyer and longtime Clinton associate, railed against Mr. Comey on Sunday, saying on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d that Mr. Comey was a \u201crenegade narcissist\u201d who thought that he was \u201cabove the law\u201d as he conducted the email investigation.\u201cWhat he was really doing was protecting his political rear end with the Republicans because he thought that Hillary Clinton was going to get elected,\u201d Mr. Davis said.\u201cKarma really delivered the punch to Comey,\u201d tweeted Neera Tanden, a veteran Clinton loyalist and the president of the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank. \u201cHe helped elect the guy who\u2019d fire him \u2014 to obstruct Justice.\u201dIt is possible that Mr. Comey thought his book would help douse some of the hatred of him on the political left, which he readily acknowledges. He wrote that he had heard Mrs. Clinton felt she had been \u201cshivved\u201d by him, and added, \u201cI also know many Democrats are similarly baffled \u2014 even outraged \u2014 by the actions I took.\u201dBut his explanations for his decisions have largely fallen flat, at least among those who lived through the stories.Mr. Comey writes in the book that he grew to believe that Loretta E. Lynch, the attorney general and his boss, was too close to the Clintons and did not have the credibility with the American people to announce a verdict in the email investigation.Ms. Lynch, in a statement, disagreed.\u201cI did what I always do: rise above politics and uphold the law,\u201d she wrote. Of Mr. Comey, she said: \u201cIf he had any concerns regarding the email investigation, classified or not, he had ample opportunities to raise them with me both privately and in meetings. He never did.\u201dMr. Comey writes at length about his decision to hold a news conference in the summer of 2016 announcing that Mrs. Clinton would not be prosecuted, but also condemning her handling of classified materials as \u201cextremely reckless.\u201d\u201cI would do the same thing again at that announcement,\u201d he writes in his book, \u201cbecause I still believe it was the best available alternative to protect and preserve the Department of Justice\u2019s and the F.B.I.\u2019s reservoir of trust with the American people.\u201dFor Mrs. Clinton\u2019s supporters, this was Mr. Comey\u2019s original sin \u2014 the moment that he broke with F.B.I. traditions that usually call for nothing more than a brief, one-sentence declaration when the decision is made not to prosecute. And that declaration is usually made by Justice Department officials, not the F.B.I.In a tweet after parts of Mr. Comey\u2019s book were released last week, Mr. Reines wrote: \u201c\u2018A Higher Loyalty\u2019 to whom @Comey? FBI? No. Set Bureau back years. DOJ? No. Broke every rule. USA? No. Blew up a candidate. Your Oath? No. Didn\u2019t quit. Fired. Only one thing left: $$$? ding ding ding.\u201dOne response to his tweet came from Jason Chaffetz, the former Republican representative from Utah who was often scorching in his criticism of Mrs. Clinton. The sentiment from the Republican lawmaker to a Democratic loyalist underscored the odd convergence around Mr. Comey\u2019s book.\u201cWe agree from time to time,\u201d Mr. Chaffetz said.Eileen Sullivan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Along with that Echo, the family has Google Home, digital home security, a lock with keyless entry, and a Nest thermostat that insists on keeping the internal temperature at a crisp 62 degrees even when people are home.Ms. Coffey has so many apps on her phone monitoring her home that she has lost track of all the things they do. \u201cI appreciate his efforts to computerize our house,\u201d she said of Mr. Berkowitz. \u201cI just wish I could turn on a light without having to ask my phone to do it.\u201dLight bulbs are just the beginning. I could get a Colgate Connect toothbrush to map my mouth and give me pointers; a Roomba vacuuming robot to clean up after me; or a smart refrigerator to warn me that the milk might curdle. I could swap out my doorbell for one with a camera, delivering me live footage of the UPS driver dropping off a Bluetooth-enabled Instant Pot that can monitor how quickly the rice cooks.Would my life be easier if I could keep track of dinner on my iPhone? I don\u2019t know. But it probably would be more monitored. Even as we are in the midst of a collective freakout about the data that Facebook has been gathering and sharing without our permission, many of us are busily installing equipment that potentially bugs our homes and tracks our movements, conversations and routines.But anxiety alone hasn\u2019t been a deterrent, since we keep buying the stuff. We rationalize this uncomfortable truth because smart technology does have the potential to make life easier and, perhaps, safer.Affix a smart sensor to your water heater and you could be alerted to an impending flood. Install a smart lock on your door and you could remotely let a neighbor in to feed the cat, or get an alert at the office when your teenager gets home from school.As for me, I live in an old house with few overhead light fixtures. It seems like a banal problem, but filling my bedroom with lamps that turn on with an iPhone means I don\u2019t have to call an electrician to drill holes in my ceiling and walls to install permanent lighting. I certainly enjoy the convenience, and savings, even if it means I have yet another reason to stare at my phone.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cambridge Analytica and the Coming Data Bust", "Date": "2018-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn TechnologyThe queasy truth at the heart of Facebook\u2019s Cambridge Analytica scandal, which is so far the company\u2019s defining disgrace of 2018, is that its genesis became scandalous only in retrospect. The series of events that now implicate Facebook began in 2014, in plain view, with a listing on Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk service, where users can complete small tasks for commensurately modest sums of cash. In exchange for installing a Facebook app and completing a survey \u2014 in the process granting the app access to parts of your Facebook profile \u2014 you would get around a dollar. Maybe two.This was a great deal, at least by the standards of the time. Facebook users were then accustomed to granting apps permission to see their personal data in exchange for much less. It was the tail end of a Facebook era defined by connected apps: games like FarmVille, Candy Crush and Words With Friends; apps that broadcast your extra-Facebook activities, like Spotify and Pinterest; and apps that were almost explicitly about gathering as much useful data as possible from users, like TripAdvisor\u2019s Cities I\u2019ve Visited app, which let you share a digital pushpin map with your friends.Most of these apps, when installed, demanded permission to access \u201cyour profile info,\u201d which could include things like your activity, birthday, relationship status, interests, religious and political views, likes, education and work history. They could also collect information about users\u2019 friends, multiplying their reach. In providing a marketplace for such apps, Facebook made it easy for users to extend their extraordinarily intimate relationship with the site to thousands of third-party developers. One of them turned out to be connected to Cambridge Analytica, which was using the data for right-wing political campaigns \u2014 a fact that was lucidly and widely reported as early as 2015 but promptly lost in the roiling insanity of primary season. (As of Facebook\u2019s most recent admission, data was collected on as many as 87 million users.)Not that more exposure in the news cycle would have mattered much back then. It was self-evidently absurd to grant a virtual-farming game access to your religious views, but that\u2019s just how the platform worked at the time, and so we got used to it, much in the same way we got used to conducting our private lives on any other corporate platform. (When Gmail first started in 2004, the fact that it placed ads based on the contents of users\u2019 emails was considered invasive. That feeling passed; Google continued scanning consumer email until 2017, and Gmail now has more than a billion users.) Still, these individually trivial decisions never gave us cause to confront just how much we had come to trust Facebook.Whenever you sign up for any free service, you\u2019re aware, in the loosest terms, that you\u2019re giving up something. It usually includes a license to use the content you create \u2014 be it capital-C Content, like public posts, or things you would intuitively understand as more private, like your direct messages and which profiles you look at \u2014 however the service pleases. You could imagine the problem with all this, if asked: You\u2019re giving up your privacy to a company that owes you nothing and could end up doing basically anything. But a user concerned about how ad-supported web services would infringe on his privacy is trapped in a sort of predictive hell: always right, but always feeling wrong; never quite able to say what will happen, but always expecting it; both constantly vindicated and yet feeling he\u2019s crying wolf.And its users unwittingly took part in a social-data boom and are only now starting to feel the consequences. The ease and speed with which internet users trust tech companies with the data they crave are wildly out of proportion with the risks they\u2019re assuming in doing so, in no small part because, out of negligence or institutional blindness, the companies couldn\u2019t anticipate the risks themselves. After all, Facebook spent years fortifying itself against hackers and spammers only to be rolled by political actors posing as app developers.This pattern \u2014 a boom based on credible-seeming promises that are a little too good to be true, followed years later by a bust confirming that they indeed were \u2014 is familiar from a different world: finance. The financial crisis was materially devastating in a way that a privacy crisis couldn\u2019t be; poor stewardship of user data isn\u2019t going to evict people from their homes. But among the lingering and underrated consequences of the collapse of the global financial system was a total loss in trust in the institutions that were supposed to prevent it. The disorienting and thoroughly unsatisfying Cambridge Analytica saga is a preview of what trailing indicators of the collapse of the data boom might look like: revealing signs, evident years later, that something was rotten with these arrangements, arriving too late to be actionable but soon enough to foster resentment against companies and services on which we\u2019ve come to depend.Experiences that test our trust of the free-services-for-personal-data internet are accumulating and threaten to become more personal: the failure of Twitter to ban someone who harassed or threatened you; a small but embarrassing email hack resulting in a scammer asking old friends for money and concluding with an admonishment from your provider that you just needed a better password; an identity theft, a suffering credit score and then news of a hack at Equifax, a service to which you never even chose to provide data. Or it could be nothing more than an eerily well-targeted ad, one that suggests that a certain service \u2014 maybe one you never even meant to interact with \u2014 knows things about you that you don\u2019t remember telling it.The wider consequences of these arrangements are harder to quantify and sometimes even to see. They are: a social-media ecosystem that has annexed the news and the public sphere; nascent but increasingly assertive systems of identity and social currency that seek to transcend borders while answering only to investors; billions of lives\u2019 worth of trustingly volunteered data in the hands of companies that might want to make money from it, or that might have no need for it anymore, or that might go out of business, change ownership or simply forget what they had in the first place. Perhaps someone \u2014 a new partner, an enterprising researcher, a repressive government \u2014 might, one day, discover new uses for the data.A loss of faith in tech companies as semipublic infrastructure would also arrive simultaneously with an understanding that that\u2019s what they had been all along: services that we depended on, ones we gave ourselves to, and that revealed themselves to be \u2014 or merely became \u2014 the sorts of services we\u2019d rather not. They\u2019re not too big to fail in the banking sense. But they\u2019re similarly hard to budge, having constructed entire modes of interaction, consumption and identity verification that are now intimately interwoven with our lives, so all-encompassing that they\u2019ve practically become invisible. To stop using these products is to leave the internet, and these companies made it their mission to make sure there isn\u2019t anywhere else to go.In a recent conference call with reporters, Mark Zuckerberg, the company\u2019s chief executive, confessed that Facebook ought to do a better job of putting privacy tools in front of users, but in the same breath he encouraged people to use the tools and to \u201cmake sure that they\u2019re comfortable with how their information is used on our services and others.\u201d It was a gesture at dusty old user agreements \u2014 an emphasis on the fact that we technically consented to this, and that if he was expected to hold up his end of the deal, we should be too. It called to mind a line of the financial industry\u2019s post-crisis defense: Borrowers should have read the fine print. But for the tech industry, this posture is even more of a stretch: It\u2019s an argument for honoring the status quo, coming from the people who have made it their mission to destroy it.John Herrman is a technology reporter for The Times.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Oh for the Days of the Making-Of Featurette \u2014 Seriously", "Date": "2018-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhile I was lazing on my couch, it turns out that a generation of young filmmakers were scrutinizing DVD extras to learn their craft.Matt and Ross Duffer, the creators of the Netflix sci-fi series \u201cStranger Things,\u201d grew up in North Carolina, far from Hollywood studios, and, as they wrote in an email, \u201cbonus features were really the only way for us to experience a film set \u2014 to see how movie magic was made.\u201dBehind-the-scenes videos, explained the brothers, gave them an inside look at the filmmaking process. They mentioned the shorts on the extended DVD edition of \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d that follow Peter Jackson through every stage of the trilogy, from pre- to postproduction.This left me wondering how a kid from North Carolina would lift the curtain today. With DVDs steadily joining VHS cassettes as extinct technology, what has become of the fun, insightful mixed bag that movie fans came to know as bonus features \u2014 the audio commentaries, behind-the-scenes featurettes, bloopers, deleted scenes and alternate endings? Some of these extras have shifted to digital stores and streaming platforms. But can cinephiles access them as easily as they could when video rental stores prospered in every neighborhood?I recently came across Rafael Perez, the former owner of Mister Video III, a now-closed Brooklyn store where I had spent many an hour. He argued that fans would eventually grow weary of scouring the internet for film analysis and start seeking out old-school hard copies, as with the vinyl revival for music.\u201cThere\u2019re so many different things you\u2019re able to get on this one little disk,\u201d said Mr. Perez, who\u2019s kept more than 1,000 DVDs from his old inventory in what he calls his man cave unceremoniously piled on shelves and in boxes.\u201cSometimes,\u201d he added, \u201cthings have to go away for people to kind of miss them.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a chicken soup for aspiring filmmakers,\u201d she said.But Netflix, which bought \u201cThe Kindergarten Teacher,\u201d appears unlikely to include extras from her shoot when it releases Ms. Colangelo\u2019s film. Like most subscription-based streaming services, Netflix produces little added content. So young filmmakers today might not have the chance to learn from the trials and tribulations Ms. Colangelo experienced on her production.It wasn\u2019t until DVDs took over the home-video market in the late 1990s that studios started seeing extras as an opportunity to help sales.Patrick Brereton, the author of \u201cSmart Cinema, DVD Add-Ons and New Audience Pleasures,\u201d said studios began using DVD extras as a selling point when they reissued old movies. \u201cSome DVDs of old John Wayne westerns had adverts for cigarettes from the 1950s,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were just sticking in anything.\u201dQuickly enough, studios started producing bonus features to sell new films as well, spending money on voice-over commentary, behind-the-scene shorts and interviews with the cast. Extras, Mr. Brereton said, became increasingly standardized and driven by a marketing agenda.\u201cThe fans love this because they are feeling at one with a director who is making a film that they love: There is triangulation of pleasure,\u201d said Mr. Brereton.Easter eggs, or hidden extras, even required fans to actively unlock them. By typing \u201c1138\u201d on the DVD option menu for \u201cStar Wars: Episode III \u2014 Revenge of the Sith,\u201d for instance, viewers gained access to a short scene of Yoda rapping.Since DVD sales plummeted in the late 2000s, however, some in the industry believe major studios have scaled back on spending money to produce extras. Several studios, including Warner Bros., declined to give numbers or discuss the evolution of extras and their budgets.\u201cBudgets were definitely more significant across the board when DVDs were a dominant player,\u201d said Julie Dansker, vice president of sales and marketing at the Orchard, an independent distributor.Now that most video stores are gone, this content is also unavailable to rent \u2014 in the physical or digital realms.But some distributors design extras expressly for the iTunes version to increase digital sales: \u201cDior and I,\u201d a documentary about the Christian Dior design company, for example, made its 2015 debut on Apple\u2019s website with an exclusive photo gallery from a fashion show featured in the film.But even cinephiles may take some convincing.Greg Oxenberg, 28, a film student at New York University, said he loved Criterion titles, but was not drawn to streaming.\u201cI use the New York Public Library a lot because they have tons of different locations and you can order the DVDs you\u2019re looking for online,\u201d said the self-described film nerd, who likes dissecting director commentaries to hone his screenwriting skills.\u201cBut it\u2019s not quite as convenient as having it all on that disk and popping it in,\u201d he admitted.Mr. Foster\u2019s wistful comment made me melancholic about my time spent at Mister Video III. Maybe, I thought, the DVDs stored in Mr. Perez\u2019s man cave will pay off after all.But for now, like Mr. Perez\u2019s store \u2014 and my idle 20s \u2014 it appears as though access to hours of geeky, director-narrated analysis at a low cost is gone.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Russia Tried to Shut Down Telegram. Websites Were Collateral Damage.", "Date": "2018-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Russia\u2019s communications watchdog was locked in an intensive game of whack-a-mole on Wednesday with Telegram, the popular and highly secure messaging app, as its stuttering attempts to block the service inadvertently knocked out the websites of scores of small businesses.Alexander Zharov, the head of the watchdog agency, Roskomnadzor, acknowledged that it had obstructed millions of IP addresses in an attempt to shutter Telegram. Roskomnadzor took that step after the company declined to provide encryption information, which would enable the agency to identify users and see the content of messages.The watchdog agency was granted authority to block the app on Friday by a Moscow court. But the clumsy, unprecedented effort to follow through, which started Monday, caused a widespread outcry after the unintended consequences became apparent.A member of the band Pussy Riot organized a small public protest. Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor who leaked American surveillance documents and now lives in Russia, expressed support for the company. Even some usually staunch Kremlin supporters called the ban misguided.Internet experts in Russia saw a greater menace in the effort beyond Telegram, speculating that if the government succeeded in silencing the app with some 13 million Russian users, it might pursue bigger fish next.\u201cIf you have a government agency being so brutal attacking Telegram, taking down millions of IP addresses, after that you can do what you want,\u201d said Andrei Soldatov, one of the authors of \u201cThe Red Web,\u201d a history of the Russian internet. \u201cAfter they have faced this much heat, they can go after Facebook and Google.\u201dTelegram tried to thwart the blockage by shifting its service to two giant American web hosts, Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services, while at the same time repeatedly changing its IP address to skip ahead of Roskomnadzor.In response, rather than chasing individual IP addresses \u2014 a unique set of numbers that identifies a computer, smartphone or other device connected to the internet \u2014 the watchdog agency elected to shut down enormous blocks of addresses, called subnets.The collateral damage hit a variety of other sites, like Viber, another messaging app, as well as small businesses including a language school and a courier service, all of which suffered financial losses.Volvo dealerships could not access their service records, according to press reports, and Kremlin museums had to suspend ticket sales. Roskomnadzor said it unblocked individual sites as soon as the agency became aware of a problem.The Agora group of human rights lawyers, which represents Telegram in Russian courts, said in a statement that it had received 73 complaints about blocked websites. The organization planned to file a formal complaint with the prosecutor general\u2019s office.Telegram has been sending messages to users encouraging them to use alternative means, including Virtual Private Networks, which effectively connect to the internet outside Russia, to evade the ban.The app\u2019s founder, Pavel Durov, who fled Russia after losing control in 2014 of VKontakte, the Russian version of Facebook that he created, sent a message to Telegram users saying that he would continue to engage in \u201cdigital resistance.\u201dHis supporters included Mr. Snowden, who wrote on Twitter that resistance to the \u201ctotalitarian demand\u201d for backdoor access to private communications \u201cis the only moral response, and shows real leadership.\u201dMaria V. Alyokhina, a political activist and member of the Pussy Riot collective who has been jailed for previous demonstrations, helped to organize a protest that consisted of tossing paper airplanes outside the Moscow headquarters of the F.S.B., the secret police. She was sentenced to 100 hours of compulsory community service, according to Mediazona, a courtroom news agency.The paper airplane is the corporate symbol of the Telegram app. The F.S.B. has been leading the effort in Russia to gain backdoor access to all private communications in Russia, saying it was necessary to combat terrorism.Telegram was widely used within the Russian government, including by President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s press office, to communicate with the public and the media. Some government agencies and press offices continued to use Telegram despite the ban.Igor Lebedev, the deputy chairman of the Russian Parliament and the son of nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky, accused the government watchdog agency of \u201cincompetence.\u201d\u201cIt targeted Telegram but hit Russian business,\u201d he wrote on Twitter, saying it should be illegal to limit access to such popular sites. \u201cWe must defend Russian citizens from pointless bans!\u201dThe Kremlin has also come in for criticism on several other fronts: It has suggested using older, slower apps as an alternative, especially one owned by a Putin crony; it shut down LinkedIn and managed to limit some access to Zello, a voice messaging app used to organize truck driver protests; and it finds itself accused of paying lip service to the idea that Russia should develop cutting edge technology while busily undermining Telegram, one of the few Russian I.T. brands to achieve global success.The office of the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, an active Telegram user, said he had shut down his account to set the example. The decision was \u201cin line with safeguarding national interests and removing the monopoly of the Telegram messaging app,\u201d the ayatollah\u2019s last Telegram stated, according to Iran\u2019s government-run Press TV news website.Internet experts suggest that what the Kremlin really wants is leverage to order the internet platforms to remove things that it does not like.\u201cThey want a hotline that they can pick up to call someone to do something,\u201d said Mr. Soldatov. \u201cIt is a very Soviet approach.\u201dFollow Neil MacFarquhar on Twitter: @NeilMacFarquhar.Oleg Matsnev and Sophia Kishkovsky contributed reporting in Moscow.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon Has Lots of Company as Trump Slams \u2018Stupid\u2019 Businesses", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Amazon, you\u2019re not alone.Lately, Mr. Trump\u2019s antibusiness rants have become particularly menacing and caused the stocks of some companies to plunge. His Twitter posts have carried with them the threat, sometimes explicit, that he is prepared to use the power of the presidency to undermine the companies that anger him.The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, long a booster of Republican presidents, is not happy. \u201cIt\u2019s inappropriate for government officials to use their position to attack an American company,\u201d said Neil Bradley, the executive vice president and chief policy officer of the chamber. Mr. Bradley, who did not specifically name Mr. Trump, added that criticism of companies from politicians \u201cundermines economic growth and job creation.\u201dMost presidents have clashed with business interests and industries, sometimes in ways that generated headlines. But Mr. Trump is unique in singling out individual companies for ridicule with regularity. And rarely have presidents done so because of a personal pique or grudge, as happens with Mr. Trump.\u201cThis is an unprecedented situation for companies. The president\u2019s tweets can cause significant reputational harm,\u201d said Dean C. Garfield, the president of the Information Technology Industry Council, which represents big technology companies like Amazon, Dell, Facebook, Google and IBM. \u201cWe are now at a place where about 90 percent of the companies we represent now have a presidential Twitter strategy in place.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s no laughing matter,\u201d he said.For many companies, that strategy comes down to waiting out the storm. In recent days, Amazon has all but ignored the president\u2019s taunts, which he issued in a flurry of tweets.\u201cThere\u2019s no real advantage going toe-to-toe with him,\u201d said Joe Lockhart, a press secretary for President Bill Clinton who was a spokesman for the National Football League, another favorite target of Mr. Trump. \u201cAnd his attention span is so short, he will move on. He\u2019ll find another target.\u201dLikewise, the president\u2019s interest in the AT&T merger with Time Warner largely stems from his repeated clashes with CNN, a subsidiary of Time Warner, which he regards as biased against him.As a private citizen, Mr. Trump has attacked companies, including calling several times for boycotts. The remarks served to raise his profile and fed the image of a no-holds-barred businessman who was unafraid to rebuke his rivals or his critics. But in those days, such comments had little ability to move stock prices or affect sales.As a candidate and as the president, Mr. Trump also uses his verbal assaults on companies to bolster his populist message that he is on the side of workers, not big business. (Still, Mr. Trump secured a large tax cut last year for corporate America.)Mr. Trump\u2019s most ardent supporters say they appreciate his willingness to criticize the corporate establishment.\u201cHe continues to go directly after the companies and not care about political correctness,\u201d said Terry Bowman, a former Trump campaign organizer who works at a Ford Motor parts factory in Ypsilanti, Mich. \u201cHe says things that a polished politician would never say. He says things that come directly from the American worker.\u201d\u201cThat is the height of irresponsibility,\u201d Mr. Obama said in 2009 without identifying specific companies. \u201cIt is shameful.\u201dMr. Clinton\u2019s Justice Department aggressively pushed to break up Microsoft on the grounds that it was abusing its monopoly position in personal computing to dominate the internet.President John F. Kennedy avoided naming individuals during a fight with the steel industry in 1962. He criticized \u201ca tiny handful of steel executives whose pursuit of private power and profit exceeds their sense of public responsibility.\u201dPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt on occasion assailed business executives as \u201cmalefactors of great wealth,\u201d attributing the memorable phrase to his cousin, Theodore Roosevelt. Neither president made a practice of identifying specific companies or executives.Mr. Trump has had no such reticence.\u201cA report just came out. They said $1.47, I believe, or about that for every time they deliver a package, the United States government \u2014 meaning the post office \u2014 loses $1.47,\u201d the president said.He added, ominously: \u201cSo Amazon is going to have to pay much more money to the post office. There\u2019s no doubt about that.\u201dWhen Merck\u2019s chief executive, Kenneth C. Frazier, quit a presidential business council last year in protest of some of the White House\u2019s policy positions, other members were initially reluctant to come to his defense for fear of a verbal attack by Mr. Trump.

Sapna Maheshwari, a reporter who covers advertising for The Times, discussed the tech she\u2019s using.What tech tools do you use to monitor what advertisers are doing with our data on websites, apps and gadgets?More than anything, though, I do lots of phone interviews \u2014 despite what they say about millennials and phones \u2014 and meet with brand marketers and people at ad agencies and ad technology companies to hear what they\u2019re thinking about and working on.What do you like about these tools, and what could be better?The online ad tracking services are helpful for the desktop and mobile web, but I haven\u2019t yet found an effective way to sort through the many, many ads that flow through Facebook and Instagram or across various mobile apps.How has tech changed advertising, and how much is the advertising industry looking to tech these days? Tech has transformed advertising \u2014 there are so many more ways to target and reach people now than when the industry was dominated by TV, print, radio and event sponsorships.There\u2019s also so much more data being collected about our habits by an array of companies, from big tech platforms to agencies to the advertisers themselves. Huge portions of advertising dollars in the last few years have gone to the big tech giants that we read about all the time \u2014 specifically Google and Facebook and, to a lesser extent, companies like Snap. Lately, advertisers have said they\u2019re spending more money on Amazon. So there are still more major changes afoot.Advertisers are also grappling with how to measure their ads in this new world. That\u2019s a challenge throughout the industry. Think of all the ways that people watch TV shows now. I recently watched \u2014 or, more accurately, binged \u2014 NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Good Place.\u201d I watched the first season on Netflix, where there were no ads, then saw the first eight episodes of the second season through NBC\u2019s Apple TV app, where there were lots of commercials. I watched the final few on Hulu, which might have had different ads. That type of behavior \u2014 especially since I was using my parents\u2019 cable login for the NBC app \u2014 is a new kind of challenge for the people buying, selling and measuring ads.What do you think of Google\u2019s and Facebook\u2019s power in the online ad industry?It\u2019s an enormous topic within the advertising industry, which generally refers to Google and Facebook as the \u201cduopoly.\u201d It\u2019s pretty remarkable that two of the world\u2019s most valuable companies make virtually all of their money from selling online ads and dominate more than half of the American digital ad market.Their size and influence make it essential for people to really understand how the companies\u2019 business models work and the types of information they\u2019re sharing with them every day \u2014 and what makes them such powerful advertising machines.Outside work, what tech product do you love using? And I love the Bose wireless speaker that my boyfriend gave me for Diwali. I use it to listen to podcasts and talk on the phone while cooking or cleaning. I love that the speaker gets me away from my phone, which can charge in the meantime, and that I can use it throughout my apartment. It would be nice if it just did the cooking for me, though.What\u2019s your advice for those who want to prevent their data from being tracked by advertisers?It\u2019s hard to prevent, but you can take some steps to limit it. Explore the privacy settings on your smartphone, including which apps have access to your location and microphone and whether you allow ad tracking. Delete apps that you don\u2019t use anymore.Advertisement"}

He indulges the opportunity to dip in and out of unreliable narration, but he doesn\u2019t abuse the privilege. He\u2019s good about dropping in shots of people lying unconscious or standing frozen to let us know when we\u2019re watching their minds wander.What can be distracting in \u201cLegion,\u201d though, is Mr. Hawley\u2019s seeming determination to continually top himself \u2014 to give each new setting, each new idea, its own distinct visual and conceptual identity.It makes sense: a show set inside the mind reflects the infinite variety of the mind. In practice the constant embellishment and novelty can be wearying, especially at series length. Does a comic-book scenario in which crowds of people are being rendered catatonic require a parable about the nature of delusion that includes an animated Chinese fable, gigantic eggs and a man hacking off his leg in the shower?The formal inventiveness deployed by Mr. Hawley and his crew of directors, who include the noted cinematographer Ellen Kuras (\u201cEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\u201d) and the indie filmmaker Ana Lily Amirpour (\u201cA Girl Walks Home Alone at Night\u201d), is consistently impressive. It also consistently outstrips the storytelling. It\u2019s easy, if maybe unfair, to think that all the filmmaking razzle-dazzle comes at the expense of the drama, which, when stripped down, consists of the usual series of battles and superhero clich\u00e9s about friendship, honor and the toughness of the outsider.The cast is virtually the same, with the welcome addition of Navid Negahban (the terrorist Abu Nazir from the early seasons of \u201cHomeland\u201d) as the Shadow King. Lily Rabe, excellent as usual, makes a guest appearance as Syd\u2019s mother in a \u201cRashomon\u201d-style episode that may be an indication that the show\u2019s finally starting to run out of ideas.

{"Headline": "Convict History Matters in Australia. But What Else?", "Date": "2018-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter 55______Our guides gave us clues more than conclusions. They pointed to the garden for guards\u2019 families, set up to resemble an English country estate. They told us about punishment. They shared tales of individual prisoners and the British commandants who ran the place.But it was the cemetery just off the coast that lingered in my mind.Port Arthur\u2019s upper-class overseers called it Isle of the Dead or Isle de Mort, and they were buried with headstones on the island\u2019s highest point.The convicts just called it Dead Island. Their remains landed in unmarked graves near the water so their watchmen, our guide told us, \u201ccould look down on them in death as in life.\u201dSome of the convicts probably deserved it. But walking among Port Arthur\u2019s dead, it was hard to escape the sanctimonious rigidity of the English class system, made even more extreme by the culture of 19th-century incarceration.I found myself imagining a prisoner who had arrived young, grinding out a 10-year sentence under the harsh condescension of British soldiers. He\u2019d depart with a skill \u2014 Port Arthur was basically an industrial labor camp \u2014 but how could he not also leave with a deep disgust for class distinctions and authority?Here, I thought, lie the roots of Australia\u2019s egalitarian ethos, traced back to a visceral rejection of the hierarchy that defined prison settlements like Port Arthur.This, after all, was the place for castoffs. Delinquent boys as young as 9 and troubled men with wives and children (not to mention a few meddlesome Irish and American activists) were all shipped off in former slave ships and put to work here in a country that was not easy to tame.The challenges of the land required camaraderie. The British system enforced divisions, putting a small elite above a mass of rebels and rogues. No wonder that those who stayed in Australia preferred to see themselves as \u201cmates\u201d more than gentlemen.Nick Dyrenfurth, a historian who wrote \u201cMateship: A Very Australian History,\u201d has argued that convicts were the first to embrace the concept.American culture bears a similar imprint. We like to see ourselves as revolutionaries who defeated British pomp and monarchy with guerrilla war tactics and demands for equality.But, of course, history is a forever struggle. What we choose to promote and overlook often changes, and reveals more than we may intend.Tasmania\u2019s convict past was also sidestepped for decades, with Port Arthur left in ruins before becoming what it is today: an impressive apparatus for remembering, complete with a ferry, interactive exhibit for children and well-trained guides.But seeing Port Arthur transformed raises additional questions. (The mass shooting that happened here in 1996 is a subject for another day.)His critique was not with remembering the Great War\u2019s heroes, but rather with the lack of investment in other elements of the country\u2019s past \u2014 one glaring blind spot in particular.\u201cWe could ask why \u2014 if we were actually genuine about remembering patriots who have died for this country \u2014 why would we not first spend $100 million on a museum honoring the at least 65,000 estimated Indigenous dead who so tragically lost their lives defending their country here in Australia in the frontier wars of the 1800s?\u201d he said. \u201cWhy is there nowhere in Australia telling the stories of the massacres, the dispossession and the courageous resistance of these patriots?\u201dHis full argument goes beyond questions and critique (though there are plenty of both). He also offers a path forward and a measure of hope even for those who disagree with him.And it\u2019s rooted in what I observed on Dead Island, in the way that the rigidity of one era had given birth to something more fluid, more equal and new.\u201cWe pretend that our national identity is a fixed, frozen thing,\u201d Richard said. \u201cBut Australia is a molten idea.\u201dIn other words, history matters not just because it never disappears, but also because it does not dictate. It can prompt change.The question is: How?I\u2019d love to hear about your views on that \u2014 and about your experiences with Australian history.When did you connect with the past in a way that felt real and revealing? Or when have you thought the process of remembering needed to evolve?Now for some of my favorite stories this week, and a recommendation we know you\u2019ll love.______Does the past hold too much sway for all of us, or just those who romanticize a rugged cruel occupation?__________________Time to mix it up: Here are a few things I\u2019ve been reading beyond The New York Times \u2026______\u201cA Quiet Place\u201d seems to be a local and international favorite.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Takes the Punches While Rest of Silicon Valley Ducks", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Two pages of notes sitting in a binder in front of Mark Zuckerberg during his congressional testimony this week hinted at a message the Facebook chief executive rarely got a chance to deliver: We\u2019re not the only ones.Mr. Zuckerberg was prepared to say that his company accounts for just a slice of the $650 billion advertising market and that it has plenty of competitors. Google, for example, has an online advertising business more than twice the size of Facebook\u2019s. And Google also collects vast amounts of information about the people who use its online services.But as Facebook has taken it on the chin over the way it has handled the personal information of its users, the leaders of other tech companies have demonstrated that even in publicity-hungry Silicon Valley, it is entirely possible for billionaire executives and their sprawling empires to keep a low profile.What set Mr. Zuckerberg apart? The personal information of up to 87 million Facebook users ended up in the hands of the voter-profiling firm Cambridge Analytica, which worked with the Trump campaign in the 2016 presidential election. Google and the biggest tech companies \u2014 as far as anyone knows \u2014 have never made such a giant mistake.Mr. Zuckerberg was the only executive to testify in two days of hearings this week. Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, and Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, were also asked to testify by the Senate Judiciary Committee.But when that hearing combined with one from another committee, which had not asked for Google or Twitter\u2019s participation, Mr. Pichai and Mr. Dorsey were let off the hook, said company officials and congressional aides.For now, at least.The companies have until April 25 to respond. When asked whether they were concerned about congressional or regulatory scrutiny, Google and Twitter, through company representatives, declined to comment.\u201cOutside of Facebook, there is probably no company paying more attention\u201d than Google, said Jason Kint, a frequent critic of Google and Facebook and chief executive of Digital Content Next, a trade group that represents entertainment and news organizations, including The New York Times. \u201cThey\u2019re absolutely ducking for cover while the heat is on Facebook. They don\u2019t want to try to trip any alarms.\u201dLike Facebook, Google collects vast amount of data on users \u2014 including their YouTube choices, internet searches and location history \u2014 to target advertisements. Facebook has more than two billion users globally, but Google has seven products, including YouTube, Gmail and its Android software, with more than a billion users each.On Wednesday, when Representative John Shimkus, Republican of Illinois, questioned Facebook\u2019s tracking of logged-off users, Mr. Zuckerberg was quick to point out that Google and \u201cthe rest of the industry\u201d employed similar tactics. It was one of the few times Google\u2019s data practices were mentioned in the two days of hearings.Mr. Zuckerberg did not get a chance to say much more about Facebook\u2019s industry peers this week. Over two days of hearings, Google was referenced 11 times by lawmakers. Twitter was mentioned 10 times and Amazon once. Apple was mentioned three times, mostly in passing.Google employees said they had not received explicit orders from management to keep a low profile because most already understood the risk. One employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because workers were not allowed to speak publicly on the issue, said there was an understanding inside Google that the company was the obvious next target.In a statement, Aaron Stein, a Google spokesman, said the company was \u201ccompletely focused on protecting our users\u2019 data\u201d and \u201cwill take action\u201d if it found evidence of \u201cdeceptive behavior or misuse of personal data.\u201dGoogle is staying on the sidelines in other ways. Four days before Mr. Zuckerberg was set to testify, Facebook surprised many in Washington when it endorsed the Honest Ads Act, a Senate bill that would require more transparency and stricter rules for political ads on the internet. Facebook\u2019s endorsement was a reversal from its previous opposition, said a spokeswoman for one of the bill\u2019s co-sponsors, Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia.Mr. Warner and another co-sponsor, Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, called on Twitter and Google to also back the bill. Twitter quickly responded with an endorsement. Google has not taken a public position.Similarly, Facebook and Google had donated $200,000 each to a group opposing a California ballot initiative that proposes enabling Californians to sue companies for data breaches, among other things. Facebook this week dropped its opposition to the initiative, which organizers said was on track to appear on the November ballot in California.Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s notes, which were photographed during the testimony, also contained a prepared response if lawmakers echoed criticism from Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, who has chided Facebook and other companies for collecting gobs of personal information about their users.\u201cLots of stories about apps misusing Apple data, never seen Apple notify people,\u201d said the document. \u201cImportant you hold everyone to the same standard.\u201dRepresentatives for Facebook and Apple declined to comment on Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s notes.Apple has long campaigned to draw a distinction between the way it operates and the way Facebook and Google do.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to traffic in your personal life. I think it\u2019s an invasion of privacy,\u201d Mr. Cook told MSNBC. \u201cI think everybody needs to understand Silicon Valley is not monolithic.\u201dWhen asked if it was worried about regulations for the industry stemming from new scrutiny of Facebook, Apple referred to recent comments Mr. Cook made to MSNBC. He said he typically believed \u201cthe best regulation is no regulation\u201d but \u201cI think we\u2019re beyond that here.\u201dAmazon uses shoppers\u2019 purchase history to target ads, though Forrester Research estimated its advertising revenue last year was $2.5 billion. Facebook makes $39.9 billion on ads and Google makes $95.4 billion.Amazon\u2019s top competitors for that business? Google and Apple.Many tech companies understand that Washington\u2019s renewed focus on privacy is likely to reach them soon, said Dean Garfield, head of the Information Technology Industry Council, a trade group representing the largest tech companies.\u201cThe tide has shifted,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is passing us by.\u201dNick Wingfield contributed reporting from Seattle.videoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is Amazon Bad for the Postal Service? Or Its Savior?", "Date": "2018-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 Five times in the last week, President Trump has pointed his Twitter arrows at Amazon over what he insists is a bad deal for the United States Postal Service.Mr. Trump wrote on Tuesday that the agreement, which sets what Amazon pays the Postal Service for many orders, costs American taxpayers billions of dollars. \u201cI am right about Amazon costing the United States Post Office massive amounts of money for being their Delivery Boy,\u201d he wrote.The details about the deal are not public \u2014 they are considered commercially sensitive information \u2014 but some of the available evidence suggests the opposite: that Amazon has been a boon to the Postal Service.Yet there is a bright spot \u2014 its business of package shipping, including Amazon orders, which grew to 5.7 billion packages last year from 3.3 billion in 2008. Several years ago, the Postal Service added Sunday delivery for Amazon packages.\u201cIt is one thing to demand better financial performance from the U.S.P.S., but something very different, in our view, to equate the U.S.P.S. financial struggles with the rise of Amazon,\u201d Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Baird, a stock research firm, wrote in a research report on Tuesday. \u201cIf nothing else, the U.S.P.S. was already generating billions of dollars in operating losses well before Amazon became a large customer.\u201dOf course, Amazon very much depends on the Postal Service to take their packages the last mile to their destination. By one estimate, about 40 percent of Amazon\u2019s orders are delivered by the agency, with the rest handled by U.P.S., FedEx and a hodgepodge of other carriers.Companies that do a lot of shipping, like Amazon, often negotiate deals with the Postal Service to pay less than an ordinary person would to send goods. It is essentially a discount for buying in bulk.That is where the president seems to be focused, and partly why Amazon\u2019s stock has fallen sharply in the last week. Its shares are down more than 20 points \u2014 nearly 1.5 percent \u2014 since March 28.But the Postal Service says all such deals it makes are profitable \u2014 and must be by law.An independent body, the Postal Regulatory Commission, oversees the rates that the Postal Service charges for its products. By law, the agreements it cuts with corporate customers like Amazon must cover their \u201cattributable costs\u201d that directly result from their use of the postal network.Amazon helps lower those costs by organizing the packages it takes to the Post Office by destination ZIP code in over 35 sorting centers around the country, leaving less work that must be done by postal workers. The company relies on the Postal Service strictly for last-mile delivery to customers, short trips that further limit the cost of delivering each package.But in one of his tweet attacks, Mr. Trump seemed to dispute whether Amazon was covering the Postal Service\u2019s costs, saying that \u201cit is reported that the U.S. Post Office will lose $1.50 on average for each package it delivers for Amazon.\u201dWhile the Postal Service is subject to Freedom of Information Act requests, there is an exemption in the federal law that allows it to avoid releasing particulars of its deals with private businesses like Amazon, said Kevin Kosar, vice president of policy at the R Street Institute, a nonprofit conservative-leaning think tank, who has studied the Postal Service.Amazon\u2019s silence about the details of its contract haven\u2019t helped clarify matters. Spokesmen for both the Postal Service and Amazon declined to comment for this article.A spokesman for the White House, Raj Shah, didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.Mr. Kosar said he considered it \u201cwildly unlikely\u201d that Mr. Trump has reviewed the Postal Service\u2019s contract with Amazon and that the president is \u201ckind of talking through his hat.\u201d Still, he said the Citigroup analysis of the accounting of the Postal Service\u2019s deals with companies like Amazon shouldn\u2019t be dismissed.There are four commissioners on the Postal Regulatory Commission, none of whom was nominated by Mr. Trump, with one vacancy. The nominations require Senate confirmation.Mr. Kosar said he expected rates to rise. He said the commission had indicated in regulatory filings \u2014 before the flurry of tweets by Mr. Trump \u2014 that it would consider increases in shipping prices.\u201cIt\u2019s just a question of magnitude,\u201d he said.Ron Nixon contributed reporting from Washington, D.C.Advertisement"}

He then brought \u201cNo Activity\u201d to the United States, starring in a remake for the CBS All Access streaming site that\u2019s been renewed for a second season. All this multinational creativity has taken place in the last three years. (Six-episode seasons help.)Mr. Brammall is blandly handsome and on the comfy side of fit, with a knack for playing exasperation in both comic and dramatic situations. His characters are harried, generally well-meaning upholders of the establishment, whether a policeman or a dealer outraged over an intrusion on his assigned turf. His American equivalents might include Chris Pratt and Ryan Reynolds, but he hasn\u2019t played superheroes, and any swagger his characters possess is unearned.In \u201cThe Letdown,\u201d his function is to help convey the degradation that motherhood has brought to the life of the heroine, Audrey, played by Alison Bell. (It\u2019s like a middle-class version of Showtime\u2019s \u201cSMILF.\u201d) When she parks on a quiet stretch of street hoping her baby will take a nap, Mr. Brammall\u2019s Scott descends on her in a cloud of righteous indignation, demanding that she move. Rather than risk waking up the child, Audrey of course agrees to buy some drugs.\u201cGlitch\u201d is an entirely different kind of series, a large-ensemble drama predicated on big fuzzy ideas about life, death and destiny in which the separate back stories of multiple characters are rationed out in frequent flashbacks. Mr. Brammall plays the uncalm center of the storm, the police constable James, who is called to the cemetery in the first episode because people are clawing out of their graves. One of them is James\u2019s ex-wife, who died four years before (and was the best friend of his new wife).James spends his time running in desperate circles to preserve the anonymity of the returnees and to protect them from threats that include a curious pharmaceutical corporation, mysterious assassins and an invisible, deadly barrier surrounding the town. The show\u2019s ideas outpace its execution (not unusual in Australian TV), especially in the second season. But it\u2019s not bad as cultish science-fiction curiosities go, with the intellectual suspense balancing the soap-opera mechanics of the returnees tracking down the loose ends of their previous lives.As the title implies, there\u2019s virtually no action \u2014 the show consists of the meandering, generally pointless, often smutty conversations that take place while the characters wait for something to happen. (Perhaps reflecting the enclosed spaces and immobility, there\u2019s a lot of talk about masturbation.) The primary talkers are Mr. Brammall and Darren Gilshenan as Hendy and Stokes, marginally competent detectives on an endless stakeout, constantly promised by unseen handlers that \u201csomeone big\u201d is about to show up.Mr. Brammall is, per usual, the straight man, offering futile protests in response to Stokes\u2019s winsomely idiotic and offensive riffs. The tables turn in one episode, though, when Stokes is replaced in the car by a taciturn American (played by Jake Johnson of \u201cNew Girl\u201d). Trying for sophisticated small talk, Hendy stumbles onto race as a topic, and Mr. Brammall, with crack timing, stutters out the thoughts of the Australian everyman: \u201cI know you have to be very sensitive about that thing in your country because you shoot the black \u2014 you shoot the people \u2014 you shoot people of various ethnic \u2014 all sorts.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nature Is Risky. That\u2019s Why Students Need It.", "Date": "2018-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn CampusDr. Heying is an evolutionary biologist and a former professor at Evergreen State College.Nature is unscripted and hard to predict. Having recently discovered this reality, Penn State has decided that its 98-year-old, student-led Outing Club shall no longer be allowed to go on outings. Citing the high risk of remote environments and poor cellphone service, the university is recommending that the club restrict its offerings to films and speakers. Students are being funneled into engaging only in previously vetted human constructions.Not so long ago universities took on the authority of parents, in loco parentis. Now that many modern parents have absolved themselves of the responsibility of raising mature, bold, responsible adults, it seems universities have followed suit. At Penn State, the Outing Club wasn\u2019t the only one on the chopping block \u2014 caving and scuba diving are reportedly out as well.In my 15 years as a professor at Evergreen State College, I led field trips to Panama and Ecuador that sometimes lasted months. My students and I explored archipelagos and jungles, coral reefs and colonial cities. And I experienced and heard tell of many dangerous situations.On one trip alone, in 2016, which my husband and fellow professor Bret Weinstein and I led together with 30 undergraduates (and our own two children), there were life-threatening emergencies involving a tree fall in the Amazon, a boat accident in Gal\u00e1pagos and, later, a serious earthquake in coastal Ecuador. Everyone made it home, but why take such risks? Is studying the politics of land use, the cultures of early Americans or territoriality in butterflies worth it?Over the course of several trips, I saw students rise to challenges in ways that they simply could not at home. I purposefully sought out field sites that were remote not just because nature is more interesting and intact in such places \u2014 more lianas climbing their way up to the light, more vine snakes mimicking those same lianas \u2014 but also because encountering nature in its least disturbed state often comes at the \u201ccost\u201d of having no connection to the outside world. Far from the virtual eyes that document our every move, people are revealed, to themselves and to others.In the field, I watched students descend into their own darkness, depression gripping them, and I watched as they emerged from it, stronger and more grounded. Romantic ideas of the jungle disappear with the reality of constant sweat and biting insects, and the realization that to see charismatic animals do interesting things, you have to get out there and fade into the forest, and then wait patiently for it to come back alive around you.Some hate it. They cannot abide the lack of control, the discovery that nature is not a nature documentary. Most, though, find hidden strength and unanticipated freedom.One afternoon on a tributary of the Amazon, a river with broad clay banks, a gloriously messy mud fight broke out between friends, while a few of us standing on the banks cheered them on. They were filthy and raucous and there were no books in sight. Students were exploring boundaries of all sorts, and it looked a lot like education to me.Another evening, the students tried to give research presentations under a corrugated metal roof but a squall came up, and the rain was pounding the roof so noisily that we had to reschedule. We dispersed, some taking the opportunity to catch up on sleep, some wandering off into the forest to explore the warm, wet embrace of a tropical jungle at night. If education is, in part, preparation for an unpredictable and shifting world, teaching courage and curiosity ought to be a priority.On domestic field trips in remote locations, my classes did field exercises and even, sometimes, endured lectures, but we also explored without explicit goals, cooked and shared meals, sat around campfires and told stories. In eastern Washington\u2019s scablands, high winds can make standing on mesas dangerous, and climbing up to them, through scree fields, is a challenge, too. Students unaccustomed to physical exertion, injured and on crutches, or just born-and-bred in the city and not familiar with how to navigate a slope of jagged, loose rocks, all faced the fields and took them on. On the scree fields of eastern Washington, facing an unpredictable and shifting world is a literal endeavor.One brave student from the 2016 trip was injured in the boat accident in the Gal\u00e1pagos. The boat was destroyed, but she soldiered on. Then, three weeks later, she was nearly crushed when the five-story unreinforced masonry hotel she was staying in collapsed during a major earthquake. She was lucky: Almost everyone in the building died. She and another student dug themselves out of the rubble.Her recovery was long and painful. She \u2014 a serious ballet dancer \u2014 was wheelchair-bound for months. After a year of surgeries, crutches and other frustrations, she caught me off guard. Despite everything, she said, she would do it all again. The trip had been that important to her.In advance of these study-abroad trips, I led long conversations about risk, how to assess it, what we perceive our own relationship with it to be. We discussed how risk is different in landscapes that haven\u2019t been rendered safe by liability lawsuits and in which medical help is a very long way away. We talked about the hidden hazards of the jungle \u2014 rising water, tree falls \u2014 compared with the familiar ones, like snakes and big cats, that people are primed to be scared of. In the tropical lowland rain forest \u2014 the jungle \u2014 you might get stuck in deep mud and perhaps need help to get out. Look before you reach for a tree for leverage. Some trees defend themselves with nasty spikes, and a branch might be crawling with bullet ants, so named for the intense experience of being stung by one.But it turns out that risk and potential go hand in hand. We need to let children, including college students, risk getting hurt. Protection from pain guarantees weakness, fragility and greater suffering in the future. The discomfort may be physical, emotional or intellectual \u2014 My ankle! My feelings! My worldview! \u2014 and all need to be experienced to learn and grow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Should Consider a \u2018Why Me?\u2019 Button", "Date": "2018-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBook\u201cOne of our biggest responsibilities is to protect data.\u201dOver the past year, the downside of social media companies \u2014 Facebook foremost among them \u2014 has become glaringly apparent. They have been platforms for information campaigns that influenced elections and endangered lives. They have failed to keep users\u2019 personal information private. And the carefully targeted ads that appear on them can be, well, creepy.It is not clear that Facebook will be able to stave off regulators, but Mr. Zuckerberg and his colleagues might want to consider this: a \u201cWhy Me?\u201d button. (Google, Amazon and others might want to take note, too.)Facebook suffers from a lack of trust because of the asymmetrical nature of the relationship users have with it. We provide it all sorts of information. But we have no idea how the information is being used, how our data is being harvested, how that data is being commingled and cross-referenced with other data sets and ultimately sold to advertisers. (Facebook already has a button, relatively buried in a list of other items, that it calls \u201cWhy Am I Seeing This Ad?\u201d It is, to some degree, a crippled version of what I\u2019m suggesting should be introduced on all of Facebook\u2019s properties.)To his credit, Mr. Zuckerberg does appear to recognize the problem that his company faces over privacy concerns. After acknowledging that protecting users\u2019 data is one of the company\u2019s biggest responsibilities, he went on to say, \u201cIf you think about what our services are, at their most basic level, you put some content into a service, whether it\u2019s a photo or a video or a text message \u2014 whether it\u2019s Facebook or WhatsApp or Instagram \u2014 and you\u2019re trusting that that content is going to be shared with the people you want to share it with.\u201dThat\u2019s where the \u201cWhy Me?\u201d button could help. This button would sit next to every advertisement and piece of content that appears before you on all of Facebook\u2019s properties, including Instagram and WhatsApp.If you saw an ad or an article pop up on your screen, you could click the \u201cWhy Me?\u201d button. Then you would see a full explanation of why that item was pushed to you.The \u201cWhy Me?\u201d explanation would not just include the name of the advertiser, but what keywords, demographics or other information the advertiser specifically targeted. It would also offer a full rundown of how your information fit into the parameters of the advertiser\u2019s request and where that information came from.Maybe Facebook saw that you had clicked on a pair of sneakers on a different service that shares information with Facebook. The \u201cWhy Me?\u201d section would show you when and where that information was collected. Did Facebook notice you searched for a new cellphone plan? Facebook would tell how it knew that, too.Did Facebook use artificial intelligence to find your face in an image without you or anyone else labeling it? The \u201cWhy Me?\u201d section would show you the images that the artificial intelligence system cross-referenced to identify you. Did Facebook scrape another site or buy information about you that it commingled with the data that you had provided? It would tell you that, too.Most important, at every point in the \u201cexplanation tree,\u201d the user would have the option to turn off or disable that specific piece of data. Facebook, of course, could \u2014 and probably should \u2014 explain the trade-offs of such decisions.The \u201cWhy Me?\u201d button could also be extended to content. When a friend or company shares a post, Facebook doesn\u2019t just display it to everyone listed as the poster\u2019s friend or follower. Facebook\u2019s algorithms choose which friends and followers see it based on all sorts of parameters, usually related to the kind of content or how you\u2019ve interacted with the friend in the past.The \u201cWhy Me?\u201d button should explain all the data points that are used in the calculation and how they are weighted.The current \u201cWhy Am I Seeing This Ad?\u201d often says something like: \u201cCompany A wants to reach people ages 18 and older who live or were recently in the United States. This is information based on your Facebook profile and where you\u2019ve connected to the internet.\u201dBut it hardly tells you the whole story. Facebook doesn\u2019t say so explicitly, but it allows companies to upload their own databases, cross-reference them with Facebook\u2019s data and use that information to serve ads to users. It also doesn\u2019t say how that other site originally got that information about who you are.In fairness, the \u201cWhy Me?\u201d button might create all sorts of problems for Facebook, and its advertisers, too. It would allow users \u2014 and rivals \u2014 to reverse engineer much of the way the system works. And advertisers would probably object to the idea of making their targeting plans public. But that would be the cost of using such large public platforms with such exact targeting.It has become something of a clich\u00e9, but in 1913, before he became a Supreme Court justice, Louis D. Brandeis said, \u201cSunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.\u201dIt could well be applied today at Facebook \u2014 and its peer companies \u2014 if it wants to avoid a governmental crackdown.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The New Power Structure", "Date": "2018-04-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistOnce upon a time, power was held in the hands of a small elite. This elite occupied the commanding heights of society and controlled big, top-down organizations. It dropped products and messages from on high, and the rest of us passively consumed them.Then along came the internet. Suddenly, information was dispersed across self-organizing, open-source networks of citizens who had the ability to collaborate, share and shape their world. Hierarchies were smashed, the wisdom of crowd was applied and transparency reigned.O.K. That didn\u2019t really happen. The first dreams of the tech revolution didn\u2019t come true. Sometimes it seems power was just redistributed from one set of massive organizations to others \u2014 Amazon, Facebook, Spotify.But something has changed. We have seen an explosion of new social organisms that don\u2019t look like the old ones: Airbnb, Etsy, Black Lives Matter, #MeToo, Blockchain. If power in the Greatest Generation looked like Organization Men running big institutions, and power for the boomers looked like mass movements organized by charismatic leaders like Steve Jobs and Barack Obama, power these days looks like decentralized networks in which everyone is a leader and there\u2019s no dominating idol.Timms thought that after the consumerism of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, there should be a day to give back. The normal thing would have been to put the 92nd Street Y logo on the effort and organize charities and other organizations around a consortium. Instead, he and his team established the meme Giving Tuesday, created a web page and some tools for people who wanted to organize, and they let the crowd take over.There are now Giving Tuesday or Giving something organizations in over 100 countries. Local organizers talk directly to one another and reshape the movement as they wish.Even more than technology, what\u2019s changed is people\u2019s attitudes toward authority. They don\u2019t trust it. They want to see people who look like them running things. Any movement that earns legitimacy has to spread ownership around. The Ikea effect applies: People value what they helped build.Many organizations profiled in \u201cNew Power\u201d are decentralized but have wrestled with the challenges of decentralization, like: How do you establish unity of purpose amid the cacophony of voices? How do you maintain standards of excellence amid the democratization of control? How do you get loosely affiliated people to commit long term, so your movement won\u2019t fizzle out, the way the Ice Bucket Challenge did?Heimans and Timms emphasize that the best organizations try to blend old and new power structures.These organizations are often founded by what you might call disappearing organizers. Somebody comes up with a compelling concept, like TED or Black Lives Matter. The concept gives people a sticky group identity; many people think of themselves as Tedsters. The core idea is spreadable, actionable and connected \u2014 it allows participants to subcreate in local and flexible ways. Tedsters organize and attend over 20,000 local TEDx events. The founder doesn\u2019t dominate the network so much as manage the community.Successful movements create what Marilynn Brewer calls \u201coptimal distinctiveness\u201d \u2014 as Heimans and Timms put it, \u201cmaking people feel like they are part of it and that they can stand out in it.\u201dThe concepts binding these movements are clear, emotional and concrete and have an implied communal narrative (MeToo). But the successful organizations also feature some structural innovation. They tend to have very low barriers to entry \u2014 no dues, no loyalty pledge up front. But they have ways to incentivize members up the participation ladder, offering premiums for super-participants who adapt, organize and share. The Lego company sets up special events and an ambassador network for its highly dedicated AFOLs (Adult Fans of Lego).At the Dutch news organization De Correspondent, journalists share story ideas with subscribers before they write them, so they can harvest community knowledge. Heimans and Timms point out that Donald Trump also blends old and new power. He may talk like an authoritarian \u2014 only I can fix this \u2014 but his actual campaign structure was a loose network of self-organizing activists. Trump is what they call a \u201cplatform strongman\u201d \u2014 someone who marshals dispersed participants on behalf of centralizing ends.The last few decades have been a social trust apocalypse. The only remaining bonds of trust are local and particular. But people are ingenious. They are figuring out how to build on those ties to weave and redeem the broader social fabric.I realize my column these days is bipolar, wildly optimistic or pessimistic. But I guess that\u2019s appropriate, since the forces tearing society apart are powerful and the people bringing it together are, too.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "G.E. Makes a Sharp \u2018Pivot\u2019 on Digital", "Date": "2018-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLast November, Mr. Flannery told investors that expenses at GE Digital would be cut this year by more than 25 percent, or about $400 million. While he insisted the digital initiatives at G.E. are \u201cvery key\u201d to the company, he added, \u201cwe want a much more focused strategy.\u201dBut the rethinking of GE Digital, with its future still under review by Mr. Flannery, points to the difficulty of producing modern software for industrial businesses as they adopt digital technology.No one disputes the overarching vision of the so-called industrial internet of things \u2014 which includes low-cost sensors and a flood of data and clever software that should deliver insights to cut costs, conserve fuel and design better products, faster. But the company greatly underestimated the challenges of creating all the software needed to achieve that grand vision, said analysts and former G.E. managers.G.E.\u2019s technical prowess, they said, lies in designing and manufacturing big machines like power-plant turbines, jet engines and medical-imaging equipment. Its traditional software skills have been in the specialized programs that control the machines and factory operations. GE Digital was a striking departure into cloud-based internet software, data analytics and artificial intelligence tools like machine learning.\u201cG.E. reached too far outside its expertise and too fast,\u201d said Steven Winoker, an analyst at UBS. \u201cAnd it became a financial black hole.\u201dG.E.\u2019s digital effort dates to 2011, when Mr. Immelt recruited William Ruh, an executive at Cisco Systems. Later that year, the company set up a center in San Ramon, Calif., east of San Francisco. At the time, Mr. Ruh announced big plans to hire as many as 400 software engineers to write code for the industrial internet.The San Ramon work force swelled sharply to 1,400 in the summer of 2016, and to a peak of 2,000 last summer \u2014 before coming down to about 1,800, after a round of cuts earlier this year.During the buildup, G.E. recruited veteran software managers who had worked at leading tech companies, including Google, Microsoft and Apple. With the cuts at GE Digital and its narrowed focus, some of them have departed.The product plan later broadened to include a cloud-based software platform for handling all kinds of sensor and machine data, and secure communications from the factory floor to data centers. G.E. even built its own data centers.The software platform under development was often referred to as an operating system for the industrial internet. When the product concept expanded, so did the Predix brand.Today, according to former G.E. engineers, Predix has been pared back to mainly a set of software tools to help write applications rather than being connected to layers of code for automating data analysis.The priority at GE Digital is now on selling products for specific industrial applications, sold as offerings in the \u201cPredix portfolio,\u201d and tailored for G.E.\u2019s roster of existing industrial customers. Less emphasis is being put on all-purpose software for the wider industrial world.In an interview, Mr. Ruh described the change at GE Digital as \u201ca pivot\u201d rather than a retreat. \u201cWe\u2019re still 1,000 percent behind our Predix portfolio,\u201d he said.The current strategy, Mr. Ruh said, \u201cis about industrial apps\u201d like those. It is a measured, step-by-step approach but one, Mr. Ruh said, that capitalizes on G.E.\u2019s strengths \u2014 its industry knowledge and deep customer relationships \u2014 and is lifting sales.GE Digital remains a large player in an increasingly crowded field of companies offering industrial internet software of various kinds, in different market niches. The entrants include the big cloud suppliers like Amazon, Microsoft and Google; major business software companies like Oracle, SAP, IBM and SAS Institute; G.E.\u2019s industrial peers such as Siemens, Honeywell and ABB; and start-ups like C3 IoT, Uptake and FogHorn Systems.The opportunity for G.E., analysts said, centers on its longstanding relationships with customers and selling to them. And so far, only 8 percent of its industrial customers are using Predix portfolio products, the company said.The New York Power Authority, the nation\u2019s largest state-owned utility, is one of them. The utility is working with GE Digital to build apps that improve the efficiency of its power generation and distribution network. In pilot projects, the partnership has saved or avoided $3 million in costs, said Gil Quiniones, chief executive of the state power authority. The goal is $500 million in savings over the next decade.But for a technology project to help its customers reduce energy consumption, the state authority went with a start-up, C3 IoT.Brian Hurst, chief analytics officer at Exelon Utilities, a large electric utility corporation based in Chicago, is also working on early-stage projects with GE Digital. Mr. Hurst said the progress was encouraging and he saw no evidence that the cuts at GE Digital had affected their joint work.But it is something he is watching closely. \u201cThe technology is moving so fast,\u201d Mr. Hurst said. \u201cToday\u2019s players may not be tomorrow\u2019s players.\u201dGE Digital, Mr. Ruh insisted, is building a business for the long term. Revenue from the Predix portfolio products reached $550 million last year, he said, and sales are growing rapidly. GE Digital\u2019s total revenue of $4 billion also includes all of G.E.\u2019s traditional industrial software, and the unit\u2019s global work force is more than 4,000.\u201cOur approach is heads-down,\u201d Mr. Ruh said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to show you success.\u201dFor his part, Mr. Flannery has consistently declared his support for G.E.\u2019s digital-industrial vision \u2014 but that does not guarantee the future for GE Digital. Mr. Flannery is selling off businesses to streamline the company. The lighting and railway locomotive divisions are up for sale, and others could follow.A smaller G.E. might not need a stand-alone digital unit. Some analysts recommend putting all the software in the industrial divisions, like power and aviation, closer to customers.\u201cSan Ramon shouldn\u2019t exist,\u201d said Scott Davis, chief executive of Melius Research, an independent financial analysis firm.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Amazon\u2019s New Headquarters Could Mean for Rents", "Date": "2018-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWinning the contest could mean a steeper increase in local housing costs over the next decade, a study finds. Nashville is already contemplating the impact.To some locals, Amazon represented something else: more people, more traffic and, most of all, higher rents in a city where a rising share of residents were already struggling to afford a place to live.Other cities could also see big increases if Amazon picks them. Monthly rents in Boston and Los Angeles could jump by even larger amounts in dollar terms \u2014 albeit from a higher starting point \u2014 reflecting a shortfall in rental housing construction. Denver \u2014 like Nashville, a midsize city that has seen brisk population growth in recent years \u2014 could see its already rapid rate of rent increases hit nearly 6 percent per year, triple the overall rate of inflation.Some potential locations would be less severely affected. Atlanta and Chicago, big cities that have made it relatively easy to build new housing in recent decades, would see only a small rent increase if they won the Amazon project. And Indianapolis, where population growth has been slow and housing is plentiful, would see no effect on its rents at all, according to Zillow\u2019s model. Even in those cities, however, neighborhoods near the Amazon campus would most likely see significant rent increases. (The study did not look at the effect on prices of owner-occupied homes.)Zillow cautions that its estimates are rough, based on a simple model that looks at how rents in each city have responded to past influxes of workers. If the cities respond differently to Amazon\u2019s arrival \u2014 for example, by building more housing \u2014 the impact on rents could be smaller than Zillow\u2019s model estimates. But there are also reasons to think Zillow\u2019s analysis could understate Amazon\u2019s potential impact. The model looks only at the effect of the jobs that the new campus is expected to create directly. If Amazon\u2019s presence draws other businesses to the area, rents could rise even faster.That\u2019s what has happened in Seattle, where a mini-Silicon Valley has sprung up around Amazon\u2019s downtown campus. Facebook, Google and other internet giants have opened satellite offices nearby, and start-ups \u2014 including Zillow itself \u2014 have their headquarters there. \u201cWhat\u2019s so important is once a city is selected that they start to get ahead of the curve,\u201d Mr. Terrazas said.In Nashville, the debate over HQ2 has gotten caught up in a broader discussion of gentrification, race and the consequences of growth. Residents long described Nashville as a small town disguised as a big city. But over the last decade, the city\u2019s tourism industry has taken off, and some of those tourists liked Nashville enough to stay. For years, the Nashville metropolitan area grew by more than 100 residents per day, with many of them moving into newly built downtown apartment complexes.\u201cIf we\u2019re only addressing housing, then I don\u2019t think we\u2019re getting to the root of the issue,\u201d Ms. Harris said. \u201cWage growth is critical in this conversation.\u201d\u201cWe welcome technology, we welcome great jobs to the city, and I think people would even welcome Amazon, but it would have to be a trade-off there,\u201d Mr. Bedne said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to sign a suicide pact.\u201dAmazon, Ms. Schuetz added, should also take housing costs, traffic congestion and related issues into account. After all, she said, Amazon won\u2019t benefit if its workers can\u2019t find places to live, or if they are viewed by existing residents as a hostile force.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long-term relationship,\u201d Ms. Schuetz said. \u201cTo retain good workers over the long haul, you should care about what housing costs could be.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Harper\u2019s Editor Insists He Was Fired Over Katie Roiphe Essay", "Date": "2018-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJames Marcus wants the world to know that he was fired from his job as the editor of Harper\u2019s Magazine. He is not stepping down voluntarily to work on a book, which he said was the face-saving \u201cofficial narrative\u201d offered to him by John R. MacArthur, the magazine\u2019s longtime president and publisher. He also said that he had refused to accept a severance payment that was contingent on his signing a non-disparagement agreement.\u201cI was fired over a principled stand that I took and I am in no way ashamed of it,\u201d Mr. Marcus said on Wednesday in a phone interview.Within the magazine, there were conflicting versions of what led to Mr. Marcus\u2019s departure. In strong terms, Giulia Melucci, the vice president of public relations at Harper\u2019s, disputed the editor\u2019s version of events.\u201cAll we can say is that the notion that he was fired because of the Katie Roiphe story has little in common with reality,\u201d she said in an emailed statement. \u201cThat is one small part of a larger and more complicated story. We wish James Marcus all the best.\u201dTold of Ms. Melucci\u2019s remarks, Mr. Marcus said that she \u201cwas not present at my firing.\u201d He added that \u201cthe bulk of the conversation\u201d he had with Mr. MacArthur, which took place last Friday afternoon, \u201cwas about Katie Roiphe\u2019s piece.\u201dHarper\u2019s is a nonprofit publication supported in large part by a foundation established by Mr. MacArthur, who is known as Rick, and his father, J. Roderick MacArthur. That structure provides some financial stability but also allows the younger MacArthur to wield more control over the publication, which was on the verge of folding before he helped rescue it in 1980.\u201cHe\u2019s looking for a doormat at this point,\u201d Mr. Marcus said of Mr. MacArthur.Ms. Roiphe\u2019s essay had a similarly troubled pre-publication history inside the Manhattan offices of Harper\u2019s. The idea began, Mr. Marcus said, with the publisher, who suggested that the magazine \u201crun a contrarian piece on #MeToo movement.\u201d The editor countered that he was uncomfortable with such an assignment, because of the magazine\u2019s \u201clongtime reputation as a gentleman\u2019s smoking club.\u201d\u201cI expressed my opposition in the beginning, but I was overruled by the publisher,\u201d Mr. Marcus said. \u201cIt\u2019s the publisher\u2019s prerogative to essentially assign a piece.\u201dMr. Marcus said that the magazine approached \u201cone or two\u201d writers, who passed on the idea, before Ms. Melucci, the Harper\u2019s publicist, reached out to Ms. Roiphe. He added, \u201cWe can quibble over who technically assigned the piece. She\u2019s a publicist and doesn\u2019t have the power to assign anything. You could say she assigned it with Rick\u2019s permission. She had no role in the editing of the piece.\u201dMs. Melucci suggested that she got involved in the editorial process only because of unusual circumstances at the magazine. \u201cMaybe think about the fact that the publicist had to assign stories because the editor didn\u2019t have ideas?\u201d she said in a phone interview. \u201cI don\u2019t know \u2014 maybe that\u2019s how bad it was.\u201dMr. Marcus disagreed with that, saying that during the discussion last week that ended with his firing, \u201cthere was no complaint about my failure to generate story ideas.\u201d\u201cThe editorial process was breaking down,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s Rick\u2019s magazine, but usually the publisher does not intercede during the editing process. The piece was widely disliked by the entire staff, but I want to stress that they worked with absolute professionalism on it, whatever they thought of it.\u201dMs. Melucci said that she did not understand Mr. Marcus\u2019s objection to the essay. \u201cI don\u2019t know why,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe because it was a good story? It was the most successful story we\u2019ve had in a couple years. He may have been against it, but it was good for the magazine.\u201dIn addition to discussing the Roiphe article last Friday afternoon, Mr. Marcus said that Mr. MacArthur, the publisher, had expressed his disappointment that Harper\u2019s had not been reaching more readers. The magazine\u2019s circulation, now at 120,000, has been in decline for years. Mr. Marcus said that the publisher\u2019s resistance to bolstering the website and expanding readership engagement by hosting events impeded opportunities for growth.Ms. Melucci said that Mr. MacArthur had no comment for this article. She also declined to comment on whether the magazine had interviewed prospective editors. Ms. Rosenbush, listed as editor at large on the Harper\u2019s masthead, will oversee the publication on an interim basis, Ms. Melucci said.Mr. Marcus described being fired as \u201cpainful,\u201d but said he still had respect for Harper\u2019s.\u201cI think it\u2019s still a magnificent publication,\u201d Mr. Marcus said. \u201cI share Rick\u2019s pride in what he has accomplished there, but I think the anxiety and increasing sense that he needs to grab the reins editorially are going to make it hard for anybody who stands in that job. Whoever that poor sod is, I wish him or her good luck.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Neither the character nor the show makes apologies for being old school. \u201cBosch\u201d isn\u2019t the best or most original series, but it\u2019s honest and reliable, like Bosch. It plays fair with the viewer, and among fans of its genre, it has a rabid following.But the soul of the series is procedural crime-solving, and that\u2019s more than ever the case in the new season, which focuses on the murder of an African-American lawyer who was about to go to court with a brutality case against the Los Angeles Police Department.Bosch and his team spend their time doing phone dumps, poring through financial records, searching homes and offices and then searching them again, and endlessly, fruitlessly tailing suspects through the Southern California streets and strip malls. They do it all on camera, and they complain about it. A lot.Anchoring it all is the deliberate, heavy quietude of Titus Welliver\u2019s performance as Bosch, communicating untold skepticism and disdain through an arched eyebrow or a downturned lip. Mr. Welliver can suggest an entire personality in the way he stares at a whiteboard or silently chooses which chair to sit in, and the show has matched him with other nonhistrionic actors like Jamie Hector (as his partner), Sarah Clarke (his former wife) and Madison Lintz (his daughter).The unhurried pace of \u201cBosch\u201d can sometimes slow to a crawl, the writing can be workmanlike and the secondary story lines involving Bosch\u2019s family or Los Angeles politics can be thin. But when it errs, it errs on the side of literalness rather than falseness, of plainness rather than pretension. The show doesn\u2019t require patience so much as relaxation. Surrender to its hard-boiled charms, and it will treat you right.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Humble Potato Is Exalted in the Mountains of Peru", "Date": "2018-04-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChahuaytire, Peru \u2014 Gumercinda Quispe is a descendant of Peruvian Incas and here, high in the Andes, more than 12,500 feet above sea level, she has prepared a nourishing, spicy potato soup, quacha chu\u00f1o.She has made it with both fresh potatoes and chu\u00f1o, the dried, hard white potatoes that are still prepared just a stone\u2019s throw away. The ancient preservation process includes soaking them in an icy stream, stomping them by foot to remove the skins and drying them in the sun.I love potatoes. They are not a staple in my native India, as they are in Peru. In India, they are a beloved, cheap treat. Cooked in thousands of different ways, almost always creatively burnished with selective spoonfuls from a treasure chest of seasonings and spices, potatoes are served in every town and village at mealtimes and as chutney-augmented street snacks. I wanted to learn more about potatoes here in the land of their birth.In the little mountain village of Chahuaytire near the town of Pisac in southern Peru, Ms. Quispe and I sat down at a table close to the warm, sooty hearth in the rustic restaurant where she works. The sun was shining bright outside, and the sky was a clear, cold blue.\u201cPut some sauce in the soup and drink from the bowl,\u201d she said, motioning to the verdant uchucuta sauce she had prepared. \u201cUchu\u201d means \u201cchiles\u201d in the Quechua language of the Incas, and \u201ccuta\u201d means \u201cground.\u201dThe sauce, a mouth-smackingly good fresh chutney to this Indian, is not just hot from one of the dozens of chiles native to Peru, but sour from limes that came with the Spaniards, and deeply aromatic from huacatay and other wild herbs that grow in the mountains.There was a time when Incas used only wild Peruvian herbs, but today, after centuries of Spanish influence, they go to the market and buy an asnapa, a bouquet of herbs that could include the New World huacatay but also gifts from the Old World like cilantro, mint, oregano, parsley and tarragon.Potatoes come in every texture and color. You can see them in the markets: reds, blues, purples, yellows and pinks, sometimes ringed with two colors when sliced open. The texture of some varieties can be changed by putting them out in the sun for a few days before cooking them. This turns them softer and silkier.Some are shaped like a puma\u2019s paw; others, an alpaca\u2019s nose or a cat\u2019s claw. Native to the Andes in Peru and northwest Bolivia, potatoes were domesticated more than 10,000 years ago. And yet new varieties are being discovered all the time.Potato banks \u2014 like the one in the Pisac region of the Andes that stores seeds in a climate-controlled vault for 1,300 varieties of potatoes \u2014 are always searching for new varieties, as are dozens of creative Peruvian chefs on the lookout for wild and unusual indigenous ingredients.Freeze-drying the potato for chu\u00f1o was just one method used to increase its life after harvest. Running or walking was the chief mode of transportation for most ancient Andean peoples (certainly the Incas); they could easily carry dried potatoes with them and make a quick stew with local herbs, chiles and water from a mountain stream whenever hunger called.Dried potatoes in Peru come in many forms. They can look like pebbles \u2014 hard and smooth, in white or purple. They can look like large gravel, with different colors. But they can also be soft, tasting and smelling as funky as fermented bean curd or ripe cheese. Each has a different flavor and texture.The Inca guide who traveled with me through the Andes still hikes carrying dried potatoes (sometimes in a powdered form) and llama jerky, essential ingredients for a soup he considers a part of his cultural inheritance.Potatoes were given superb treatment wherever I traveled. At the Sumaq Hotel in the town of Aguas Calientes, there was pastel de papa, a meltingly soft potato cake with layers of thin-sliced potato, bacon and cheese.Papa a la Huancaina, which originated in the town of Huancayo in the central highlands and is considered by many to be Peru\u2019s national dish, was everywhere, including the cafeteria at Machu Picchu. Boiled, sliced potatoes and boiled, sliced eggs were placed on top of lettuce leaves with some olives strewn about, and dressed with a Huancaina sauce that brought the dish together. Its main ingredient was the long, aromatic orange chile, aji amarillo.Perhaps my favorite dish of all was causa. Like lasagnas, causas are layered terrinelike dishes, generally served cold, though room temperature can also work for some of them.Instead of pasta, potatoes \u2014 mashed and seasoned with an aji amarillo paste, lime juice, olive oil and salt \u2014 are the most important element in a causa. They can provide one, two or even three of the layers in the dish. The other in-between layers could include seafood salad, vegetable salad, chicken salad or, as in the Amazon region, pork-and-onion salad made with the addition of the fiery, round charapita chile.Whichever way it is served, causa is always soothing \u2014 and refreshingly delicious. For the hotter regions of Peru, it is just as cooling and satisfying as that warming soup is in the Andean mountains.Advertisement"}

(They involve a stepfather played by Ed Asner.)\u201cIt\u2019s a karate opera,\u201d Mr. Schlossberg said. \u201cThere\u2019s a fun sort of Hatfields and McCoys vibe.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nice to be a big fish in a small pond,\u201d Mr. Hurwitz said, \u201cwhen the small pond is Google.\u201d\u201cThat kick to the head sent them on two different trajectories,\u201d Mr. Hurwitz said. \u201cDaniel on the upswing, and Johnny in the downward spiral that\u2019s been going for the last 30 years.\u201d\u201cThe good news is now I\u2019m sitting on the sidelines \u2014 I\u2019m not getting my ass kicked,\u201d Mr. Macchio said. \u201cAt 56, no matter how much hair and makeup help me, everything hurts more in the morning.\u201dEven off camera, both he and Mr. Zabka, 52, are remarkably well-preserved. This is key to maintaining the possibility that the story\u2019s old guys might actually fight, too \u2014 the will-they-or-won\u2019t-they of this particular sitcom. (\u201cMy kicks are still high,\u201d Mr. Zabka warned, grinning. \u201cNo mercy.\u201d)But neither was interested putting on a karate gi for a broad, nostalgic spoof. In separate interviews, the actors struck similar notes of protectiveness about the \u201cKarate Kid\u201d legacy, about how important it was for \u201cCobra Kai\u201d to spin the story forward and include some of the film\u2019s heart along with the clever callbacks, fan Easter eggs and \u201chumor that comes from the fact that these two guys have not moved past it,\u201d Mr. Macchio said.The actors long ago made peace with the fact that as far as the rest of the world is concerned, they\u2019ll never entirely move past \u201cThe Karate Kid.\u201dMr. Macchio had other indelible roles in movies like \u201cThe Outsiders,\u201d \u201cCrossroads\u201d and \u201cMy Cousin Vinny,\u201d and he has starred on Broadway. But he knows that any time he attends a sporting event, the arena will put him on the Jumbotron and play \u201cYou\u2019re the Best\u201d at some point.\u201cFor so long, I still felt that kick,\u201d he said.Kept mostly apart during filming, Mr. Macchio and Mr. Zabka never really became friends until later, on the fan convention circuit. But while it\u2019s an odd thing, being randomly but inextricably linked to another person for your entire adult life, there\u2019s something transporting about it, too.Mr. Macchio, for one, was stunned at how quickly the old fire came back once the actors finally faced off for the first time during filming for \u201cCobra Kai.\u201d\u201cIt just had all that tension \u2014 you look into his eyes, and he\u2019s looking at mine,\u201d he said. \u201cThe eyelids had a couple more wrinkles, but it felt like yesterday.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Or that these services have created millions of jobs, new business ecosystems and helped fuel the rise of the digital economy that brings broad societal benefit.But it is important not to forget the learning of lessons and the hoped-for change.

This basic trade-off, of privacy for convenience, has been fundamental to the operation of social media sites over the last decade.The loss of user data to Cambridge Analytica is obviously an issue. But the bigger issue is the loss of countless hours to Facebook and other social media outlets. Compounding that issue is how screens affect our interactions with others and how social media influences our understanding and awareness of the world around us.Facebook\u2019s data breach without user consent should be a catalyst inspiring examination of our connection to screens and how screen time affects news consumption, time management and intimate relationships.To the Editor:I agree that we need better privacy rules.

{"Headline": "Walmart, With Billions to Spend, Seeks Flipkart E-Commerce Site in India", "Date": "2018-04-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWalmart is nearing a deal to acquire a majority stake in India\u2019s leading online retailer, a bold move that would open another front in its escalating war with Amazon.The Indian company, Flipkart, is a start-up that sells everything from clothing to smartphones in the country\u2019s blossoming e-commerce market.The two sides are in advanced discussions, and a deal could be announced soon, according to three people briefed on the matter. Exact terms are not yet final, and the talks are fluid, said these people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the negotiations were continuing.Two of the people said that the deal would value Flipkart at about $20 billion and that Walmart was looking to acquire a stake of at least 60 percent.The deal would be an aggressive and, some analysts say, risky foray by Walmart into one of the world\u2019s last great open markets for online retailing. Although India has a significant middle class, most of the nation\u2019s enormous population is still far too poor to afford much more than basic necessities. Flipkart has posted billions of dollars in losses while trying to build its business.Still, Walmart missed out on China\u2019s e-commerce boom, and it does not want to make the same mistake with India \u2014 especially with its rival Amazon already a strong player there. Only about 2 percent of India\u2019s retail sales are online now, but tens of millions of Indians are getting onto the internet every year via cheap smartphones and rock-bottom mobile data prices.Amazon has committed at least $5.5 billion so far to building its India presence, fighting to gain market share among the country\u2019s young, increasingly tech-savvy shoppers. After starting an Indian site, Amazon.in, from scratch in 2013, Amazon blew past local players like Snapdeal and is now a close No. 2 to Flipkart in sales.Based in Bangalore, Flipkart was founded in 2007 by Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal. The two men, who are not related, worked briefly at Amazon\u2019s back-office operations in India before deciding to form their own company.Like Amazon, Flipkart initially started selling books online before expanding into a vast array of products. On its way to becoming India\u2019s top online retailer, it successfully navigated problems such as customers\u2019 preference for paying in cash and the country\u2019s spotty roads and delivery networks.While Walmart operates stores around the globe, India would be a relatively new frontier for the huge retailer. The company operates wholesale stores in India, but it has no public-facing retail or e-commerce presence.Flipkart would be one of Walmart\u2019s largest acquisitions since it acquired Asda, a large British grocery chain, in 1999. That deal would be valued at about $16 billion today, adjusted for inflation.Analysts point out that Walmart has made very few large acquisitions in its 56-year history and that some of those deals remain works in progress.Acquiring Flipkart would give Walmart an instant leg up on Amazon in India, but it is still likely to face stiff competition from its primary rival. Amazon\u2019s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, views India as his chance to make up for the company\u2019s failure to establish a major presence in China, just like Walmart. That likely means the online giant will double down on its investment there now that Walmart has come onto the scene.\u201cI don\u2019t think they should do it,\u201d Scott Mushkin, a retail analyst at Wolfe Research, said of Walmart\u2019s potential deal for Flipkart. \u201cAmazon is like an A.T.M. machine. I wouldn\u2019t want to be competing with Amazon in India.\u201dIn addition to pouring billions into its Indian e-commerce site, Amazon is also investing in original content from Bollywood movie studios and has developed local versions of crucial products, such as its Prime video streaming and Echo voice-activated speakers.Amazon\u2019s assault was so intense that a couple of years ago, some analysts were predicting that Flipkart would be crushed. Complicating matters, Flipkart was racked by management turmoil.But Tiger Global, one of Flipkart\u2019s earliest and largest investors, pushed for the appointment of one of its own executives, Kalyan Krishnamurthy, as chief executive in January 2017. Mr. Krishnamurthy is credited with steadying the company and improving the customer experience.SoftBank, a Japanese investment firm that has been making large bets in India over the last few years, also agreed to provide $2.5 billion in fresh capital last summer.Walmart would bring an even larger potential source of funding to Flipkart as it tries to keep growing.\u201cFor the ecosystem, this is good,\u201d said Satish Meena, a senior analyst in New Delhi for Forrester, a technology research firm. \u201cThere is more money and more expertise coming into the system. And customers will get more products at a lower price.\u201dThe e-commerce market in India, which includes categories like travel, was about $38.5 billion last year, and it is expected to grow to $50 billion in 2018, according to a recent study by Deloitte and the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India.\u201cThe whole game now is scale,\u201d said Bill Dreher, a retail analyst at Susquehanna International Group.Advertisement"}

Qualifications: Must be attractive, know how to charm socially awkward programmers and give relaxing massages.Ms. Shen is a \u201cprogrammer motivator,\u201d as they are known in China. Part psychologist, part cheerleader, the women are hired to chat up and calm stressed-out coders. The jobs are proliferating in a society that largely adheres to gender stereotypes and believes that male programmers are \u201czhai,\u201d or nerds who have no social lives.\u201cThey really need someone to talk to them from time to time and to organize activities for them to ease some of the pressure,\u201d said Ms. Shen, a 25-year-old who has a degree in civil engineering from a university in Beijing.The country\u2019s laws against gender discrimination are not often enforced. Many companies are direct in their job ads. Males preferred. Only good-looking women need apply. With programmer motivators, it\u2019s more explicit, putting women in subservient positions to men.In tech, men dominate the top ranks. Just one woman sits on the 11-member board of Alibaba, the e-commerce giant. At Baidu, a search company, none of its five board members is a woman. At Tencent, a games and social media conglomerate, there are none. By comparison, Twitter has three women on its nine-person board. At Facebook, two of its nine directors are women.Like many other businesses, China\u2019s tech companies are blunt about gender bias in their job ads. Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent have repeatedly published recruitment ads boasting that there are \u201cbeautiful girls\u201d working for the companies, according to Human Rights Watch, a New York-based rights watchdog.In January, Alibaba said it was seeking a sales manager for Taobao, its e-commerce platform. Women were preferred, ages 28 to 35, \u201cwith a good personal image and class.\u201dIn November, Baidu advertised for a marketing position. Men were preferred \u201cbecause of business travel\u201d and other reasons.Both companies have since removed the references to specific genders in those ads.Alibaba said that the company has clear guidelines on providing equal opportunity regardless of gender and \u201cwill conduct stricter reviews of the recruiting advertisements to ensure compliance with our policy.\u201d It also said that one-third of the 18 founders of Alibaba are women and that female leaders account for one-third of the company\u2019s management positions.Baidu said that 45 percent of the company\u2019s 40,000 employees are female, which is reflected in midlevel and senior positions. \u201cWe value the important work that our female employees do across the organization,\u201d the company said in an emailed statement.In a statement, Tencent said it values diverse backgrounds and apologized for the ads.It is unclear how many companies employ programmer motivators. According to Baidu Baipin, a job search website run by Baidu, just seven companies are currently advertising for these jobs, mostly at smaller start-ups. There used to be more. Alibaba advertised for a programmer motivator with \u201crecognizably good looks\u201d in 2015 but deleted the ad after being criticized by Chinese internet users.Ms. Shen started work at Chainfin.com, a consumer finance company, in October. She declined to disclose her salary, but Zhang Jing, a human resources executive who hired Ms. Shen, said it was around $950 a month.Ms. Shen came to Beijing from the northeastern province of Heilongjiang. She has long black hair and pale skin and wears red eye shadow to the office, where she always has a ready smile for her colleagues. They call her by her nickname, Yueyue, which translates to Joy.At Chainfin.com, the bulk of her work is tending the front desk, organizing social events, ordering snacks for tea breaks and chatting with the programmers. She may call a programmer to a conference room and ask him, \u201cDid you have to work overtime?\u201d before listening to his various frustrations.\u201cI thought it was really novel,\u201d Ms. Shen said, \u201cbecause I had never seen such a job before.\u201dOn a recent Friday, she approached Guo Zhenjie, 28, who has a foldout bed next to his desk. Ms. Shen asked whether his waist was still hurting from the long hours at his desk. He said, yes, he had been working till 10 or 11 for the past few nights.\u201cThe company\u2019s intention is for me to give you a massage, though my technique might not be great,\u201d Ms. Shen told Mr. Guo.Both of them broke out in giggles.Ms. Shen stood over a seated Mr. Guo and started kneading his shoulders.\u201cIt really does feel good,\u201d Mr. Guo said, as Ms. Shen gently whacked his back with a massage clapper device.For some start-ups, having a programmer motivator on staff is one of the many perks to attract male coders, a job that is in high demand in China\u2019s booming tech scene.Feng Zhiyi, 31, who works in research and development at Chainfin.com, said he was envious when photos of female programmer motivators fanning male employees appeared on the internet.\u201cAnd now we have one, too,\u201d Mr. Feng said.Mr. Feng said Ms. Shen had improved the work environment by organizing birthday parties and getting the programmers active with games such as tug of war or sack races.He said he was open to the idea of male programmer motivators but somewhat skeptical. \u201cA man chatting with another man, it\u2019s like going out on a date with a guy,\u201d Mr. Feng said. \u201cA little awkward, isn\u2019t it?\u201dMs. Zhang, the human resources executive who was part of the panel that hired Ms. Shen, stressed that it is important for a programmer motivator to look good. She said the applicants needed to have \u201cfive facial features that must definitely be in their proper order\u201d and speak in a gentle way.They should also have a contagious laugh, be able to apply simple makeup and be taller than 5 feet 2 inches.\u201cHer position is at the front desk, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Ms. Zhang said. \u201cIt may be that people won\u2019t be able to see her if they walk in.\u201dMs. Shen said that she does not consider her job to be sexist.\u201cMany feminist ideas are too extreme now,\u201d she said. \u201cI think women should be independent, self-reliant and have self-respect. And that\u2019s enough.\u201dXu Jiaolong, one of Chainfin.com\u2019s few female programmers, who gets massages from Ms. Shen, did not see anything wrong with the job. The way she saw it, it was a mere \u201cdivision of labor.\u201d But, with a smile, she said the company could consider hiring a man to motivate female programmers, too.China\u2019s tech industry is beginning to question such practices. Wang Jie, 40, the chief executive of Shanbay.com, an app that helps people learn English, has been vocal about the \u201cobjectification\u201d of women by other start-ups.He was so disturbed that some tech companies were using \u201cbeautiful women\u201d to draw male programmers to their companies that he wrote a post last October on Zhihu, China\u2019s version of Quora, the question and answer site, saying that Western companies would be sued back home if they posted similar ads.But Mr. Wang has found that attitudes are difficult to change. Several people responded to his post, saying he was making a mountain out of a molehill.\u201cThe men said: \u2018If there are more beautiful women, I\u2019ll be happier in my job. What\u2019s the issue?\u2019\u201d Mr. Wang said. \u201cAnd some women said: \u2018As a woman, I don\u2019t think this is a problem at all.\u2019\u201dElsie Chen contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech Firms Sign \u2018Digital Geneva Accord\u2019 Not to Aid Governments in Cyberwar", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe principles, which have been circulating among senior executives in the tech industry for weeks, also commit the companies to come to the aid of any nation on the receiving end of such attacks, whether the motive for the attack is \u201ccriminal or geopolitical.\u201d Although the list of firms agreeing to the accord is lengthy, several companies have declined to sign on at least for now, including Google, Apple and Amazon.Perhaps as important, none of the signers come from the countries viewed as most responsible for what Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president, called in an interview \u201cthe devastating attacks of the past year.\u201d Those came chiefly from Russia, North Korea, Iran and, to a lesser degree, China.The impetus for the effort came largely from Mr. Smith, who has been arguing for several years that the world needs a \u201cdigital Geneva Convention\u201d that sets norms of behavior for cyberspace just as the Geneva Conventions set rules for the conduct of war in the physical world. Although there was some progress in setting basic norms of behavior in cyberspace through a United Nations-organized group of experts several years ago, the movement has since faltered.Mr. Smith said over the weekend that the first move needed to come from the American companies that often find themselves acting as the \u201cfirst responders\u201d when cyberattacks hit their customers. \u201cThis has become a much bigger problem, and I think what we have learned in the past few years is that we need to work together in much bigger ways,\u201d Mr. Smith said in an interview. \u201cWe need to approach this in a principled way, and if we expect to get governments to do that, we have to start with some principles ourselves.\u201dYet not all governments are likely to embrace the \u201cCybersecurity Tech Accord\u201d in part because the principles it espouses can run headlong into their own, usually secret efforts to develop cyberweapons.Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor who leaked documents about surveillance programs, revealed pictures suggesting that American officials intercepted some hardware that came out of Cisco Systems, a major manufacturer of the routers and switches that make up the spine of the internet, apparently so the equipment directed traffic back to American intelligence agencies. There is no evidence that Cisco cooperated, but the publication of the photos led some foreign customers to believe that American equipment had been broadly compromised by the N.S.A.Cisco is one of the firms that has signed the accord. Mark Chandler, Cisco\u2019s general counsel, said the company believed that \u201cwe need to say we will not be part of any effort that will undermine the security of the web, or undermine those who depend on it \u2014 our customers.\u201d Among the other signatories were Dell, Juniper Networks, the two parts of the recently-split Hewlett-Packard, Symantec and FireEye. Two foreign firms, Telephonica of Spain and Nokia of Finland, also signed. There are no Chinese or Russian companies on the list of initial signatories.The new technology accord vows that the 31 signers \u201cwill protect against tampering with and exploitation of technology products and services during their development, design, distribution and use.\u201d Among the companies that signed are Oracle, Symantec, FireEye and HP, along with the Finnish company Nokia and the Spanish company Telef\u00f3nica.The cybersecurity coordinator at the White House, Rob Joyce, is widely rumored to be considering leaving his post and returning to the National Security Agency, where he ran the most elite of the cyberforces that attack foreign networks. If Mr. Joyce departs, the White House will have lost its two most senior, and most knowledgeable, cybersecurity policymakers in the span of a few weeks.An earlier version of this story incorrectly referred to the name of one of the signatories on the technology accord. It is Juniper Networks, not Juniper Systems.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Looming China Trade Action Divides Industry and Roils Markets", "Date": "2018-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s promise to take tough action against China\u2019s unfair economic practices was one of his most popular campaign ideas. But as the United States prepares stiff trade measures and China retaliates, stock markets have plummeted and some of America\u2019s biggest companies are pushing back.Industry giants like General Electric and Goldman Sachs, as well as agricultural companies, have lodged objections with the White House, saying that tariffs on both sides of the Pacific and limitations on investments will cut off American companies from the world\u2019s most lucrative and rapidly growing market.Since then, the White House has announced another trade measure targeted at China that would place tariffs on at least $50 billion worth of products imported to the United States and would restrict investment flows between the two economic giants. This week, the Trump administration is expected to announce a list of Chinese imports subject to tariffs, which could include high-tech products like semiconductors as well as cheap electronics and other goods that many Americans buy.Josh Kallmer, the senior vice president for global policy at the Information Technology Industry Council, an advocate for companies like Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and IBM, said his group had been largely supportive of the administration\u2019s targeting of China\u2019s unfair trade practices. But the group had made it clear to the White House that it would not be pleased with any measure that had tariffs \u201cas the primary or even a significant remedy.\u201d\u201cThe reason is that it would be a tax on consumers,\u201d Mr. Kallmer said, \u201cprecisely the people we are trying to support.\u201dThat theory could make it more difficult for American companies to operate in a country that already puts up steep barriers.As Mr. Trump advances a series of tough trade measures to confront these behaviors, however, cracks have appeared in American industry\u2019s seemingly united front.Companies in technology, investment and other industries now say that the measures the administration is taking to help them may actually end up doing irreparable harm to supply chains they have built up over decades. Any American company that wants to be a global player cannot afford to lose access to China\u2019s growing market, executives say.The 25 percent tariff on pork that China imposed on Monday is expected to be particularly harmful, including in regions that supported the president, like Iowa, North Carolina and Indiana. Last year, American farmers sent more than a billion dollars\u2019 worth of pork to China, their largest export market by value after Japan and Mexico.\u201cBecause we\u2019re so blessed to have America feed the world, we\u2019re also the first industry to get slammed whenever there are trade difficulties between the U.S. and other countries,\u201d Denise Bode, the coordinator for the American Fruit and Vegetable Processors and Growers Coalition.\u201cAmerican farmers appear to be the first casualties of an escalating trade war,\u201d said Max Baucus, a former Democratic senator from Montana and a chairman of a group called Farmers for Free Trade. \u201cWith farm incomes already declining, farmers rely on export markets to stay above water. These new tariffs are a drag on their ability to make ends meet.\u201dHowever, analysts and companies involved in China said that these measures appeared unlikely to adequately resolve American concerns about China\u2019s longstanding encroachment on American intellectual property.Companies are waiting anxiously for the administration to release a list of Chinese products this week that will be subject to tariffs \u2014 most likely the kind of high-tech products that the administration has accused China of targeting. The retail industry, which lobbied the administration and Congress against an early plan to impose tariffs on Chinese-made apparel and footwear, is now cautiously optimistic that its products will be exempt.G.E. and IBM, which operate through joint ventures and other partnerships in China and around the world, have both lobbied against the expansion of Cfius over concerns that restrictions on joint ventures with foreign companies that include the transfer of valuable skills or technology could weaken the position of American companies abroad.Financial firms, including Goldman Sachs and the Carlyle Group, have also expressed concern about investment restrictions, saying they could provide a drag on the United States economy.White House advisers, in turn, have complained that previous approaches to dealing with China have not worked, and that companies are overreacting to legitimate trade measures.Speaking Monday on CNBC, the White House trade adviser, Peter Navarro, defended the administration\u2019s tough actions on China and said investors should not fear a trade war.\u201cEverybody needs to relax,\u201d Mr. Navarro said. \u201cThe economy is as strong as an ox.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Farmers Hit the Road to Reach Shoppers Before Amazon Does", "Date": "2018-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySo is David Nowacoski, a chicken and pig farmer here in East Smithfield.We recently spent the day with Mr. Nowacoski and his wife, Marla, traveling about 92 miles in the family minivan, picking up and dropping off food from three farms, one cheese room, one tavern and a bakery. Even in this rural patch of natural gas fields and deer hunting grounds, where the closest Whole Foods is more than 100 miles away, Amazon\u2019s influence is deeply felt. Mr. Nowacoski says Amazon and other big retailers have conditioned consumers to expect a higher level of convenience.\u201cThis is where society is going, and we have to figure out how the small farm plays a role in it,\u201d he says. A day on the road with the Nowacoskis shows how exhausting and costly e-commerce can be. Dressed in overalls and a purple sweatshirt, Mr. Nowacoski walks over to a shed that smells like diesel fuel, dirt and garlic. He mixes garlic powder into the chicken feed as a natural antibiotic. Mr. Nowacoski raises about 4,000 chickens a year for meat and an additional 600 hens for eggs. In warmer months, the birds live in fields, eating grass, herbs and insects. But on a morning like this \u2014 with the temperature around 18 degrees and a snowy mist making it feel even colder \u2014 the chickens are kept in a coop with a vaulted ceiling and walls made of clear plastic. Mr. Nowacoski walks among the birds, carrying a blue feed bucket in each hand. The hens flock to him, while the rooster hangs back, crowing with jealousy and alarm. \u201cThat bird hates me,\u201d Mr. Nowacoski says. With the chickens fed, we walk down a winding dirt road to the pig pen. The sky has gone from light purple to blue-gray, and the snow has stopped.The pigs are still sleeping when we poke our heads into their hut, carpeted with hay. They lie side by side like a band of brothers \u2014 warm, plump and blissfully unaware that they have about three weeks left on earth.\u201cYeah, boys. Yeah, boys,\u201d Mr. Nowacoski calls to them. Most of the 300-pound pigs are opting to sleep in, but a few amble out onto the snowy ground, grunting, snorting and looking for breakfast. Mr. Nowacoski rubs and scratches their haunches vigorously, sizing up their meat.Confirmed. Three weeks left.A pot of coffee brews in the kitchen, and bacon sizzles on the stove. Ms. Nowacoski stands at the counter organizing online orders on her tablet.The Nowacoskis grew up in East Smithfield, a town of about 200 residents 75 miles west of Scranton. Friends since high school, they got married and moved to Princeton, N.J., where Mr. Nowacoski worked for an employee benefits firm. In 1993, they returned to East Smithfield and bought 80 acres of rolling fields, maple groves and a swamp that they dug out into a lake stocked with catfish and largemouth bass. Like many farms in the area, the Nowacoskis\u2019 land sits above the Marcellus Shale formation, a huge natural gas deposit. The couple lease some of their land to gas companies for hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. When gas prices were high, the Nowacoskis received enough money to send two of their three children to college without amassing debt. But as prices slumped, the infusion of wealth from the fracking boom all but evaporated.\u201cEveryone thought they would be millionaires,\u201d Mr. Nowacoski says. \u201cThen it just stopped.\u201dThe gas money is vanishing while milk prices are also low, putting pressure on farms and the broader economy.The Nowacoskis hope their e-commerce business, Delivered Fresh, can help farmers find new markets for their milk, meat and produce.The Nowacoskis spend Wednesdays picking up food from as many as 20 farms \u2014 a loop that sometimes totals 300 miles. They make deliveries on Thursdays and Fridays. For now, most orders are dropped off at central locales like farm stands or church parking lots. Eventually, Mr. Nowacoski hopes to expand delivery directly to the homes of as many customers as he can. It\u2019s not clear how many shoppers can afford \u201cpasture raised\u201d chicken breasts that cost $7.95 a pound in an area where household incomes are far below the national median.\u201cPeople ask, \u2018Why do you cost so much?\u2019\u201d Mr. Nowacoski says. \u201cThe better question is how are others like Walmart able to sell it so cheaply?\u201dWith the minivan loaded with three large coolers, the Nowacoskis pull out of their driveway and head west. The first stop is a small dairy farm about 35 minutes away in Roseville, to pick up cheese. To reach the farm, we climb a long, lonely hill that cuts through a snow-encrusted field.Near the top of the hill, we turn right and glide down a paved road that resembles a bobsled run. The cheese shop is at the bottom of the driveway, next to a barn.Amanda Kennedy is in her \u201ccheese room,\u201d wearing a white smock. She got up at 1:30 in the morning to start making the cheese. She milked the cows at 3 and helped her three children onto the bus at around 7.Ms. Kennedy, who was raised on a farm down the road, hopes that she can weather the turmoil in the dairy industry \u2014 which has been roiled by years of low milk prices \u2014 by finding a market for her specialty Cheddar and dill cheese curds.Ms. Nowacoski packs the curds into a cooler and leaves Ms. Kennedy a check for $24, and we are back on the road.After dropping off chicken thighs at a tavern along the way, the Nowacoskis drive to Milky Way Farms in Troy, Pa., to pick up bottles of milk for the week\u2019s online orders.The lunch menu at the Milky Way restaurant features broccoli salad, vegetable beef soup, lemon pineapple cake and gluten-free bread. The hamburgers are made from beef raised at a farm next door. \u201cIt is the middle of lunch time,\u201d Ms. Seeley says, taking our order. \u201cAnd there is nobody here.\u201dTourist traffic to the area has dropped, her husband says, and most people no longer take time to sit down for lunch. Even as the restaurant fades, Mr. Seeley will keep running a store at the farm that sells his chocolate milk, ice cream and egg nog. He\u2019s counting on online deliveries to extend his reach farther.\u201cWe have high hopes,\u201d he says.Fred McNeal, another farmer, joins us for lunch. He runs a farm market in Towanda, Pa., called Farmer Fred\u2019s that sells everything from lawn furniture to turkey bone broth and garden seeds. Mr. McNeal says he never worried about competition from Amazon until the company bought Whole Foods last June. He is convinced that Amazon will find a way to deliver fresh food locally, eating into the market for local goods.\u201cWe see this coming,\u201d Mr. McNeal says. \u201cWe have to figure out how to give customers what they want or we are going to be another story about a business that didn\u2019t adapt.\u201d After lunch, the Nowacoskis return to their farm to pick up heads of lettuce and then drive to a bakery, minutes before it closes at 4:30 p.m. The couple have been on the road for more than six hours. They will visit more farms the next day.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Big Reason Wall Street Is Flocking to Spotify: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Good Tuesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Spotify\u2019s shares opened at $165.90.\u2022 If the markets fall again, we have some possible explanations.\u2022 Should Facebook offer \u201cWhy Me?\u201d buttons?\u2022 Disney has offered to buy Sky News to help Fox\u2019s Sky bid.Spotify is a loss-making company that might not report a profit until next decade, but that didn\u2019t stop investors from valuing the company at $30 billion when it debuted Tuesday on the United States stock market.Spotify is an impressive company. Its loyal, paying customer base is enormous and is expected to keep growing. Also, Spotify has so far held its own in the face of competition from Apple, Amazon and Google, all of which want to win new subscribers to their music streaming services.But there is an important reason that Wall Street is flocking to Spotify: It is doing a great job at getting record companies to roll over.Spotify\u2019s main cost is what it pays record companies for the music it streams to its customers. As Spotify has grown, that expense has fallen as a share of its total revenue, which shows that Spotify is negotiating increasingly advantageous deals with record companies.That has bolstered Spotify\u2019s gross profit margin, which measures how much money a company keeps after paying out the costs directly related to generating its revenue. Last year, that margin was 21 percent of revenue at Spotify, well up from 14 percent in 2016.Crucially, though, Spotify has said it expects its gross margin to expand to as much as 35 percent over the longer term. In other words, as Spotify\u2019s spending on music grows, so will its leverage over record companies. And it may well achieve its gross margin target. After all, Netflix, which occupies a similar position in the market for streaming video, has a gross margin of 35 percent.But Spotify\u2019s main rivals could complicate things. What if Amazon offered record companies better terms than Spotify? That would reduce Spotify\u2019s bargaining power, making it harder to deliver wider gross margins investors are expecting. And Amazon, along with Apple and Google, has far deeper pockets to slog it out over the long term.\u2014 Peter EavisSpotify\u2019s unusual path to the public markets was a success.On its first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the music streaming service finished with a valuation of $26.5 billion.Spotify\u2019s shares opened at $165.90 before closing at $149.01.That\u2019s well above the high of $132.50 that its shares changed hands at in private transactions this year. It\u2019s also well above the $137.50 the WSJ reported its private shares were trading at during the past week.Spotify had eschewed a typical initial public offering in favor of a direct listing. That meant there was no \u201cdeal price\u201d for investors to reference on the first day of trading and no underwriters acting as stabilizing agents if the stock began to plunge.Despite all that, Spotify\u2019s valuation at the close on Tuesday ranks among the highest for a tech company debuting on an American exchange.Here\u2019s a look at the tech companies with the 10 biggest market capitalizations after their first day of trading, courtesy of Dealogic:Alibaba \u2014 $233.9 billionFacebook \u2014 $81.7 billionPalm \u2014 $53.3 billionInfineon Technologies \u2014 $47.9 billionJD.com \u2014 $28.9 billionSnap \u2014 $28.9 billionGoogle \u2014 $27.2 billionSpotify \u2014 $26.5 billionTwitter \u2014 $24.9 billionAgilent \u2014 $20.1 billionTesla said:\u2022 It built 2,020 Model 3s in the past seven days. That fell short of its goal of 2,500 by the end of the quarter.\u2022 Tesla produced 9,766 Model 3s during the quarter.\u2022 In total, Tesla produced 35,000 cars in the first quarter.\u2022 It has delivered 8,800 Model 3s during the first quarter, below the 8,800 analysts expected according to Bloomberg.\u2022 In all, Tesla delivered a record 29,980 vehicles during the quarter.\u2022 The company said it expects Model 3 weekly production to reach 5,000 by the end of the second quarter.\u2022 The combined deliveries of the Model X and Model S came to 21,800 cars, the lowest total in several quarters.ContextTesla\u2019s stock and bond prices have plunged amid concerns about how much cash the company is using as it struggles to speed up assembly and sales of the Model 3. With a starting price of $35,000, the car is supposed to be more affordable than Tesla\u2019s other cars. The company has been counting on a quick expansion of its Model 3 business to increase revenue.The president reiterated his claim that Amazon is \u201ccosting the United States Postal Service massive amounts of money\u201d in a post to Twitter on Tuesday morning.Shares are essentially flat on the day.\u201cPackage delivery has been a bright spot for a service that\u2019s lost money for 11 straight years. The losses are mostly due to pension and health care costs \u2014 not the business deal for the Postal Service to deliver packages for Amazon. Boosted by e-commerce, the Postal Service has enjoyed double-digit increases in revenue from delivering packages, but that hasn\u2019t been enough to offset declines in first-class letters and marketing mail, which together make up more than two-thirds of postal revenue.\u201cWhile the Postal Service\u2019s losses can\u2019t be attributed to its package business, Trump\u2019s claim that it could get more bang for its buck may not be entirely far-fetched. A 2017 analysis by Citigroup concluded that the Postal Service was charging below-market rates as a whole for parcels. The post office does not use taxpayer money for its operations.\u201dCould Mr. Tump\u2019s criticism lead to action against Amazon?\u201cNothing can be certain, except death and taxes \u2026 and more Trump tweets on Amazon. We believe sales tax collection changes would have limited impact on consumer use of Amazon and could actually help Amazon\u2019s relative competitive positioning in domestic e-commerce.\u201dMore from Andrew:The \u201cWhy Me?\u201d button might create all sorts of problems for Facebook, and its advertisers, too. It would allow users \u2014 and rivals \u2014 to reverse engineer much of the way the system works. And advertisers would probably object to the idea of making their targeting plans public. But that would be the cost of using such large public platforms with such exact targeting.The bottom line: Disney wants Fox to have full control of Sky to support its $52.4 billion deal to buy most of Fox, and it wants to get ahead of Comcast\u2019s rival effort to buy that 39 percent of the British broadcaster.An earlier version of this article misstated the status of a Department of Defense contract for cloud computing services.

{"Headline": "Gender Progress in Macho Australia?", "Date": "2018-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter 52______In addition to public panels on the #MeToo movement, there were conferences, university discussions and a dinner with young female New York Times readers to talk about our coverage.Everyone, it seemed, had something to say about #MeToo.On her way back to New York, Francesca jotted down a few impressions about Australia\u2019s gender movement and how it compares with what\u2019s happening in the United States.Her thoughts raised as many questions as they answered, and we hope you\u2019ll share your insights as we unpack the issue.Notebook from SydneyBecause I\u2019m director of the New York Times Gender Initiative, many people I met on my travels wanted to talk me about women and Trump and women and sexual harassment and women and Harvey and women and the workplace and women and women and women.But they also had a few things to share, too.The rumblings from women and people in their 20s and 30s began almost at once:\u201cAustralian politics is a boys\u2019 club. The journalists here don\u2019t cover politicians as aggressively as they do in the U.S. Exhibit A (and B and C and D): Barnaby Joyce!\u201d\u201cAnd the press! The press! There are so few publications we identify with! Most young people just turn away and shrug.\u201d\u201cAnd the defamation laws! It\u2019s almost impossible for the press to cover sexual harassment. Meanwhile, sexual harassment is rife in universities, at workplaces and on and on!\u201dAnd yet.The Sydney Opera House was hosting a day all about women called \u201cAll About Women.\u201d Attendees who were mostly women (and a few odd men out) turned out in the thousands. The festival aired around the country on local TV stations. People tuned in.And yet.The ABC devoted episodes to International Women\u2019s Day and two ABC national radio stations (Fran Kelly and Richard Glover) invited me on to talk Harvey Weinstein and, you guessed it, women.And yet.Gay marriage had been recently legalized. And the city of Sydney would pay homage to the passing of the law at its 40th Anniversary Mardi Gras celebrations. And yet.Barnaby Joyce, the former deputy prime minister, a champion of family values, who had fathered a child with a staff member who was not his wife, and accepted a rent-free townhouse from a millionaire politician, had stepped down from his post. On the surface it looked like progress but underneath, was it? It got me thinking: What should women (and others) in Australia realistically expect from a gender movement? Are hopes pinned too high? Or do expectations not go far enough? So here are my questions for you, Australia: How do you think the movement in Australia compares with the wave of accountability sweeping the rest of the world?And what does gender progress in a macho country like Australia look like, anyway? Now let\u2019s catch up with news of the week, and what to watch on Netflix on April.______\u201cI never expected anything like this, just as a poor man never dreams of striking it rich overnight,\u201d Mr. Lam said.______Sometimes the most memorable stories are those of a single individual who hit a fork in the road, and took off in a surprising direction.______News and FeaturesSports____________My personal pick: \u201cThe Lobster.\u201d If I even tried to explain it, I would fail miserably \u2014 but it\u2019s definitely a memorable film. It\u2019s about love. And dictatorship. Maybe.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Silicon Valley Shouldn\u2019t Work With the Pentagon", "Date": "2018-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMr. Malcomson is the author of \u201cSplinternet: How Geopolitics and Commerce Are Fragmenting the World Wide Web.\u201dIs Silicon Valley going to war? In 2013, Amazon beat IBM for a contract to host the United States intelligence community\u2019s data cloud. Microsoft now markets Azure Government Secret, its cloud-computing service designed specifically for federal and local governments, to the Defense Department and intelligence agencies. And last year, Google signed a contract with the Pentagon for Project Maven, a pilot program to accelerate the military\u2019s use of artificial intelligence.These partnerships might ease anxiety in the Defense Department about China\u2019s artificial-intelligence advances and ominous, state-led fusion of civil and military technology development. But a comparable fusion of the United States government and Silicon Valley would be a mistake.Narrowing the focus of the United States tech sector to the needs of the military would serve neither party. On the contrary, it would make the nation weaker.To be sure, defense contracts are hardly new in Silicon Valley, and Google\u2019s recent moves might be seen as heralding Silicon Valley\u2019s return to its natural home in defense contracting. But that would be to misunderstand both Silicon Valley history and today\u2019s technology.The internet and much of digital computing did indeed emerge from decades of United States defense contracts, beginning as long ago as World War I. Yet the Pentagon itself sloughed off the internet \u2014 not knowing quite what to do with it, and rightly judging it to be insecure \u2014 to the National Science Foundation. When the internet became a commercial concern, the National Science Foundation off-loaded it to the Department of Commerce. Government might have given birth to the internet, but it sure didn\u2019t raise it.The emergence of a civilian, entrepreneurial tech culture in the 1970s owed as much intellectually, if not (at first) financially, to the antiwar movement and the 1960s counterculture \u2014 hardly friends of the military-industrial complex. Out of this the dominant, highly creative ethos of geek antiauthoritarianism grew. It is hard to believe that closer ties with the military would perpetuate this culture of innovation.The technology involved in projects like Azure Government Secret and Project Maven is also very different from the data-sharing projects of the 1960s. Those older technologies would not have been created in the absence of government funding. Today\u2019s projects, in contrast, are all basically A.I. plays. Very little of this is defense-specific, but all of it is useful for defense and espionage. Unlike, say, weapons development, A.I. research is inherently dual-use. United States tech giants would be pursuing it with or without government contracts. Silicon Valley does not need the Pentagon to initiate these endeavors.The Pentagon is in a different position. It came around very reluctantly to the idea that it is dependent on private industry for the defense of the country and the projection of American power. But come around it has, in no small part thanks to China.The United States military seems to have been spooked. In a 2017 memo, the deputy secretary of defense, Robert O. Work, wrote that while the Defense Department had made \u201ctentative steps\u201d in A.I., \u201cwe need to do much more, and move much faster.\u201d The memo announced the formation of Project Maven to do just that. This month, Gen. Stephen Wilson, the vice chief of staff for the Air Force, said that China is taking a \u201cwhole of nation\u201d approach to A.I. and the United States should, too.Yet we shouldn\u2019t forget that civil-military antagonism and the deep American tradition of distrusting the state have been crucial to the United States\u2019 ability to innovate. There are good reasons why defense-tech giants of the 1960s, \u201970s and \u201980s like Raytheon and Grumman missed out on such major tech advances as Web protocols, the smartphone, personal computers and various types of encryption \u2014 all of which would eventually have great military significance. The biggest reason was that none of these advances were directed at waging war; indeed, many aimed at transcending the power of the state.After the Cold War, the Soviet Union\u2019s extraordinary technological capacity dissipated in large part because it had been so reactive: The Soviets had let their adversary determine the pace and scope of their own innovation. The United States should not make that mistake.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Facebook Fallacy: Privacy Is Up to You", "Date": "2018-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneWas Mark Zuckerberg pulling their leg?By providing its users with greater and more transparent controls over the personal data they share and how it is used for targeted advertising, he insisted, Facebook could empower them to make their own call and decide how much privacy they were willing to put on the block.He must be kidding.As Mr. Zuckerberg surely knows, providing a greater sense of control over their personal data won\u2019t make Facebook users more cautious. It will instead encourage them to share more. This, of course, will produce more data for Facebook to mine to its own financial advantage.\u201cDisingenuous is the adjective I had in my mind,\u201d said Alessandro Acquisti, a leading expert on privacy-related behavior at Carnegie Mellon University, when I called to chat about how Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony meshed with his research.\u201cFifteen years ago it would have been legitimate to propose this argument,\u201d he added. \u201cBut it is no longer legitimate to ignore the behavioral problems and propose simply more transparency and controls.\u201dThe phenomenon even has a name: the \u201ccontrol paradox.\u201d\u201cPrivacy control settings give people more rope to hang themselves,\u201d Professor Loewenstein told me. \u201cFacebook has figured this out, so they give you incredibly granular controls.\u201dIt is time that Congress appreciates it, too.The question for members of Congress goes beyond how much Facebook and others may be exploiting our inability to rationally assess the pros and cons of sharing information \u2014 profiting from the difficulty we have measuring the immediate reward of the cute puppy video against the more distant risk of having our data sloshing around the internet for years.Those in the industry often argue that people don\u2019t really care about their privacy \u2014 that they may seem concerned when they answer surveys, but still routinely accept cookies and consent to have their data harvested in exchange for cool online experiences.Professor Acquisti thinks this is a fallacy. The cognitive hurdles to manage our privacy online are simply too steep.This is all pretty novel. The idea of online privacy didn\u2019t exist a generation ago. While we are good at handling our privacy in the offline world, lowering our voices or closing the curtains as the occasion may warrant, there are no cues online to alert us to a potential privacy invasion. It seems foolhardy to think we could determine the boundaries of data collection on our own.Even if we were to know precisely what information companies like Facebook have about us and how it will be used, which we don\u2019t, it would be hard for us to assess potential harms. Could we face higher prices online because Amazon has a precise grasp of our price sensitivities? Might our online identity discourage banks from giving us a loan? What else could happen? How does the risk stack up against the value of a targeted ad, or a friend\u2019s birthday reminder?Members of Congress have mostly let market forces prevail online, unfettered by government meddling. Privacy protection in the internet economy has relied on the belief that consumers will make rational choices. Give them a simple dial to manage their preferences \u2014 and accurate information, in a timely fashion and a big font, about what they are sharing online \u2014 and they will make the right calls to avoid discrimination, protect themselves from predatory behavior and thrive.The more that psychologists and behavioral economists study psychological biases and quirks, the clearer it seems that rational choices alone won\u2019t work. \u201cI don\u2019t think any kind of disclosure or opt in or opt out is going to protect us from our worst instincts,\u201d Professor Loewenstein argued.What to do? Professor Acquisti suggests flipping the burden of proof. The case for privacy regulation rests on consumers\u2019 proving that data collection is harmful. Why not ask the big online platforms like Facebook to prove they can\u2019t work without it? If reducing data collection imposes a cost, we could figure out who bears it \u2014 whether consumers, advertisers or Facebook\u2019s bottom line. That could help set societywide boundaries about what data to collect and what to leave alone.It would no longer be up to confused users to protect themselves.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s Deal for Shazam Is Delayed in Europe Over Data Concerns", "Date": "2018-04-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 If data is the most valuable currency of the digital economy, at what point does a company have so much that it becomes unfair?That\u2019s a question antitrust experts are increasingly asking themselves as the world\u2019s biggest technology companies harvest more and more information about people and businesses. On Monday, European regulators pushed the idea forward, announcing an investigation into Apple\u2019s proposed acquisition of the song-identification app Shazam over concerns the iPhone maker would get access to data on competitors like Spotify.Ms. Vestager has said that with free services, customers pay with their data, and are not always getting a fair deal. This broader interpretation of antitrust law would have important consequences for future acquisitions made by companies such as Amazon, Facebook and Google.\u201cCompeting music streaming services could be put at a competitive disadvantage,\u201d the commission said. It added that it wanted to prevent Apple from blocking Shazam from referring users to other music services.The European Commission has until Sept. 4 to make a final decision on whether to block or approve the deal, or seek concessions from Apple.Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Ms. Vestager\u2019s office has also fined a number of other tech giants, including Amazon, Facebook, Google and Qualcomm. And a new data protection law taking effect next month is expected to bring even more scrutiny.Antitrust cases based on data will become more common as companies use customer information as a moat against competitors, according to Maurice Stucke, a law professor at the University of Tennessee, who has written in favor of broader enforcement of antitrust rules. He cited a potentially influential German investigation of Facebook over the use of data.The European inquiries are likely to influence governments elsewhere in the world, Mr. Stucke said. Governments, wary of the technology industry\u2019s power over the global economy, will develop rules to account for concerns that data can be used to build monopoly positions, even when companies buy businesses that wouldn\u2019t initially seem to be consequential, he said.\u201cYou\u2019re seeing significant changes over the last three to four years on data, privacy and competition policy,\u201d Mr. Stucke said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sea change.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Investment Boom From Trump\u2019s Tax Cut Has Yet to Appear", "Date": "2018-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter years of costly layoffs and plant closings, things are looking up for the heavy-machinery giant Caterpillar, which forecasts solid global sales growth and increased demand this year. Yet despite the corporate investment incentives at the center of President Trump\u2019s tax overhaul, the company\u2019s executives have no plans to supercharge investment or expansion.Caterpillar\u2019s plans for new investment remain low by historical standards. Instead, the company has started using cash to repurchase its own stock as a way to return cash to shareholders, something it hadn\u2019t done since 2015.\u201cWe feel we have the necessary bricks-and-mortar capacity that we need,\u201d Brad Halverson, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, said in a post-earnings conference call last Tuesday.Republicans sold the 2017 tax law as \u201crocket fuel\u201d for American investment and growth, saying that corporations \u2014 flush with cash from lower tax rates \u2014 would channel money back into the economy by building factories and offices and investing in equipment, which would help companies grow and provide winnings for workers.Economists say that may happen as companies readjust their spending plans over the coming months to take advantage of the new law, and they note that it is too early to tell how much the tax law will spread into the broader economy.But, so far, hard evidence of such an acceleration has yet to appear in economic data, which show more of a steady investment roll than a rapid escalation. And while there are pockets of the economy where investment is picking up \u2014 among large tech companies and in shale oil business, for example \u2014 corporate spending on buying back stock is increasing at a far faster clip, prompting a debate about whether the law is returning money to the overall economy or just rewarding a small segment of investors.Data on the gross domestic product, released Friday, showed that business investment grew at a 6.1 percent annual clip during the first three months of 2018, down from 7.2 percent during the first quarter last year. Excluding oil and gas investment, which is particularly volatile, the investment pace grew slightly over the past year.While the first-quarter investment numbers were more robust than they were in 2015 and 2016 \u2014 when a bust in oil prices curtailed a large chunk of American corporate spending \u2014 they weren\u2019t radically different from the roughly 5 percent rate of growth for business investment that has prevailed since 2010.Representative Erik Paulsen, a Minnesota Republican who chairs the Congressional Joint Economic Committee, attributed the G.D.P. growth to the tax cuts. \u201cAmericans are better off today than they were 16 months ago,\u201d he said in a statement on Friday. \u201cBusiness investment is strong, wages are growing, and disposable income is climbing thanks to tax reform and pro-growth policies.\u201dAnalysts were more cautious in drawing conclusions.\u201cEven regardless of the tax plan kicker, we would have seen a pickup in business investment,\u201d said Keith Parker, head of United States equity strategy at UBS. Capital spending, he said, \u201ctypically follows profits with a lag.\u201dScott Greenberg, a tax analyst at the conservative Tax Foundation, warned that it was \u201calways difficult to identify an economic trend from just one quarter\u2019s data.\u201dSenator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, told The Economist in remarks published last week that after the tax cuts passed, corporations \u201cbought back shares, a few gave out bonuses; there\u2019s no evidence whatsoever that the money\u2019s been massively poured back into the American worker.\u201d A spokeswoman said Monday that Mr. Rubio\u2019s criticism was that the law could have done more to help working families while also stimulating corporate investment.While overall business investment in the American economy was up 6.1 percent in the first quarter, business spending by the larger corporations included in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index \u2014 as measured by their announcements of capital expenditures so far this earnings season \u2014 is up 23.5 percent from the first quarter of 2017, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. That would be the fastest pace since 2012.Large tech companies are among some of the biggest spenders. Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, nearly tripled its first-quarter capital spending to $7.3 billion on real estate and computing capacity and data centers. Amazon increased investment by more than 40 percent to more than $3 billion as it builds out its network of fulfillment centers.But with roughly a quarter of the companies in the S.&P. 500 having reported first-quarter results, their spending on buybacks is even higher, up 43 percent from the first quarter of 2017, to $43 billion, according to data from Howard Silverblatt, an analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.Traditionally when companies have more cash than they think they can invest productively, they return it to shareholders either by paying them cash dividends or by going into the market and repurchasing shares. Those buybacks tend to push the price of a stock up, making shareholders wealthier, at least on paper.Republicans, and some Democratic economists, say this can help the economy, if those shareholders sell their stock and then use their profits to make other investments. But critics argue that buybacks disproportionately benefit the wealthy \u2014 the richest 10 percent of Americans own 84 percent of all stock \u2014 and executives who are often compensated with shares.Boeing said it had bought back $3 billion worth of its stock in the first quarter. (It expects to buy $15 billion over the next two years.) Facebook expanded its plans to buy back its shares to the tune of $9 billion. the appliance maker Whirlpool said it would sell its Brazilian refrigerator compressor business for roughly $1 billion, and then use that money to buy its own shares. The railroad operator CSX said it had bought back more than $800 million in shares in the first quarter, as part of plans to buy $5 billion in shares by the first quarter of next year.As they anticipated a windfall from tax cuts, the nation\u2019s banks increased their pace of buybacks by more than 50 percent last year, to $77.5 billion from $51 billion in 2016, according to data compiled by S&P Global Market Intelligence. The 10 largest banks, led by JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup, accounted for 70 percent of those buybacks.Republicans have highlighted the buybacks as a boost for the economy, saying they will put money in the hands of investors who will find productive and widespread ways to use it. Many Democrats say those buybacks undermine Republican claims about the tax law and prove the overhaul will reward only corporations and the wealthy.\u201cThe whole theory was to lavish corporations and the already wealthy with tax cuts, and maybe the benefits will trickle down to everyone else,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, said in a floor speech in April. \u201cWe\u2019re already seeing the balloon burst on that idea, as corporations dedicate an enormous percentage of the tax savings to stock buybacks, and only a sliver to worker compensation.\u201dA recent surge in oil and gas investment is largely a result of the recovery in oil and gas prices and easing of regulations over the last year, rather than incentives put in place by the tax overhaul. Economists believe those incentives \u2014 such as allowing companies to immediately and fully deduct the cost of capital spending in order to lower their taxes \u2014 could help stimulate investment for companies.Verizon, in its quarterly earnings report last week, said it had increased capital expenditures to $4.6 billion in the first quarter, up $1.5 billion from the same period in 2017. But the company plans to stick to its target of spending at most $17.8 billion on investment this year \u2014 a level that has not budged much for the past four years.\u201cI don\u2019t see us having a massive acceleration in capex,\u201d Verizon\u2019s chief financial officer, Matt Ellis, told analysts on its post-earnings conference call.Advertisement"}

These People Actually Did.", "Date": "2018-04-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPeering into a webcam, her face intermittently frozen over an iffy Skype connection in Medellin, Colombia, Lizz Quain was explaining not long ago why she uprooted her 9-year-old twins almost a year and a half ago to travel the world.Ms. Quain, who is in her 40s, owned a children\u2019s play cafe and preschool near Seattle before she renounced her American middle-class existence in August 2016, fed up with what she described as a stifling, consumerist culture.Once Donald J. Trump was elected president, she made a common liberal refrain \u2014 \u201cIf Trump wins, I\u2019m leaving the country\u201d \u2014 reality, deciding not to return home with her daughters, Aubrey and Gabriella. After traveling through Asia and Europe, she is now figuring out how to start a business selling products through Amazon to finance the life of an itinerant-by-choice single mother.\u201cIf the G.O.P. gets out of office, if our education system improves, if we get universal health care, I\u2019ll move back to the States because we\u2019ll get tired of traveling,\u201d Ms. Quain said. But until that utopian day arrives, \u201cWe\u2019re unplugging from the Matrix.\u201dThe Quains are not the only family that has of late dispensed with the trappings of the American dream (house, school, career) and gone nomad. Hopping from one vacation rental to the next or piling into R.V.s, they have sold or rented out their homes and unloaded most of their possessions, financing their travels with savings or work done remotely.Lainie Liberti, an administrator of the group, said it\u2019s not just the tense political climate in the United States motivating people to leave. \u201cPeople are not seeing a future,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are starting to focus on living now and focusing on their children. They are re-evaluating what is important to them.\u201dMs. Quain, who worked as much as 100 hours a week running her own company, worried about the values she was imparting to her daughters. \u201cI don\u2019t want them to grow up to be worker bees,\u201d she said. \u201cI want them to grow up to be freethinking entrepreneurs.\u201dLike many of the new expats, she is home-schooling (\u201cworldschooling\u201d is the more popular term). Her daughters are learning Spanish at a Medellin day camp and spend their spare time playing Minecraft and Roblox, video games they sometimes play online with other traveling children. She hopes eventually they\u2019ll start their own YouTube channel, if someone will teach them. \u201cOnce I get my business up and running,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019ll hire people to teach them how to do things.\u201d\u201cAll you need to do is have a laptop and be an intelligent person,\u201d Mr. Kortman said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a specific skill set.\u201dBurdened by high rent, along with car and student loan payments, they did not see a future where they could buy a home in the area and still pay down their debts. \u201cOur family was telling us to settle down,\u201d Mr. Gillespie said from Prague last winter. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t see the value in that.\u201dLast spring, he and his wife sold their car, their furniture and most of their possessions for about $10,000. So far, traveling has been cheaper. In Croatia, for example, their expenses fell by 60 percent, allowing them to pay down their student loans faster. \u201cIf we can make it work, then we\u2019re going to keep going as long as we can,\u201d Mr. Gillespie said.Mr. and Ms. Gillespie travel with High Sierra backpacks. Kailen has her own pack, too: a tiny one shaped like a bumblebee. They pared down their belongings to the bare essentials, although Ms. Gillespie did carry an orange Bebe skirt and Zara top around Italy all summer because she thought it would make for a great photograph in Florence (she got her shot and unloaded the outfit). \u201cIt was totally impractical,\u201d she said.Jessica and William Swenson are financing an 11-month around-the-world trip with their three small children through a mix of savings, inheritance, a severance package and the income from renting out their four-bedroom house with a pool in Livermore, Calif.The family is traveling light, carrying only backpacks \u2014 even the children, Ezra, 8, Theo, 6, and Vesper, 5, have them \u2014 with a few changes of clothes. Mr. Swenson, 36, an accountant, bald with a full beard, wears a kilt. \u201cHe\u2019s Scottish and loves the un-bifurcated life,\u201d Mrs. Swenson said, speaking over FaceTime from an Airbnb in Bali, Indonesia. The family was waiting out a volcanic eruption, hoping their flight to Australia would not be canceled because of ash.The Swensons embarked on the trip as a sort of lemonade-from-lemons move after Mr. Swenson\u2019s job relocated, his mother died and the family\u2019s live-in child care moved out.\u201cWe were like, \u2018That removed all our obstacles,\u2019\u201d Mrs. Swenson said. But even though social media is accessible from around the world, they were also relieved to escape what Mrs. Swenson describes as \u201ca general feeling of anger and bitterness,\u201d that had descended on the progressive Bay Area in the months since Mr. Trump became president. \u201cI\u2019m not really political,\u201d she said. \u201cI try not to engage.\u201dOf course, sometimes people they meet abroad want to talk United States politics. This the Swensons deflect. \u201cWe kind of put the kibosh on it,\u201d Mrs. Swenson said. \u201cWe\u2019re here to be students, and not talk about horrible things.\u201dBut not everyone who takes their life on the road does so to escape an unsatisfying one. Sonja Jernstrom, 37, and Chris Jernstrom, 36, left their home in Seattle in June to take a 14-month trip around the world with their two children, Ben, 7, and Emma, 4.They\u2019re driving through the Americas in a truck with a 70-square-foot camper before they head off to Asia, the Middle East and Europe. \u201cIt was an opportunity to take a midcareer break,\u201d said Mr. Jernstrom, who quit his job in investment management; Ms. Jernstrom is a former environmental scientist. The family is financing their travels with savings and income earned renting out their four-bedroom house out on Airbnb.Seeing Latin America has been eye-opening. When Mr. Trump was elected, \u201cwe both felt like, \u2018Gosh, maybe we want to move to Europe,\u2019\u201d Mr. Jernstrom said from Chile. But \u201cthis trip has made me appreciate so much about how much we have in the U.S. It\u2019s made me feel like I want to go back to the U.S. and make things better at home.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified a country the Swenson family visited in December.

But anyone wanting to assess where the stellar foreign growth came from \u2013 and whether it can continue \u2014 would have little company data with which to work.Twitter on Monday did not break down international revenues by region. It did say that Japan, its second largest source of revenue, brought in $117 million, a 61 percent increase. Facebook, in contrast, releases revenue and user numbers for four regions. That Twitter offers limited international data is perhaps not that surprising, given that the company does not release a tally for daily active users, a number Facebook provides. (Twitter does release a growth number for daily users but only provides an actual total for monthly active users.)Twitter\u2019s revenue trends may at some point prompt it to divulge more. Foreign advertising revenue accounted for half its sales in the first quarter, compared with 40 percent in the same period a year ago.Ned Segal, Twitter\u2019s chief financial officer, on Wednesday said the strength of international revenue could mean that they account for more than half of the total. In the first quarter, foreign ad revenue surged 51 percent, compared with the year-earlier period. In the United States, the increase was just 1 percent.Mr. Segal did mention some first-quarter \u201chighlights\u201d for the international operations. A good ad sales performance and audience growth powered Japan\u2019s results, he said, adding that ads outside of China for Chinese exporters were also a source of strength. Britain, Brazil and the Middle East were also bright spots, Mr. Segal said.Twitter\u2019s stock slid on Wednesday despite the good numbers. With a little more clarity, investors may be willing to give them more weight.- Peter EavisComcast has formally bid nearly $31 billion for the European broadcaster. Sky has withdrawn its recommendation of Fox\u2019s year-and-a-half-old bid for full control.What\u2019s next?Keep these dates in mind\u2022 On May 1, Britain\u2019s competition regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority, is expected to offer its recommendation on whether Fox\u2019s bid should allowed to go through.\u2022 By June 13 or so, Britain\u2019s culture secretary, Matthew Hancock, is expected to make a final decision on Fox\u2019s offer.In the meantime, Comcast is working to obtain regulatory approvals for its own bid. Given the American telecom giant\u2019s relatively small presence in Britain, that shouldn\u2019t be too much of an issue.\u2014 Michael de la MercedPutting together a nearly $31 billion takeover requires a fair amount of help. Here\u2019s who\u2019s working for Comcast and Sky \u2014 and Fox, which may come back with a higher bid.Comcast\u2022 Robey Warshaw, the small boutique investment bank run by \u201cthe two Simons.\u201d Both Mr. Robey and Mr. Warshaw are on the deal.\u2022 Evercore Partners, led by co-founder Roger Altman and senior deal maker Eduardo Mestre\u2022 Bank of America Merrill Lynch (which is working as corporate brokers, a peculiarly British function that is something like relationship banking and market surveillance), led by Adrian Mee, a global co-head of M.&A., and Tim Waddell, a vice chairman of corporate and investment banking for Europe and a veteran corporate broker.\u2022 Wells Fargo, led by Stephen Locke, a managing director.Sky\u2022 Morgan Stanley (financial adviser and corporate broker), led by Simon Smith, head of investment banking in Europe; Anthony Zammit, a managing director; and Ben Grindley of corporate broking.\u2022 PJT Partners, led by partners Simon Lyons and Scott Matlock.\u2022 Barclays (as financial adviser and corporate broker), led by Mark Astaire, chairman of corporate broking and Richard Taylor, co-head of investment banking.Fox\u2022 Centerview Partners, led by co-founder and longtime Fox adviser Blair Effron and partners David Cohen and James Hartop\u2022 Goldman Sachs, led by investment banking co-head and longtime Fox adviser John Waldron; Mark Sorrell, head of M.&A. for EMEA (and a son of Martin Sorrell); and managing directors Mike Smith and Owain Evans\u2022 JPMorgan Chase, led by Jennifer Nason, global chairwoman of T.M.T.; Hugo Baring, co-head of T.M.T. banking for EMEA; Marco Caggiano, a managing director; and Dwayne Lysaght, head of U.K. M.&A.How the offers stack up:\u2022 Comcast: \u00a312.50 a share, and pledges to maintain Sky News\u2019s independence\u2022 Fox: \u00a310.75 a share for the 61 percent of Sky it doesn\u2019t yet own. (Disney, which had already agreed to buy the bulk of Fox in a separate deal, has also offered to buy Sky News to satisfy editorial independence concerns.)Financial companies are on the brink of having one of their top demands granted: an end to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s public database of complaints about their products and services.What\u2019s in the databaseWhy finance institutions want it shut downThey say the database can be misleading because the agency publishes a record of all the complaints that it receives, without vetting them. The companies also argue that they already have channels for resolving customer disputes.Why consumer groups say that could be problematicConsumer groups argue that taking the database offline would neuter one of its core purposes: pushing companies to take complaints more seriously.More than 185,000 complaints to the bureau have been resolved with some form of compensation or relief, often with financial institutions changing their practices or making customers whole.The social media company became the latest firm to easily beat expectations, only to have its shares tumble.If those stock moves sound familiar, that\u2019s because similar moves happened at 3M and Caterpillar on Tuesday. Despite meeting expectations, 3M tumbled after it lowered the high end of its outlook. Caterpillar, meanwhile, raised its guidance for the year, but comments on its conference call that the first quarter would be the \u201chigh-water mark\u201d for earnings per share sent the stock sliding.Why such big moves? It\u2019s worth pointing back to what DealBook\u2019s Peter Eavis wrote Tuesday:\u201cDespite all the bullish talk about earnings and the economy, stocks looked vulnerable going into the first-quarter earnings season. Analysts are expecting earnings for companies in the S.&P. 500 to grow 25 percent this year, an unusually large increase. At the 2018 forecast, the S.&P. 500 looks temperately valued at 17 times earnings. But looking back, stocks appear expensive, at 21 times the S.&P. 500\u2019s earnings for 2017. This large gap between future and historical valuations creates a chasm that stocks can fall into if profits disappoint. If companies, like 3M did on Tuesday, provide underwhelming earnings outlooks, investors will stop believing that stocks are cheap, based on 2018 earnings.\u201dIn the case of Twitter, the stock is up about 30 percent this year and more than 75 percent since late October. A rally like that leaves little room to disappoint.Wall Street executives are eagerly awaiting a relaxation of the supplemental leverage rule, which governs how much their firms can borrow. The Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of Currency are for it; the F.D.I.C. and Lael Brainard, an Obama administration appointee at the Fed, are opposed.Why relax the rule? It\u2019s making it too hard for banks to do business. \u201cThe best analogy is that it\u2019s like having the same speed limit for every road in the country,\u201d Greg Baer of the Clearing House Association told Peter.Why keep it? The rule provides adequate protection in case there\u2019s another downturn, and banks have been doing fine otherwise. \u201cU.S. bank lending has been healthy over recent years and profits are strong,\u201d Ms. Brainerd said in a speech last week.\u2022 There are more Republican senators and Democratic governors named John than there are women in either group.\u2022 There are almost as many C.E.O.s named John in the Fortune 500 as female C.E.O.s in that group.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Party City Offers Ramadan Decorations, a First for a Big U.S. Retailer", "Date": "2018-04-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor the first time, a major American retailer is offering a dedicated line of decorations for the holiest month on the Islamic calendar: Ramadan, which culminates in the Eid al-Fitr celebration.The retailer, Party City, which has about 850 locations, mostly in the United States, was motivated to create the items because customers kept requesting them, Ryan Vero, the company\u2019s president of retail, said this week. \u201cWe are always seeking insights from our store teams who are engaging with our customers every day,\u201d said Mr. Vero, who called these customers underserved when it comes to party supplies.Party City\u2019s Ramadan items, which were designed by its internal product innovation team, have been selling well online \u2014 many items have sold out \u2014 and will be available by Saturday in some stores in cities like New York, Los Angeles and Sugar Land, Tex.The announcement is welcome news to many Muslims gearing up for the holiday, which begins on May 16 and ends at sundown on June 14 \u2014 the start of the Eid al-Fitr party that goes through June 15.\u201cI\u2019m really excited about it,\u201d Huda Khwaja, 20, of Atlanta, said of Party City\u2019s effort. \u201cIt makes me feel like we\u2019re less of an oddity.\u201dMs. Khwaja, a recent college graduate, has been decorating for Ramadan her whole life. Her parents wanted the holiday to be meaningful and fun for her and her seven younger siblings, she said. Their decorations were usually homemade and consisted of signs, chain links and streamers all made of paper, as well as twinkle lights, she said.To some degree, Ms. Khwaja\u2019s parents were ahead of the curve. Adorning a home for Ramadan and the Eid is not necessarily traditional for Muslims, but it has become increasingly popular.\u201cI converted to Islam in 2001, and I definitely see a big difference,\u201d said Jittaun Jones, 39, of Elk Grove, Calif., the mother of two young boys. \u201cIn the last 10 years, more and more people with kids find it really important to go all out because Christmas is such a big deal, and holidays are such a big deal.\u201dMariam Abdelgawad, 29, who has three young children, agreed that decorating helps Muslim families contend with the hype around the December holidays, and helps children feel connected to their religion and culture while also being American.The Party City website has recently been shared among different Muslim groups, Ms. Abdelgawad said, adding that people often pass around information on how to find new decorations this time of year.Aside from the Oriental Trading Company, Party City does not have a lot of direct competition in the party-goods market. As for Ramadan decorations, its only major competitors are Etsy and Amazon, which both offer a good variety.\u201cWe are the fastest growing religious community in America, and I think that businesses are beginning to realize that there\u2019s a market out there for us,\u201d said Ms. Jones.Party City is not worried. Mr. Vero said that regardless of religion or holiday preferences, the company is always looking to support its customers.Some American Muslims also feel that, with more ugliness directed toward Islam recently, it\u2019s increasingly important to celebrate openly.\u201cWe want our kids to feel attached to Ramadan, and it\u2019s really hard in today\u2019s political climate, where everything about Muslims is kind of questioned,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Jones said. \u201cYou want your children to be proud and have these amazing memories. This is a really awesome holiday, too.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Surprising Way to Eat Vegetables: For Dessert", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStruggling to cut down on added sugar and get more vegetables into your diet? Take a lesson from some of the best chefs in the country and try eating vegetables for dessert.Chefs are pushing the culinary boundaries of traditional desserts, reducing added sugars and experimenting with the natural sweetness of corn, carrots, fennel, squash, sweet potatoes and other vegetables. At the restaurant Gwen in Los Angeles, a deliciously sweet roasted artichoke, celery sorbet and green olives with cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche cheesecake have appeared on the dessert menu. At Blue Hill in New York City last fall, diners delighted in the natural sweetness of a honeynut squash with ice cream, parsnip cake and naturally sweet carrot sorbet.\u201cWe\u2019re shooting for a pastry kitchen that doesn\u2019t gratuitously use any sugar because there is so much natural sweetness in the fruits and vegetables we use,\u201d said Dan Barber, the Blue Hill chef and co-owner who works with the pastry chef Joel De La Cruz to create veggie-focused desserts. \u201cWe like looking at vegetables in a new way.\u201dAt Gramercy Tavern in Manhattan, pecan pear cake is served with arugula and blue cheese mousse. A grapefruit panna cotta includes cilantro and avocado, and a popular green curry ice cream sundae gets its kick from curry made with chiles, cilantro, lemongrass and other traditional Thai ingredients.\u201cWe always want to use something that makes sense and adds a little different note to a dessert,\u201d said Miro Uskokovic, the pastry chef at Gramercy Tavern. \u201cAnd many vegetables \u2014 carrots, celery, beets, sunchoke \u2014 have so much sugar. You can manipulate them in such a way that it eats like a dessert.\u201dWhile it may sound far-fetched to serve vegetables for dessert at the family table, chefs say the lesson for home cooks is to recognize the high sugar content in many vegetables and cook them in a way that enhances the food\u2019s natural sweetness. Too often, home cooks take a puritanical approach to vegetables in a quest to make them more healthful, serving them without butter or sauce and cooking them only briefly.\u201cIt\u2019s as simple as cook the heck out of root vegetables,\u201d Mr. Barber said. \u201cI like the idea of root vegetables simply roasted for a long time. You\u2019re getting out all the water you can and caramelizing all the sugars. Add a scoop of ice cream, and it\u2019s a great experience.\u201dFor Blue Hill\u2019s squash dessert, the honeynut squash \u2014 a smaller, sweeter relative of butternut squash \u2014 was roasted for several hours, scooped out and dried further on the stove top. \u201cEvery bite you are taking is squash times 800 percent,\u201d Mr. Barber said. \u201cIf it was picked at the right moment, it bombs with sweetness. That\u2019s true of parsnips, celery roots and beets as well.\u201dAlthough we tend to think of vegetables as a savory food, every vegetable has a natural range of sugar that can vary based on the soil and growing conditions, how recently it was picked and whether it was in the ground during a freeze.A food\u2019s sugar content is measured on a Brix scale (named after Adolf Brix, the German chemist who first measured sugar in plant juice) \u2014 the higher the number, the sweeter the food.For instance, sweet corn can average about 10 on the Brix scale, but can go as high as 24, putting it in the same range as grapes, oranges, papayas and pineapples. Carrots can range from 4 to 18 \u2014 similar to kumquats, mangoes and raspberries. Bananas and melons can measure around 12 to 14 on the Brix scale, along with tomatoes, sweet potatoes, English peas, beets, broccoli, celery and cucumbers.During cold weather, root vegetables like carrots and parsnips convert starch to sugar to prevent freezing, resulting in a sweeter taste. As a result, a carrot or parsnip picked after a freeze will have a higher sugar content than those harvested before the freeze.Chefs note that not every vegetable works alone as dessert. Recently during a master cooking class, Mr. Uskokovic tasted a dessert made with radicchio, simple syrup, macadamia nut cream and wild rose flavors. \u201cIt was beautiful and delicious, but I think it needed more sugar,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was too borderline salad.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never been a huge fan of rhubarb, but I\u2019ve reached for celery over and over again,\u201d Mr. Stupak said. \u201cI think it has brilliant effects in the dessert world.\u201d\u201cI love tasting avocado in the sweet context,\u201d Mr. Stupak said. \u201cIf you really eat an avocado and close your eyes and taste it, the flavors are subtly nutty and almost anise-like or fennel-like.\u201dMr. Stupak noted that carrot cake, while popular, doesn\u2019t really taste like carrots. \u201cSomething like a carrot sorbet or carrot ice cream gets much closer to transmitting the flavor,\u201d he said. He said he once served a carrot ice cream made with carrot pur\u00e9e and many people thought it had the orange and vanilla flavors of a creamsicle. \u201cI love that because they are tasting facets of a carrot they haven\u2019t tasted before,\u201d he said.Mr. Stupak said he happily mashes and pur\u00e9es vegetables at home that he turns into cakes and cookies for his two young children. \u201cIt\u2019s a very clever way to get someone to eat their vegetables,\u201d he said.And if you try cooking a vegetable for dessert and it\u2019s not quite sweet enough for your palate, Mr. Barber has an easy fix. \u201cFor the home cook, I don\u2019t have a problem putting sugar on vegetables for dessert,\u201d he said. \u201cThe sweetness will still be a lot less than a conventional dessert.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Slump? Tech, Trade Drag Down Stocks: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Good Monday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching.\u2022 Elon Musk finally responded to last week\u2019s bad news about Tesla.\u2022 Trump continues to go after Amazon.\u2022 China retaliated to President Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs.\u2022 Tech leaders have been keeping mum on Facebook.For months, the stock market rally seemed to have the strength to plow through the obstacles that the Trump administration threw in its way.But now, the S.&P. 500 index is down more than 10 percent from its all-time high.Too much blame can be placed on the White House, however.Before investors began fretting about tech and trade, the underpinnings of the stock market\u2019s ascent were perhaps not as robust as they looked. Wall Street analysts expect earnings for the companies in the S.&P. 500 to increase 25 percent this year, according to data compiled by Standard & Poor\u2019s, an unusually large jump that was reflected in the stock market valuations. Much of that projected earnings increase is coming from tax cuts and some from expectations that companies\u2019 revenue would grow at a nice clip as global growth stayed strong.\u2014 Peter EavisA little humor has not cleared the clouds over Tesla.The accident renews questions about Autopilot, a signature feature of Tesla vehicles, and whether the company has gone far enough to ensure that it keeps drivers and passengers safe.Raj Rajkumar, who researches autonomous driving at Carnegie Mellon University, thinks those assumptions concern one of Tesla\u2019s key sensors. \u201cThe radars they use are apparently meant for detecting moving objects (as typically used in adaptive cruise control systems), and seem to be not very good in detecting stationary objects,\u201d he says.Doubts about the fundamental capabilities of Tesla\u2019s Autopilot could crimp demand for its cars among a customer base that is often seeking the best technology.Out of respect for the privacy of our customer and his family, we do not plan to share any additional details until we conclude the investigation.- Peter EavisTech companies are again dragging down stocks on Wall Street.The S.&P. 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite are off 3.1 percent and 3.5 percent Monday. The continued fall in the share prices of some of the biggest tech companies is weighing heavily on the indexes.Amazon is down 5.4 percent, Netflix is off 5.9 percent, Facebook fell 3 percent, Google-parent Alphabet slipped 3.6 percent and Apple dropped 5.9 percent.After leading the market higher for much of the past two years, tech stocks have hit some turbulence. Since March 16, Facebook, Alphabet, Netflix and Amazon are all down more than 12 percent, while Apple is down 7.3 percent.Over that period the business models of those companies have come under increased scrutiny. News that Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm hired by President Trump\u2019s 2016 election campaign, gained access to private information on more than 50 million Facebook users has weighed not only on the shares of Facebook but on Alphabet as well. Amazon, meanwhile, has come under attack from President Trump.President Trump attacked the e-commerce again on Monday morning.Monday\u2019s tweet is the latest over the past five days from Mr. Trump criticizing Amazon. Over that period, Mr. Trump has accused Amazon of not paying enough taxes, of putting thousands of local retailers out of business and of using the United States Postal Service as its \u201cDelivery Boy.\u201dAmazon\u2019s shares are down 4 percent and are off nearly 11 percent since Axios reported on Wednesday about Mr. Trump\u2019s anger toward the company.Context\u2022 Amazon has said that the Postal Regulatory Commission, which oversees the service, has consistently found that its contracts with Amazon are profitable.Critic\u2019s cornerDA Davidson analyst Tom Forte wrote in a note via Reuters:\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s comments are consistent with industry sources we have spoken to in the shipping industry, who often label Amazon\u2019s deal with the USPS as a sweetheart deal. An argument, however, could be made that the USPS was losing billions before it expanded its service offerings for Amazon and would, still, likely lose billions if Amazon discontinued its use of the USPS tomorrow.\u201dCiting anonymous sources, Bloomberg\u2019s Ian King and Matt Gurman report:\u201cThe initiative, code named Kalamata, is still in the early developmental stages, but comes as part of a larger strategy to make all of Apple\u2019s devices \u2014 including Macs, iPhones, and iPads \u2014 work more similarly and seamlessly together.\u201dApple provides Intel with about 5 percent of its annual revenue.Kenneth C. Griffin\u2019s Citadel has just hired Phil Villhauer, a former top trader at Steven A. Cohen\u2019s investment firm. Mr. Villhauer will become deputy head of global equities at Citadel, a newly created position. He will officially join the Chicago-based hedge fund in the middle of April and work out of Citadel\u2019s office in New York, a Citadel spokesman confirmed.\u201cWe see this as a big hire for us,\u201d said Zia Ahmed, a Citadel spokesman.In January, Mr. Cohen reconfigured Point72 as a hedge fund after establishing it as a family office in 2014 to manage $11 billion of his personal wealth. Point72 has said it has raised between $2 billion and $4 billion in outside money.Mr. Villhauer had been with Mr. Cohen through both the good days and bad days. He was there when SAC turned into a powerhouse hedge fund, and he was there when the fund pleaded guilty to insider trading charges in 2013. The guilty plea required the firm to stop managing money for outside investors.When Mr. Villhauer left Point72, Mr. Cohen, in a letter to employees, called the departure a \u201cretirement\u201d and said he was sad to see Mr. Villhauer go.Now Mr. Villhauer will start a new chapter in his career at another well-known hedge fund firm.____________________________Part of the silence, people in the industry say, comes from a desire to avoid the business equivalent of bad karma \u2014 knowing that they, too, may one day face the buzz saw of public censure.Critic\u2019s corner More on data and privacy The Chinese government said on Monday that it would place tariffs on the imports of 128 American-made products in retaliation for to President Trump\u2019s tariffs on steel and aluminum.The Washington flyaroundWhen the Justice Department allowed Live Nation to merge with Ticketmaster, it tried to assuage concerns that the deal would cripple competitors.But critics have reason to be skeptical. Here\u2019s how Beau Buffier, the chief of the New York Attorney General\u2019s Antitrust Bureau, described Live Nation:\u201cIt is now widely seen as the poster child for the problems that arise when enforcers adopt these temporary fixes to limit the anticompetitive effects of deeply problematic vertical mergers.\u201dThe inquiries come as the department is reviewing two more mergers, between AT&T and Time Warner, and Disney and Fox.The department\u2019s new antitrust chief has said that the Live Nation deal and several other deals posed problems because they relied too much on the federal government\u2019s ability to police corporate behavior.\u201cEven if we wanted to do that, we often don\u2019t have the skills or the tools to do so effectively,\u201d the antitrust chief, Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, said in a speech.More for your playlistThe deals flyaroundAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Do Taxpayers Know They Are Handing Out Billions to Corporations?", "Date": "2018-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorEvery year, states and local governments give economic-development incentives to companies to the tune of between $45 billion and $80 billion. Why such a wide range? It\u2019s not sloppy research; it\u2019s because many of these subsidies are not public.Economic development all across the country is getting less open \u2014 and both Democrats and Republicans are doing it. In fact, in many cases, the politicians themselves aren\u2019t even the ones negotiating for the public.How do communities balance the tremendous opportunity of attracting a world-class company against the taxpayer costs, the pressures on our infrastructure and our struggles of providing affordable housing?Many of these companies want to hide their proposed jobs and wages on the initial application \u2014 it\u2019s an extremely effective way of making it impossible to evaluate if these companies kept their promises to create high-paying jobs in exchange for taxpayer dollars.Other states are also secretive about economic development. Amazon\u2019s brazen public call for proposals for its second headquarters reveals how far governments will go to keep these secrets. Some cities and states revealed their bids, including New Jersey\u2019s $7 billion taxpayer-funded incentive. But the majority didn\u2019t. In January, when Amazon cut down this list down to 20 locations, the finalists signed nondisclosure agreements to keep the rest of the process secret.Another strategy to avoid transparency in a competition like this is through complexity. The idea is to make economic development so twisted that it\u2019s nearly impossible to figure out who is responsible for it. If governments aren\u2019t submitting these bids, with taxpayers\u2019 money, who is responsible for economic development?The recent bidding war for Amazon and failure of communities to live up to the Standards Board reporting rule reveals that weak transparency laws can be further thwarted by using the complexity of these programs.Advertisement"}

The tone is set at the top, by a boss who maintains serious conflicts of interest, glories in nepotism and treats the presidency as a gilded marketing opportunity. Trump\u2019s example is a green light for corruption.A leader knows whose counsel to seek and whose to be wary of. Trump knows only the siren\u2019s song of sycophants saying what he wants to hear. He\u2019s not interested in a diversity of input and information. One obsequious, affirming channel will do.He doesn\u2019t do what a leader should and challenge himself \u2014 and the rest of us \u2014 to be bigger. He exploits his privilege to be as small as possible. With all the world watching and potentially taking cues from him, he crassly insults just about anyone who crosses him. It\u2019s equal parts pathology and sport.A leader tells the truth. I needn\u2019t extend that thought by so much as a syllable.Other presidents had their fictions. Their flaws. Trump is hardly soiling some pristine tradition. To suggest so is to validate his belief that he\u2019s persecuted.But to pretend that he\u2019s an unremarkable link in the chain is crazier, and that\u2019s not merely because of his unconventional r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and attachment to Twitter. He lacks the flashes of valor and moments of inspiration that immediate predecessors had.Will there be anything like that with Trump? Some memory of dignity or grace? The question, I fear, is rhetorical. While those presidents sometimes failed to lead, he doesn\u2019t even try.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Target Agrees to Review Screening of Job Applicants Amid Claims of Bias", "Date": "2018-04-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTarget agreed on Thursday to revise guidelines for how it screens people seeking jobs at its stores, a step meant to quell complaints that the retailer discriminates against black and Hispanic applicants with criminal records that can include offenses too minor or old to affect their performance as employees.Those pressing the complaints against Target said the agreement announced on Thursday would create even more opportunities for fresh starts.\u201cTarget\u2019s background check policy was out of step with best practices and harmful to many qualified applicants who deserved a fair shot at a good job,\u201d Sherrilyn Ifill, president and director-counsel at the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, said in a statement.The agreement addresses a series of complaints filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission by Carnella Times, who said Target declined to hire her after running a background check in 2006.It also seeks to resolve a potential class action filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan on Thursday by the legal defense fund and other lawyers representing Ms. Times; the Fortune Society, which works on behalf of former prisoners; and another job applicant. The settlement requires a judge\u2019s approval.The settlement calls for Target, which acknowledged no wrongdoing, to work with experts to adopt \u201cvalid\u201d guidelines for how it uses criminal records in hiring, and to finance a modest settlement fund. The company said it would still use background checks, but would bring in outside experts to review how the checks are used and would evaluate any recommended changes.Jenna Reck, a Target spokeswoman, said the company had made significant changes to its screening process in recent years \u2014 for instance, removing a criminal-history question from job applications. She wrote in an email that when hiring, Target tried \u201cto give everyone access to the same opportunities.\u201dAt issue was the company\u2019s practice of conducting criminal background checks on anyone applying for hourly and entry-level jobs in the United States.African-Americans and Hispanics are arrested and convicted at rates more than double those of whites, according to the suit, which said Target\u2019s hiring process \u201csystematically\u201d eliminated thousands of qualified applicants regardless of their potential to be good employees by requiring the automatic rejection of people convicted of offenses that could include violence, theft, fraud or drugs within the seven years of their applications.The policy, the suit said, \u201cimported acute racial and ethnic disparities in the criminal justice system into the employment process, thereby multiplying the negative impact on African-American and Latino job applicants.\u201dComplaints about background checks in retail-sector hiring are not unique to Target.The Target conflict\u2019s origins date to Ms. Times\u2019s attempt to be hired as an overnight stocker at a Target store in South Windsor, Conn.She said she had told Target interviewers that she had a misdemeanor conviction from 1996, when she was in her mid-20s. After several interviews, she said, she received what Target called a conditional job offer contingent on the results of a criminal-background check.Later, she received a letter from Target with a copy of a background report showing she had two misdemeanor convictions from 1996, and she was eventually told that she would not be hired, according to court papers.The second applicant named in the suit, Erving Smith, said he had applied for a job as a stocker at a Target store in Pittsburgh in 2014. He told interviewers that he had been convicted 10 years earlier of a drug-related felony, but received a conditional job offer.Mr. Smith said a store manager called later to tell him that the offer was being rescinded because of the results of a background check, according to the suit.The jobs in dispute included stocker, cashier and cart-attendant positions, which the suit said could provide \u201cstable employment for many individuals who lack formal education or technical job skills and who are trying to get their lives back on track after some interaction with the criminal justice system.\u201dAs part of the proposed settlement of the suit, Target agreed to institute a priority hiring process so that certain people who had been turned away could get jobs. Others who are retired, already employed or otherwise unable to benefit from a job would be eligible for awards of up to $1,000 apiece from the settlement fund, to which the company agreed to contribute $3.7 million.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Circe, a Vilified Witch From Classical Mythology, Gets Her Own Epic", "Date": "2018-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byProfileOn a cold, sunny afternoon in March, the novelist Madeline Miller wandered through the Greek and Roman galleries at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, swooning over ancient amphoras and ethereal statues of gods and goddesses.She was eager to see a particular artifact \u2014 a 2,500-year-old wine vessel painted with a scene from Homer\u2019s Odyssey, as Odysseus confronts the goddess and sorceress Circe after she transforms his men into pigs.Ms. Miller was riveted and horrified by that scene when she first read the Odyssey, and it became a pivotal moment in her new novel, \u201cCirce,\u201d a bold and subversive retelling of the goddess\u2019s story that manages to be both epic and intimate in its scope, recasting the most infamous female figure from the Odyssey as a hero in her own right.But on her way to see the vase, she kept getting distracted, dazzled by the mythical figures that have populated her imagination since she was a little girl, when her mother read passages to her from the Iliad and Odyssey at bedtime. More age-appropriate fare never grabbed her attention in the same way. \u201cI wanted gods and monsters,\u201d she said.Visiting the museum felt like a homecoming of sorts. Growing up on the Upper East Side, she spent hours roaming the Met, marveling at the heroes, warriors and deities. Exploring those halls decades later, she was just as awe-struck.\u201cThis is one of my favorites,\u201d she said, bounding toward a marble statue of a wounded Amazon warrior, noting that the figure would have once been brightly painted. \u201cYou can see the drops of blood on the side of her breast.\u201dShe spotted a terra-cotta plaque of Odysseus, disguised as a beggar, cautiously approaching his wife Penelope after he returns to Ithaca. \u201cI love the emotion that\u2019s conveyed in just her posture,\u201d she said.Tucked away in a dimly lit gallery was the Circe vase, which showed Odysseus pursuing Circe with his sword drawn as his pigheaded men trail helplessly behind him.\u201cCirce as a character is the embodiment of male anxiety about female power,\u201d Ms. Miller said, as she studied the vase, snapping photos with her phone. \u201cOf course she has to be vanquished.\u201dThat scene infuriated Ms. Miller when she read the Odyssey on her own, at 13. It bothered her that one of the most powerful female figures in the epic was left kneeling and cowering before Odysseus, and then takes him to bed as a conciliatory gesture. \u201cFor the hero to succeed, the woman has to be put in her place, and that was always so disappointing,\u201d she said.Years later, when she was majoring in classics at Brown University and read the Odyssey in the original Homeric Greek for the first time, Ms. Miller began to rethink Circe\u2019s story, which unfolds from Odysseus\u2019s perspective, as he describes his time on her island to the Phaeacians. She saw that Circe, far from being purely a villain or a vanquished witch, had a benevolent side and played a crucial role guiding Odysseus back to Ithaca.She had planned to stay away from epics for a while, but kept thinking about the witch, alone on her island. Why did she transform men into animals? What happened to her after Odysseus and his crew sailed away, or in the centuries before they arrived? She decided Circe deserved her own epic.\u201cEpic has been so traditionally male,\u201d she said. \u201cAll these stories are composed by men, largely starring men, and I really wanted a female perspective.\u201dRecycling classical myths is a well-worn literary trope; everyone from Shakespeare to Margaret Atwood and Rick Riordan have riffed on and remixed Greek and Roman stories. Ms. Miller, 39, who lives outside Philadelphia, is particularly well equipped to tackle Homer. She began studying Latin when she was 12, started on Greek a couple of years later, and seems to have near encyclopedic knowledge of ancient Western gods and goddesses.\u201cCirce\u201d \u2014 a feminist reboot starring a goddess who has often been overlooked, or miscast as a vindictive seductress \u2014 has drawn praise both from classics scholars and novelists like Margaret George and Ann Patchett.Emily Wilson, a classicist who recently published a new translation of the Odyssey, said she was skeptical at first of yet another \u201cretelling of a classical myth,\u201d but was won over by Ms. Miller\u2019s take. \u201cWhat she\u2019s doing is partly about gender, but it\u2019s also addressing a bigger question about power, and the abuse of power,\u201d she said.In Ms. Miller\u2019s version, Circe\u2019s encounter with Odysseus is only a slice of her story, which unfolds over thousands of years and begins in the palace of her father, the sun god Helios. Her family members, who treat her with cruelty or indifference, become infamous in their own right: Her sister Pasiphae marries King Minos and gives birth to the Minotaur, a bullheaded, man-eating monster; while her brother Aeetes grows up to rule Colchis, the land of the Golden Fleece, and fathers Medea, who later murders her children.Circe\u2019s fortune changes when she discovers her power to transform. After she turns a nymph, Scylla, into a six-headed sea monster, Helios banishes Circe to a remote island where she spends centuries in exile, with wolves and lions as her companions.Ms. Miller was intrigued by Homer\u2019s description of Circe as \u201dspeaking like a human,\u201d an odd detail that is never fully explained in the Odyssey. In her novel, Circe\u2019s deceptively soft voice produces grave consequences. When sailors wash up on her island, she welcomes them with wine and food, and they mistake her for a mortal. After a violent encounter with one sailor, she begins preemptively attacking them, turning them into pigs.To flesh out Circe\u2019s story, Ms. Miller looked beyond the Odyssey and consulted a handful of ancient texts. She found scattered references to Circe across the ancient world, and drew from the plot of the Telegony, an epic preserved only in a short summary, which tells the story of Telegonus, Odysseus and Circe\u2019s son.She plucked other details from the Argonautica, an epic poem about the voyage of Jason and the Argonauts, which describes how Circe performs a purification ritual for Jason and Medea.She wove some of the mythology into her narrative, and ignored other depictions that struck her as silly or sexist, deliberately omitting a scene from Ovid\u2019s Metamorphoses where Circe punishes a king who spurns her advances by turning him into a woodpecker.\u201cThat\u2019s one of the funny things about mythological realism, or whatever it is that I write,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to write about six-headed monsters, but from a realistic perspective.\u201dIt\u2019s perhaps the same reason Ms. Miller loves the Greek and Roman antiquities at the Met, works of art that feel both timeless and transcendent, yet lifelike. As she made her way through the treasure-filled galleries, she kept \u201cnerding out,\u201d as she sheepishly called it, over the relics. She paused to admire a marble figure of Aphrodite crouching in the bath and a headless statue of Hermes.A look of excitement crossed her face as she rushed toward one of her favorite artifacts. \u201cIf you will indulge me, there\u2019s a chariot,\u201d she said, practically skipping off.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Deutsche Bank is finally, and drastically, shrinking itself.\u2022 Facebook can afford to clean up its act.\u2022 Is the problem with I.P.O.s a \u2018middle-market tax\u2019?\u2022 On today\u2019s earnings calendar: Amazon, Microsoft, PepsiCo and Lazard.Since the financial crisis a decade ago, the German institution\u2019s giant investment banking operations have lagged well behind those of its rivals. And Deutsche Bank\u2019s problems had relevance well beyond the trading desks of Wall Street; its difficulties have at times pumped uncertainty into the global financial system. Deutsche Bank\u2019s post-crisis behavior stands in contrast to that of other European investment banks that had also become risky and bloated before the 2008 meltdown. Switzerland\u2019s Credit Suisse and UBS made hard decisions several years ago that helped them adapt to new realities. But Deutsche Bank wavered and delayed. And since this probably won\u2019t be the last time that a too-big-to-fail bank takes too long to fix itself, it\u2019s worth asking why Deutsche Bank dragged its feet. Some reasons follow:- Peter EavisDeutsche Bank\u2019s decision to end its Wall Street ambitions should benefit its American rivals.The German lender said on Thursday that it was scaling back operations such as trading and providing services to hedge funds. According to a note from Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Deutsche Bank\u2019s decision to shrink its investment banking business should \u201chelp industry pricing and provide a revenue opportunity\u201d for United States banks.Deutsche Bank\u2019s scale of tradingLast year Deutsche Bank had a 7.7 percent share of the trading in bonds, currencies and commodities, and a 5.1 percent share of stock trading.Deutsche Bank reported \u20ac4.4 billion in revenue from fixed-income trading last year and another \u20ac2.1 billion from equity trading. Of the combined \u20ac6.5 billion in revenue it generated, 40 percent came from the United States, according to a note from Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.Which banks stand to benefitJPMorgan, Bank of America and Citigroup should get a lift from Deutsche Bank\u2019s pull back from fixed-income trading. The three banks\u2019 market share of fixed-income trading is nearly 50 percent.For stock trading, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan have about 45 percent of the market.Amazon\u2019s profit more than doubled during the first quarter, while Microsoft\u2019s earnings jumped 35 percent. A driver for both companies was their cloud-computing businesses.Amazon\u2019s numbers\u2022 The e-commerce giant reported a profit of $1.6 billion, up from $724 million a year ago.\u2022 Earnings per share came in at $3.27. Analysts expected $1.26 per share, according to Thomson Reuters.\u2022 Revenue jumped 43 percent to $51 billion, beating analysts\u2019 expectations of $49.78 billion.\u2022 Operating income increased 92 percent to $1.9 billion in the first quarter.\u2022 Sales for Amazon Web Services, its cloud-computing business, increased 49 percent to $5.4 billion.Critic\u2019s corner\u201cSales have more than doubled in five years, but it\u2019s taking more fixed assets to get there. Amazon now uses property and such with less efficiency than Walmart.\u201dMicrosoft\u2019s numbers\u2022 The software giant posted a profit of $7.42 billion, up from $5.49 billion a year ago.\u2022 Earnings per share came in at 95 cents. Analysts expected 85 cents per share.\u2022 Revenue rose 16 percent to $26.82 billion, beating expectations of $25.77 billion.\u2022 Operating income rose 23 percent to $8.3 billion.\u2022 Revenue at Azure, Microsoft\u2019s could-computing business, surged 93 percent.Shares of Amazon climbed 7 percent after hours, while Microsoft\u2019s stock rose 2.1 percent.Critics\u2019 cornerSince hitting an intraday low of $150.80 on March 28, the stock has climbed 15 percent and reclaimed more than $60 billion in market value.Ross Sandler, an analyst at Barclays, writes:\u201cWe don\u2019t think 1Q marks the \u201call clear\u201d for FB shares by any means, but given the drubbing over the past two months, we think it may start an overdue stabilization period (next week\u2019s f8 should also help move the conversation back to innovation to some degree). Stepping back, FB\u2019s valuation is attractive vs. its peers, and while we fully expect more tape-bombs in 2018 we think patient investors will be rewarded at current levels when sentiment eventually improves.\u201dFacebook\u2019s first-quarter earnings featured a 63 percent jump in profit and a 49 percent rise in revenue. And roughly 70 million new monthly active users.Peter Eavis\u2019s take: If Facebook wants to spend more on protecting its community, it can: Its operating earnings are equivalent to 46 percent of its revenue. But its expense numbers haven\u2019t provided clear evidence that the company is going the extra mile yet.The key assessment, from the Pivotal analyst Brian Wieser:\u201cAll the data privacy issues, the congressional hearings, none of that will get as much scrutiny from investors as the bottom line.\u201dThe chipmaker reported results Wednesday that topped Wall Street\u2019s expectations. The conference call that followed provided analysts an opportunity to ask about where Qualcomm\u2019s acquisition of NXP stands. The deal is awaiting approval from Chinese regulators, but growing trade tension between China and the United States has increasingly put the deal in doubt.Here is what Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm\u2019s chief executive, said on the call:\u201cWe continue to work closely with China. The environment is obviously quite difficult from a geopolitical point of view, at least right now. However, we expect to ultimately receive approval. And I\u2019ll just remind folks that we have 8 of 9 jurisdictions that have already ruled on it. So although we \u2014 we remain committed to it. And we think it\u2019s going to get done. However, if it does not get done, as you mentioned, we think we have the ability to move very rapidly on a buyback as we communicated earlier in the January time frame. I\u2019ll just remind everyone that we did a 90-day extension to the merger agreement. And we\u2019re going to work very hard to get that done. And if it doesn\u2019t get done, we\u2019re going to move on to another approach. So hopefully, that answers the question.\u201dA bit later in the call Mr. Mollenkopf added:\u201cWith respect to MOFCOM and remedies, our evaluation of the environment is such that really, I think the issue is probably more related to the higher-level discussions between the countries as opposed to any individual issue related to MOFCOM. Of course, we continue to work with the regulators and work through any issues that pop up. But I think the environmental issues between the countries are probably more the situation today than anything else. But obviously, we work closely with the regulator.\u201dIt\u2019s not just regulations like Sarbanes-Oxley that put smaller companies off public listings, argues Rob Jackson, a Democratic S.E.C. commissioner \u2014 it\u2019s the fact that they pay on average 7 percent of proceeds raised in their offerings, way more than bigger clients.\u201cWith the deck stacked against them, it\u2019s no wonder that middle-market I.P.O.s have been on a steady decline. And this has had real effects across our economy, which is now dominated by fewer, and larger, public companies than ever before.\u201dHe suggests the S.E.C. should make underwriters disclose more about the costs of going public, including companies\u2019 potential losses from underpricing, and that bankers should do more to explain why they\u2019re worth their fees.What Jeffrey Lurie, the owner of the Philadelphia Eagles, said, according to the NYT:\u201cWe\u2019ve got to be careful not to be baited by Trump or whomever else.\u201dBob Kraft of the New England Patriots, a friend of Mr. Trump, said:\u201cThe problem we have is, we have a president who will use that as fodder to do his mission that I don\u2019t feel is in the best interests of America.\u201dThere\u2019s no question that it will help make sense of Randall Stephenson\u2019s expansion of AT&T into the pay-TV market and improve AT&T\u2019s positioning and value proposition.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Is Creepy. And Valuable.", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneOne of the most telling moments in the spectacle of Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s congressional testimony last week was when Representative Billy Long, a Missouri Republican, warned the co-founder of Facebook of what Congress was likely to do about its multiple concerns surrounding the social network. \u201cCongress is good at two things: doing nothing, and overreacting,\u201d he said. After years of the former, he said, \u201cwe\u2019re getting ready to overreact.\u201dThat sounds worrisome. But I sympathize. Doing nothing and overreacting make sense when you have no clue of what is going on. And we don\u2019t. The cloud of questions aimed at Mr. Zuckerberg \u2014 Is Facebook too dominant? Does it censor information? Whom does it share our data with? Does it help sell OxyContin? \u2014 suggests that we don\u2019t really know what the problem with Facebook is. It also suggests we don\u2019t understand what Facebook does.That goes for the entire data-driven ecosystem, from Google to the auto companies riddling your car with sensors that can tell where you\u2019ve been and how fast you got there. And that puts policymakers in an uncomfortable spot.The crucial issue for Congress, government regulators, members of the public and even Mr. Zuckerberg is how much all this data-driven stuff is worth to us. What do we stand to lose by, say, sharply limiting the data these companies can collect? What do we stand to gain?We don\u2019t know.\u201cWe don\u2019t understand the value to us of the new data economy nor the risks it entails,\u201d said Leonard Nakamura, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia who has studied the economic impact of data. \u201cWe just let it rip and now are trying to catch up.\u201d Unfortunately, we have only rudimentary tools to measure the good and the bad.As the data-driven economy continues evolving at breakneck speed, catching up may be beyond our reach; we will build the guardrails by trial and error. The risk is that policy will be driven mostly by fear.What is the problem with Facebook? Clearly Moscow\u2019s use of the platform to spread fake news and warp the 2016 elections is one problem. Allowing data from tens of millions of users to flow, without their knowledge, to a political consultancy working for Donald Trump is another.But the raw business models of the colossi of the data economy are creepy in and of themselves. Start with the sheer scale of personal data scooped up by Facebook, often without users\u2019 knowledge. The platform not only harvests the data you share with the platform, but also collects information about you from the files of other Facebook users you know. It buys data about your offline lives from data brokers \u2014 including sensitive stuff like your income and the credit cards you own. And testifying in the House, Mr. Zuckerberg admitted that Facebook sucks up information about people who are not even on Facebook, so it can aim ads at them.But policy cannot be determined only by the potential creepiness of what corporate America might do with our data. Maybe perfect price discrimination will never take off because consumers don\u2019t like it.Indeed, it is unclear to what extent consumers are repelled by any of this. Though surveys repeatedly find that Americans are concerned about their privacy, they rarely take action to stop cookies and other tools deployed to gather their data \u2014 leading scholars to coin the term \u201cprivacy paradox.\u201d As Sinan Aral of the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has noted, \u201cLots of the things that depend on ads we want as public goods.\u201dBut this must understate the data economy\u2019s contribution to our well-being. Facebook is an immensely valuable mode of communication and interaction for two billion people around the world. The company has published in-house research suggesting that people who do lots of sharing on the social network are happier and healthier.Facebook\u2019s advertising tools \u2014 the ones that use your data to figure out whether you should see an ad from the small shop in Connecticut that sells organic yarn \u2014 provide mom-and-pop operations with cost-effective marketing opportunities once reserved for large corporations.More broadly, Mr. Nakamura points out, the online economy powered by data collection and advertising is improving welfare in a way not properly captured in standard measures of economic output. This includes reams of \u201cfree\u201d music and the potential benefits from the artificial intelligence that will be trained using personal data. The consumer surplus \u2014 the benefit that we get from a good or service above and beyond the price we pay for it \u2014 is bigger than it ever was. And it will grow further.And yet if this sounds like an argument against touching the data-driven digital economy with even the slightest regulation, it is not. Worries that Facebook and some of its brethren may have become large enough to squelch innovation are legitimate. So are suspicions that it plays fast and loose with consumer data.Regulations to curb the power of the digital behemoths \u2014 say, barring them from buying up rising companies like Instagram and WhatsApp that might threaten their dominance in the future \u2014 make sense. So do policies that ensure responsible stewardship of the data they gather.\u201dI don\u2019t think the right policy position is to totally eliminate the business model, but instead to introduce some restraint,\u201d said Terrell McSweeny, the lone Democrat on the Federal Trade Commission. \u201cThe idea is to give people more control over the uses of their data and ensure companies are responsible for what is happening to it.\u201dSummoning Mr. Zuckerberg to testify suggests that Congress is no longer happy doing nothing. Hopefully, it can do better than simply overreact to its fears.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Trump, It\u2019s the \u2018Amazon Washington Post.\u2019 To Its Editor, That\u2019s Baloney.", "Date": "2018-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmazon does not own The Washington Post. President Trump, however \u2014 impervious to certain facts and armed with a Twitter account \u2014 has tried hard to convince the public otherwise.While Mr. Bezos has reinvigorated The Post, he has found himself vulnerable to the president\u2019s attacks. Since 2015, Mr. Trump has linked The Post and Amazon on Twitter a dozen times.How do the president\u2019s broadsides play inside The Post\u2019s newsroom?\u201cI don\u2019t even know how to describe what goes through my mind,\u201d Martin Baron, the paper\u2019s executive editor, said in a telephone interview on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s completely made up.\u201dPeople close to the president have said critical articles in The Post often trigger his public musings about Amazon. Last week, after The Post followed up on a story broken by The New York Times that Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyer had raised the prospect of offering pardons to two of Mr. Trump\u2019s former top advisers, Michael Flynn and Paul J. Manafort, Mr. Trump fired off a tweet saying that Amazon did not pay enough taxes and was \u201cputting many thousands of retailers out of business.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s tweeted criticisms of Mr. Bezos, Amazon and The Post may not have much bite. Lindsay Walters, a White House spokeswoman, told reporters last week that \u201cthe president has expressed his concerns with Amazon,\u201d adding, \u201cWe have no actions at this time.\u201dThe president\u2019s tweet storm may have had one real-world effect, however: Amazon\u2019s stock fell 5.2 percent on Monday, a day when the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index dropped 2.2 percent.\u201cDo I think it\u2019s a bad thing that the president is attacking a news outlet, period? Yes,\u201d said Indira Lakshmanan, who holds the Newmark chair in journalism ethics at the Poynter Institute, a center for media studies. \u201cAnd that he\u2019s attacking a business owned by an owner of a media company? Yes, if there are no grounds for it.\u201dOn Monday, Mr. Baron said The Post was not cowed by Mr. Trump\u2019s invectives. \u201cWe cover him the way that we feel any president should be covered,\u201d he said. After Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets on Saturday, the paper published an article under the headline \u201cTrump accuses Amazon of \u2018Post Office scam,\u2019 falsely says The Post is company\u2019s lobbyist.\u201dMr. Baron also rebuffed any suggestion that The Post was a lobbyist for Amazon, as Mr. Trump has proclaimed at times.\u201cThere isn\u2019t anybody here who is paid by Amazon,\u201d he said. \u201cNot one penny.\u201d(Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment or to provide an interview with Mr. Bezos.)Mr. Bezos holds conference calls with The Post\u2019s leadership every other week to discuss the paper\u2019s business strategy but has no involvement in its news coverage, Mr. Baron said. During his occasional appearances at The Post\u2019s building, Mr. Bezos sometimes stops by a news meeting \u201cjust to thank everybody,\u201d Mr. Baron said.\u201cI can\u2019t say more emphatically he\u2019s never suggested a story to anybody here, he\u2019s never critiqued a story, he\u2019s never suppressed a story,\u201d the editor said.\u201cFrankly, in a newsroom of 800 journalists, if that had occurred, I guarantee you, you would have heard about it,\u201d he added. \u201cNewsrooms tend not to like those kinds of interventions, particularly a newsroom that\u2019s as proud as The Washington Post.\u201cIf he had been involved in our news coverage, you can be sure that you would have heard about it by now,\u201d Mr. Baron added. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t happened. Period.\u201dMr. Bezos\u2019 hands-off approach extends to The Post\u2019s coverage of Amazon. During a town hall-style meeting held before his deal for The Post was completed, he told the paper\u2019s employees that they should cover him as they would any other business executive and treat Amazon no differently from any other company, Mr. Baron said.\u201cHe\u2019s reiterated that to me any number of times,\u201d he said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t get involved. I\u2019ve never heard from him on any story that we\u2019ve written about Amazon, and we\u2019ve had any number of them that are critical.\u201d\u201cSo funny to watch Fake News Networks, among the most dishonest groups of people I have ever dealt with, criticize Sinclair Broadcasting for being biased,\u201d the president tweeted, responding to negative reports over the weekend about the Sinclair Broadcast Group. \u201cSinclair is far superior to CNN and even more Fake NBC, which is a total joke.\u201dNick Wingfield contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jamie Dimon\u2019s Letter \u2014 Handicapping a Run for President in 2020: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Good Thursday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Jamie Dimon chafes under liquidity rules.\u2022 Mark Zuckerberg has disclosed more on how much Facebook user data may have been accessed.\u2022 The White House is still talking tough on trade with China.\u2022 Blackstone\u2019s infrastructure fund isn\u2019t doing so well.On Wall Street, there\u2019s been a running parlor game about whether Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s chief executive, would try to run for president in 2020. His annual letters, filled with commentary on U.S. policy, have only increased the chatter, and this year\u2019s letter, released Thursday, is no different. It touches on everything from trade to immigration. While Mr. Dimon, who once called himself \u201cbarely a Democrat,\u201d says he plans to stay at the bank for the next five years, the question among political prognosticators is whether Mr. Dimon\u2019s policy views could ever find a home among voters in this politically polarized environment.Mr. Dimon\u2019s sensible letter was seemingly supportive of some of President Trump\u2019s policies, while taking the opposing side on others. Mr. Dimon particularly applauded the corporate tax cut and deregulation efforts. On China trade, Mr. Dimon writes: \u201cIt is not unreasonable for the United States to press ahead for more equivalency,\u201d and that \u201cone of the administration\u2019s best arguments is that negotiation alone has not worked.\u201d However, he said he would like to see more cooperation with U.S. allies on talks with China and added that the U.S. should \u201crevisit the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\u201dOn immigration, he called for tougher border control, writing, \u201cAmerican citizens have the right to complain that we have not successfully protected our borders since the last immigration reform in 1986.\u201d He also said, \u201cPeople immigrating to this country should be taught American history, our language and our principles.\u201d At the same time, he also advocated for \u201ca path to legal status and citizenship\u201d for \u201cDreamers\u201d and improving \u201cmerit-based immigration\u201d programs so that immigrants educated here can stay.Mr. Dimon made a point of saying that part of the problems facing the country is that too many people are talking past each other.\u201cWhen people argue as if there are binary solutions, the argument is almost always wrong,\u201d he wrote, advocating that people try to look at all sides of a situation. \u201cI tell my liberal friends to read columnists like Arthur Brooks and George Will. And I tell my conservative friends to read writers like Tom Friedman.\u201dIf Mr. Dimon were to run, he would likely have to do so as an independent. It is hard to see how liberal Democrats would embrace much of his deregulatory positions. And yet many of his positions \u2013 and especially some of his social positions not enunciated in his letter \u2014 may not be far right enough to capture the interest of Republicans.Maybe the country needs someone in the middle, but history has not been kind to third-party candidates.\u2014 Andrew Ross SorkinBut he also addressed a policy area much closer to home \u2013 bank regulation. Mr. Dimon often has expressed skepticism about aspects of the banking overhaul that took place in the wake of the financial crisis. But his remarks on regulation arguably carry more weight now. Congress is closer to modifying the post-crisis rules than at any point since Dodd-Frank was signed into law in 2010. An important regulatory requirement Mr. Dimon criticized, therefore, might become a focus for those wanting to roll back the rules.Mr. Dimon in this year\u2019s letter zeroed in on regulations that require banks to have a certain amount of liquidity, the financial term for access to cash or low-risk assets that can be easily sold for cash.In 2008, some large financial firms were crippled when customers, depositors and creditors withdrew their money. The Federal Reserve and taxpayers had to step in to support the banks. To help prevent a repeat of this, post-crisis rules require that banks hold a certain amount of liquid assets to cover a theoretical level of outflows. Mr. Dimon is in favor of banks having more liquidity than before the crisis, but in the letter, released Thursday, he wrote:Liquidity requirements, while much higher, now have an element of rigidity built in that did not exist before. Banks will be unable to use that liquidity when they most need to do so \u2014 to make loans or intermediate markets. They have a \u201cred line\u201d they cannot cross (they are required to maintain hard and fast liquidity requirements). As clients demand more liquidity from their banks, the banks essentially will be unable to provide it.First, a bank that lacks liquidity is in no position to lend. When a bank\u2019s creditors and customers fear it doesn\u2019t have enough cash in reserve, they will most likely withdraw their money. This not only deprives the bank of the money it needs to lend, it also sharply reduces its chance of survival. Or as Gregg Gelzinis of the left-leaning Center for American Progress puts it, \u201cYou won\u2019t be able to take this action if you fail.\u201dThe nation\u2019s largest bank holding companies have strong capital levels and retain their ability to lend to households and businesses during a severe recession.Andrew Gray, a JPMorgan spokesman, followed up with more material on Mr. Dimon\u2019s thinking on liquidity.He re-emphasized Mr. Dimon\u2019s point about having to tie up funds that could be used to make loans. Mr. Gray noted that a bank facing outflows would be expected to keep refilling its pool of liquid assets to be in compliance with a liquidity regulation. This would leave fewer funds for lending and making markets, Mr. Gray asserted.He also addressed the argument that higher capital levels, not liquidity, will largely determine the extent to which banks will lend through a downturn. Mr. Gray asserted that liquidity rules play an important role in ensuring banks have the resources to participate in wider financial markets. Rules forcing the hoarding of liquidity may, thus, crimp that activity.\u2014 Peter EavisMick Mulvaney, the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has complained that the regulator engages in \u201cwasteful spending.\u201d He even submitted a quarterly budget request recently of $0.That attitude apparently didn\u2019t apply to two of his recent hires.ContextThe consumer bureau, as well as fellow financial regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, is allowed under federal law to pay employees significantly more than other government agencies can pay. The rationale is that the higher salaries are necessary to recruit skilled employees who otherwise might land jobs on Wall Street.As a result, the C.F.P.B. is stocked with employees who earn more than the average Washington bureaucrat. Of the agency\u2019s 1,600 employees, 219 make more than $200,000, according to the records reviewed by The Times.\u2014 Stacy CowleyBlackRock, the world\u2019s largest money manager, plans to offer a series of new products allowing individuals and institutions to invest in market indexes without putting money into manufacturers and retailers of firearms.They include:\u2022 a new exchange-traded fund that will track the performance of the MSCI USA Small Cap Extended ESG Focus Index, composed of small stocks with favorable environmental, social and governance standards, while specifically excluding producers and large retailers of civilian firearms.\u2022 a similar credit-focused ETF that eschews the debt of gunmakers and distributors.\u2022 an option to take the guns out of institutional strategies tracking major market indexes, including the S&P 500, the Russell 2000 and three others.Critic\u2019s cornerRob Cox of Breakigviews writes:\u201cBlackRock\u2019s moves may spark criticism from gun-rights supporters, who lashed out at companies like Delta Air Lines that severed ties with the National Rifle Association. But it\u2019s hard to see how offering customers more choice is ever a bad idea. Moreover, by getting out early, BlackRock makes clear to those young people lobbying for tighter gun laws \u2013 who it hopes will be customers for decades to come \u2013 that it has something for them. Far from virtue signaling, it\u2019s simply good business.\u201d\u2022 Facebook said Cambridge Analytica harvested the data of 87 million users, not 50 million.\u2022 A vulnerability in search and account recovery functions may have exposed \u201cmost\u201d of Facebook\u2019s 2 billion users to unauthorized harvesting of their public profile information.A brighter note for Facebook: Its shares are up in premarket trading today, after Mr. Zuckerberg said that #DeleteFacebook didn\u2019t appear to be having much effect.The Facebook calendar\u2022 April 9: Alerts should start popping up for users whose information may have been shared with Cambridge Analytica.\u2022 April 10: Mr. Zuckerberg is scheduled to testify before the Senate\u2019s Commerce and Judiciary committees.\u2022 April 11: He will testify before the House Energy and Commerce Committee.People familiar with the negotiations say Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, and Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, have at times argued for more dialogue with the Chinese and quicker concessions that would help diminish the trade deficit. \u2026 Other top trade advisers, including longtime China critics like Robert Lighthizer and Peter Navarro, have taken a tougher stance.The United States trade deficit rose 1.6 percent to $57.6 billion, its highest level since October 2008. The deficit has now risen for six straight months, the longest such streak since 2000.The merchandise-trade gap with China narrowed to $34.7 billion in February from $35.5 billion. The Trump administration wants to cut $100 billion, or about 25 percent, from the annual deficit with China, Bloomberg points out. During President Trump\u2019s first year in office, the United States\u2019 trade deficit with China rose to $375.2 billion in 2017, a record high.Last May, Blackstone announced with great fanfare that it planned a $40 billion fund with Saudi Arabia to invest in U.S. infrastructure: up to $20 billion from the Saudis, who would match commitments by other outside partners. But as of now, Blackstone has secured just $575 million in such commitments \u2014 and missed two fund-raising deadlines.\u2022 The Saudis wanted the fund overseen by an investment committee, with a seat for them. Blackstone refused.\u2022 Many potential investors balked at committing money until an investment team was in place, a process that took some time.More from Scott Shane and Dai Wakabayashi of the NYT:That kind of idealistic stance, while certainly not shared by all Google employees, comes naturally to a company whose motto is \u201cDon\u2019t be evil,\u201d a phrase invoked in the protest letter. But it is distinctly foreign to Washington\u2019s massive defense industry and certainly to the Pentagon, where the defense secretary, Jim Mattis, has often said a central goal is to increase the \u201clethality\u201d of the United States military.The company line: \u201cWe\u2019re actively engaged across the company in a comprehensive discussion of this important topic.\u201dThe tech flyaround\u201cThe future of a combined Viacom and CBS is going to be driven by an increasing focus on international and scaling up,\u201d he wrote \u2014 an agenda better suited to Viacom\u2019s C.E.O., Bob Bakish.\u201cRetreating from the world is not the solution, nor is burning down the current system and starting anew.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "L.A. Times\u2019s New Owner Plans Big Moves. First Up, Relocating to the Suburbs.", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 As a son of Chinese immigrants growing up in apartheid South Africa, Patrick Soon-Shiong spent his afternoons racing through the streets of Port Elizabeth selling the evening newspaper. The job, he likes to say, shaped his views on the power of the press and the plight of the underdog.\u201cThe newspaper is really important to bind the community,\u201d he said in a recent interview at his biotechnology company\u2019s sprawling headquarters in Culver City, Calif. \u201cIt bound us in my world of South Africa, and it\u2019s really a voice for the people.\u201dIt is a conviction that Dr. Soon-Shiong, a biotech billionaire who is considered the richest man in Los Angeles, has relayed often in the days since he agreed to buy The Los Angeles Times from the media company Tronc for $500 million. But if his purchase was motivated by a nostalgia for his paperboy days, those who know him say he also wants to secure his place among the city\u2019s power brokers, win credit for restoring the paper to its former glory and establish his legacy.But over all, employees seemed impressed by and hopeful about his plans, and the meeting ended with a standing ovation.Negotiations over the purchase of the paper, which some people familiar with the deal had expected to be completed by the end of March, have dragged. Part of the issue is that the deal was put together quickly \u2014 in just a matter of days \u2014 and due diligence is taking longer than expected. Tronc\u2019s technology had also been supporting The Times, and the two sides are trying to reach an agreement to keep the paper running until it can build its own capabilities, according to one of the people.On a recent afternoon, Dr. Soon-Shiong, dressed in a dark suit and light blue Ferragamo tie, laid out an ambitious vision for The Times that involves leveraging technology, extending the paper\u2019s video and podcast abilities and moving its headquarters to a new campus. At turns jocular and loquacious, he discussed hiring a top editor and stressed the importance of editorial independence and tolerance. Among the prominent editors he has pursued are two Los Angeles Times veterans \u2014 Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The New York Times, and Marty Baron, the executive editor of The Washington Post.\u201cI look upon the newspaper \u2014 on the newsroom side of it and the editorial chief side of it \u2014 to be completely independent, factual, honest, fair,\u201d he said. \u201cIt also needs to be inspiring, compassionate and caring.\u201dJournalists in the newsroom, which is exhausted by years of tumult under previous ownership, are cautiously optimistic that Dr. Soon-Shiong will reinvent the paper and return it to financial strength, just as another billionaire, Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, has done at The Washington Post.The city\u2019s political and cultural elites see Dr. Soon-Shiong as the last, best hope to restore the paper\u2019s place as an important civic institution in a sprawling region that lacks a true center of gravity, with a mayor whose powers are smaller than in other big cities, and where economic power is diffuse, spreading across industries like Hollywood and tech.\u201cI see it as a mechanism of binding the community,\u201d Dr. Soon-Shiong said. \u201cAnd sort of a grounding force.\u201dFor now, at least, Dr. Soon-Shiong\u2019s purchase has achieved one goal long held by civic leaders \u2014 and Times journalists: Return the paper to local hands.Since the Chandler family sold The Times Mirror Company to the Chicago-based Tribune Company in 2000, The Times has operated under corporate control, weathering cost cuts, severe layoffs and, for a time, a frat house culture that spilled from the top ranks.Despite the renewed buoyancy in the Times newsroom, it is not clear whether Dr. Soon-Shiong, who moved to Los Angeles in 1980 and built a fortune in health care, can reinvigorate a once-storied news organization whose newsroom is so hard-pressed for resources.\u201cI\u2019m ambitious,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to cure cancer; I want to find a universal flu vaccine; I want to find the cause of Alzheimer\u2019s; I want to figure out how to regenerate your tissue. That is an ambitious program.\u201d\u201cI think if you are trying to do a cutting edge, complex, ambitious project, that may be perceived as overpromising,\u201d he added.His plans for The Times are certainly grand, if undefined.In the weeks since the deal was announced in February, Dr. Soon-Shiong has been on something of a listening tour, calling on former staff members and seeking out advice from luminaries in journalism. He has spoken, for instance, to Mr. Baquet of The New York Times and Mr. Baron of The Washington Post, as well as Donald Graham, the former publisher of The Post, and Norman Pearlstine, a former top editor at The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg and Time Inc.In private conversations, Dr. Soon-Shiong has mused about trying to lure a big name editor to lead The Times.\u201cHe\u2019s swinging for the fences, and I think that\u2019s a good strategy,\u201d said Matt Toledo, the former publisher of The Los Angeles Business Journal and a friend of Dr. Soon-Shiong\u2019s.Though he had not yet addressed the Times newsroom before Friday, he had met with the paper\u2019s top editors, telling them he planned to invest in the paper, make Washington reporting a priority and expand the paper\u2019s foreign coverage, according to two people familiar with the meeting.He also told them he had decided to buy the paper after hearing Tronc planned to close its Washington bureau so it could afford an expensive new lease for The Times\u2019s headquarters.In the interview, Dr. Soon-Shiong expressed interest in expanding Times journalism beyond the written word and said he would build a state-of-the-art studio for video and podcasts. He has been particularly enamored with \u201cDirty John,\u201d a true-crime podcast produced by the Times reporter Christopher Goffard, and attended a Lakers game recently with Mr. Goffard.Though much of his plans are still unclear, he spoke excitedly about goals for his newspaper\u2019s new space.He wants lots of light, a day care center, a museum to honor the newspaper\u2019s history and modern technology. Eventually, he said, he would like to build a basketball court \u2014 he has one below his Brentwood mansion, as well \u2014 and open the campus up to the public to allow readers to see how the newspaper is put together.And while he is still grappling with whether The Times should be a local or regional newspaper versus a national or global news outlet, he said he thought the country needed a major news organization on the West Coast to countervail the powerful institutions, like The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and The Post \u2014 on the East Coast.\u201cI think we will make each other\u2019s boats rise and save this whole industry,\u201d he said.Several people who have spoken to Dr. Soon-Shiong about the newspaper characterized him as smart, tech savvy and eager to learn about a business in which he has until now largely admired from afar. But many of his inquiries have revealed his inexperience in running a newspaper: He has, for instance, asked how journalists put together coverage and whether the same newsroom staff can work on print and digital.Dr. Soon-Shiong\u2019s wife, Michele Chan, a former actress, has accompanied him to some of the meetings about The Times, and also seemed to be involved in decision-making, Mr. Pearlstine said. \u201cShe talks really eloquently about wanting the workplace to be more diverse and more reflective of the community it covers,\u201d he said.Mr. Pearlstine said that in their discussions about the newspaper, Dr. Soon-Shiong \u201ctalked a lot about this desire for a legacy.\u201dNot exactly an unknown in Los Angeles, Dr. Soon-Shiong remains a largely obscure figure in a city that values celebrity and personal achievement. His philanthropy has been mainly focused on health care \u2014 his name adorns a hospital in Santa Monica. And he prefers to pal around with ballplayers (he owns a piece of the Lakers) rather than Hollywood types. He is, though, close to Mark Burnett, the reality television producer behind \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d who sits on the board of one of his biotech companies, NantHealth.Dr. Soon-Shiong said that his focus will remain on his day job \u2014 trying to cure cancer. But he has suggested to others that he may appoint himself as publisher of The Times. He dismissed that out of hand in the interview, saying, \u201cI see myself as an owner who can approach the challenges facing the industry with a fresh set of eyes.\u201dStill, there are questions of whether or not he will seek to influence the positions of the editorial page. The Los Angeles Times, once a conservative paper, is now a liberal voice in a city and state that is solidly progressive. Much like the state and city it covers, the editorial pages have been a voice of opposition in the Trump era.Dr. Soon-Shiong describes himself as an independent, and he has supported both Republicans and Democrats. He said he has a fondness for Rudy Giuliani, a Republican and the former New York mayor, whom he met when Mr. Giuliani was treated for cancer.During the transition after the 2016 election, Dr. Soon-Shiong met with Donald J. Trump and discussed a job overseeing health care. A job offer never materialized, according to a person apprised of the talks, because of the controversies over Mr. Soon-Shiong\u2019s charitable giving, which were laid out in Politico last April.When asked about the paper\u2019s position on President Trump, and if he would impose his own views on the editorial board, Dr. Soon-Shiong said, \u201cI need to set the tone of compassion and caring. I don\u2019t want a vindictive paper.\u201dOf Mr. Trump, he said: \u201cI think my best response is he\u2019s our president. I\u2019m here to say that what we need to do is ensure that we can do everything we can for the president to succeed because I think it\u2019s good for our nation.\u201dFollow Tim Arango on Twitter: @tarangonyt and Sydney Ember: @melbournecoalAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Markets That Climbed the Trump Bump Are Tumbling Down From It", "Date": "2018-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Trump Bump is becoming the Trump Slump.In the first year of Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidency, ebullient investors propelled stock markets to one record high after another. And Mr. Trump was the bull in chief, celebrating the record-breaking march as validation of his economic policies.Those days are done.Even after a fast start to 2018, stock markets finished the first quarter down for the year \u2014 the first quarterly decline since 2015. It suggested that a period of calm and steadily rising markets had given way to a turbulent new era with a bearish bent.The plunge continued Monday, with the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index sinking 2.2 percent. Investors jettisoned shares of financial, technology and many other businesses, spooked at least in part by a tweet from Mr. Trump aimed at one of the country\u2019s biggest companies: Amazon.Monday\u2019s decline left stocks down more than 4 percent so far in 2018. They are now down more than 10 percent from their peak in late January. That means the market has entered a so-called correction \u2014 a term used to indicate that the downward trend is more severe and lasting than simply a few days of bearish trading.The stock market is still up more than 20 percent since Nov. 8, 2016, the day Mr. Trump won the White House \u2014 a roller-coaster ride driven in part by expectations about what a Trump presidency could bring to Washington.At first, the prospect of Republicans controlling the White House and both houses of Congress thrilled investors. They anticipated a wave of regulatory rollbacks and the slashing of corporate and personal tax rates. Many of those dreams have been realized, culminating in Mr. Trump signing a huge tax cut into law in December. When the S.&P. 500 notched its high-water mark of 2872.87 on Jan. 26, it represented a roughly 325 percent increase since the bull market began in March 2009.But since February, a toxic stew of factors \u2014 many but certainly not all of them emanating from Washington \u2014 has polluted what had been the market\u2019s placidly rising waters. And there\u2019s little prospect of the messes dissipating anytime soon.First there was the risk that the economy might be growing too fast, which could prompt central banks to hike interest rates sooner than expected. Then there was the risk of a trade war ignited by the White House imposing tariffs on certain products, an action that quickly prompted countries like China to erect trade barriers of their own. Next came the threat of a government crackdown on technology companies, after revelations of their misuse of customer data.Monday\u2019s dose of unnerving news was a presidential tweet aimed at Amazon, which Mr. Trump accused of hurting the United States Postal Service. Mr. Trump\u2019s feud with the company has been going on sporadically since before he became president, but the onslaught has accelerated lately. On Monday, Mr. Trump tweeted that the Post Office loses money by working with Amazon \u201cand this will be changed.\u201dIn the face of these factors, the optimism of just two months ago has all but evaporated.\u201cIt certainly adds to uncertainty, and the market doesn\u2019t like uncertainty,\u201d said Ed Clissold, chief United States strategist at Ned Davis Research, a stock market research firm.One thing is clear: The days of calm markets marching steadily higher, shattering one record after another, are gone for now. That carries risks for Mr. Trump, who spent the first year of his presidency as a stock-market cheerleader but in recent months has been mostly silent about the market\u2019s gyrations.It also could be a danger for the United States economy. Academic research suggests that long-term market declines can rub off on consumers, leading them to feel less affluent and therefore spend less money. That is bad news for an economy that hinges largely on zesty consumer spending.The market\u2019s decline over the past two months has been broad based. Six of the 11 sectors included in the S.&P. 500 index are down more than 10 percent from the market high in late January.On any given day, a particular sector might be clobbered. One day it could be industrial companies such as Boeing or Caterpillar, which export lots of products and therefore could be harmed in a trade war. Another day could bring declines to technology companies like Facebook and Twitter, whose profits are vulnerable to tougher government regulation of social media networks. The next day it could be energy and financial companies, whose fortunes would be diminished if the economy slows.On Monday, just 13 stocks in the S.&P. 500 rose.The meat producer Tyson dropped more than 6 percent, after China imposed duties on pork and fruit from the United States in response to the tariffs that the Trump administration has imposed on products imported from China. China is one of Tyson\u2019s most important export markets. Lean hog futures \u2014 which reflect the anticipated prices of pig carcasses \u2014 were down 3.9 percent.After Mr. Trump\u2019s complaint about Amazon, it too, was a big loser, falling 5.2 percent. Other giant tech firms were sucked into the downdraft. Microsoft dropped 3 percent. Facebook tumbled 2.8 percent, bringing its year-to-date decline to 14.4 percent. And Intel dove 6 percent after a Bloomberg News report that Apple was planning to use its own chips in its computers instead of Intel processors.And Tesla, reeling amid doubts about its ability to churn out electric vehicles, tumbled more than 5 percent.The tech sector has been the epicenter of stock market pain in recent weeks, hurt by concerns about trade friction with China \u2014 a key market and supplier for tech firms \u2014 and fears of tighter government regulation. Even before Monday\u2019s fall, some $457 billion had been wiped off the sector\u2019s total market value.\u201cPeople think that tech is going to go from the Wild West to a much more regulated, scrutinized environment,\u201d said Dan Suzuki, an equity strategist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Even the shares of financial institutions \u2014 the companies that would most likely benefit from a looser regulatory environment favored by Republicans \u2014 have been battered. The sector dropped 2.1 percent Monday, with investors worried about an unfavorable lending environment.For markets, nothing is for sure. They could rebound mightily later this week and shake off jitters about a trade war. But some observers believe conditions may have to get worse before they can get better \u2014 and there could be more declines before that happens.\u201cIn order for the market to bottom, there probably has to be more consternation and more pessimism about the current environment,\u201d said Mr. Clissold, of Ned Davis Research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Stay on Top of Breaking News", "Date": "2018-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech We\u2019re UsingHow do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Jonah Bromwich, a breaking news reporter for The Times in New York, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.You cover breaking and trending news with an extremely quick turnaround. What are some of the tech tools you rely on to stay on top of the news and file stories quickly and accurately?For example, we could become aware of a story that we want to monitor (and possibly cover) when a tweet from a local Houston reporter says something like, \u201cGunshots fired in Harris County Institute of the Forensic Sciences.\u201d And then seconds later, another one from a different account says, \u201cWhoa im in Houston and I think i just heard fireworks or maybe gunfire???\u201dAfter a couple more tweets like that I might call the Harris County sheriff or the Houston police or whoever else makes sense. They\u2019re often tweets that we might not otherwise have seen, because they come from, for example, a cloud computing consultant in Houston who has 43 followers on Twitter. I wouldn\u2019t see that on Twitter for hours, but Dataminr would bring it to my attention right away.I also use Twitter and Reddit for trending stories. And there are certain aggregator sites that people swear by. I\u2019ve been using Hvper recently, thanks to a recommendation from my editor. And I still sometimes web surf like an old, using an RSS reader (Feedly).Which one is the most important?For breaking news, probably Dataminr. It\u2019s a handy tool. For trending news, what we hope to do is put together patterns that others may not have, or to put a new spin on a story that\u2019s already out there.I also use Twitter to follow the news, which sometimes helps me find patterns. (I can\u2019t use Tweetdeck, and I\u2019m always impressed that people are able to, by the way.)Beyond your job, what tech product do you love using in your daily life?I listen to music near constantly when not at work, so a lot of the technology I use regularly has to do with that.I have a couple of Bose Bluetooth speakers. The Bose SoundLink Mini is one of my favorite things. I got mine years ago, and it still works. The sound quality is strong, and it\u2019s easy to connect to and to carry around. If I need to play music a little louder, I have a Bose SoundTouch system that works O.K.There\u2019s a story with those Sennheiser headphones. They were sent to me in the mail and were in a box on my coffee table for a couple of months. I thought they belonged to my roommate (someone had opened the outer layer of the box), but he told me they weren\u2019t his. So I called my parents and some of my best friends to ask if they had gotten me these kind of expensive headphones. No one had.I couldn\u2019t figure out where they had come from and was a little paranoid that someone was spying on me. A year later, I came home and my downstairs neighbor was taking out his trash and wearing those same Sennheisers. Then I thought for a second.\u201cHey, Evan,\u201d I said. \u201cDid you actually have to order those twice because one package went missing?\u201d He confirmed \u2014 I had stolen his headphones. He was very nice about it, and because he had gotten them replaced, he has let me keep them so far.I also gave in and started using a Tile, which is a Bluetooth tracker, to find my keys. It has made it so I never lose my keys.What could be better?The SoundTouch system can be hard to connect to, and it sometimes shuts off inexplicably. The over-ear headphones get blown out kind of easily, but you can order replacements on Amazon and they are super cheap.There is now so much tech out there \u2014 tweets, Facebook posts, phone notifications and more \u2014 to distract us. What\u2019s your advice for readers who struggle to concentrate on their work?I don\u2019t have any magic tricks or anything, though, and I get distracted pretty easily. When I really want to concentrate on something, I try to leave my phone in another room. And when I need to write something on deadline, I minimize Slack and put my stolen headphones on.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bulging Debt May Spell Trouble for Energy, Telecom and Retail", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhile many companies have shrewdly taken advantage of rock-bottom interest rates over the last decade, bulging debt in industries like retail, energy and telecommunications is a burden that investors may need to worry about.Many retailers, for example, have been struggling with competition from online giants like Amazon and Walmart. The debt of major companies like Neiman Marcus, PetSmart and Sears is already rated as speculative (also known as high-yeld or junk). And Diane Vazza, head of global fixed-income research at Standard & Poor\u2019s, said many debt-laden retailers have already suffered credit downgrades this year. These include Sears, Payless and Guitar Center Holdings.Once a company\u2019s debt is downgraded to speculative from investment grade, it may find the footing more slippery. Companies that fall into speculative grade ratings (B- or lower in the S.&P. ratings system) tend to accelerate toward even lower ratings, Ms. Vazza said.The risk to investors \u2014 and the interest the companies must pay for new borrowing \u2014 rises, adding to cash flow stress. When the stress is great enough, companies can fail.Mr. Wildstein said the retail industry was \u201cbifurcated.\u201d \u201cThe department store model is being disrupted by Amazon,\u201d he said, and many department stores are suffering. On the other hand, he said, the home improvement giants are seemingly unaffected: \u201cHome Depot and Lowe\u2019s continue to do well.\u201dDebt loads aren\u2019t merely a concern for fixed-income investors. Equity investors need to be aware of debt loads at troubled companies because, in a severe case, bankruptcy would wipe out the value of any stock holdings.Energy is another industry where debt is worrisome. Oil and gas companies carry large loads of lower-rated debt that is due to mature in the next five years, according to S.&P. New fracking technology has helped to expand domestic oil and gas output and loosened the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries\u2019 grip on prices. But as the new supply depresses prices, it also pinches cash flow.Indeed, 14 of 16 midsize and larger drillers tracked by Gordon Douthat, a director of equity research at Wells Fargo Securities, had higher capital spending costs than cash flow last year: Anadarko Petroleum, Noble Energy and Pioneer Natural Resources are among them.One central problem is the modest level of oil prices which, despite a recent rebound, remain well below highs of over $100 a barrel. Mr. Wildstein said he expects them to remain \u201caround $60\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t believe they\u2019ll go back to the $70s or $80s,\u201d he said.Telecom debt also is worth watching. Citing increased price competition, Moody\u2019s has a negative outlook on the entire sector. Bill Wolfe, Moody\u2019s senior vice president, said the industry was rife with \u201clarge companies with a lot of debt,\u201d including Frontier Communications, CenturyLink and Sprint.Verizon Communications also carries a large debt load, but it may be something of a special case. \u201cThey\u2019re an extremely large issuer,\u201d Mr. Wildstein said.Mr. Wildstein\u2019s fund holds Verizon debt, and he says the company may be overly dependent on its wireless network. It needs to diversify by acquiring a cable provider or media company, he said.Verizon lists its total debt as $117.1 billion. \u201cWe want to strengthen the balance sheet,\u201d Matthew D. Ellis, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, said on a Jan. 23 earnings call. \u201cYou should expect us to deleverage from where we are today,\u201d he added.Outside these industries, debt is high for much of corporate America but probably manageable, several analysts said.\u201cThe leverage is elevated \u2014 companies are borrowing more,\u201d said Mr. Wolfe of Moody\u2019s. But since they are borrowing at historically low rates, their repayment abilities have not been measurably affected, he noted.Among investment-grade companies, the ratio of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, to interest expense has inched up to 9.9 in the 12 months through Sept. 30, 2017, from 9.7 in 2010. Companies with speculative-grade \u2014 also known as high-yield \u2014 debt have also seen their Ebitda-to-interest expense ratios improve a bit, Moody\u2019s reports.The broad outlook for corporate bonds isn\u2019t entirely rosy. Interest rates have been rising, and S.&P. estimates that more than $4 trillion in corporate debt will have to be refinanced \u2014 presumably at even higher interest rates \u2014 by the end of 2022. But S.& P. doesn\u2019t expect this refinancing to cause undue problems.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Washington Moves to Soften a Big Bank Capital Rule: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Tuesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Earnings are dragging stocks lower.\u2022 The yield on the 10-year Treasury note broke through 3 percent.\u2022 A new study found that female and male C.E.O.s tend to earn similar levels of compensation.\u2022 What does Eddie Lampert have in mind for Sears?\u2022 A thought experiment with Amazon\u2019s pay and profits.One of the simplest and strongest protections against another financial crisis could soon be weakened.Two federal banking regulators have in recent weeks proposed adjustments that could ease a stringent, no-frills bank capital requirement, much disliked on Wall Street, called the supplementary leverage ratio. The Trump administration\u2019s effort to loosen financial regulation is moving forward on several fronts, but the changes to the leverage ratio would arguably put the deepest dent in the post-crisis overhaul.Under the adjustment, the ratio would fall for all of the eight big banks that are subject to it. Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs stand to enjoy some of the biggest declines.Compared with the current rules, the new leverage ratio would reduce capital required at the eight banks by around $86 billion. But other capital rules would, for the time being at least, prevent the banks from cutting their capital by that amount.Not all regulators support the proposed adjustment.The new leverage ratio swaps a fixed capital requirement for one that is in part based on a bank\u2019s size and reach in the global financial system.Critics of the current leverage ratio said it was causing banks to reduce certain important activities.- Peter EavisBut they are dragging them lower on Tuesday.The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 500 points, or 2.1 percent, while the S.&P. 500 and the Nasdaq Composite slid more than 1.5 percent. For the Dow, Tuesday\u2019s move lower push the blue-chip index back down more than 10 percent. If its losses hold through the close, it will mark the Dow\u2019s fifth consecutive down day, its longest such streak since 2017.Disappointing earnings from some of the stock market\u2019s biggest companies are weighing heavily on stocks.\u2022 Despite a 73 percent jump in Alphabet\u2019s net profit, shares fell more than 4 percent as Wall Street analysts raised concerns that a jump in capital spending could crimp profitability\u2022 Travelers is off 4 percent after its earnings missed expectations.In all, Apple, 3M, Travelers and Caterpillar have accounted for 260 points of the Dow\u2019s decline.ContextAs of Friday, with 17 percent of companies in the S.&P. 500 having reported, profits were on pace to rise more than 18 percent, the high quarterly rate in seven years. So far, 80 percent of companies in the indexes have reported have beaten expectation.Peter Eavis\u2019s takeDespite all the bullish talk about earnings and the economy, stocks looked vulnerable going into the first-quarter earnings season. Analysts are expecting earnings for companies in the S.&P. 500 to grow 25 percent this year, an unusually large increase. At the 2018 forecast, the S.&P. 500 looks temperately valued at 17 times earnings. But looking back, stocks appear expensive, at 21 times the S.&P. 500\u2019s earnings for 2017. This large gap between future and historical valuations creates a chasm that stocks can fall into if profits disappoint. If companies, like 3M did on Tuesday, provide underwhelming earnings outlooks, investors will stop believing that stocks are cheap, based on 2018 earnings.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note broke through 3 percent early Tuesday, the first time since 2014 that the benchmark borrowing rate has carried a \u201cthree handle.\u201d Big picture, there\u2019s not much news here. Rates are rising on the back of solid global growth and a Federal Reserve that continues to gradually raise rates this year.No news, however, doesn\u2019t mean no worries. Nearly a decade after the worst of the Great Recession, no one knows exactly how reliant the American economy has become on rock-bottom interest rates. With average 30-year fixed mortgage rates now topping 4.4 percent, housing data has been persistently soft in recent months. And residential real estate is expected to be a drag on first quarter G.D.P. numbers when they\u2019re published on Friday, suggesting that if rising rates are no reason to panic, they shouldn\u2019t merely be shrugged off either.A number of prominent bond investors have long eyed the 3 percent level. Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive of DoubleLine Capital and manager of one of the largest U.S. bond funds, warned that hitting 3 percent would trigger bear market for bonds.A similar move higher in February caused stocks to tumble. So far, though, equities have taken Tuesday\u2019s climb above 3 percent in stride. The Dow Jones industrial average and the S.&P. 500 are essentially flat in early trading.That stunning conclusion, from a new study, could shake up discussions in boardrooms and C-suites everywhere. (The study tracked compensation at 2,282 companies from 1996 to 2014.)One of the most interesting theories about why women may have bridged the pay divide at the highest levels has been offered by previous studies and experts: that a premium has been applied because there is such a limited supply of women in the chief executive role.

The United States has taken a different path. Companies that collect consumer data can\u2019t defraud or mislead their customers, and the Federal Trade Commission is a watchdog for those standards. Beyond those foundational protections, Congress has historically protected our data through \u201csectoral\u201d laws that set specific rules for specific industries. Thus, records on the videos you watch, your credit report, health history, and other kinds of data are all protected by slightly different rules.That\u2019s when the lobbying really started.

{"Headline": "Wells Fargo Is About to be Hit With $1 Billion Fine: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Good Thursday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Regulators are about to hit Wells Fargo with a $1 billion penalty.\u2022 The European Union is prepared to offer some trade concessions.\u2022 Two big drug makers have shown interest in bidding for Shire.\u2022 How the Time Warner C.E.O. did on the stand yesterday.\u2022 Dates to watch in the U.S.-China trade fight.The basics:\u2022 It would be the most stringent action taken against a bank by the Trump administration.\u2022 The action is said to punish Wells Fargo for forcing customers to buy auto insurance they didn\u2019t need, improperly charging mortgage customers and for having inadequate compliance practices.The misdeeds at Wells Fargo showed that the bank\u2019s sales culture had degraded. Bank employees, eager to meet sales goals, had been opening accounts for customers without their consent. Other misdeeds were revealed as well.The scandals were particularly surprising because Wells Fargo, with its focus on traditional lending, was widely viewed as a worthy alternative to the Wall Street-focused institutions at the center of the financial crisis of 2008. Wells Fargo\u2019s steady revenue growth and its habit of invariably beating earnings forecasts lulled investors into a false sense of confidence and led them to pile into Wells Fargo\u2019s stock.\u2014 Peter EavisCritics\u2019 cornerNow would not seem like the ideal to start a venture capital firm that aims to help U.S. start-ups break into the Russian market, given the political tensions between the two countries.The firm said on Thursday that it has opened for business in the U.S. with a $200 million fund, its second, for investing in a variety of industries, from A.I. to fintech. And it has hired a veteran of Silicon Valley, Anurag Chandra, to help in that mission.Victor Orlovski, Fort Ross\u2019s founder and managing partner, said in an interview that the current state of U.S.-Russian political relations should not affect his firm\u2019s ability to operate. Declining to comment on politics broadly, he said that Russia \u2014 which remains one of the biggest markets for apps worldwide \u2014 will remain a compelling destination for start-ups.\u201cThe nature of start-ups is all about risk,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a political tension, but not when you\u2019re talking to start-ups.\u201dFort Ross\u2019s team is betting its contacts in Russia and knowledge of the market will help attract U.S. start-ups. Mr. Orlovski was previously the chief digital officer at Sberbank, Russia\u2019s biggest bank, and maintains connections in that region, including through his former employer.For one of Fort Ross\u2019s existing investments, the social trading start-up eToro, the investment firm introduced the portfolio company to a local player in Russia to help it crack that market.Fort Ross began raising its latest fund in the fall, drawing investors from Russia and the Middle East. (Mr. Orlovski said that the investors are primarily family offices and wealthy individuals, though he does eventually want to branch out into traditional money sources like U.S. pension funds.) But the goal, he added, was to make the firm better-known in Silicon Valley, a task he argued would not be hampered by his background or focus.\u201cI don\u2019t feel like we are a second- or third-tier venture firm just because I\u2019m personally from Russia or because we have connections to Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cOne year, or a couple of years ahead, we want to be a bigger player in the community of V.C.s here.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la MercedThe European Union, with its $16 trillion economy and its reputation for toughness in trade negotiations, could be the immovable object that stymies President Trump\u2019s combative trade agenda.But that outcome is looking less likely.According to the Journal, the European Union is prepared to reduce tariffs on United States cars and industrial machinery, among other goods. The newspaper also reported that the bloc might offer to join the United States in pressuring China to relax its trade and investment rules. (In return, the European Union is reportedly asking for European companies to be given access to United States government procurement contracts.)The Trump administration apparently proposed the punitive tariffs as a way to secure compromises from trading partners, and bring them into an alliance against China. If the European Union bends to this strategy, rather than rejecting it outright, it would be a notable gain for Mr. Trump.\u2014 Peter EavisTakeda Pharmaceutical disclosed on Thursday that it has bid for more than $60 billion for the Irish drug maker Shire, though the offer was rejected. But it may have competition in the form of Allergan, which said on Thursday it was considering an offer for Shire.Still the disclosures, following weeks of speculation, again raises the prospect of consolidation within the pharmaceutical industry. Drug makers have long looked to big takeovers to broaden their product portfolios.For Takeda, which is based in Osaka and whose products include treatments for acid reflux and for cancer, a big takeover would give it both more scale \u2014 the combined company would have some $30 billion in annual sales \u2014 and a bigger international footprint.But Shire, which is headquartered in Dublin and is best known for producing Adderall, would be its biggest takeover by far. (Its next-biggest acquisition was the $13.7 billion purchase of Nycomed seven years ago.)Takeda\u2019s main competitor may be Allergan, the maker of Botox, is a veteran acquirer, having been built up through numerous mergers over the years.Under the terms of that offer, Shire shareholders would own just over half of the combined company.Takeda and Shire said that they are in discussions, which could lead to yet another revised bid.Yet for both Takeda and Allergan, a deal for Shire could prove financially risky, since each company would need to borrow significant amounts of debt to finance a transaction.Under British takeover rules, Takeda has until April 25 to decide whether to continue pursuing Shire. Allergan has until May 17 to do the same.Advising Takeda are Evercore Partners, JPMorgan Chase and Nomura. Advising Shire are Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.\u2014 Michael de la MercedFrom Mr. Lohr:The rethinking of GE Digital, with its future still under review by Mr. Flannery, points to the difficulty of producing modern software for industrial businesses as they adopt digital technology.No one disputes the overarching vision of the so-called industrial internet of things \u2014 which includes low-cost sensors and a flood of data and clever software that should deliver insights to cut costs, conserve fuel and design better products, faster. But the company greatly underestimated the challenges of creating all the software needed to achieve that grand vision, said analysts and former G.E. managers.Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Thursday that the statue known as \u201cFearless Girl\u201d will soon be moved from its spot at the southern tip of Broadway to a spot facing the New York Stock Exchange.And if the city has its way, the bull will eventually go with her.\u201cSo after deciding to allow the sculpture \u2014 placed temporarily at the spot \u2014 to remain for a year, city officials came to the conclusion that the number of pedestrians spilling into the streets created a safety hazard.\u201dDuring his court testimony in Washington yesterday, the Time Warner C.E.O. argued that his company\u2019s proposed $85.4 billion sale to AT&T was necessary, given the \u201ctectonic changes\u201d in the media world wrought by Netflix and Amazon.Among the biggest problems for Time Warner as a stand-alone television and movie producer is that it does not have access to viewer data to target advertising and other valuable customer information the same way that Amazon and Netflix do, Mr. Bewkes said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have emails, contact information, billing information \u2026 any of these things,\u201d he said.Lawyers for the Justice Department, which has sued to block the deal, grilled him about an internal document from last year showing plans to create digital products even without AT&T.Randall Stephenson of AT&T could take the stand today.On May 1, exemptions to the tariffs on imported steel and aluminum expire.On May 22, the public comment period ends for another $50 billion worth of tariffs, and the Trump administration can announce a final list of targets.And Aug. 18 is potentially the deadline for the administration to act on an investigation into Chinese trade practices. But there\u2019s a provision for a 180-day delay after that.Key caveats: President Trump has the power to pursue trade policy almost at whim. And a W.T.O. proceeding against China could take years.The politically minded bank already adopted principles for limiting firearm sales laid out by the advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety. Now it\u2019s using its position as a (small) shareholder in Sturm, Ruger to urge the gun maker to adopt six Everytown principles.Among them: Supporting mandatory background checks for all sales; binding sellers to a code of conduct; and adopting smart-gun tech. If Ruger doesn\u2019t support those principles, Amalgamated would withhold votes for Sandra Froman, a Ruger director who\u2019s also on the N.R.A.\u2019s board.The tech flyaroundAs the firm moves more into consumer businesses \u2014 pushing its Marcus online lending platform, buying Adam Dell\u2019s budget-planning app \u2014 it is looking less like a traditional investment bank and trading house and more like a one-stop shop. Like the universal banks JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why We Should Be Optimistic About Retail", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnother ViewAs consultants who have lived and breathed retail for more than 25 years, we\u2019re pained by such headlines, but we remain believers in the industry. Traditional retailers have already made meaningful progress addressing one of their three biggest problems \u2014 too many stores \u2014 and have begun to address the other two: the high level of debt on their balance sheets and the rise of digital retailing. We\u2019re also optimistic about the industry\u2019s prospects because of its long history of successful reinvention.Retail has been in a constant state of renewal since the earliest days of commerce. Artisans were disrupted by merchants, who were disrupted by bazaars and spice-route traders. Pushcarts disrupted stand-alone stores. The Sears Roebuck catalog of 1893 disrupted the first era of brick-and-mortar retail. Malls disrupted the town square; superstores and category-killers disrupted the local five-and-dime. And now, off-price, dollar stores, fast-fashion and online players are shaking up the industry. Through it all, retail has survived.The disrupter du jour is, of course, Amazon \u2014 which collected more than 40 cents of every dollar spent online last year.Few retailers have figured out yet how to compete effectively with Amazon, but some perspective is necessary. Just 8.9 percent of retail sales in the United States last year were made online \u2014 including Amazon. Said differently, 91.1 percent of the $5.7 trillion consumers spent at retailers last year still passed through brick-and-mortar locations. Yes, the share of retail sales taking place online will continue to increase for some time \u2014 but not forever.Here are three reasons to be confident in the industry\u2019s prospects:First, while bankruptcies and store closings are certainly painful, they are helping whittle away at retail\u2019s overcapacity problem. Last year the United States had 23.5 square feet of retail space per person, according to Morningstar. That compares with 16.4 square feet in Canada and 11.1 square feet in Australia, the next two countries with the most retail space per capita. And compared with Europe or Japan, America has nearly six times as much retail space per capita. No industry can survive with that kind of crushing overcapacity for long \u2014 and retail has now awakened to that fact.Second, the industry is beginning to reduce its debt levels. True, an average of $5 billion per year in high-yield retail debt is set to come due between 2019 and 2025, according to Fitch Ratings. That\u2019s on top of this year\u2019s $1.9 billion. More and more lenders are valuing a retailer with an inelastic balance sheet less than a retailer that has more options. Add to that the benefits of a growing economy, rising wages for consumers and the benefits to retail from the new tax law, and we just may have a recipe for a retail renaissance.Third, as Peter Drucker famously said: \u201cThe purpose of business is to create a customer, the business enterprise has two \u2014 and only two \u2014 basic functions: marketing and innovation.\u201dThe marketing part will be easy for retail \u2014 it\u2019s in its D.N.A. The innovation part will be tougher, and there will be many more setbacks along the way (including companies trying to beat Amazon at its own game).But we see the innovative experiments going on in retail today \u2014 the \u201cexperiential\u201d stores appealing to those craving experiences as much as things, the \u201cshoppertainment\u201d malls combining entertainment with spending, the back-to-the-future \u201clocal\u201d retail that eschews universal brands in favor of more curated offerings \u2014 and this gives us even more confidence.Don\u2019t bet against retail; the destruction it\u2019s going through now is, as in the past, of the creative variety.Mr. Bines and Mr. Bassuk are the global co-heads of retail consulting at AlixPartners LLP.Advertisement"}
