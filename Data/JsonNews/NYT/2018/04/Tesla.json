And then, in the span of six days, a team of law enforcement officers in Sacramento located and arrested the man they say is behind one of America\u2019s most brutal and mysterious crime sprees, the Golden State Killer.Joseph James DeAngelo, 72, was living in Citrus Heights, a suburb of Sacramento and a short drive on the freeway from the neighborhoods that he is alleged to have terrorized in the 1970s and 1980s. He is a former police officer who the authorities now say raped more than 50 women and killed 12 people. He wore the badge at the time of many of the rapes.Prosecutors and police officers on Wednesday said DNA analysis was crucial in linking Mr. DeAngelo with murders in Southern California. They managed to obtain his DNA and make the match. But how did they locate Mr. DeAngelo in the first place? And how are they so confident that Mr. DeAngelo was behind the rash of rapes in the Sacramento area, crimes for which there was no DNA evidence? Details will be forthcoming, officials promised at a news conference on Wednesday.For more: (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)We know, we know.

{"Headline": "Tesla to Halt Production of Model 3 Cars Temporarily", "Date": "2018-04-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTesla plans to halt production of its Model 3 compact car on Tuesday in a bid to work out kinks that have slowed assembly of the car, a critical vehicle in the company\u2019s business plan.It expects to idle its Model 3 assembly line for several days to clear impediments that have held production well below the electric-car company\u2019s targets.In the final week of March, Tesla made just over 2,000 Model 3s. It is hoping to lift that to 5,000 cars a week by the end of the second quarter. At one time, the company\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, thought Tesla would be able to make several hundred thousand Model 3s in 2018.In a statement, Tesla said it had planned downtime into its production plans at its car plant in Fremont, Calif., \u201cto improve automation and systematically address bottlenecks in order to increase production rates.\u201dNews of the halt in production was first reported by BuzzFeed. The company\u2019s stock price was down slightly in Tuesday trading.Tesla\u2019s trials in putting the Model 3 into mass production have drawn scrutiny from investors. With a starting price of $35,000, the Model 3 is supposed to be Tesla\u2019s most affordable and top-selling car. The company has been counting on a quick increase in sales to bolster revenue and enable the company to pare down losses and pay off bonds and borrowings while still investing heavily in future vehicles.Concerns over the slow pace of Model 3 assembly spurred Moody\u2019s Investors Service to cut Tesla\u2019s credit rating last month and question whether the company could face a cash crunch this year.Its financial troubles have been compounded by an investigation by federal safety experts into a fatal crash on March 23 that involved a Tesla Model X sport-utility vehicle that was operating with its Autopilot driver-assistance system engaged. The driver, Wei Huang, a software engineer at Apple, died in a hospital shortly after the crash.The National Transportation Safety Board sent investigators to California to look into the crash. Tensions between Tesla and the agency increased after the automaker suggested the driver was at fault because data from the car showed that he did not have his hands on the steering wheel for several seconds before the car hit a concrete barrier.In production of the Model 3, Mr. Musk gambled by creating an assembly line that relies much more heavily on automated equipment and robots than workers. But it has proved more difficult than he expected to get the machinery to work in harmony. He recently said he was sleeping at the Fremont plant while working to improve the production line, and he has described the delays and glitches as \u201cproduction hell.\u201dIn a tweet over the weekend, Mr. Musk acknowledged that \u201cexcessive automation at Tesla was a mistake. To be precise, my mistake. Humans are underrated.\u201dTesla stock and bond prices have slumped in recent weeks. On Monday, Tesla shares closed at $291.21, down 3 percent on the day. They have lost nearly a fifth of their value since March 12.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In This Space Race, Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk Are Competing to Take You There", "Date": "2018-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionLaunch Pad 39A, just north of Cape Canaveral, Fla., was the storied site where America\u2019s space dreams and the imaginations of its youth were sent soaring. The first manned mission to the moon blasted off from there in 1969, as did the last, in 1972; so did the first space shuttle mission, in 1981, and the last, in 2011. But by 2013, with the shuttle program grounded and America\u2019s half century of space aspirations having ended with bangs and whimpers, 39A was rusting away and weeds were growing through its flame trench. A crippled NASA was eager to sell it.The space agency knew there was a natural customer: Elon Musk, the cheeky PayPal co-founder and Tesla creator whose SpaceX venture had become the first private rocket company to launch into orbit with a payload. Musk\u2019s mesmerizing style \u2014 skittering on the border between visionary and eccentric \u2014 made it seem at times that his obsession with space travel involved a desire to return to some celestial home, but his Falcon rockets had won NASA\u2019s respect. Surprisingly, a second bidder emerged: Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, who pursued his passion for all things, including space travel, with an awesome talent for being both exuberant and methodical. His company, Blue Origin, was building a reusable launch vehicle that, among other things, planned to take tourists into space.Musk won the bidding for Launch Pad 39A, but a few months later Bezos bought the nearby Launch Complex 36, from which missions to fly by Mars and Venus had been launched. The transfer of these hallowed pads represented, both symbolically and in practice, John F. Kennedy\u2019s torch of space exploration being passed from government to the private sector \u2014 from a once-glorious but now sclerotic federal agency to a new breed of boyish billionaires who embodied the daring passion and imagination of history\u2019s great pioneers, adventurers and innovators.Two new books chronicle this fascinating transition. \u201cThe Space Barons,\u201d by Christian Davenport, a Washington Post reporter, is an exciting narrative filled with colorful reporting and sharp insights. The book sparkles because of Davenport\u2019s access to the main players and his talent for crisp storytelling. \u201cRocket Billionaires,\u201d by Tim Fernholz, a reporter for Quartz, is not quite as vibrant a narrative and lacks some of Davenport\u2019s memorable scenes, but it provides smart analysis of the New Space sector as well as historical context about NASA\u2019s triumphs and failures.In the class that I teach on the history of the digital revolution, the students discuss whether innovation is driven more by big government projects or by nimble entrepreneurs. The answer, of course, is that it usually involves a symbiotic mix, like the semiconductor industry, which arose out of the Pentagon and NASA\u2019s need to put guidance systems in the nose cones of rockets. Vannevar Bush was the dean of engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a co-founder of Raytheon, and oversaw the government science programs that resulted in the atom bomb and electronic computer. He wrote a seminal paper in 1945, called \u201cScience \u2014 the Endless Frontier,\u201d which described how a collaboration of all three sectors he had been part of \u2014 academia, business and government \u2014 would drive innovation. Government funding of basic research in university labs would lead to discoveries in fundamental science that would be the \u201cseed\u201d for future inventions.Many innovations have progressed along that path. The ENIAC computer funded by the United States Army and built at the University of Pennsylvania was the genesis for UNIVAC and then most other electronic computers. The network funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and designed by a consortium of academic and private labs led eventually to today\u2019s internet. The National Science Foundation, started based on Vannevar Bush\u2019s paper, created a multiagency Digital Library Initiative that funded the academic research of Larry Page and Sergey Brin, which led to Google. The sequencing of the human genome, largely funded by the National Institutes of Health, planted the seeds for the biotech industry.Now space endeavors are following this \u201cinnovation progression,\u201d as we can call it. \u201cJust as Darpa served as the initial impetus for the internet and underwrote a lot of the costs of developing the internet in the beginning, it may be the case that NASA has essentially done the same thing by spending the money to build sort of fundamental technologies,\u201d Musk said a year after launching SpaceX. \u201cOnce we can bring the sort of commercial, free enterprise sector into it, then we can see the dramatic acceleration that we saw in the internet.\u201dOne of the first private pioneers was Burt Rutan, a mutton-chopped aircraft designer who regarded NASA as a bloated and unimaginative bureaucracy and in 1982 founded a company called Scaled Composites that designed aircraft so innovative that, as Davenport writes, \u201cit was as if his inspiration came not just from the laws of aerodynamics but from Picasso.\u201d One of his ideas was for a manned aircraft that could reach the edge of space and then fold its wings upward to act as a feather allowing the craft to re-enter the earth\u2019s atmosphere, land on a runway, and be reused. It would become his entry in the Ansari X Prize, which offered $10 million for the first private company that could launch a reusable vehicle to space twice within two weeks.Rutan attracted two billionaire partners. The first was the Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, who as a schoolboy in Seattle yearned to become an astronaut but, being nearsighted, realized that was impossible so spent his time coding in the school\u2019s computer room with his friend Bill Gates. Rutan\u2019s second partner was the toothy goldilocked Richard Branson, a thrill-addicted serial adventurer and entrepreneur who was as enthusiastic about publicity as Allen was averse to it. Branson\u2019s personal motto for his company, Virgin, was \u201cScrew it, let\u2019s do it,\u201d which was no longer a guiding principle at NASA, and he created Virgin Galactic with the goal of taking tourists into space. \u201cPaul, isn\u2019t this better than the best sex you ever had?\u201d Branson asked Allen during one test flight as the spaceship climbed higher.In 2004, Rutan\u2019s craft (with a Virgin logo on its tail) flew twice to space and back to win the X Prize. At the celebration, Rutan took a shot at NASA. \u201cI was thinking a little bit about that other space agency, the big guys,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they\u2019re looking at each other now and saying, \u2018We\u2019re screwed.\u2019\u201d Branson began selling tickets at prices that started at $200,000 to those who wanted to ride in a similar plane he began building, the launch date of which always seems to be about a year away.Elon Musk\u2019s love of adventure came partly from his maternal grandfather, an accomplished amateur pilot in South Africa who in 1952 completed a 22,000-mile journey across the globe with no electronic instruments. Musk founded SpaceX in 2002 with the eventual goal of colonizing Mars. \u201cThe more Musk studied, the more he realized that there had been very little advancement in rocket technology in the past 40 years,\u201d Davenport writes. \u201cTo a self-made Silicon Valley tech entrepreneur, this was stunning.\u201d His company\u2019s mantra was, \u201cSet audacious, nearly impossible goals and don\u2019t get dissuaded.\u201dMusk\u2019s entrepreneurship had a social purpose. SpaceX, Tesla, his electric car company, and SolarCity, his renewable energy company, Fernholz writes, \u201cwere explicitly intended to further human civilization.\u201d Along the way, he developed a cultlike following. When SpaceX managed to launch a space capsule into orbit and dock it at the International Space Station in 2012, something NASA could no longer do on its own, the employees at his headquarters broke into a chant, \u201cWe love Elon!\u201dBezos was likewise inspired by his own maternal grandfather. Lawrence Preston Gise, an upright but loving naval commander, helped develop the hydrogen bomb during a stint at the Atomic Energy Commission and then retired to his sprawling Texas ranch to enjoy his family \u2014 and in particular his insatiably curious little grandson with very big ears, smile and laugh. Bezos\u2019 passion for space began when he was 5 and he watched with his family the launch of Apollo 11, the manned moon mission commanded by Neil Armstrong. \u201cIt really was a seminal moment for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember watching it on our living room TV, and the excitement of my parents and my grandparents. Little kids can pick up that kind of excitement.\u201dBezos spent every summer at his grandfather\u2019s ranch, where he fixed windmills, castrated cattle and geeked out on the tiny county library\u2019s surprisingly large sci-fi collection. His high school valedictorian speech was about space: how to colonize planets, build space hotels and save our fragile planet. \u201cSpace, the final frontier, meet me there!\u201d he concluded.When Bezos founded Blue Origin in 2000, naming it after that pale blue planet where humans originated, he called upon one of his favorite science fiction writers, Neal Stephenson, to be an adviser. They kicked around wildly novel ideas, such as using a bullwhip-like device to propel objects into space. Eventually Bezos focused on reusable rockets. \u201cHow is the situation in the year 2000 different from 1960?\u201d Stephenson asked him. \u201cWhat\u2019s different is computer sensors, cameras, software. Being able to land vertically is the kind of problem that can be addressed by those technologies that existed in 2000 that didn\u2019t exist in 1960.\u201dBezos began putting together a huge tract of ranch land in Texas where he could build his reusable rockets in secret. One of the great scenes in Davenport\u2019s book is the description of the helicopter trip Bezos took to find the land, which ended with a terrifying crash. He survived, and it conditioned him to the fact that flying machines sometimes fail. Among Bezos\u2019 many strengths is to be exuberant patiently, to have a long-term horizon, as he has done at Amazon. At his Texas ranch, he has begun construction of a 10,000-year \u201cClock of the Long Now\u201d designed by the futurist Danny Hillis, which has a century hand that advances every hundred years and a cuckoo that comes out every millennium. In the mission statement for his space company, he wrote, \u201cBlue will pursue this long-term objective patiently, step by step.\u201d As Elon Musk pushed forward with very public fits and starts, Bezos advised his team, \u201cBe the tortoise and not the hare.\u201dAt the end of 2015, within a month of each other, Musk and Bezos both launched rockets that returned safely to earth and were reusable. For the moment, Musk the hare had darted ahead: His powerful Falcon 9 rocket had lifted a payload into orbit, whereas Bezos\u2019 smaller New Shepard craft had merely gone up into the edge of space and returned. But as happens with scrappy entrepreneurial business competitors, in contrast to government bureaucracies, Bezos and Musk were goading each other on. And unlike the race between the tortoise and the hare, they can both triumph \u2014 as can, one hopes, Richard Branson and others.Indeed, even NASA and its big corporate contractor, the United Launch Alliance, a venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing, can come out winners from competition. As is often the case with the innovation progression, the greatest technological advances come when a symbiosis is reached that combines the resources of a visionary government and the scrappiness of risk-taking entrepreneurs, each spurring the other onward and upward.Walter Isaacson is a professor of history at Tulane.

{"Headline": "As Trade Tensions Rise, Here Are Some Lessons From Brexit: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Wednesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Another bank takes steps toward gun safety.\u2022 The next steps in the tariffs tit-for-tat.\u2022 Investigators are looking into the motive behind the shooting at YouTube\u2019s headquarters.Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union provides pointers for investors as President Trump ratchets up trade tensions with China.In the weeks following Britain\u2019s vote in 2016 for \u201cBrexit,\u201d fears grew that the post-war economic order was under serious threat. But European stock markets recovered, including Britain\u2019s. Investors came to see that the European Union was not going to break up, and Britain was not going to erect tall walls around its economy. Looking back, the panicky early reaction to Brexit seems to have sprung more from a fear of the unknown than any big threats to the global trading system. Investors took a deep breath and gained some perspective.Movements in the United States stock market suggests the same thing is happening in response to President Trump\u2019s trade policies. China on Tuesday evening announced the tariffs it plans in retaliation against those President Trump is threatening. Reacting to China\u2019s announcement, the S.&P. 500 index plunged early on Wednesday but recovered strongly to close up 1.2 percent.Investors may believe China\u2019s move will lead to drawn-out negotiations. Here, Brexit is again illustrative. As the back and forth between the European Union and Britain has gone on, investors have gained more clarity and confidence. If talks between the U.S. and China gain steam, the uncertainty now clouding relations between the two countries may gradually clear.But the standoff between the U.S. and China differs in important ways from the Brexit tensions. The U.S., for instance, is in a much stronger position than Britain. China exports far more to the U.S. than the U.S. does to China. Limiting access to the U.S. economy could hurt China\u2019s growth at a time when it is trying to overhaul important economic sectors. If investors believe that the U.S. can successfully exploit its advantages to make China more friendly to foreign businesses, they may even see the trade skirmish as positive for the global economy.But Brexit also flashes a warning to those expecting a big win for Mr. Trump. One of the reasons that the European Union has presented a united front is that it sees Brexit as a threat to its values and goals. Similarly, China may believe that Mr. Trump\u2019s trade attack puts some of its most deeply held aspirations under threat \u2013 and will fight back hard.- Peter EavisAfter Citigroup announced plans to limit firearms sales by business customers, the question was which lenders would be the next to make a move on guns. The latest: Amalgamated Bank, the union-owned bank known for its socially minded policies.\u2022 Require gun dealers to protect merchandise from burglary and theft and refuse sales to people who appear in distress or intoxicated\u2022 Require retailers to stop selling high-capacity magazines and bump stocks\u2022 Require gun makers to \u201ccommit to developing innovations in firearms that will allow law enforcement to more easily solve gun crimes\u201dAmalgamated said that it would not only require all business customers to adhere to those guidelines but added that it won\u2019t invest any of its own money in gun manufacturers or distributors.Here\u2019s what Amalgamated\u2019s C.E.O. Keith Mestrich, said in a news release:\u201cCollectively, banks and lenders have the power to promote responsible business practices from gun manufacturers and distributors, and ultimately contribute to a safer society for all. Amalgamated will do whatever we can to achieve that goal and we hope other banks and financial institutions will agree and act.\u201dThe new figure sharply increased the company\u2019s previous estimate of how many users\u2019 information was harvested by Cambridge Analytica. The number had been put at more than 50 million users.The sharing of the user data has unleashed a torrent of criticism at Facebook, the world\u2019s largest social network. The company\u2019s stock is down sharply since The New York Times and The Observer of London reported on how Cambridge Analytica improperly acquired users\u2019 data.The company released the revised estimate of affected users in an extended statement on Wednesday about its plans for handling personal data. The company said it will start alerting users on April 9 about whether their information may have been shared with Cambridge Analytica.In related Facebook news\u2022 Earlier on Wednesday, lawmakers in Washington had said Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, would testify before the House Energy and Commerce Committee on April 11 about the company\u2019s handling of sensitive user data.And is dragging down the Dow Jones industrial average. The blue-chip index is off nearly 350 points, or 1.4 percent. That slide is worse than the declines of the S.&P. 500 and the Nasdaq Composite, which are both down less than 1 percent.Boeing\u2019s 4 percent fall has shaved 87 points off the Dow Wednesday. Boeing is the highest priced stock in the price-weighted index, which means Boeing has an outsized impact on the index\u2019s moves.Boeing\u2019s shares have served as a proxy for investor concern about a possible trade war with China since the Trump administration announced tariffs on aluminum and steel.Over that period, the stock has fallen 12 percent.The streaming-music company\u2019s shares opened at $165.90, but they steadily decline throughout their first day of trading, closing at $149.01.The stock is down 4.1 percent to $142.91 in early trading Wednesday.Because Spotify eschewed a typical initial public offering in favor of a direct listing, there is no I.P.O. price off which to base the performance of its shares. But the company\u2019s current shares price remains well above the $132.50 its private shares changed hands at earlier this year.Sony.At Tuesday\u2019s close, Sony\u2019s 5.7 percent stake was worth $1.5 billion.What may change: security in Silicon Valley.

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 T-Mobile and Sprint have their eye on regulators.\u2022 HNA is set to drop its pursuit of SkyBridge Capital\u2022 How close are the U.S. and Europe to a trade war?But from that, Mr. Legere sought to change the way U.S. wireless providers did business:\u2022 Lowering prices\u2022 Ending some long-term contract requirements\u2022 Offering unlimited data plans\u201cThe company took off like a rocketship and has sustained that momentum ever since the AT&T merger was blocked,\u201d the analyst Craig Moffett of the research firm MoffettNathanson told me in an interview.More on the legacy of Mr. Legere, from my and Cecilia\u2019s story on the deal:Those policies helped T-Mobile add nearly 40 million customers over the last five years, with 5 million new customers added last year alone. AT&T, Verizon and Sprint all followed suit, and in recent years the overall price of basic wireless plans has stayed flat or fallen, according to Obama-era regulators.The Un-carrier campaign helped propel T-Mobile ahead of Sprint in 2015. As of Dec. 31., the company had 58.7 million retail subscribers, compared to Sprint\u2019s 40.9 million. T-Mobile\u2019s market value also outstripped that of Sprint\u2019s, contributing to the structure of Sunday\u2019s deal: Mr. Legere would become C.E.O. of the combined company, which would keep the T-Mobile name.In an ironic twist, completion of the Sprint deal would put T-Mobile ahead of its former suitor, AT&T, in terms of retail subscribers. AT&T had 93.2 million at the end of 2017.But Mr. Moffett said that the very success of Mr. Legere and T-Mobile could pose problems for the Sprint deal, since it proves that regulators\u2019 opposition to the two companies\u2019 effort to merge in 2014 was justified.When I asked about the tweet in a phone interview on Sunday \u2014 which also involved Marcelo Claure, Sprint\u2019s C.E.O. \u2014 Mr. Legere chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re expecting me to remember tweets from 2014?\u201d he responded.\u2014 Michael de la Merced\u201cThe 5G aspects that are critical for the country and critical for us really was the flipping point as to this is the time.\u201d\u201cServices are going to be broadened, prices are going to go down, speeds are going to go up. The 5G capability is going to be beyond anything the United States has seen before. Jobs are going to go up from day one.\u201cIf you liked the competition before, you\u2019re going to love what\u2019s coming with this one. \u201dT-Mobile agreed to buy Sprint in an all-stock deal, which valued Sprint at $26.5 billion or $6.62 a share. At that deal price, Mr. Claure\u2019s long-term award of 10 million Sprint shares is worth $66.2 million. Those shares \u201cwill fully vest if he\u2019s terminated within 18 months of the deal\u2019s completion, or if his responsibilities change materially.\u201dHe also \u201cis eligible for cash severance of about $11.6 million and $54,000 of other benefits.\u201dSo far this year, companies and other buyers have announced $1.68 trillion of acquisitions, according to Dealogic. That\u2019s the biggest total through the first four months of a year on record, topping the $1.64 trillion of deals struck in 2007.Merger activity is also on a record pace in the United States. Acquirers have struck $674 billion of deals for U.S. companies through April 30, the highest level on record and exceeding the $607 billion agreed to through the same period in 2007.Whether they will succeed is another matter. Michael and Cecilia Kang point out that while the F.C.C. commissioner, Ajit Pai, has signaled an open mind toward mergers, many antitrust staffers at the Justice Department are the same people who opposed the deal in 2014.No matter how much hyperbole Sprint and T-Mobile expend, it is hard to see how the deal will pass muster with regulators.\u201cIt would not surprise me if they can come up with an economist with a model that says this is all unicorns and cupcakes,\u201d said Michael Kades, a former lawyer at the F.T.C. who is now the director of markets and competition policy for Washington Center for Equitable Growth. \u201cBut the market concentration is presumptively anticompetitive.\u201dFrom AnnaMaria Andriotis, Telis Demos and Emily Glazer of the WSJ:The financial companies have explored creating a new credit-card code for firearms dealers, similar to how they code restaurants, or department stores, according to people familiar with the matter. Another idea would require merchants to share information about specific firearm products consumers are buying, some of the people said.If the credit card companies and banks agreed, they could come up with a series of subcodes that would identify retailers that sold guns under a \u201cbest practices\u201d policy \u2014 like the policy that Citigroup proposed or the one that Walmart and Dick\u2019s follow \u2014 and the ones that don\u2019t. It would add transparency to the process, and it would give banks that issue credit cards the opportunity to decide which retailers they wanted to associate with.But such a move might concern opponents of gun control, who worry that keeping tabs on firearms sales would be contrary to the government\u2019s hands-off approach to monitoring such transactions. And then there are general privacy concerns: Adam Levitin, a law professor at Georgetown, told the WSJ: \u201cThere\u2019s the slippery slope danger if it\u2019s guns today maybe it is pornography tomorrow and the day after it\u2019s right-wing literature.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la MercedThe country says it will refuse to discuss President Trump\u2019s two toughest trade demands when American officials arrive in Beijing this week, potentially derailing the high-level talks.Keith Bradsher of the NYT reports:The Chinese government is publicly calling for flexibility on both sides. But senior Beijing officials do not plan to discuss the two biggest requests that the Trump administration has made over the past several months, according to people involved in Chinese policymaking. Those include a mandatory $100 billion cut in America\u2019s $375 billion annual trade deficit with China and curbs on Beijing\u2019s $300 billion plan to bankroll the country\u2019s industrial upgrade into advanced technologies like artificial intelligence, semiconductors, electric cars and commercial aircraft.What\u2019s behind China\u2019s stance? Beijing feels its economy has become big enough and resilient enough to stand up to the United States.Mr. Koum, who co-founded WhatsApp and had insisted that strong encryption be built into the service, was perturbed by the amount of data that Facebook collected on people and had advocated for stronger protections of that information, the executive said.Mr. Koum\u2019s exit is the highest-profile departure from Facebook after months of controversy at the social network.The gathering reliably draws leaders from Wall Street, Hollywood and sports to Los Angeles to discuss trade, health care, investing and more. This year\u2019s conference will touch on hot topics like the trade tensions between the U.S. and China, the #MeToo movement, the planned talks with North Korea, and the backlash against Silicon Valley.Attendees include Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Tim Sloan of Wells Fargo, Leon Black of Apollo Global Management and Eric Schmidt of Google.The worries of some critics, according to Nathaniel Popper:Countries that devote more resources to the process could successfully push their preferred cryptographic algorithms to be the standards, potentially creating so-called back doors that could be used in the future to spy on blockchain activity.More from Julie Creswell, Kevin Draper and Rachel Abrams:While Nike executives have told investors that the women\u2019s category was a crucial part of its revenue growth strategy, former employees said it was not given the budget it needed to roll out the sophisticated marketing campaigns that were the hallmark of traditional men\u2019s sports, like basketball.Advertisement"}

But that\u2019s not enough to tell you whether something is a good business. We want to see a good return on invested capital and good free cash flow.\u201dThey sleuth among small- and mid-cap outfits and shy from the tech giants, like Alphabet and Amazon, that have felt so much investor ardor over the past several years. Instead, they\u2019ve toted up gains in holdings as diverse as Dunkin\u2019 Brands Group and Wix.com.Many people misunderstand the investment case for Dunkin\u2019, associating the company with its doughnuts and its omnipresence in the Northeast, particularly New England, Mr. Bonavico said. Its promise instead lies in caffeinated beverages and in the company\u2019s potential for growth in the rest of the United States.\u201cCoffee is the major driver \u2014 it\u2019s a daily purchase, it\u2019s habit-forming, and it\u2019s got a 90 percent margin,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s an enormous opportunity for them to add franchisees west of the Mississippi.\u201dWix, for its part, is known as a website builder for small businesses.

All economic data is signaling they\u2019re past the worst.\u201dThroughout Latin America, Mr. Pruett said, banks tend to be family-controlled and operated, which typically aligns their interests with those of outside shareholders. On top of that, \u201cMarkets are concentrated, and the penetration of financial services is low,\u201d he said.Consider Peru, home to one of his top holdings, Credicorp, a major bank in a country with 31 million people and an economy growing at 6 percent a year. It is one of four banks that dominate the country\u2019s financial system.\u201cThey each have about a quarter of the market,\u201d Mr. Pruett said. \u201cMargins are high.\u201dInvestors have noticed, pushing Credicorp\u2019s stock up nearly 50 percent over the last year. \u201cThe banks in Latin America are long-term winners.\u201dMr. Pruett\u2019s fund, with an expense ratio of 1.09 percent, returned 10.5 percent in the first quarter.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Shipping Costs Have Put Amazon in a Bind: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Good Friday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Does Amazon have its shipping costs under control?\u2022 What will come out of the Merkel-Trump meeting?\u2022 Why Deutsche Bank was so late to make necessary cuts.\u2022 More complaints have emerged about NBC News\u2019s response to harassment allegations.Amazon\u2019s shipping costs have suddenly become a hot subject, not just to President Trump, but also to the 100 million people who have Amazon Prime.Higher shipping costs are a reason Amazon is raising the cost of Prime membership to $119 a year from $99.But a 20 percent hike is a lot for even a popular service, and it could turn customers off. So why did Amazon do it? The e-commerce giant\u2019s results provide some clues.Members of Prime get free shipping, though their membership fees partially pay for that perk. As the Prime program covers more goods, it\u2019s getting more expensive for Amazon. \u201cOur two-day shipping, it\u2019s now available on over 100 million items, up from 20 million as recently as 2014,\u201d Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon\u2019s C.F.O., said on a conference call Thursday when announcing the increase in the Prime membership fee.The cost pressures from shipping are getting uncomfortable for Amazon. Worldwide shipping costs totaled $6.1 billion in the first quarter of this year, equivalent to 22.5 percent of Amazon\u2019s sales from its online stores during the period. That\u2019s up from 2017, when quarterly shipping costs averaged 19.9 percent of online sales. By bringing shipping costs back down to 20 percent of online sales, Amazon could, in theory, save over $2.5 billion a year (2.5 percent of annualized first-quarter sales comes to roughly $2.8 billion.)To save money, Amazon could offer free shipping on fewer goods, but that could undermine the company\u2019s efforts to bolster sales. And Amazon doesn\u2019t need to do that if it can increase its Prime fees, to help recoup the higher shipping costs. But the fee increase may not be enough. Charging 100 million Prime members an extra $20 per year, in theory, raises \u201conly\u201c $2 billion.- Peter EavisMore on her challenge, from the NYT:Few leaders seem less personally in sync with Mr. Trump than Ms. Merkel. Estranged by widely diverging temperaments and leadership styles, the two leaders have also clashed on substance \u2014 from climate change and military spending to Germany\u2019s chronic, yawning trade surplus with the United States, a particular bugbear of the president.Or as a former State Department official told the NYT, \u201cMerkel is going to Washington and it looks like the U.S. just doesn\u2019t care.\u201d But a foreign relations expert said, \u201cNever underestimate Merkel.\u201dA combination of the two companies would complete one of the telecommunications industry\u2019s most long-awaited transactions and would create the third-largest wireless carrier in the United States, with more than 127 million customers. Sprint and T-Mobile have tried to negotiate a merger twice before.Analysts have argued, and Sprint and T-Mobile themselves have acknowledged, that the companies need greater scale and more resources to better compete against the industry\u2019s leaders, Verizon and AT&T.Should the deal be completed, only three companies would dominate the market in the United States for cellphone service. It is unclear whether the transaction would get regulatory approval. A previous round of merger talks ended in 2014, having drawn strong opposition from the Obama administration.\u2014 Michael de la MercedWhat Mr. Ubben had to say: \u201cThe management and board of FOX has done a superb job of steering the company through a time of transition for the entertainment industry.\u201dWhat Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch had to say: \u201cJeff has been an important partner during a transformational period. Our board and, ultimately, our shareholders, have benefited enormously from his many contributions.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la Merced\u2022 Nonresidential fixed investment \u2014 what businesses spend on equipment, software, buildings and intellectual property \u2014 increased at a solid 6.1 percent.\u2022 Business spending on equipment climbed 4.7 percent, down from 11.6 percent in the fourth quarter.Bigger pictureEconomists on Wall Street and in Washington have repeatedly warned that the economy\u2019s upward streak is unlikely to extend beyond the next year or two.Over the longer term, the Fed expects real annual growth in the United States to fall to 1.8 percent. The Congressional Budget Office\u2019s 10-year outlook comes to the same disappointing conclusion.The nation\u2019s debt has topped $21 trillion and is growing, a level many view as unsustainable. And if the Federal Reserve follows through on its plan to raise interest rates, the cost of paying off that debt will grow larger.\u2022 Hubris: Unlike rivals, Deutsche Bank didn\u2019t raise capital after the financial crisis, ultimately leaving it significantly weaker. By the end of last year, its tangible equity capital ratio was still below JPMorgan Chase in 2011. (Perhaps Germany\u2019s banking regulator should have applied more pressure, as Switzerland\u2019s did.)\u2022 Fear: Did Deutsche Bank\u2019s leaders worry about scaling back the investment bank because of its huge importance for revenue? (Last year, it provided 54 percent.) And about the cost of unwinding some trades?The news organization asserted that the complaints that led to Matt Lauer being ousted from the \u201cToday\u201d show were the first of their kind. Others disagree:What NBC News has done: Brought in a consultant for in-person sexual harassment prevention seminars and pledged to share the results of an internal review.The online video giant has largely avoided the political heat that has burned Facebook, but it has still lurched from crisis to crisis, particularly over upsetting videos.The idea is that someday humans will be able to train the machines, in a similar manner, to sniff out misinformation, smut, and abuse.Sure, there\u2019s logic to it, in the face of the threat from Netflix and Amazon. But as the two companies continue to bicker over price and executive chairs, is there another reason Shari Redstone is pushing the idea so hard, when other CBS shareholders seem uninterested?What seems to be driving Shari Redstone is familial score-settling, a quest for victory over her father, who never wanted her to have a role in either Viacom or CBS. \u201cIt\u2019s the story of a person who was mistreated by her father,\u201d said the source who recently noted Sumner\u2019s physical condition, and has known the father and daughter for an extensive period of time.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Sparing Consumers Tariff Burden, Trump Hit Manufacturing", "Date": "2018-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the escalating economic showdown between the United States and China, President Trump is trying to put American shoppers first. The administration did not place tariffs on necessities like shoes and clothes, and mostly spared smartphones from the 25 percent levy on Chinese goods announced this week.But by shielding consumers, Mr. Trump has put American manufacturers \u2014 a group he has championed \u2014 in the cross hairs of a potential global trade war. If the measures stand, along with China\u2019s retaliatory tariffs, they could snuff out a manufacturing recovery just beginning to gain steam.\u201cIf you want to spare the consumer so you don\u2019t get this massive backlash against your tariffs, then there goes manufacturing, because that\u2019s what\u2019s left,\u201d said Monica de Bolle, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cThe irony is, you cannot spare manufacturing from anything because manufacturing is globally integrated. The sector sources its parts and components from all over the world.\u201dThat intricate supply chain often runs directly between the two countries, sometimes in both directions. Chinese factories make wing panels and doors for Boeing\u2019s Next Generation 737 planes, which are assembled by union workers in Renton, Wash. General Motors makes its Buick Envision, a sport-utility vehicle, in Shandong Province, and sells it to American consumers. Construction workers in Denver use building materials manufactured in China, made in part from ethane gas produced in Texas.A central aim of Mr. Trump\u2019s America First agenda is to bring back pieces of the supply chain lying outside the country. The tariffs announced this week are just a bargaining point in a broader negotiation between the United States and China over trade.\u201cThey are trying to force end-product manufacturers here to use more American content by making it more expensive for them to use Chinese content,\u201d said William Reinsch, a trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.The United States trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, has said that the administration carefully conceived the tariffs using an algorithm that would \u201cmaximize the impact on China and minimize the impact on U.S. consumers.\u201dThe result is a list of more than 1,300 targets, many of them obscure products that may not deliver a direct hit to consumers\u2019 wallets. The victims include industrial robots, chemicals, medical devices and heavy machinery used in everything from processing food to crushing rock.Such industries have been a vibrant piece of the economy, adding 224,000 jobs in the past year, the strongest growth since the recession ended nearly nine years ago. But underpinning that rebound has been a strong global appetite for American goods \u2014 demand that could now be weakened.\u201cThis is a pretty tenuous recovery, and employment is still at much lower levels than it was before the crisis,\u201d said Mark Muro, an economist at the Brookings Institution. \u201cThis is not a super dynamic, healthy industry.\u201dRecent job growth has been concentrated in industries that could be affected by American tariffs on China, Chinese tariffs on the United States, or both.President Trump\u2019s tariffs against steel and aluminum imports, designed to protect blue-collar workers, could instead undermine their livelihood.Some of the strongest gains in the past year have come from makers of metal products, industrial machinery and transportation equipment. All those industries rely heavily on steel and aluminum, goods that Mr. Trump hit with tariffs earlier this year in a move aimed indirectly at China\u2019s production.In the latest salvos, the United States took aim at a multitude of technical components \u2014 items like circuit breakers, consoles and touch screens. Those tariffs could raise costs for electronics manufacturers, who have been hiring more aggressively lately and whose supply chains run through China.Beijing, for its part, zeroed in on an array of American products, including plastics, a fast-growing export. Chinese companies imported $3.2 billion worth of plastic resins from the United States in 2017, according to the American Chemistry Council, a trade group. Chinese factories turn those resins into building materials, automobile instrument panels, eyeglasses and thousands of other products, many of which end up back in the United States.The plastics tariffs alone could send ripples deep into Trump country. In recent years, companies have announced billions of dollars of investments seeking to capitalize on the boom in American natural-gas production. Some of those investments were to go into new plants in Pennsylvania, Ohio and other states to turn gas into chemicals and plastics, much of it bound for China.Companies aren\u2019t likely to abandon those plans overnight, said Calvin M. Dooley, president of the American Chemistry Council. But if the trade barriers persist, projects could be in jeopardy. \u201cThat is going to impede our ability to capitalize on that competitive advantage,\u201d Mr. Dooley said.Even with the flurry of measures and countermeasures between the United States and China, the moves so far have touched only a fraction of their $650 billion in annual trade. But they are beginning to signal how much damage could be caused, and who would suffer most.In some cases, the tariffs seem intended to deliver a message rather than a fatal blow. The United States said it would impose tariffs on aircraft parts \u2014 an important and high-profile American industry, but not one facing much competition from China. Beijing said it would impose tariffs on cars and S.U.V.s, the third-largest American export to the country. But the move may not hit American automakers as hard as it might seem.China already has a 25 percent tariff on imported cars, so General Motors, Fiat Chrysler and Ford have all agreed to manufacture inside the country as joint ventures with domestic producers, to avoid the extra charge to consumers. Foreign carmakers operating in the United States \u2014 Daimler and BMW \u2014 do send vehicles to China from factories in the Southeast. A report by analysts at Evercore ISI suggests that those companies, rather than the Detroit automakers, would bear the brunt of the Chinese levies.Tesla might have the most to lose. The electric-car company had been lobbying hard for permission to produce cars in Shanghai, but hasn\u2019t reached a deal. It sends vehicles to the Chinese market from its plant in Fremont, Calif., and its chief executive, Elon Musk, has expressed frustration even at the existing duties.Aircraft and their parts are the largest single category of American exports to China, making Boeing a big target. For now, though, Beijing seems to be moving slowly. It said it would impose tariffs on planes between 15,000 and 45,000 kilograms, which includes some older models that Chinese buyers have ordered from Boeing. But it seemed to stop conspicuously short of whacking the company\u2019s newer 737 MAX 8, which weighs 45,070 kilograms empty.That near miss is meant to convey to Boeing, and Mr. Trump, what China is capable of, said Richard L. Aboulafia, a longtime aviation and aerospace analyst at the Teal Group.\u201cTheir attitude toward a trade war assumes that the other side will lie down and stay horizontal,\u201d Mr. Aboulafia said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure the easy and fun approach to trade wars holds up against return fire.\u201dKeith Bradsher contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How U.S. Fuel Economy Standards Compare With the Rest of the World\u2019s", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "Advertisement\nNormalized to U.S. Corporate Average Fuel Economy test cyclesSeveral other countries have modeled their vehicle standards after those in the United States, so a rollback by the Environmental Protection Agency could potentially affect standards across the globe.If automakers complied with the rules solely by improving the fuel economy of their engines, new cars and light trucks on the road would average more than 50 miles per gallon by 2025 (the charts here break out standards for cars and light trucks separately). But automakers in the United States have some flexibility in meeting these standards. They can, for instance, get credit for using refrigerants in vehicle air-conditioning units that contribute less to global warming, or get credit for selling more electric vehicles.The Obama-era rules were also footprint-based, which means that larger S.U.V.s and light trucks face less stringent standards than smaller passenger cars do \u2014 as is true in most countries.Normalized to U.S. Corporate Average Fuel Economy test cyclesIn recent years, as gasoline prices have fallen, more Americans have been opting to buy bigger cars and S.U.V.s.

{"Headline": "Goldman\u2019s Gains in Trading Raise a Familiar Dilemma: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Tuesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 A \u2018Geneva Convention\u2019 for cyberwar?\u2022 Did Goldman\u2019s trading business perform too well?\u2022 The U.S.-China fight has pushed deeper into tech.Goldman Sachs\u2019s strong first-quarter earnings raise a familiar dilemma for the bank.The results got a significant fillip from trading, a business Goldman must do well in, but not so well that investors think the bank is too dependent on it. And a breakdown of first-quarter revenue shows the dominance of trading. Revenue from trading in stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities and derivatives totaled $4.39 billion during the first three months of the year. That works out at 44 percent of total revenue, well above the 37 percent share that trading had in 2017.Stock and bond markets are unpredictable, even in relatively good times, so the helpful trading conditions this quarter may not last. What can Goldman\u2019s senior executives do to persuade investors that the bank is a lot more than a trading shop? They can point to the fact that David M. Solomon is in line to succeed Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman\u2019s current C.E.O. Mr. Solomon ascent took place in the bank\u2019s powerful investment banking division, not its trading operations.Goldman\u2019s leaders can continue to talk about the steps the bank is taking to widen its client base and diversify into other businesses that might have more stable revenue, like its relatively new consumer lending operations. But such businesses are going to take time to make a meaningful contribution.And it\u2019s important to remember that other major businesses at Goldman are also volatile. Investing and lending, which mostly involves making longer-term investments in companies, and whose revenue can be unpredictable, made up 21 percent of total revenue in the first quarter, the second largest contribution.Despite the bumper results in trading along with investing and lending, Goldman\u2019s shares slid slightly on Tuesday, suggesting investors are waiting on longer-term trends than one quarter\u2019s results.But the volatility of revenue is not the only reason investors are often skeptical about Wall Street firms. The huge amounts that they pay out in compensation is also a concern. When revenue rises, so does pay. As a result, money that could have fallen to the bottom line at other types of companies instead gets paid out to traders and bankers. Compensation at Goldman Sachs made up 45 percent of non-interest revenue in the first quarter, up from 44 percent the first quarter of 2017.\u2014 Peter EavisHere are the numbers:The move comes amid an outcry prompted by the arrests of two African-American men at a Starbucks location in Philadelphia last week.The two men were arrested after asking to use the restroom in the shop. An employee refused their request, because the men had not bought anything, according to officials. The men sat down and were asked to leave, and an employee eventually called the police. The prosecutor\u2019s office in Philadelphia reviewed the case and declined to pursue charges against the men because of \u201ca lack of evidence that a crime was committed,\u201d according to a spokesman.Some may be optimistic that the $1.5 trillion tax cut will extend the business cycle.The strategists at Morgan Stanley are not among them.\u201cWhile there\u2019s a fair amount of debate about how much this fiscal expansion extended the economic cycle, for markets our analysis suggests we\u2019re closer to the end of the day than the beginning. Hence, there\u2019s less reason to behave like it\u2019s \u2018morning in America\u2019 than \u2018happy hour in America.\u2019\u201dKey points\u2022 Morgan Stanley argues that while the tax cuts will help lift growth in the near term, its benefits are already priced into the markets.\u2022 The new tax law creates economic cliffs, as many key provisions in the law are not permanent and end in just a few years.\u2022 The tax cuts may make it more difficult for the government to turn to fiscal stimulus to fight the next downturn.In conclusion\u201cWhile this policy supports growth in the near term, it may worsen the next downturn while limiting the fiscal reaction to it. Even if those concerns are unfounded, we think much of fiscal stimulus\u2019 \u2018good news\u2019 is already in the price of key markets.\u201dThe streaming video company added 7.41 million subscribers during the first quarter. Its profit jumped 62 percent, and sales grew 40 percent.Netflix also said it plans to spend $10 billion on content and marketing this year.Shares are up 8.6 percent Tuesday and 75 percent this year. That easily beats the S.&P. 500, which has gained just 0.2 percent this year. It also tops the performance of its fellow FANG stocks. Facebook is off 4.5 percent this year, Google-parent Alphabet is up about 3 percent, and Amazon has risen 28 percent.Stephen Ju, an analyst over at Credit Suisse, writes in a note titled \u201cGetting Closer and Closer to Achieving Escape Velocity\u201d:\u201cNetflix continues to reap the benefits of its programming win streak, as it wields its large content acquisition budget as a weapon to put greater distance between itself and its competitors (especially as Disney prepares to exit the platform). And we find it hard to argue with the accelerated pace of subscriber additions as the conceptual proof of its capital allocation decision, and we also expect the Street to continue to underwrite the investments.\u201dTwitter is having an even better day.The stock is up 87 percent over that period.The NYT\u2019s David Sanger says the impetus came largely from Microsoft\u2019s president, Brad Smith, \u201cwho has been arguing for several years that the world needs a \u2018digital Geneva Convention\u2019 that sets norms of behavior for cyberspace just as the Geneva Conventions set rules for the conduct of war in the physical world.\u201dAlso striking: Who hasn\u2019t yet signed, including Google, Apple and Amazon.More from Michael:Ms. Massenet and Mr. Brown are counting on Ms. Massenet\u2019s Net-a-Porter experience and contacts to help Imaginary Ventures stand out. The firm has already invested in companies like Glossier and Everlane, an upstart clothing brand.Mr. Ballmer said of the latest report, \u201cPublic companies owe this level of transparency to shareholders; I think citizens, as America\u2019s shareholders, deserve the same.\u201dAs more financial firms move to pressure gun makers and sellers into self-regulation, the advocacy group (backed by Mike Bloomberg) plans to ask them to press for more policy positions and operational changes.Among them: Requiring background checks for all gun sales; more funding for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; having gun makers require sellers to adopt a code of conduct; and adopting smart-gun tech.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "With Tesla in a Danger Zone, Can Model 3 Carry It to Safety?", "Date": "2018-04-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseAs I zipped up the West Side Highway the other day in a gleaming red Tesla Model 3, I found myself wondering: Are American drivers ready for Autopilot?Autopilot is Tesla\u2019s enhanced driver-assistance technology, which the company maintains is the most advanced system available. Tesla says all its vehicles \u201chave the hardware needed for full self-driving capability at a safety level substantially greater than that of a human driver.\u201dIn this case, I was the human. I had tried a gull-wing Model X last fall with an earlier version of Autopilot, but since then the stakes \u2014 for both Tesla and consumers \u2014 have soared.On March 23, a driver was killed in Mountain View, Calif., after a Model X crashed into a concrete highway divider while Autopilot was in use. The fatal accident attracted intense media coverage and sent Tesla stock, long an investor favorite, into a nose dive.Four days later, Moody\u2019s downgraded Tesla\u2019s debt from stable to negative. Tesla was already so plagued with Model 3 production delays that its chief executive, Elon Musk, said he had been sleeping on the factory floor. By the beginning of this past week, Tesla shares had dropped over 30 percent from a peak of almost $390 a share last summer.Despite this wave of negative publicity, it seems clear that Tesla will rise or fall based on the performance, safety, design and value of its cars. If it gets those things right, all the other issues will sort themselves out. Tesla has already defied skeptics and attracted legions of die-hard fans by surmounting seemingly impossible odds to build all-electric cars that have drawn lavish praise from automotive critics.That includes the Model 3, which Popular Mechanics named its 2018 Car of the Year. (It was a finalist for Motor Trend\u2019s similar award. That it lost out to the Alfa Romeo Giulia has drawn howls of online protest.)When my Model 3 test vehicle pulled up to the curb on Eighth Avenue, it didn\u2019t quite stop pedestrian traffic the way opening the gull-wing doors on the Model X had, but I could see why the automotive press is so excited. The interior features a single slab of wood sweeping around the cockpit interrupted only by a touch-screen interface that houses nearly all the controls, many of them voice activated.With its Zen minimalism, it doesn\u2019t look or feel like any other car I\u2019ve been in. The synthetic-leather seats are comfortable, and there\u2019s ample room for someone my size (6-foot-3). This all comes at a cost: $57,500 for this luxurious long-range version, far from the $35,000 base price that has excited many potential Tesla buyers.The Model 3 may not have the rocketlike acceleration of the X, but I found it nimble and responsive. I easily accelerated from a full stop into traffic flowing at highway speed, usually a nerve-racking maneuver in a conventional car. Driving the Model 3 was such a pleasure I was reluctant to cede any control to Autopilot.For someone with decades of experience driving a conventional car, my first taste of semiautonomous driving last fall had come as a shock. The sensation of a vehicle moving on its own was so bizarre that I instinctively gripped the steering wheel, which immediately transferred control back to me.This time I was more relaxed, willing to see how the car would behave. I gave the voice-activated navigation system a destination (Garden State Plaza, a New Jersey shopping mall about 20 miles away), and the car accelerated, braked, stayed in the center of the lane and maintained a comfortable three-car distance ahead of me, all without my intervention. At the mall, it detected an empty parking place, and flawlessly backed into it.One of its most impressive features is the ability for the driver to change lanes simply by pressing the turn-signal lever. The Tesla scans for traffic in the adjacent lane, waits for an opening and then glides into place, eliminating the danger of a blind spot. (Over the years I\u2019ve experienced several close calls involving lane changes and blind spots.)Although I\u2019d been briefed on its limitations, so successful was Autopilot that I was tempted to let down my guard by not bothering to look in the rearview mirror. That would have been a mistake.For all its vision capabilities (including in darkness), Autopilot became confused when lanes weren\u2019t clearly marked or split in two or at exit ramps. You can\u2019t simply program the destination and let the car find its way. It\u2019s reassuringly cautious about changing lanes, but in heavy traffic, I would have missed an exit while waiting for it to find a suitable opening, and had to assert manual control.While heading south on the New Jersey Turnpike, I could see in the rearview mirror a BMW bearing down at high speed. I pushed the turn signal for a lane change, and despite its ultrasonic sensors, the Tesla seemed oblivious to the onrushing car. It started to move into its lane; the driver laid on his horn, and I had to grab control to avoid an accident.The Tesla owner\u2019s manual describes this situation as one that the system can\u2019t yet manage. Tesla said it expected future upgrades to solve the problem, but for now, drivers need to be as attentive to the rearview mirror as with any other car.Tesla had no comment for this column.At this juncture, Autopilot is a misnomer, as many others have observed. \u201cThis is not self-driving technology,\u201d said Bryan Reimer, a research scientist and expert on autonomous vehicle technology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cIt\u2019s a collaborative system that leaves responsibility for safety in the drivers\u2019 hands and isn\u2019t intended to let them sit in the back seat or pursue other activities while driving.\u201d Even though some companies have said they plan driverless ride services in as little as two years, Mr. Reimer said full automation was likely to be many years or even decades in the future.Given that this was my first extended drive using Autopilot, I was hypervigilant, maybe even more so than in a conventional car. I\u2019m told that wears off in time, as using Autopilot becomes second nature. The risk is that complacency contributes to driver inattention. Mr. Reimer and other experts are conducting research into the issue.\u201cAs technology supplants human performance,\u201d Mr. Reimer said, \u201cthe bigger question is how safe is safe enough. If lane-changing technology is 50 percent more effective than humans, is that good enough? That\u2019s the big question no one wants to answer.\u201dAt the same time, he said, he worries that \u201cintense media coverage of accidents like Mountain View will scare people off.\u201d He said it was too soon to draw any conclusions from that fatality, but noted that Tesla\u2019s excellent safety record over the many millions of miles its cars have now traveled suggested that using Autopilot \u201ccan\u2019t be substantially more risky than conventional controls.\u201d (There were more than 40,000 traffic fatalities in the United States last year.)After my drive in the Model 3, my sense is that even with its flaws, Tesla\u2019s Autopilot is a vast improvement over conventional controls, and enhances (rather than supplants) the driving experience. I\u2019m tempted to join the Model 3 waiting list, which numbers over 400,000 customers.An earlier version of this article misidentified the Alfa Romeo model that was named the 2018 Motor Trend Car of the Year. It is the Giulia, not the Giulietta.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Redstones\u2019 Voting Power Leaves Moonves and CBS Few Options: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Friday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Lending in the first quarter is set to disappoint.\u2022 JPMorgan reported record revenue and profit.\u2022 Why is President Trump considering rejoining the TPP?\u2022 What the U.S.P.S. inquiry means for Amazon.Chief executives with Mr. Moonves\u2019s record don\u2019t often find themselves in this position, but he is there because of CBS and Viacom\u2019s unique corporate governance structure: namely, the super-voting powers of the Redstone family\u2019s vehicle, National Amusements.Let\u2019s recap the kind of power that National Amusements has over the corporate siblings, thanks to its dual classes of stock:\u2022 Despite owning just over 10 percent of the outstanding shares at CBS and just under 10 percent at Viacom, the Redstones have about 80 percent of the voting power at both companies.\u2022 With that kind of power, National Amusements could replace the board at either company at any point in time.It is that power that allows Shari Redstone to compel CBS and Viacom to explore a merger for the second time.CBS said in a statement Wednesday: \u201cThe industry and the marketplace know Leslie Moonves\u2019 record and we think it speaks for itself.\u201d Viacom declined to comment.Thanks to the dual-class stock structure \u2014 something CBS and Viacom share with the likes of Facebook, Alphabet and The New York Times Company \u2014 there\u2019s little that regular shareholders, or management of either company, can do.Legal experts say that National Amusements has fiduciary duties to shareholders of each company, but that the Redstones unquestionably have the power to replace board members.\u201cYou can stack the board,\u201d said John Coffee of Columbia Law School, though he added that \u201cit might be poor form to stuff the board\u201d before pushing through a merger or C.E.O. change.Charles Elson, director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware, said that companies controlled by a dual-class structure can sometimes opt for other shareholders to have a voice. But that isn\u2019t a requirement.Professor Elson said that Ms. Redstone has the ability to force through a deal or a board change. But, he added, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t mean that these things go without litigation.\u201d\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedTax cuts, bank deregulation and a recovering global economy were expected to unleash a surge of bank lending that could stoke an even stronger expansion. But lending in the first quarter is set to disappoint, at least going by the results of the four big banks that reported Friday.JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and PNC Financial had a combined $2.78 trillion of loans at the end of the first quarter, up 3 percent from $2.7 billion at the end of the same period a year ago. How does that growth rate stack up? It\u2019s more or less in line with the 2.9 percent increase in loans the banks notched up last year, but it is well below the 4.6 percent and the 4.4 percent rates that they together achieved in 2016 and 2015.Each quarter, much attention is paid to the performance of the big banks\u2019 Wall Street operations. But activities like trading are only remotely related to the real economy. As a result, to assess whether banks are assisting the wider economy, it makes more sense to look at trends in their lending, which directly finances consumer spending, home purchases and corporate investments.Investors may have been disappointed at the first-quarter lending numbers. Despite the four banks\u2019 strong profits, their stock prices on Friday slid.The unexceptional first-quarter loan growth may, of course, give way to bigger increases later this year as confidence builds. And beneath the aggregated loan totals are some numbers that suggest things could improve. Citigroup\u2019s loans grew 7.1 percent in the first quarter, compared with the year-ago period. The increase was driven by a 13 percent surge in corporate lending, much of which took place in Europe and Asia. And the first-quarter total for the four banks was held back by a 1.1 percent decline at Wells Fargo, which is operating under a strict regulatory edict.\u2014 Peter Eavis\u201cWe\u2019ve got a deal\u201d already, said Steven Ciobo, Australia\u2019s trade minister, who added, \u201cI can\u2019t see that all being thrown open to appease the United States.\u201dShares of the biggest banks are faring worse than the broader stock indexes.The KBW Bank Index, made up of 24 of the largest banks, is off nearly 1 percent while the S.&P. 500 is essentially flat in early trading.JPMorgan was down 1.1 percent, Citigroup was off 1.5 percent, and Wells Fargo fell 2.3 percent.The declines come despite JPMorgan announcing record profits and Citi reporting its highest earnings since 2015.Following widespread missteps at the bank, the Fed in February told Wells Fargo that, until sufficient improvements were made, it could not increase the amount of assets it holds. Some analysts said the cap need not stop the bank from making more loans, because it could sell securities and then use that money to do more lending. But loans did not grow in the first quarter. At the end of March, Wells Fargo had $947 billion of loans, down from $958 billion a year earlier, and also down from $957 billion at the end of 2017.But the decline is not large, and it\u2019s not clear how much the Fed\u2019s cap is to blame. Wells Fargo\u2019s loans had not been growing strongly in recent quarters.And here are Wells Fargo\u2019s numbers:\u2022 Wells Fargo\u2019s profit rose to $5.94 billion.\u2022 Earnings per share came in at $1.12 a share. Analysts had expected earnings of $1.06 a share, according to Thomson Reuters.\u2022 Revenues fell to $21.9 billion from $22.3 billion in the first-quarter 2017.\u2022 Costs rose 3% to $14.24 billion from $13.79 billion a year ago.\u2014 Peter EavisJPMorgan reported record revenue and profit for the first three months of this year.Here are the numbers:\u2022 The bank reported earnings of $8.71 billion, up 35 percent from a year ago.\u2022 That comes to $2.37 a share. Analysts had expected earnings of $2.28 a share, according to Thomson Reuters.\u2022 Revenue increased to $28.5 billion, up 10 percent.\u2022 Return on equity, a measure of profitability, hit 15 percent, up from 11 percent a year ago.\u2022 Trading revenues rose to $6.57 billion, up 13 percent from the first quarter of 2017.\u2022 Equities trading revenue rose 26 percent to $2.02 billion.\u2022 Bond-trading revenue rose 8 percent to $4.55 billion.\u2022 Earnings rose to $4.6 billion, up from $4.1 billion a year ago.\u2022 Earnings per share came in at $1.68. Analysts expected $1.61 a share, according to Thomson Reuters.\u2022 Revenue increased to $18.9 billion for the quarter, up 3% from a year earlier.\u2022 Revenue from fixed-income trading fell 7 percent to $3.4 billion.\u2022 Equity trading revenue jumped 38% to $1.1 billion.\u2022 Fees from investment banking fell 10 percent to $1.1 billion.One way to gauge the crosswinds blowing through financial markets and the global economy is by examining the results of JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo, which report their first-quarter earnings today.\u2022 Are trade tensions reducing demand for credit?\u2022 How concerned should we be with the volatility in the stock and bond markets?\u2022 Are regular Americans borrowing more, potentially boosting the U.S. economy?\u2022 How much will deregulation help the banks?\u201cI, maybe a bit na\u00efvely, believed that there was a need for someone in high elected office to be more open-minded and willing to not only govern from the middle but to try to shame everyone else into going to the middle.\u201dAlas, his company agreed to buy most of 21st Century Fox for $52.4 billion, and that was that.One intriguing possibility: Elliott pushing to be involved in a sale of some or all of the business through its private equity team, Evergreen Coast Capital.The deals flyaroundAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "China Is Opening Its Car Market. But Not Enough, Say Auto Companies.", "Date": "2018-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow the cheering has stopped.Central to Mr. Xi\u2019s plan is that it will allow foreign automakers to own Chinese factories, instead of working through a 50-50 Chinese partner, as is currently required. But auto executives in Beijing said they were comfortable with the current system.\u201cIt would be crazy to think you can do it all yourself, in a market that is so different,\u201d said Trevor Worthington, Ford\u2019s vice president for product development in Asia and the Pacific.Mr. Xi\u2019s plan to further open up China\u2019s auto market was seen as a potential olive branch. It calls for phasing out by 2022 the Beijing government\u2019s requirement that any foreign automaker that wants to make cars in China do so through a 50-50 joint venture with a Chinese car company. For makers of electric cars, the requirement would end this year. He also said that China would reduce its 25 percent tariff on imported cars, without offering details.The plan could help companies setting up new factories, especially upstarts like the electric vehicle company Tesla Motors, which has big ambitions in the world\u2019s largest market for new cars.But established carmakers like Daimler, Volkswagen and Ford said at the auto show on Wednesday that they planned to keep their joint ventures the way they were. The companies have already moved their production and auto parts supply chains to China. And foreign auto companies have found making cars in China for local drivers quite profitable.\u201cWe will maintain the structure as we have today,\u201d said Rupert Stadler, the chairman of Audi, the luxury arm of Volkswagen of Germany. Referring to Audi\u2019s two joint ventures in China, he added, \u201cFor us it is very clear: We will, in the long run, have two feet on the ground in China.\u201d\u201cWe hope things may change,\u201d said Jochem Heizmann, the president and chief executive of Volkswagen Group China. \u201cAt the end, this limits competition, this limits innovation.\u201dThey also cited China\u2019s ambitious program to use state support to build up world-beating competitors in electric and self-driving cars, among other emerging technologies, a program called Made in China 2025.China also requires that electric cars be manufactured under brand names that are partly owned by Chinese partners.Peter Fleet, the president of Ford Motor\u2019s Asia and Pacific operations, said the company already planned to sell electric cars in China through a joint venture under an inexpensive local brand that would not carry its famous blue oval logo. Still, he said, he thought the rule might be erased once China eliminates the requirement that electric cars also be produced by joint ventures in China.\u201cThat\u2019s some of the detail we\u2019ve yet to see,\u201d he said.Ailin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}

The actions have weighed on the stock prices of large international corporations, and if implemented, could hurt their bottom lines.But global companies mostly have not detailed the potential impact of Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policies. Will that now change? With first-quarter earnings imminent, and tensions with China escalating, shareholders may want companies to make specific disclosures. The companies may be tempted to say little. After all, Mr. Trump\u2019s trade restrictions have merely been threatened, and may not occur if deals are struck. But in the past, companies have refreshed their outlooks in the face of circumstantial economic and geopolitical events, like the Gulf War. And investors will likely press firms to estimate the impact of a trade war and describe the measures they will take to protect their businesses.Still, the prospect of a trade war raises questions about the adequacy of corporate disclosure. Those of G.M., contained in its latest annual report, seem quite detailed. They offer quite specific warnings about the risks of doing business in China, and the company even mentions the possibility of trade agreements falling apart. But financial reports from Boeing and Apple arguably have less on potential problems in China and trade disputes.Boeing\u2019s annual report did mention tariffs and embargoes as threats. But the report, released in February, also sounded a bullish note on the global economy that now almost sounds like it was from a different era:\u201cThe long-term outlook for the industry continues to remain positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel growth: economic growth and the increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization, and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries.\u201dWill such language remain in Boeing\u2019s reports?- Peter EavisFor years, investors had a singular focus on the Federal Reserve and its plans to raise rates.Any indication that the Fed could move more aggressively than expected to tighten monetary policies and stocks would pull back.Now the Fed has company in sending jitters through the market: Trade.A one-two punch from the White House and the Fed pushed stocks on Wall Street down Friday. The S.&P. 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average both finished off more than 2 percent.Markets began to slide at the start of trading after President Trump\u2019s threat on Thursday to heap fresh tariffs on China. Investors took little comfort in statements from the administration\u2019s top economic policymakers, Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary. Both men sought to tamp down the contentious back-and-forth between the two economic giants.Comments from Mr. Powell in the early Friday afternoon added to the unease. In a speech in Chicago, Mr. Powell highlighted the strength of the United States economic recovery and gave little indication that the Fed planned to deviate from its gradual path of lifting interest rates.On WABC Radio\u2019s \u201cBernie & Sid in the Morning\u201d show, Mr. Trump said:\u201cNow we could\u2014the easiest thing for me to do would be just to close my eyes and forget it.\u201d\u201cIf I did that, I\u2019m not doing my job. So, I\u2019m not saying there won\u2019t be a little pain but the market\u2019s gone up 40 percent, 42 percent \u2014 so we might lose a little bit of it\u2014 but we\u2019re going to have a much stronger country when we\u2019re finished. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m all about. We have to do things that other people wouldn\u2019t do.\u201dThe president also took to Twitter to defend his approach to trade policy. Mr. Trump, in a tweet, criticized both China and the World Trade Organization, saying that the Chinese \u201cget tremendous perks and advantages, especially over the U.S. Does anybody think this is fair. We were badly represented. The WTO is unfair to U.S.\u201dThat followed another early morning tweet, in which Mr. Trump boasted that the new metals tariffs he has put into effect on China and other nations had not hurt American consumers as his critics predicted.More from what a representative for China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce said:\u201cWe feel America is very arrogant. They have taken a wrong action. The result is that they will hurt themselves.\u201dThe Chinese official said that the two sides can\u2019t negotiate under the current conditions. And in an interview with Bloomberg on Friday, Larry Kudlow \u2014 who has been national economic adviser for just under a week \u2014 said he could not predict when talks would begin. He added:Earlier this year, stocks sold off after the jobs report for January showed a 2.9 percent annual increase in wages, a relatively strong rise. Investors feared that a sustained increase in earnings could prompt consumers to buy more goods and services, pushing up prices in the process. Concerns receded after February\u2019s report showed a 2.6 percent jump in wages, and March\u2019s rise of 2.7 percent is not likely to stir up more worries.The March report contained data that could do even more to quell investors\u2019 nerves over inflation. While the report revised February\u2019s gain higher to 326,000 jobs from 313,000, it sharply reduced the January figure to 176,000 from 239,000. The January revision prompted Jim Vogel, of FTN Financial, to write:\u201cThat collapsed what had been an upward slope to the last two years of payroll growth and implicitly reduced the upward pressure on wages that so many are still certain will arrive this year.\u201d\u2014 Peter EavisThe headline numbers The takeaways\u2022 \u201cThat\u2019s something I get no credit for, by the way,\u201d he says. \u201cI have been for equal opportunity in gay marriage for the last 12 or 13 years.\u201d\u2022 \u201cSee this?\u201d he says. \u201cThese are front-stabbing knives.

{"Headline": "China Loosens Foreign Auto Rules, in Potential Peace Offering to Trump", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 Beijing and Washington have threatened each other with tariffs for weeks, raising the prospect of a trade war. But on Tuesday, China took a step to lower tensions, offering to make it easier for foreign automakers and aerospace manufacturers to own factories in the country.The Chinese authorities said that in the next five years they would ease rules that have long required carmakers like General Motors, Toyota and Volkswagen to link up with a local partner before building a factory in China. For manufacturers of electric cars, as well as for companies that make jetliners, helicopters and drones, Beijing plans to move even faster, eliminating foreign ownership limits this year.Loosening limits for electric carmakers and aerospace manufacturers is notable because those are two areas where Beijing and Washington have been increasingly at loggerheads. The sectors are among 10 industries in Beijing\u2019s Made in China 2025 plan, which calls for extensive government support to expand China\u2019s production and self-sufficiency in everything from microchips to robotics.Beijing\u2019s offer on Tuesday to make it easier for foreign aircraft manufacturers to set up wholly owned factories in China might even increase worries in the national security community in Washington about further transfers of the technology needed to retain America\u2019s military edge.Easing electric car limits may not be enough to bring the Trump administration to the negotiating table, much less reach a deal. The White House has expressed more interest in creating jobs in the United States than in making it easier for American companies to build factories overseas.It also isn\u2019t clear whether the measures \u2014 part of a series of moves to relax trade rules for carmakers \u2014 will win over the auto industry.China has previously said it will also reduce tariffs on imported cars, but it has not specified when or by how much. Much of the global auto parts industry has already moved to China to avoid those tariffs.G.M., Volkswagen and others have learned to profit handsomely with their local partners, which have developed fairly few homegrown models attractive enough to win over Chinese customers. And foreign automakers may want local partners anyway to smooth potential political problems and to win access to Chinese subsidies.The latest move, announced on Tuesday by China\u2019s top economic planning agency, follows through on a long-promised effort by Beijing to further open its markets to foreign companies.The planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission, said in a statement that rules requiring a Chinese partner would be lifted this year for the electric-car industry, in 2020 for the production of trucks and other commercial vehicles, and in 2022 for all cars made in China.China also said on Tuesday that it would eliminate foreign ownership restrictions this year on its shipbuilding industry. But that industry is in disarray, saddled with overcapacity and heavy debts after more than a decade of large loans from the state-controlled banking industry.The immediate big winner from the decision on car manufacturing would be Tesla. Going into the Chinese market without a joint venture partner would mean that Tesla could keep better control of its technology and retain all the profits. That also means Tesla would have to foot the entire investment cost.\u201cThey don\u2019t need to negotiate with any party, but the bad news is they have to invest 100 percent of their own money,\u201d said Yale Zhang, the managing director of Automotive Foresight, a Shanghai consulting firm, referring to Tesla.General Motors quickly issued a statement on Tuesday indicating that it was not eager to buy out its partners, notably the powerful and state-controlled Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation. \u201cG.M.\u2019s growth in China is a result of working with our trusted joint venture partners,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe will continue to work with our partners to provide high-quality products and services to consumers.\u201dVolkswagen also said in a statement that it was committed to continuing its joint ventures, but that it would explore whether new opportunities were possible. The German company has been making ambitious plans to build electric cars in China, and only has a loose and deliberately temporary joint venture with Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Group to do so.Cui Dongshu, the secretary general of the China Passenger Car Association, which represents the country\u2019s domestic industry, said that Chinese automakers had developed a lot of expertise recently in electric cars. \u201cFor the short term, they still face huge pressures,\u201d he said on Tuesday. \u201cFor the long term, automakers will adapt to the new environment and make our auto industry more competitive.\u201dChina has been the only carmaking nation of any significance that requires joint ventures with local companies. Even countries like Brazil and India, which have some of the world\u2019s highest barriers to imports, do not have similar joint venture requirements.Beijing insisted on the special rule when it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. Chinese trade negotiators wanted to make sure that the country\u2019s automakers, which were tiny by international standards then, would not be crushed by foreign competition.Ailin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 The big banks are getting ready to report first-quarter results.\u2022 Larry Fink believes robust global growth and earnings will support stocks.\u2022 There\u2019s a consensus that Facebook must be regulated. The question is, how?\u2022 What Paul Ryan\u2019s exit means for business.\u2022 Jack Ma argues that a trade war would hurt the U.S.Headwinds and tailwinds are blowing through the financial markets and the global economy.The strength of these crosscurrents can be gauged, in part, by examining the results of the big banks, three of which report their first-quarter earnings on Friday. They are JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, which have large operations around the world and big Wall Street businesses, as well as Wells Fargo, which is more of a traditional lender focused on the United States.At the start of the year, the big banks had the wind in their backs. The global economy seemed to be on a clear growth path, the United States had just enacted large tax cuts and the Trump administration was expected to loosen bank regulations. But the threat of a trade war between the United States and China helped plunge the stock markets into correction during the first quarter. The banks\u2019 results, as well as comments from their senior executives, could signal whether the tumult is seeping into the real economy. Here are some things to watch out for:\u2014 Peter EavisAmid the steep drop in its stock price, perhaps it was only a matter of time before Micro Focus drew an activist investor. Elliott Management was a logical candidate. Now, as the $34 billion activist investor has taken a stake in the software maker, here\u2019s what it could push for:\u2022 Potentially go private altogether\u2022 Potentially sell off Suse Linux, a popular maker of the Linux operating system that Micro Focus acquired as part of its takeover of AttachmateOne possibility is that Elliott will push to be involved in a sale of some or all of the business through its private equity team, Evergreen Coast Capital.A spokesman for Elliott declined to comment, while a spokeswoman for Micro Focus declined to comment.Despite one of more volatile quarters in recent years, the chief executive of BlackRock believes that robust global growth and stellar earnings results will be enough to keep the stock market from spiraling downward.But he concedes that worries over trade wars and increased political uncertainty \u2014 at home and abroad \u2014 has made for a riskier investing environment.\u201cMy optimism has abated somewhat,\u201d Mr. Fink said in an interview on Thursday. \u201cBut economically the world is in good shape.\u201dBut for all the turmoil and noise, the market is about flat for the year, he pointed out.The investment giant reported first-quarter earnings Thursday. Helped by continuing inflows into the firm's passive funds, better performance by its actively managed funds and a more favorable tax rate, earnings per share grew 28 percent compared with a year ago.\u201cThis quarter validates us institutionally,\u201d Mr. Fink said, making the point that BlackRock could attract money even when investors are in a jittery mood.Even though many investors yanked money out of the market over the past two months, BlackRock had $55 billion of net inflows for the quarter, with its fast-growing exchange-traded funds comprising $34 billion of that figure.Assets under management grew by 17 percent annually and now stand at a record high of $6.3 trillion.Critics\u2019 cornerIt would seem pretty serious.\u201cWillow initially not only hated the idea but put her foot down because she thought it would be highly destructive to our family and to our lives.\u201dThe idea kept nagging at him and his wife gave her reluctant permission.\u201cThe thought I had was coming from the patriot in me, growing up at a time when we respected our politicians not only for what they stood for but because of what they accomplished. I am horrified at the state of politics in America today, and I will throw stones in multiple directions. Dialogue has given way to disdain. I, maybe a bit naively, believed that there was a need for someone in high elected office to be more open-minded and willing to not only govern from the middle but to try to shame everyone else into going to the middle.\u201dAlso from the piece, Oprah Winfrey thought he would have been the ideal candidate.\u201cBob is one of the people I respect most in the world. That\u2019s a very short list. He is infinitely capable of multiple categories of expertise, and he has created an environment where you can disagree with him\u2014and that\u2019s not just because I\u2019m Oprah. I really, really pushed him to run for president, so much so that I said to him, \u2018Gee, if you ever decide to run for office, I will go door to door carrying leaflets. I will go sit and have tea with people.\u2019\u201d\u201cBerkshire\u2019s present intention is to vote against the four directors proposed by management,\u201d Mr. Buffett\u2019s assistant, Debbie Bosanek, said in an email.Two weeks ago USG rejected Knauf\u2019s $5.9 billion, or $42-a-share, offer. The rejection came despite Berkshire, which controls more than 30 percent of USG, saying it would take Knauf\u2019s offer if the German company agreed to buy the rest of USG for at least $42 a share.Knauf had called on USG shareholders to withhold support for USG\u2019s board nominees in an effort to bring USG to the table.Shares of USG rose 2.8 percent on the news.\u201cIt is therefore ironic that the U.S. administration is waging a trade war at a time when the largest potential consumer market in the world is open for business.\u201dShe seems to be trying to dial back that threat: National Amusements, the Redstone family holding company that controls CBS and Viacom, said in a statement that it has \u201ctremendous respect\u201d for Mr. Moonves, \u201cand it has always been our intention that he run a combined company.\u201dBut in a deal process that is playing out unusually publicly, consider the gantlet thrown.Through its $100 billion Vision Fund, SoftBank has pushed into businesses as wide-ranging as augmented reality, online commerce and dog walking. But the rationale for an investment like this one appears more elusive, other than being a play for lucrative sports content.\u201cIt is safe to say it is one of the largest tax bills on earned income in history.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Green also asked Mr. Zuckerberg if Facebook planned to comply with the provision in the European law that allows individuals to obtain a copy of the data companies hold about them.\u2022 A number of lawmakers have tried to draw a comparison between the Obama campaign\u2019s use of a Facebook app to scrape data from users and their friends in 2012 and Cambridge Analytica. Those lawmakers have failed to mention one very important distinction between the Obama campaign\u2019s app and Cambridge Analytica\u2019s app: The Obama app was actually on Facebook itself, and it was very clear about who and what the data would be used for. The app used to scrape data for Cambridge Analytica was accessed through a personality questionnaire hosted on a site outside of Facebook, and it appeared to users to be for academic research, not for a political data company owned by a wealthy Republican donor and dedicated to reshaping the American electorate.Mr. Musk told co-host Gayle King:\u201cI think whenever something is \u2013 whenever there\u2019s something that affects the public good then there does need to be some form of public oversight. \u2026 I do think there should be some regulations on AI. I think there should be regulations on social media to the degree that it negatively affects the public good. We can\u2019t have like willy-nilly proliferation of fake news, that\u2019s crazy. You can\u2019t have more types of fake news than real news. That\u2019s allowing public deception to go unchecked. That\u2019s crazy.\u201dAndrew writes: These were the most important words from Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s five-hour testimony: \u201cI agree we are responsible for the content.\u201d They may come back to haunt him, given his previous rejection of calling Facebook a publisher. He later backtracked and called his business a tech company, but his acknowledgment may fundamentally shift the conversation \u2014 and how the company operates. (All in all, Mr. Zuckerberg did better than anyone had expected.)Lawmakers now seem much more aware of how much power large technology companies have. This was encapsulated in questions posed by Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina. He framed Facebook as a monopoly and brought up the possibility of regulating Facebook, asking Mr. Zuckerberg: \u201cBut you as a company welcome regulation?\u201dAnd Facebook may now only be one big scandal away from a more stringent government response.Critics\u2019 corner\u201cUnder a symbiotic U.S.-China relationship, America became a preeminent technology leader, and its brands are today the envy of the world. China improved the standard of living of its citizens with a tenfold increase in per capita gross domestic product over the past 20 years.\u201dBut that relationship will change over the next two decades, Mr. Ma said:\u201cChina is shifting its economy from the world\u2019s largest exporter to the world\u2019s largest consumer. Chinese citizens now have the wealth and income to pursue discretionary spending. They want to buy high-quality imported food, cosmetics, fashions and health and wellness products for themselves and their children.\u201dMr. Ma goes on to write:\u201cIt is therefore ironic that the U.S. administration is waging a trade war at a time when the largest potential consumer market in the world is open for business. Is America going to forfeit this opportunity?Instigating a trade war is the wrong solution because it will only provoke retaliation. The Chinese government responded to U.S. tariff threats with its own tariffs on American agricultural products, such as soybeans. China is the largest export market for American soybeans, worth $14 billion annually and accounting for 65 percent of all U.S. soybean exports.The U.S. has been a consistent defender of free and open markets, but this time it is resorting to protectionism that will not improve American competitiveness. Any country seeking to increase exports would do better to focus on developing good products and channels to access foreign markets rather than putting up trade barriers.\u201dShari Redstone, whose National Amusements controls CBS and Viacom, is seeking to combine the two media companies.From Reuters:\u201cHer longtime friend and business ally, powerful CBS Chief Executive Les Moonves, has emerged as one of the biggest obstacles to a potential CBS-Viacom tie-up, according to people familiar with the matter. Concerns are that his objections could either doom the transaction or that he might not lead the new entity, the people said.\u201cMoonves is chafing at Redstone\u2019s insistence on installing Viacom\u2019s CEO as his second-in-command and likely successor of a merged company, the people say.\u201dBank of America works with \u201cjust a handful\u201d of such manufacturers, according to its vice chairwoman Anne Finucane. Their reactions? \u201cMixed,\u201d she said.It\u2019s not exactly a surprise. SoftBank\u2019s Masa Son bought control of Sprint planning to merge it with T-Mobile, the better to fight Verizon and AT&T.

{"Headline": "A.I. Researchers Are Making More Than $1 Million, Even at a Nonprofit", "Date": "2018-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 One of the poorest-kept secrets in Silicon Valley has been the huge salaries and bonuses that experts in artificial intelligence can command. Now, a little-noticed tax filing by a research lab called OpenAI has made some of those eye-popping figures public.OpenAI paid its top researcher, Ilya Sutskever, more than $1.9 million in 2016. It paid another leading researcher, Ian Goodfellow, more than $800,000 \u2014 even though he was not hired until March of that year. Both were recruited from Google.A third big name in the field, the roboticist Pieter Abbeel, made $425,000, though he did not join until June 2016, after taking a leave from his job as a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. Those figures all include signing bonuses.The figures listed on the tax forms, which OpenAI is required to release publicly because it is a nonprofit, provide new insight into what organizations around the world are paying for A.I. talent. But there is a caveat: The compensation at OpenAI may be underselling what these researchers can make, since as a nonprofit it can\u2019t offer stock options.Salaries for top A.I. researchers have skyrocketed because there are not many people who understand the technology and thousands of companies want to work with it. Element AI, an independent lab in Canada, estimates that 22,000 people worldwide have the skills needed to do serious A.I. research \u2014 about double from a year ago.\u201cThere is a mountain of demand and a trickle of supply,\u201d said Chris Nicholson, the chief executive and founder of Skymind, a start-up working on A.I.That raises significant issues for universities and governments. They also need A.I. expertise, both to teach the next generation of researchers and to put these technologies into practice in everything from the military to drug discovery. But they could never match the salaries being paid in the private sector.In 2015, Elon Musk, the chief executive of the electric-car maker Tesla, and other well-known figures in the tech industry created OpenAI and moved it into offices just north of Silicon Valley in San Francisco. They recruited several researchers with experience at Google and Facebook, two of the companies leading an industrywide push into artificial intelligence.In addition to salaries and signing bonuses, the internet giants typically compensate employees with sizable stock options \u2014 something that OpenAI does not do. But it has a recruiting message that appeals to idealists: It will share much of its work with the outside world, and it will consciously avoid creating technology that could be a danger to people.\u201cI turned down offers for multiple times the dollar amount I accepted at OpenAI,\u201d Mr. Sutskever said. \u201cOthers did the same.\u201d He said he expected salaries at OpenAI to increase as the organization pursued its \u201cmission of ensuring powerful A.I. benefits all of humanity.\u201dOpenAI spent about $11 million in its first year, with more than $7 million going to salaries and other employee benefits. It employed 52 people in 2016.At DeepMind, a London A.I. lab now owned by Google, costs for 400 employees totaled $138 million in 2016, according to the company\u2019s annual financial filings in Britain. That translates to $345,000 per employee, including researchers and other staff.Some researchers may command higher pay because their names carry weight across the A.I. community and they can help recruit other researchers.\u201cWhen you hire a star, you are not just hiring a star,\u201d Mr. Nicholson of the start-up Skymind said. \u201cYou are hiring everyone they attract. And you are paying for all the publicity they will attract.\u201dOther researchers at OpenAI, including Greg Brockman, who leads the lab alongside Mr. Sutskever, did not receive such high salaries during the lab\u2019s first year.In 2016, according to the tax forms, Mr. Brockman, who had served as chief technology officer at the financial technology start-up Stripe, made $175,000. As one of the founders of the organization, however, he most likely took a salary below market value. Two other researchers with more experience in the field \u2014 though still very young \u2014 made between $275,000 and $300,000 in salary alone in 2016, according to the forms.Though the pool of available A.I. researchers is growing, it is not growing fast enough. \u201cIf anything, demand for that talent is growing faster than the supply of new researchers, because A.I. is moving from early adopters to wider use,\u201d Mr. Nicholson said.In essence, Mr. Musk was poaching his own talent. Since then, he has stepped down from the OpenAI board, with the lab saying this would allow him to \u201celiminate a potential future conflict.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But as the United States prepares stiff trade measures and China retaliates, stock markets have plummeted and some of America\u2019s biggest companies are pushing back.Industry giants like General Electric and Goldman Sachs, as well as agricultural companies, have lodged objections with the White House, saying that tariffs on both sides of the Pacific and limitations on investments will cut off American companies from the world\u2019s most lucrative and rapidly growing market.Since then, the White House has announced another trade measure targeted at China that would place tariffs on at least $50 billion worth of products imported to the United States and would restrict investment flows between the two economic giants. This week, the Trump administration is expected to announce a list of Chinese imports subject to tariffs, which could include high-tech products like semiconductors as well as cheap electronics and other goods that many Americans buy.Josh Kallmer, the senior vice president for global policy at the Information Technology Industry Council, an advocate for companies like Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and IBM, said his group had been largely supportive of the administration\u2019s targeting of China\u2019s unfair trade practices. But the group had made it clear to the White House that it would not be pleased with any measure that had tariffs \u201cas the primary or even a significant remedy.\u201d\u201cThe reason is that it would be a tax on consumers,\u201d Mr. Kallmer said, \u201cprecisely the people we are trying to support.\u201dThat theory could make it more difficult for American companies to operate in a country that already puts up steep barriers.As Mr. Trump advances a series of tough trade measures to confront these behaviors, however, cracks have appeared in American industry\u2019s seemingly united front.Companies in technology, investment and other industries now say that the measures the administration is taking to help them may actually end up doing irreparable harm to supply chains they have built up over decades. Any American company that wants to be a global player cannot afford to lose access to China\u2019s growing market, executives say.The 25 percent tariff on pork that China imposed on Monday is expected to be particularly harmful, including in regions that supported the president, like Iowa, North Carolina and Indiana. Last year, American farmers sent more than a billion dollars\u2019 worth of pork to China, their largest export market by value after Japan and Mexico.\u201cBecause we\u2019re so blessed to have America feed the world, we\u2019re also the first industry to get slammed whenever there are trade difficulties between the U.S. and other countries,\u201d Denise Bode, the coordinator for the American Fruit and Vegetable Processors and Growers Coalition.\u201cAmerican farmers appear to be the first casualties of an escalating trade war,\u201d said Max Baucus, a former Democratic senator from Montana and a chairman of a group called Farmers for Free Trade. \u201cWith farm incomes already declining, farmers rely on export markets to stay above water. These new tariffs are a drag on their ability to make ends meet.\u201dHowever, analysts and companies involved in China said that these measures appeared unlikely to adequately resolve American concerns about China\u2019s longstanding encroachment on American intellectual property.Companies are waiting anxiously for the administration to release a list of Chinese products this week that will be subject to tariffs \u2014 most likely the kind of high-tech products that the administration has accused China of targeting. The retail industry, which lobbied the administration and Congress against an early plan to impose tariffs on Chinese-made apparel and footwear, is now cautiously optimistic that its products will be exempt.G.E. and IBM, which operate through joint ventures and other partnerships in China and around the world, have both lobbied against the expansion of Cfius over concerns that restrictions on joint ventures with foreign companies that include the transfer of valuable skills or technology could weaken the position of American companies abroad.Financial firms, including Goldman Sachs and the Carlyle Group, have also expressed concern about investment restrictions, saying they could provide a drag on the United States economy.White House advisers, in turn, have complained that previous approaches to dealing with China have not worked, and that companies are overreacting to legitimate trade measures.Speaking Monday on CNBC, the White House trade adviser, Peter Navarro, defended the administration\u2019s tough actions on China and said investors should not fear a trade war.\u201cEverybody needs to relax,\u201d Mr. Navarro said. \u201cThe economy is as strong as an ox.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Big Reason Wall Street Is Flocking to Spotify: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Good Tuesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Spotify\u2019s shares opened at $165.90.\u2022 If the markets fall again, we have some possible explanations.\u2022 Should Facebook offer \u201cWhy Me?\u201d buttons?\u2022 Disney has offered to buy Sky News to help Fox\u2019s Sky bid.Spotify is a loss-making company that might not report a profit until next decade, but that didn\u2019t stop investors from valuing the company at $30 billion when it debuted Tuesday on the United States stock market.Spotify is an impressive company. Its loyal, paying customer base is enormous and is expected to keep growing. Also, Spotify has so far held its own in the face of competition from Apple, Amazon and Google, all of which want to win new subscribers to their music streaming services.But there is an important reason that Wall Street is flocking to Spotify: It is doing a great job at getting record companies to roll over.Spotify\u2019s main cost is what it pays record companies for the music it streams to its customers. As Spotify has grown, that expense has fallen as a share of its total revenue, which shows that Spotify is negotiating increasingly advantageous deals with record companies.That has bolstered Spotify\u2019s gross profit margin, which measures how much money a company keeps after paying out the costs directly related to generating its revenue. Last year, that margin was 21 percent of revenue at Spotify, well up from 14 percent in 2016.Crucially, though, Spotify has said it expects its gross margin to expand to as much as 35 percent over the longer term. In other words, as Spotify\u2019s spending on music grows, so will its leverage over record companies. And it may well achieve its gross margin target. After all, Netflix, which occupies a similar position in the market for streaming video, has a gross margin of 35 percent.But Spotify\u2019s main rivals could complicate things. What if Amazon offered record companies better terms than Spotify? That would reduce Spotify\u2019s bargaining power, making it harder to deliver wider gross margins investors are expecting. And Amazon, along with Apple and Google, has far deeper pockets to slog it out over the long term.\u2014 Peter EavisSpotify\u2019s unusual path to the public markets was a success.On its first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the music streaming service finished with a valuation of $26.5 billion.Spotify\u2019s shares opened at $165.90 before closing at $149.01.That\u2019s well above the high of $132.50 that its shares changed hands at in private transactions this year. It\u2019s also well above the $137.50 the WSJ reported its private shares were trading at during the past week.Spotify had eschewed a typical initial public offering in favor of a direct listing. That meant there was no \u201cdeal price\u201d for investors to reference on the first day of trading and no underwriters acting as stabilizing agents if the stock began to plunge.Despite all that, Spotify\u2019s valuation at the close on Tuesday ranks among the highest for a tech company debuting on an American exchange.Here\u2019s a look at the tech companies with the 10 biggest market capitalizations after their first day of trading, courtesy of Dealogic:Alibaba \u2014 $233.9 billionFacebook \u2014 $81.7 billionPalm \u2014 $53.3 billionInfineon Technologies \u2014 $47.9 billionJD.com \u2014 $28.9 billionSnap \u2014 $28.9 billionGoogle \u2014 $27.2 billionSpotify \u2014 $26.5 billionTwitter \u2014 $24.9 billionAgilent \u2014 $20.1 billionTesla said:\u2022 It built 2,020 Model 3s in the past seven days. That fell short of its goal of 2,500 by the end of the quarter.\u2022 Tesla produced 9,766 Model 3s during the quarter.\u2022 In total, Tesla produced 35,000 cars in the first quarter.\u2022 It has delivered 8,800 Model 3s during the first quarter, below the 8,800 analysts expected according to Bloomberg.\u2022 In all, Tesla delivered a record 29,980 vehicles during the quarter.\u2022 The company said it expects Model 3 weekly production to reach 5,000 by the end of the second quarter.\u2022 The combined deliveries of the Model X and Model S came to 21,800 cars, the lowest total in several quarters.ContextTesla\u2019s stock and bond prices have plunged amid concerns about how much cash the company is using as it struggles to speed up assembly and sales of the Model 3. With a starting price of $35,000, the car is supposed to be more affordable than Tesla\u2019s other cars. The company has been counting on a quick expansion of its Model 3 business to increase revenue.The president reiterated his claim that Amazon is \u201ccosting the United States Postal Service massive amounts of money\u201d in a post to Twitter on Tuesday morning.Shares are essentially flat on the day.\u201cPackage delivery has been a bright spot for a service that\u2019s lost money for 11 straight years. The losses are mostly due to pension and health care costs \u2014 not the business deal for the Postal Service to deliver packages for Amazon. Boosted by e-commerce, the Postal Service has enjoyed double-digit increases in revenue from delivering packages, but that hasn\u2019t been enough to offset declines in first-class letters and marketing mail, which together make up more than two-thirds of postal revenue.\u201cWhile the Postal Service\u2019s losses can\u2019t be attributed to its package business, Trump\u2019s claim that it could get more bang for its buck may not be entirely far-fetched. A 2017 analysis by Citigroup concluded that the Postal Service was charging below-market rates as a whole for parcels. The post office does not use taxpayer money for its operations.\u201dCould Mr. Tump\u2019s criticism lead to action against Amazon?\u201cNothing can be certain, except death and taxes \u2026 and more Trump tweets on Amazon. We believe sales tax collection changes would have limited impact on consumer use of Amazon and could actually help Amazon\u2019s relative competitive positioning in domestic e-commerce.\u201dMore from Andrew:The \u201cWhy Me?\u201d button might create all sorts of problems for Facebook, and its advertisers, too. It would allow users \u2014 and rivals \u2014 to reverse engineer much of the way the system works. And advertisers would probably object to the idea of making their targeting plans public. But that would be the cost of using such large public platforms with such exact targeting.The bottom line: Disney wants Fox to have full control of Sky to support its $52.4 billion deal to buy most of Fox, and it wants to get ahead of Comcast\u2019s rival effort to buy that 39 percent of the British broadcaster.An earlier version of this article misstated the status of a Department of Defense contract for cloud computing services.

{"Headline": "Volkswagen Set to Oust Matthias M\u00fcller as C.E.O. After Diesel Scandal", "Date": "2018-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Volkswagen is set to oust its chief executive, Matthias M\u00fcller, as it grapples with a diesel emissions scandal that has cost it billions of dollars, led to the imprisonment of two executives, and scarred the German carmaker\u2019s reputation.Herbert Diess, who is in charge of the company\u2019s flagship Volkswagen brand, was likely to succeed Mr. M\u00fcller, according to two people with knowledge of the internal discussions. The company said earlier on Tuesday that it was considering a leadership change, and a final decision was expected by the end of the week.While there was no obvious trigger for Mr. M\u00fcller\u2019s departure at this moment, his efforts to lead the company beyond the 2015 emissions cheating scandal have stalled.The repercussions have continued to multiply, tainting not only Volkswagen but also its rivals BMW and Daimler just as they grapple with an industrywide shift toward electric and self-driving vehicles. Political leaders are pressing the German carmakers to compensate diesel owners who bought cars that turned out to be dirtier than advertised, which could add to the already astronomical cost of the scandal.In September 2015, Volkswagen was accused of evading emissions standards in the U.S. The scandal has hit the company hard.\u201cThis is a chance for Volkswagen to make a change,\u201d said Christian Strenger, the former chief executive of Deutsche Bank\u2019s wealth management division, who is suing Volkswagen because he said it violated its duty to shareholders by failing to be forthcoming about the emissions scandal. But Mr. Strenger said that Mr. Diess would have to \u201chave the guts to clean things up.\u201dVolkswagen is still the target of a wide-ranging criminal investigation that has included searches of Mr. M\u00fcller\u2019s offices. However, there has been no new information that would have prompted Mr. M\u00fcller to leave now, said Klaus Ziehe, a spokesman for the prosecutors in Braunschweig who are conducting the inquiry.German prosecutors have not charged anyone in the Volkswagen case, but they expect to complete their investigation this year. Two former Volkswagen executives, James Liang and Oliver Schmidt, are serving prison sentences in the United States after pleading guilty to charges including conspiracy to violate the Clean Air Act.Mr. M\u00fcller was a high-ranking executive involved in product development at the same time that the company was developing the illegal software and deploying it in vehicles. He also worked closely with some of the people under investigation over possible involvement in the emissions scandal. Mr. M\u00fcller has insisted he was ignorant of any wrongdoing, but he has nonetheless faced the accusation that he was part of a system that allowed it to take place.Mr. Diess has a shorter history at Volkswagen than most other members of the management board, but he would nonetheless satisfy the company\u2019s longtime preference for choosing chief executives from within its own ranks. He joined Volkswagen in July 2015 from BMW, where he had been a member of the management board in charge of product development. He has succeeded in improving the profitability of the division that makes Volkswagen brand cars like the Golf, Jetta and Passat. The division accounts for most of the cars that Volkswagen sells but is far less profitable than the company\u2019s Audi and Porsche luxury brands.Mr. Diess, who managed factories in Britain for BMW, is much more comfortable speaking English than Mr. M\u00fcller and will have an easier time communicating with investors and media outside Germany. Mr. Diess has also not spent his career steeped in Volkswagen culture and may be in a better position to change it.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.But he will most likely face resistance from entrenched interests within the company. He has already clashed with Volkswagen\u2019s powerful workers council, which has de facto veto power over major decisions.And Mr. Diess must answer to Hans Dieter P\u00f6tsch, the chairman of the supervisory board and former chief financial officer of Volkswagen. Mr. P\u00f6tsch is a confidant of the Porsche family, which via a holding company owns more than half of Volkswagen\u2019s shares. The family, descendants of the man who created the Volkswagen Beetle for Adolf Hitler, has been criticized by shareholders for failing to appoint more independent members of the supervisory board and resisting more sweeping change.The challenges that Mr. Diess faces are considerable. Even now, the diesel scandal continues to corrode Volkswagen\u2019s reputation.In January, The New York Times reported that the company had helped to finance experiments in which monkeys were forced to breathe diesel fumes at a lab in Albuquerque. The exposure of the research caused a furor in Germany and beyond. Chancellor Angela Merkel condemned the experiments, the German Parliament debated possible consequences, and animal rights activists demonstrated outside Volkswagen\u2019s headquarters in Wolfsburg.Volkswagen\u2019s cheating has also had an effect on the wider industry. Diesel was once the most popular engine option in Europe because of its fuel economy. But diesel vehicle sales have been dropping since Volkswagen\u2019s deception was uncovered.Volkswagen\u2019s stock price closed the day 3.1 percent higher, at 169 euros, or about $208, on the news of Mr. M\u00fcller\u2019s upcoming departure.Amie Tsang contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}

And Tesla shares have lost nearly a quarter of their value since March 12.Tesla\u2019s Autopilot semiautonomous driver-assistance system has also come under scrutiny.

{"Headline": "For Tesla, \u2018Production Hell\u2019 Looks Like the Reality of the Car Business", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTesla began producing electric cars at its plant in Fremont, Calif., six years ago, starting with small quantities and ramping up to about 100,000 vehicles last year. Now, as it tries to double or triple that number, the company and its chief executive, Elon Musk, are getting a lesson in how hard it is to mass-produce automobiles.On Tuesday, Tesla reported that it had managed to increase production of a crucial new model in the first quarter of 2018, although it remained well short of the company\u2019s already lowered target. At the same time, it encountered a new hitch \u2014 a drop in sales of its two established products, the Model S sedan and Model X sport-utility vehicle.The company is counting on the success of the new offering, the Model 3, to increase revenue and help pare its losses as Tesla invests heavily in the vehicles it hopes to offer in the future.But a series of setbacks have left Tesla far behind schedule in turning out the Model 3 \u2014 for which nearly 400,000 prospective buyers have already put down $1,000 deposits \u2014 and it is taking some extraordinary measures to turn things around. Mr. Musk said on Twitter this week that he had been sleeping at the plant, and the company said some workers who normally assemble the Model S and Model X were shifted to Model 3 production.The troubles reflect a reality overlooked by many people outside the auto industry: Producing a quarter of a million cars a year in one plant is a daunting task.\u201cYou have to have a finished car rolling off the line every couple of minutes,\u201d said Mark Wakefield, global co-head of automotive and industrial at AlixPartners, a consulting firm. \u201cAnd each one has maybe 5,000 parts that come from different suppliers and have to arrive just in time, and each car is available in a couple of thousand build combinations with different colors and features. And all this has to happen at a competitive cost. There\u2019s a lot that can trip you up.\u201dEven as he introduced the Model 3 at an event last summer, Mr. Musk warned that the company would find itself in \u201cproduction hell\u201d \u2014 and as those words proved prescient, he has had to repeatedly dial back his forecasts for how many Tesla could churn out.Mr. Musk once envisioned producing as many as 500,000 cars this year, and last summer he was hoping to be able to make 20,000 Model 3s a month by December. More recently, Tesla had aimed to produce at least 2,500 Model 3s per week by the end of the first quarter.But that is more than it managed in the entire fourth quarter, and it has produced fewer than 10,000 in the first quarter, the company said Tuesday.There have been signs of momentum, however. In the past seven days, Tesla said, it had produced 2,020 Model 3s, a rate it said it expected to sustain in the coming week.Tesla has closely guarded the details of its manufacturing system, but Mr. Musk has described it as highly automated.Ron Harbour, a partner and auto-manufacturing specialist at Oliver Wyman, a consulting firm, said that adding more automated equipment tends to create a more complex production environment. \u201cYou have more new equipment to launch, there\u2019s more programming, more maintenance,\u201d he said. \u201cMore automation doesn\u2019t necessarily make it more efficient.\u201dThe highest-volume plants he\u2019s seen, Mr. Harbour added, often have more assembly workers and fewer robots. \u201cIt\u2019s a little counterintuitive, but that\u2019s how it is,\u201d he said.With a starting price of $35,000, the Model 3 is more affordable than Tesla\u2019s other models and a crucial part of its ambitions to become a mass-market automaker \u2014 as well as to stabilize its finances and turn a profit.But Mr. Wakefield noted that working out bottlenecks and hitches in auto production often isn\u2019t as straightforward as it could appear. For example, modifying one part to make it fit better or stronger can require other parts to be modified, or can alter the car\u2019s driving characteristics.\u201cIf you make a change to solve one problem, you can create five other problems,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople think you just find a problem and solve it, but it\u2019s not like that. There are literally millions of problems that come up and require thousands of engineers, working in teams, either at the car company or the suppliers, to deal with.\u201dWhile Tesla scrambled to work out the kinks in making the Model 3 in the first quarter, deliveries of the Model S and Model X declined by 23 percent from the previous quarter \u2014 to 21,800 \u2014 even as the company reported \u201cthe most productive quarter in Tesla history.\u201dTesla said it had been hurt by a shortage of battery packs for its cars, made at the plant it calls the Gigafactory, near Reno, Nev.Michelle Krebs, a senior analyst at Autotrader.com, said the decline in deliveries of the Model S and Model X might suggest that the allure of Tesla vehicles has somewhat faded. Electric cars make up fewer than 1 percent of all vehicles sold in the United States.\u201cYou just wonder if there\u2019s enough growth in electric vehicles,\u201d she said. \u201cAt first everybody who wanted a Tesla and could afford a Tesla hopped on. But it\u2019s not the newest thing anymore.\u201dEven aside from its production struggles with the Model 3, the company has been hit by a barrage of negative news in recent weeks.Concern has grown over the safety of Autopilot, its driver-assistance system, after a fatal crash on March 23 that occurred while the system was engaged. It was at least the third fatal crash that has taken place while a driver was using Autopilot.Also last week, Moody\u2019s Investors Service downgraded Tesla\u2019s credit rating and said the company risked running short of cash by the end of the year.The company said Tuesday that it saw no need to take special measures this year to raise cash. Its shares closed up 6 percent on Tuesday after the regulatory filing, but they have still shed 23 percent of their value in barely three weeks.Advertisement"}

Much of that projected earnings increase is coming from tax cuts and some from expectations that companies\u2019 revenue would grow at a nice clip as global growth stayed strong.\u2014 Peter EavisA little humor has not cleared the clouds over Tesla.The accident renews questions about Autopilot, a signature feature of Tesla vehicles, and whether the company has gone far enough to ensure that it keeps drivers and passengers safe.Raj Rajkumar, who researches autonomous driving at Carnegie Mellon University, thinks those assumptions concern one of Tesla\u2019s key sensors. \u201cThe radars they use are apparently meant for detecting moving objects (as typically used in adaptive cruise control systems), and seem to be not very good in detecting stationary objects,\u201d he says.Doubts about the fundamental capabilities of Tesla\u2019s Autopilot could crimp demand for its cars among a customer base that is often seeking the best technology.Out of respect for the privacy of our customer and his family, we do not plan to share any additional details until we conclude the investigation.- Peter EavisTech companies are again dragging down stocks on Wall Street.The S.&P. 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite are off 3.1 percent and 3.5 percent Monday. The continued fall in the share prices of some of the biggest tech companies is weighing heavily on the indexes.Amazon is down 5.4 percent, Netflix is off 5.9 percent, Facebook fell 3 percent, Google-parent Alphabet slipped 3.6 percent and Apple dropped 5.9 percent.After leading the market higher for much of the past two years, tech stocks have hit some turbulence. Since March 16, Facebook, Alphabet, Netflix and Amazon are all down more than 12 percent, while Apple is down 7.3 percent.Over that period the business models of those companies have come under increased scrutiny. News that Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm hired by President Trump\u2019s 2016 election campaign, gained access to private information on more than 50 million Facebook users has weighed not only on the shares of Facebook but on Alphabet as well. Amazon, meanwhile, has come under attack from President Trump.President Trump attacked the e-commerce again on Monday morning.Monday\u2019s tweet is the latest over the past five days from Mr. Trump criticizing Amazon. Over that period, Mr. Trump has accused Amazon of not paying enough taxes, of putting thousands of local retailers out of business and of using the United States Postal Service as its \u201cDelivery Boy.\u201dAmazon\u2019s shares are down 4 percent and are off nearly 11 percent since Axios reported on Wednesday about Mr. Trump\u2019s anger toward the company.Context\u2022 Amazon has said that the Postal Regulatory Commission, which oversees the service, has consistently found that its contracts with Amazon are profitable.Critic\u2019s cornerDA Davidson analyst Tom Forte wrote in a note via Reuters:\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s comments are consistent with industry sources we have spoken to in the shipping industry, who often label Amazon\u2019s deal with the USPS as a sweetheart deal. An argument, however, could be made that the USPS was losing billions before it expanded its service offerings for Amazon and would, still, likely lose billions if Amazon discontinued its use of the USPS tomorrow.\u201dCiting anonymous sources, Bloomberg\u2019s Ian King and Matt Gurman report:\u201cThe initiative, code named Kalamata, is still in the early developmental stages, but comes as part of a larger strategy to make all of Apple\u2019s devices \u2014 including Macs, iPhones, and iPads \u2014 work more similarly and seamlessly together.\u201dApple provides Intel with about 5 percent of its annual revenue.Kenneth C. Griffin\u2019s Citadel has just hired Phil Villhauer, a former top trader at Steven A. Cohen\u2019s investment firm. Mr. Villhauer will become deputy head of global equities at Citadel, a newly created position. He will officially join the Chicago-based hedge fund in the middle of April and work out of Citadel\u2019s office in New York, a Citadel spokesman confirmed.\u201cWe see this as a big hire for us,\u201d said Zia Ahmed, a Citadel spokesman.In January, Mr. Cohen reconfigured Point72 as a hedge fund after establishing it as a family office in 2014 to manage $11 billion of his personal wealth. Point72 has said it has raised between $2 billion and $4 billion in outside money.Mr. Villhauer had been with Mr. Cohen through both the good days and bad days. He was there when SAC turned into a powerhouse hedge fund, and he was there when the fund pleaded guilty to insider trading charges in 2013. The guilty plea required the firm to stop managing money for outside investors.When Mr. Villhauer left Point72, Mr. Cohen, in a letter to employees, called the departure a \u201cretirement\u201d and said he was sad to see Mr. Villhauer go.Now Mr. Villhauer will start a new chapter in his career at another well-known hedge fund firm.____________________________Part of the silence, people in the industry say, comes from a desire to avoid the business equivalent of bad karma \u2014 knowing that they, too, may one day face the buzz saw of public censure.Critic\u2019s corner More on data and privacy The Chinese government said on Monday that it would place tariffs on the imports of 128 American-made products in retaliation for to President Trump\u2019s tariffs on steel and aluminum.The Washington flyaroundWhen the Justice Department allowed Live Nation to merge with Ticketmaster, it tried to assuage concerns that the deal would cripple competitors.But critics have reason to be skeptical. Here\u2019s how Beau Buffier, the chief of the New York Attorney General\u2019s Antitrust Bureau, described Live Nation:\u201cIt is now widely seen as the poster child for the problems that arise when enforcers adopt these temporary fixes to limit the anticompetitive effects of deeply problematic vertical mergers.\u201dThe inquiries come as the department is reviewing two more mergers, between AT&T and Time Warner, and Disney and Fox.The department\u2019s new antitrust chief has said that the Live Nation deal and several other deals posed problems because they relied too much on the federal government\u2019s ability to police corporate behavior.\u201cEven if we wanted to do that, we often don\u2019t have the skills or the tools to do so effectively,\u201d the antitrust chief, Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, said in a speech.More for your playlistThe deals flyaroundAdvertisement"}

He is also editor at large for Inc. magazine.Having more orders than you can fill is generally deemed a high-class problem.Despite demand for 400,000 of its Model 3, Tesla is proving otherwise, and that\u2019s a problem for investors, not to mention the future of electric vehicles.President Trump claims that companies overestimated demand for highly efficient cars such as fully electric vehicles \u2014 E.V.s. Yet consumers\u2019 initial rush to own Tesla\u2019s Model 3, with current pricing starting around $50,000, certainly belies that claim.Yet you want to believe that Mr. Musk can pull this off. He rescued Tesla once before, when the company was days away from running out of cash. And in SpaceX, Mr. Musk has proved that he can run a highly sophisticated private spacecraft company.Tesla\u2019s problem, unfortunately, isn\u2019t rocket science. In some ways it\u2019s more complex.Tesla can\u2019t seem to run an auto production line, something that the Detroit auto companies that Mr. Musk mocks are very good at. Ford\u2019s electric vehicles and hybrids, such as the Fusion Energi, may not match the Tesla Model X in style or speed, but Ford can knock out millions of fenders and hoods in its stamping operations with absolute certainty and to tight specifications.Tesla is operating out of the former G.M./Toyota joint venture plant in Fremont, Calif., which produced more than 400,000 cars annually at its peak. Tesla has been running at a quarter of that rate, and has had to resort to pulling cars off the line and finishing them by hand. That\u2019s not what you call mass production; more like mass confusion.\u201cSo I\u2019m back to sleeping at factory,\u201d Mr. Musk tweeted on April 2. \u201cCar biz is hell.\u201dDiesel is dying; the gasoline internal combustion engine may soon follow. The administration\u2019s latest assault on the environment and our lungs rests partly on the premise that deregulation will make Detroit more competitive. It will do exactly the opposite.When regulation forces an industry to invest in leading-edge technologies, that industry often gains a competitive advantage. E.V.s and ultraefficient internal combustion engines will dominate the auto industry within a decade.If American companies fail to keep up technologically, the domestic auto industry will resemble the 1980s all over again, when Detroit ignored fuel economy to build gas-guzzler S.U.V.s because they were so profitable. When oil spiked again, the Big Three went into a decline that would not end until taxpayers ultimately paid the price in a huge bailout.Auto companies are still free to make monster S.U.V.s, but if they don\u2019t continue to improve efficiency, there\u2019s a real risk they\u2019ll find companies like Volvo and BMW speeding past them. That doesn\u2019t enter the thinking of Mr. Trump and Mr. Pruitt in their shortsighted attack on our health in the name of deregulation. Car buyers love their S.U.V.s; they love their planet and their lungs, too. There\u2019s no reason to trade one for the other.Advertisement"}

Q: What were some of his most famous opinions? Two years after vacating an opinion by Judge Reinhardt forbidding states from banning same-sex couples from marrying, the Supreme Court adopted just that constitutional rule.Q: Can you give us a layman\u2019s explanation of the Ninth Circuit and tell us why it\u2019s important? Because California and other western states continually innovate everything from the economy to social policy, the Ninth Circuit tends to hear an outsized portion of \u201cbig\u201d cases.

There are several vacancies on the Ninth Circuit, now including Judge Reinhardt\u2019s seat. We can expect that over the next year, or less, President Trump will nominate judges to fill most of those positions.

{"Headline": "Markets That Climbed the Trump Bump Are Tumbling Down From It", "Date": "2018-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Trump Bump is becoming the Trump Slump.In the first year of Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidency, ebullient investors propelled stock markets to one record high after another. And Mr. Trump was the bull in chief, celebrating the record-breaking march as validation of his economic policies.Those days are done.Even after a fast start to 2018, stock markets finished the first quarter down for the year \u2014 the first quarterly decline since 2015. It suggested that a period of calm and steadily rising markets had given way to a turbulent new era with a bearish bent.The plunge continued Monday, with the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index sinking 2.2 percent. Investors jettisoned shares of financial, technology and many other businesses, spooked at least in part by a tweet from Mr. Trump aimed at one of the country\u2019s biggest companies: Amazon.Monday\u2019s decline left stocks down more than 4 percent so far in 2018. They are now down more than 10 percent from their peak in late January. That means the market has entered a so-called correction \u2014 a term used to indicate that the downward trend is more severe and lasting than simply a few days of bearish trading.The stock market is still up more than 20 percent since Nov. 8, 2016, the day Mr. Trump won the White House \u2014 a roller-coaster ride driven in part by expectations about what a Trump presidency could bring to Washington.At first, the prospect of Republicans controlling the White House and both houses of Congress thrilled investors. They anticipated a wave of regulatory rollbacks and the slashing of corporate and personal tax rates. Many of those dreams have been realized, culminating in Mr. Trump signing a huge tax cut into law in December. When the S.&P. 500 notched its high-water mark of 2872.87 on Jan. 26, it represented a roughly 325 percent increase since the bull market began in March 2009.But since February, a toxic stew of factors \u2014 many but certainly not all of them emanating from Washington \u2014 has polluted what had been the market\u2019s placidly rising waters. And there\u2019s little prospect of the messes dissipating anytime soon.First there was the risk that the economy might be growing too fast, which could prompt central banks to hike interest rates sooner than expected. Then there was the risk of a trade war ignited by the White House imposing tariffs on certain products, an action that quickly prompted countries like China to erect trade barriers of their own. Next came the threat of a government crackdown on technology companies, after revelations of their misuse of customer data.Monday\u2019s dose of unnerving news was a presidential tweet aimed at Amazon, which Mr. Trump accused of hurting the United States Postal Service. Mr. Trump\u2019s feud with the company has been going on sporadically since before he became president, but the onslaught has accelerated lately. On Monday, Mr. Trump tweeted that the Post Office loses money by working with Amazon \u201cand this will be changed.\u201dIn the face of these factors, the optimism of just two months ago has all but evaporated.\u201cIt certainly adds to uncertainty, and the market doesn\u2019t like uncertainty,\u201d said Ed Clissold, chief United States strategist at Ned Davis Research, a stock market research firm.One thing is clear: The days of calm markets marching steadily higher, shattering one record after another, are gone for now. That carries risks for Mr. Trump, who spent the first year of his presidency as a stock-market cheerleader but in recent months has been mostly silent about the market\u2019s gyrations.It also could be a danger for the United States economy. Academic research suggests that long-term market declines can rub off on consumers, leading them to feel less affluent and therefore spend less money. That is bad news for an economy that hinges largely on zesty consumer spending.The market\u2019s decline over the past two months has been broad based. Six of the 11 sectors included in the S.&P. 500 index are down more than 10 percent from the market high in late January.On any given day, a particular sector might be clobbered. One day it could be industrial companies such as Boeing or Caterpillar, which export lots of products and therefore could be harmed in a trade war. Another day could bring declines to technology companies like Facebook and Twitter, whose profits are vulnerable to tougher government regulation of social media networks. The next day it could be energy and financial companies, whose fortunes would be diminished if the economy slows.On Monday, just 13 stocks in the S.&P. 500 rose.The meat producer Tyson dropped more than 6 percent, after China imposed duties on pork and fruit from the United States in response to the tariffs that the Trump administration has imposed on products imported from China. China is one of Tyson\u2019s most important export markets. Lean hog futures \u2014 which reflect the anticipated prices of pig carcasses \u2014 were down 3.9 percent.After Mr. Trump\u2019s complaint about Amazon, it too, was a big loser, falling 5.2 percent. Other giant tech firms were sucked into the downdraft. Microsoft dropped 3 percent. Facebook tumbled 2.8 percent, bringing its year-to-date decline to 14.4 percent. And Intel dove 6 percent after a Bloomberg News report that Apple was planning to use its own chips in its computers instead of Intel processors.And Tesla, reeling amid doubts about its ability to churn out electric vehicles, tumbled more than 5 percent.The tech sector has been the epicenter of stock market pain in recent weeks, hurt by concerns about trade friction with China \u2014 a key market and supplier for tech firms \u2014 and fears of tighter government regulation. Even before Monday\u2019s fall, some $457 billion had been wiped off the sector\u2019s total market value.\u201cPeople think that tech is going to go from the Wild West to a much more regulated, scrutinized environment,\u201d said Dan Suzuki, an equity strategist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Even the shares of financial institutions \u2014 the companies that would most likely benefit from a looser regulatory environment favored by Republicans \u2014 have been battered. The sector dropped 2.1 percent Monday, with investors worried about an unfavorable lending environment.For markets, nothing is for sure. They could rebound mightily later this week and shake off jitters about a trade war. But some observers believe conditions may have to get worse before they can get better \u2014 and there could be more declines before that happens.\u201cIn order for the market to bottom, there probably has to be more consternation and more pessimism about the current environment,\u201d said Mr. Clissold, of Ned Davis Research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Washington Moves to Soften a Big Bank Capital Rule: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Tuesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Earnings are dragging stocks lower.\u2022 The yield on the 10-year Treasury note broke through 3 percent.\u2022 A new study found that female and male C.E.O.s tend to earn similar levels of compensation.\u2022 What does Eddie Lampert have in mind for Sears?\u2022 A thought experiment with Amazon\u2019s pay and profits.One of the simplest and strongest protections against another financial crisis could soon be weakened.Two federal banking regulators have in recent weeks proposed adjustments that could ease a stringent, no-frills bank capital requirement, much disliked on Wall Street, called the supplementary leverage ratio. The Trump administration\u2019s effort to loosen financial regulation is moving forward on several fronts, but the changes to the leverage ratio would arguably put the deepest dent in the post-crisis overhaul.Under the adjustment, the ratio would fall for all of the eight big banks that are subject to it. Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs stand to enjoy some of the biggest declines.Compared with the current rules, the new leverage ratio would reduce capital required at the eight banks by around $86 billion. But other capital rules would, for the time being at least, prevent the banks from cutting their capital by that amount.Not all regulators support the proposed adjustment.The new leverage ratio swaps a fixed capital requirement for one that is in part based on a bank\u2019s size and reach in the global financial system.Critics of the current leverage ratio said it was causing banks to reduce certain important activities.- Peter EavisBut they are dragging them lower on Tuesday.The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 500 points, or 2.1 percent, while the S.&P. 500 and the Nasdaq Composite slid more than 1.5 percent. For the Dow, Tuesday\u2019s move lower push the blue-chip index back down more than 10 percent. If its losses hold through the close, it will mark the Dow\u2019s fifth consecutive down day, its longest such streak since 2017.Disappointing earnings from some of the stock market\u2019s biggest companies are weighing heavily on stocks.\u2022 Despite a 73 percent jump in Alphabet\u2019s net profit, shares fell more than 4 percent as Wall Street analysts raised concerns that a jump in capital spending could crimp profitability\u2022 Travelers is off 4 percent after its earnings missed expectations.In all, Apple, 3M, Travelers and Caterpillar have accounted for 260 points of the Dow\u2019s decline.ContextAs of Friday, with 17 percent of companies in the S.&P. 500 having reported, profits were on pace to rise more than 18 percent, the high quarterly rate in seven years. So far, 80 percent of companies in the indexes have reported have beaten expectation.Peter Eavis\u2019s takeDespite all the bullish talk about earnings and the economy, stocks looked vulnerable going into the first-quarter earnings season. Analysts are expecting earnings for companies in the S.&P. 500 to grow 25 percent this year, an unusually large increase. At the 2018 forecast, the S.&P. 500 looks temperately valued at 17 times earnings. But looking back, stocks appear expensive, at 21 times the S.&P. 500\u2019s earnings for 2017. This large gap between future and historical valuations creates a chasm that stocks can fall into if profits disappoint. If companies, like 3M did on Tuesday, provide underwhelming earnings outlooks, investors will stop believing that stocks are cheap, based on 2018 earnings.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note broke through 3 percent early Tuesday, the first time since 2014 that the benchmark borrowing rate has carried a \u201cthree handle.\u201d Big picture, there\u2019s not much news here. Rates are rising on the back of solid global growth and a Federal Reserve that continues to gradually raise rates this year.No news, however, doesn\u2019t mean no worries. Nearly a decade after the worst of the Great Recession, no one knows exactly how reliant the American economy has become on rock-bottom interest rates. With average 30-year fixed mortgage rates now topping 4.4 percent, housing data has been persistently soft in recent months. And residential real estate is expected to be a drag on first quarter G.D.P. numbers when they\u2019re published on Friday, suggesting that if rising rates are no reason to panic, they shouldn\u2019t merely be shrugged off either.A number of prominent bond investors have long eyed the 3 percent level. Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive of DoubleLine Capital and manager of one of the largest U.S. bond funds, warned that hitting 3 percent would trigger bear market for bonds.A similar move higher in February caused stocks to tumble. So far, though, equities have taken Tuesday\u2019s climb above 3 percent in stride. The Dow Jones industrial average and the S.&P. 500 are essentially flat in early trading.That stunning conclusion, from a new study, could shake up discussions in boardrooms and C-suites everywhere. (The study tracked compensation at 2,282 companies from 1996 to 2014.)One of the most interesting theories about why women may have bridged the pay divide at the highest levels has been offered by previous studies and experts: that a premium has been applied because there is such a limited supply of women in the chief executive role. Some readers may find that an offensive idea on its face \u2014 that women in effect are being overpaid because of their scarcity \u2014 but it\u2019s one that has gained currency among some academics.Shares in Shire jumped in Tuesday trading, reaching 3,977.20 pence by late trading London time.\u2014 Michael de la MercedWhat does this mean for Uber?\u2022 Uber sold its business in China to Didi in 2016.

If labor markets continue to tighten, the question soon won\u2019t be hypothetical.Since Amazon doesn\u2019t disclose its total compensation expense, Peter Eavis did some math. Multiplying that median pay number by the total number of employees gives a (hypothetical!) comp expense of $16.1 billion. Two more sums:By comparison, a 10 percent raise at Walmart would have cut annual pretax profit by 28 percent, and a 20 percent raise is a 56 percent hit.\u2022 Mr. Palihapitiya: Bet on Box.Advertisement"}
