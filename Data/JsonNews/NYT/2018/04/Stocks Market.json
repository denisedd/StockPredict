But by then he had already absorbed many hits to the head during eight years of Pop Warner football and one year playing as a high school freshman.By 2014, Ms. Archie\u2019s son, Paul Bright Jr., was 24, and had done something out of character, his mother said: He bought a motorcycle off Craigslist, despite having no riding experience. He fixed it up, and rode it fast without a license or insurance. On Labor Day that year he T-boned another vehicle and died.An examination of her son\u2019s brain revealed previous damage to its frontal lobe, and he was found to have chronic traumatic encephalopathy, more commonly known as C.T.E.Now, California state lawmakers are being asked to bar children under 12 from playing organized tackle football \u2014 a requirement supporters say will protect their brains from unnecessary injury and trauma. Ms. Archie, who had been working to make sports safer long before her son\u2019s death, supports the bill, but thinks the age limit should be pushed even higher.\u201cIf I\u2019m wrong there is going to be less brain-injury exposure,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they\u2019re wrong, kids can die.\u201d\u201cOver my son\u2019s dead body,\u201d Ms. Archie said, \u201cwill it not pass.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Officials at the Los Angeles Tourism & Convention Board have done the focus groups, and they\u2019ve come up with a controversial conclusion.\u201cThe younger generations living in New York love Los Angeles,\u201d Don Skeoch, the board\u2019s chief marketing office said in an email. \u201cThis is not fake news, we promise.\u201dThe New York-specific ads will run through the end of May, officials say.

{"Headline": "Why Trump\u2019s Tariffs Could Raise the Cost of a Hip Replacement", "Date": "2018-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPacemakers and artificial joints. Defibrillators. Dental fillings. Birth-control pills and vaccines. All are made in China, and all could be subject to new tariffs.Dozens of drugs and medical devices are among the Chinese products and ingredients that the Trump administration targeted for a potential 25 percent tariff in a proposal this week. The list includes some products that are in dangerously short supply, like epinephrine, used to treat allergic reactions, and others, like insulin, whose rising prices have driven public outrage in the United States.China\u2019s medical device industry has been expanding rapidly. An International Trade Commission report in January said the fastest growth was in sales of implantable orthopedic devices, plates and screws, mostly made of titanium and used for surgery and sports medicine. One analyst estimates that about 12 percent of medical devices imported into the United States come from China, amounting to $3 billion a year.Several companies, including Medtronic and Zimmer Biomet, have orthopedic device factories in China that export goods to the United States.And a report this week by RBC Capital Markets estimated that if the proposed 25 percent tariffs took effect, the move could cost the medical device industry up to $1.5 billion each year. Some of the higher costs would undoubtedly result in increased prices for those devices, affecting baby boomers, who are now among the biggest recipients of hip and knee replacements.Brandon Henry, a medical device analyst for RBC Capital Markets, said some of the bigger medical technology companies were surprised to find their products on the list.Greg Crist, a spokesman for AdvaMed, the trade group for device members, said its members were \u201cdisappointed because this action threatens to affect the health and well-being of American patients and those around the world.\u201dHow much would be passed on to consumers remains unknown.\u201cThe impact of this orthopedic device tariff isn\u2019t a straight line,\u201d said David A. Halsey, president of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, in an email, adding that the group was working to assess the possible effects.It was unclear whether the tariffs would have a substantial effect on the drug industry, analysts said, even though China is a leading exporter of raw pharmaceutical ingredients. \u201cWe don\u2019t see much impact,\u201d Umer Raffat, a pharmaceutical industry analyst for Evercore ISI, said in a note to investors on Tuesday.That is because many generic drugs that contain Chinese ingredients are manufactured in countries like India, meaning they would not be subject to the tariffs. And brand-name drugs made in the United States are frequently so expensive that the list price often has little connection to the product\u2019s manufacturing cost.Nevertheless, at least one trade group sounded the alarm on the tariffs, warning that they could exacerbate the already contentious issue of health care costs, just when the Trump administration has pledged to take action to lower drug prices.Several major manufacturers, including Merck and the generic-drug makers Mylan and Teva Pharmaceutical declined to comment.\u201cThe cynic in me thinks this is another way for companies to say they need to raise their prices,\u201d said Erin R. Fox, a drug-shortage expert at the University of Utah.While many pill forms of generic drugs are manufactured overseas, most generic injectable drugs are made in the United States, using raw ingredients acquired from overseas. But because many companies do not disclose where those raw ingredients come from \u2014 saying the information is proprietary \u2014 it is hard to know the impact of the proposed tariffs, Ms. Fox said.\u201cThings are so bad right now with the injectables, we don\u2019t need anything else to pile on, to possibly make things worse,\u201d Ms. Fox said.Heather Zoumas Lubeski, a spokeswoman for Par Pharmaceutical, a major manufacturer of injectable epinephrine, said the company\u2019s raw ingredients were imported from Europe and that the proposed tariffs would not have an impact on Par or its parent company, Endo International.Some analysts and trade lawyers pointed out that the list was an early draft and that many different industries and groups would be lobbying the government in the coming months so that their products would not be punished.An earlier version of this article erroneously included Pfizer among a group of manufacturers that declined to comment on President Trump\u2019s proposal to impose tariffs on certain medical devices and drugs made in China. Pfizer was not contacted for comment by The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Trade War Could Leave Investors With Few Places to Hide", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe long calm in the stock market has been broken by confirmation that the Federal Reserve intends to combat inflation aggressively and by signs of a trade war that could threaten global economic integration and the prosperity it has helped engender.What happens from here may hinge on the speed and severity of Fed interest rate increases and the speed and severity with which the United States and China impose tariffs on each other\u2019s goods.At their most extreme, investment advisers warn, each factor could subdue growth, and protectionist policies could do much worse. Until signs emerge that economic damage will be limited, they say, stocks could remain under pressure.\u201cWe\u2019re dealing with a more toxic issue than we\u2019ve had to deal with in this bull market,\u201d said Edward Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. \u201cThere\u2019s the potential for causing a global recession, and that\u2019s something investors are worrying about.\u201dThey seemed not to have a care in the world as 2018 began. Stocks recorded a string of record highs as Wall Street contemplated the benefits from reduced corporate and personal income tax rates that had just been enacted. But Treasury bond yields rose steadily through January as indicators of economic strength, particularly the persistently low unemployment rate, raised the prospect of rising inflation.Around the same time, President Trump began to impose tariffs intended to protect American industries from foreign competition. Solar panels and washing machines were his first targets. Then came steel and aluminum.Tariffs may or may not help the targeted industries, which in these cases are not significant segments of the economy, anyway, and the taxes are almost universally viewed as harmful to consumers, who have to pay more for the affected goods. And then there\u2019s the impact of tariffs imposed by foreign governments in retaliation, which came swiftly from China, the main target of the trade war that Mr. Trump has threatened to wage.The potential impact of the back-and-forth trade moves, and the ones that yet may come, helped send stocks on one of the swiftest plunges on record starting in late January \u2014 11.8 percent in less than 10 trading days for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.That was followed by a rally that recouped most of the loss, and then another decline that took the index close to a fresh low, leaving it down 1.2 percent in the first three months of the year, the first quarterly decline since 2015. The early days of April have been rocky as well.If a trade war really has begun, some household names in corporate America could become casualties, Andy Rothman, an investment strategist at Matthews Asia, warned.\u201cThere are already a lot of U.S. companies doing really well in China,\u201d he said. \u201cG.M. sells more cars in China than in the U.S., Boeing sells more planes in China than in any other market, and Apple derives 20 percent of its revenues in China. Those are big listed names.\u201dThe impact would go beyond sales in China, he added. American companies that obtain parts and supplies there could see that conduit disrupted.As for the Chinese economy and stock market, Mr. Rothman said, they are mostly immune.\u201cVery few listed Chinese companies export stuff to the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if Trump disrupts U.S.-China trade, the impact should be negligible.\u201dA trade war, therefore, \u201cwill hurt us more than them,\u201d he said. That\u2019s why he expects the president\u2019s protectionist tendencies to be reined in.\u201cThe odds of a full-blown trade war are extremely low,\u201d Mr. Rothman said. Not only is the Chinese leadership eager to avoid one, but \u201cTrump must be coming under a lot of pressure not to do this for the damage it will do to the U.S. equity market.\u201dTobias Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist at Citi Research, also foresees limited damage to the economy and stocks from an unraveling in trade relations. He pointed to the exemptions on steel and aluminum tariffs offered to big trading partners like Canada and Mexico, and he expressed hope that Mr. Trump\u2019s words and actions merely reflected his penchant for eccentric deal making.\u201cTrump has a unique negotiating style,\u201d Mr. Levkovich said. But \u201cif he takes it further, it could be a problem and hurt growth in a more meaningful way.\u201d As for the impact of the president\u2019s tactics on investments, he added, \u201cit doesn\u2019t help.\u201dMr. Yardeni said he thought a trade war could be forestalled, although the mere prospect of one could depress the stock market. He agreed that \u201cthis could be Trump\u2019s art of the deal \u2014 take an extreme negotiating position and wait for people on the other side to say, \u2018Let\u2019s talk about this.\u2019\u201dTighter monetary policy is a more run-of-the-mill concern. But investors should not underestimate the potential it has to harm their portfolios with valuations elevated across the board and inflation threatening to return.\u201cPrices across just about every asset class look high historically,\u201d said Ben Inker, head of asset allocation for the asset management firm GMO. \u201cWhat they all have in common is that when you squint, they make sense if you assume cash rates are going to stay low for some time. If inflation is up, then you need significantly tight monetary policy. That\u2019s bad for bonds and also stocks.\u201dMr. Inker is concerned about a trade war, like many other investors, but he emphasizes the risk of higher prices on goods \u2014 inflation \u2014 that it might cause.\u201cThe nightmare scenario is a general rise of economic nationalism and the mercantilist view that trade has winners and losers,\u201d he said. \u201cThen you get a retreat from globalization, which has helped the economy grow without experiencing significant inflation.\u201dWhen stocks fall, so usually do yields on high-quality bonds, sending prices higher in a so-called flight to safety. But one ominous development during the first leg of the decline in stocks, from Jan. 26 to Feb. 8, was that the yield on 10-year Treasury securities rose to 2.85 percent from 2.66 percent. Yields were steady during the second wave of selling in stocks, but they rose overall during the first quarter, to 2.74 percent from 2.4 percent.That means that bond prices, as well as stock prices, fell.Terri Spath, chief investment officer of Sierra Investment Management, warned in a note to clients that the traditional balanced portfolio, split 60/40 between stocks and bonds, might not provide the protection through diversification that it used to if the bond bull market that began in the early 1980s is over, as she believes.\u201cTightening Fed policy, inflation, rapidly growing deficits and their impact on rates can sometimes move bond prices violently,\u201d Ms. Spath wrote. \u201cJuly 2016 marked the lowest level in rates I will likely see in my lifetime,\u201d with the 10-year Treasury yield reaching 1.33 percent. \u201cIf interest rates continue the climb up from that level, traditional bonds and the 60/40 will continue to die, as foreshadowed during the first correction of 2018.\u201dMs. Spath is not alone in disdaining bonds. The latest Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey of global fund managers, released in late March, showed bonds to be the second-least-favorite of 22 asset classes \u2014 behind only British stocks \u2014 relative to how managers have rated them throughout the survey\u2019s 17-year history.Bond funds and domestic and international stock funds all fell in the first quarter, though not by that much. The average taxable bond fund declined 0.5 percent, according to Morningstar, led lower by portfolios specializing in longer-term issues.The average domestic stock fund fell 0.4 percent, with consumer defensive and natural resources groups faring worse than most and technology being one of the few clear winners, up 6 percent. International funds declined 0.3 percent, although specialists in China and Latin America recorded gains.With interest rates rising, stock market valuations still high and protectionist impulses threatening to ignite a full-blown trade war, advisers encourage investors to indulge protectionist impulses of a different sort when it comes to their portfolios. They recommend keeping less money in stocks or being more selective about the ones investors own.\u201cYou\u2019re better off investing pretty much anywhere other than the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Inker said about stocks, although he prefers Treasury bonds to foreign bonds.The only type of investment he recommends outright, rather than in comparison to others that he deems even worse, is \u201cthe cheap half of emerging\u201d markets, in particular technology stocks in places like Taiwan and elsewhere in Asia.\u201cOther than emerging market value, we don\u2019t see assets that deserve to go up a lot,\u201d he said.Citi\u2019s analysts prefer emerging markets and Europe, where stocks are cheaper and central banks are doing more to prop up the markets. Mr. Levkovich counters that stocks are cheaper abroad for good reasons: American businesses have higher returns on equity, and American benchmark stock indexes are heavier in technology and lighter in the financial industry.Mr. Levkovich recommended that investors prune their portfolios to enhance return prospects. In particular, he would be cautious on tech and usually defensive areas like utilities, consumer staples and telecoms, and emphasize traditional industrial companies and the materials industry, including chemical producers.Mr. Yardeni remains optimistic about stocks, but he\u2019s in no hurry to buy.\u201cYou have to recognize that if you\u2019re thinking of buying stocks, you\u2019re not exactly getting in early,\u201d he said. \u201cWe could have a shakeout here until we get clarity on protectionism.\u201dHis advice is to be patient in the likelihood that stocks can be bought at lower prices. When the time feels right, he said, he would look at exporters and other companies that would be on the front lines in a trade war, which he expects to be averted.\u201cYou\u2019re probably going to find some good opportunities in blue-chip stocks with exposure to tariff issues,\u201d Mr. Yardeni said. But for now, he cautioned, risks in the market have risen.\u201cThis probably will turn out to be a panic attack, like before,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it has the potential to be a more serious correction than we\u2019ve had in some time.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spotify\u2019s Wall Street Debut Is a Success", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpotify is a hit.On its first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the music streaming service finished with a valuation of $26.5 billion. The share price closed at $149.01, giving Spotify a market value similar to that of companies like M&T Bank and General Mills.\u201cThere\u2019s a healthy appetite among public market investors for streaming media assets,\u201d said Rob Sanderson, an analyst at MKM Partners.The stock opened trading at $165.90, meaning that Spotify was valued at $29.5 billion to start the day, before declining gradually through the afternoon.Among Wall Street traders, Spotify\u2019s debut as a public company drew attention for the way it decided to list its shares. It went with a so-called direct listing approach, a rare process that eschewed the usual circus \u2014 and safeguards \u2014 of a standard initial public offering.Typically, a company lists its shares publicly as part of a broader plan to raise fresh cash for acquisitions or other investments. Spotify chose not to raise any new funds by issuing shares, which would have diluted the value of existing stakes owned by shareholders.Instead, the company is taking existing shares and allowing them to be traded on the exchange. That allows longtime shareholders \u2014 like investors and employees \u2014 to sell their shares on the exchange immediately, though for years an active secondary market has existed for Spotify stock.The Stockholm-based company, which was founded in 2006 and went online in 2008, said it did not need to raise any new cash from investors, citing the roughly $1.84 billion it had on hand at the end of 2017.Daniel Ek, the company\u2019s chief executive and co-founder, characterized Spotify\u2019s manner of going public as perfectly in keeping with the company\u2019s self-image as a disrupter.\u201cWhile I appreciate that this path makes sense for most, Spotify has never been a normal kind of company.\u201dSpotify\u2019s direct listing approach was still seen as risky. Without underwriting banks acting as \u201cstabilizing agents,\u201d and without millions of newly issued shares to guarantee liquidity, the process for setting an opening price proved slow and complex. The stock did not begin trading until 12:43 p.m., the latest start for any company ever listed on the New York Stock Exchange, according to Kristen Kaus, a spokeswoman for the exchange.Afterward, the day went without a glitch, with Spotify achieving a trading volume of 30 million.\u201cIt was a safe landing,\u201d said Santosh Rao, the head of research at Manhattan Venture Partners. \u201cPeople thought this was going to be chaotic, but it was smooth.\u201dSpotify\u2019s arrival on the market followed the Wall Street debut of Dropbox last month, when the cloud storage company\u2019s shares jumped 36 percent on its first day of trading. Dropbox closed Tuesday at $31.59, far above its I.P.O. price of $21 a share.Taken together, the new offerings amount to a bright spot for a technology sector that has been badly beaten up by investors this year. Amid growing concern over trade tensions with China and possible regulatory scrutiny of Facebook, technology shares shed roughly $450 billion in market capitalization between March 12, the peak of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 tech sector, and Monday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oaxaca on the Gowanus: The Charms and Chiles of Claro", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRestaurant Review12 PhotosWhen you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.If you love Oaxacan food and live in New York City, it helps to be mobile. About half a million Mexican-Americans live here, too, and while more have been arriving from Oaxaca in recent years, very few have opened restaurants.Claro, in other words, is not where you go for Oaxacan recipes that have been passed down from generation to generation. Home-style soups and stews are rare. So is cooked fish. On the other hand, Mr. Steele has given himself liberty to work with ingredients that might furrow the average Mexican grandmother\u2019s brow, like kale and sunchokes. Although he has lived part-time in Oaxaca City for more than a decade, he still thinks like a New York chef.But as his head-to-toe artwork suggests, Mr. Steele has a tendency to go all in. This is, as it happens, the only way to make the moles that are the pride of Oaxaca. The moles at Claro are riveting: The ground nuts and dried spices, the garlic and onions all seem to bring out the personalities of the chiles \u2014 sometimes fruity, sometimes vegetal \u2014 while tamping down their heat. He keeps their bitterness in check, too.Pork cheek was stewed in a mole rojo that has just enough chocolate to make you smile; the mole negro, in which marbled short ribs were cooked to extreme tenderness, was so balanced that no one ingredient ever seemed to be in the lead. Chichilo, not one of your everyday moles, was the brightest and most outgoing of the three, and a big pool of it made an exciting foil for a chile relleno filled with shredded, spiced duck.Mr. Steele also goes all in on masa, which is stone-ground and nixtamalized on site from strains of blue and yellow corn native to Oaxaca. Ten years ago you couldn\u2019t talk about the state of masa in New York without experiencing early signs of depression; now Claro is among a handful of local restaurants whose masa is worth getting excited about.Thicker, softer wheels of masa with raised rims make up the base of memelas, the Oaxacan version of sopes and huaraches. The one with goat-cheese crema and wild mushrooms has a meaty intensity, without any meat; another, spread with an unexpectedly fluffy hash of chorizo and potatoes, is topped with house-made queso fresco to calm the chorizo\u2019s burn.Occasionally, it can be hard to tell Claro\u2019s memelas from its tostadas. Because together they make up a substantial chunk of the menu, if you don\u2019t order carefully you can end up with a long, unbroken run of masa discs. (This is not the worst fate on earth.)The flavors at Claro tend to be finely tuned, so when a dish was out of alignment, I noticed. Beef tongue tacos would have needed a heavier glug of salsa to make up for meat that was as salty as country ham. And when the pickled-pepper sauce binding the bacon-and-octopus tostada was too sharp and sour, what had been the high point of one dinner became the low point of another \u2014 a vinegar tostada.Claro is filled with evidence of the connections Mr. Steele has made over the years in Oaxaca. The bar stocks a smoky but approachable mezcal that he imports, called El Buho. The tiles under the bar and the charcoal-toned plates and dishes are made by ceramists he met there. It\u2019s all pretty restrained; you don\u2019t get the sense he has turned the restaurant into a warehouse for crafts he bought, drunk on the exchange rate, at the artisan\u2019s market.On the wall is a mural of three goats surrounding a woman who seems to be having a bad day; she is in a caldron over a fire, and the goats look hungry. If you want to turn the tables, try to go to Claro on a night when barbecued goat is on the menu. Served with blue and yellow tortillas, red and green salsas, and a bowl of consomm\u00e9, it is more than enough to make a meal of.I ate it with one eye on the back door, thinking about what else Claro might serve when the weather is warm enough to start cooking on the wood grill every night.An earlier version of this article misstated Claro\u2019s ties to a nearby restaurant. Claro is run by one owner of Freek\u2019s Mill, not two. An earlier version also misstated the number of Oaxacan ceramists responsible for the tiles, plates and dishes at the restaurant. It was two, not one.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Reservations powered by ResyAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Focusing on a Manager\u2019s Best Stock Ideas May Not Be a Good Idea", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStock funds with concentrated portfolios \u2014 30 or 40 holdings, tops \u2014 are supposed to contain only the managers\u2019 best investment ideas.It turns out, though, that those ideas generally haven\u2019t been good enough to help the funds beat more diversified rivals.In the first quarter, and in the one, three and five years that ended on March 31, the average such stock fund, known as a focus fund, failed to beat at least half of the funds with the same objective \u2014 large-company growth, Asian smaller companies, whatever \u2014 according to Morningstar.At our request, Morningstar examined all actively managed stock funds that had no sales load, a minimum investment of $10,000 or less and at least $100 million in assets. A focus fund was defined as being in the 10 percent of funds with the fewest portfolio holdings, meaning it owned fewer stocks than any of the other 90 percent.Despite the so-so performance of focus funds as a group, some did exceptionally well, and that reveals the good and bad news about them: Their portfolio concentration can accentuate the gap between the best and worst.\u201cConcentration can propel you to greater heights and drive you to greater depths,\u201d said Christopher Davis, a senior analyst specializing in equity strategy for Morningstar. \u201cA concentrated fund is harder to own.\u201dAmid the ordinariness, or worse, there were many apparent standouts. A greater number of concentrated funds performed in the top 10 percent within their respective investment objectives in each period than would be expected by chance, the Morningstar data reveals.In the year through March, for instance, in a universe of 1,938 funds, 19 or 20 in the group with the 10 percent fewest holdings should be in the top 10 percent of returns, strictly by chance, but 26 were.Todd Rosenbluth, director of exchange-traded fund and mutual fund research at CFRA, views the wide performance range among focus funds as a silver lining.\u201cConcentrated funds put only their best ideas into the portfolio and tend to stick with them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can be more volatile, as they are driven by a smaller number of stocks and tend to be more concentrated in certain sectors.\u201dThat may give any of them a chance to beat the market. Diversified portfolios, in contrast, may not deviate much from benchmark stock indexes, he said, and so \u201care more likely to lag a considerably cheaper Vanguard index mutual fund.\u201dThe potential to substantially outperform allows providers of focus funds to charge more money. The average focus fund has annual expenses of 1.06 percent, compared with 0.98 percent for the average actively managed stock fund, according to Morningstar. Focus funds also typically have smaller asset bases, providing fewer economies of scale.\u201cConcentrated funds start off deeper in the expense hole and have a deeper expense gap to traverse,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cIf you bet on the right one, your upside potential is all that much greater. Investors choose to make that bet. If they choose well, the expense ratio doesn\u2019t really matter. If they don\u2019t, the additional expenses will add insult to injury.\u201dThere have been clear, consistent winners among focus funds, even if their inherent volatility can cause periodic weakness. Many names appear on several lists of top concentrated portfolios this year and over one, three and five years, with seven funds on all four.One of those, Guinness Atkinson Global Innovators, maintains a portfolio of about 30 stocks. They are often the same ones because the managers like to hold positions for many years.As the fund\u2019s name suggests, its managers \u201ctry to identify companies that use innovation to drive their growth,\u201d said Matthew Page, one of those managers. \u201cWe believe that, ultimately, companies like that should outperform because they\u2019re smarter and better than their average peers. That means higher growth prospects and profits.\u201dAmong the themes that appeal to him are big data and machine learning. The first refers to the storage, processing and analysis of immense sets of related data. The second involves developing programs that allow computers to learn from and make predictions about data almost instantaneously, a skill that will be needed for technologies such as self-driving cars.It\u2019s hard to invest in these areas directly, Mr. Page said, so the portfolio holds stocks in related ones, including Nvidia, which makes graphics processing units, Fanuc, a Japanese robotics business, and Infineon, a German maker of semiconductors for the automotive industry that is expanding into chips for electric and self-driving vehicles.The Baron Fifth Avenue Growth fund, another that appears on all four lists of top-performing focus funds, favors large companies that sell for less than their intrinsic worth because investors misunderstand their businesses, Alex Umansky, the fund\u2019s manager, says. He adds that there are so few mispricings among these well-researched companies that the fund usually holds just 30 to 35 stocks.He keeps most of them for long periods \u2014 \u201cour time horizon is forever,\u201d he said \u2014 and accepts price swings that other managers try to avoid by maintaining bigger portfolios.\u201cWe think overdiversification has been massively value-destructive over the last decade because people are worried about managing volatility,\u201d Mr. Umansky said.The fund\u2019s largest constituent, accounting for 15 percent of its assets, is hardly obscure \u2014 Amazon \u2014 but Mr. Umansky contends that its price is too cheap, even at 235 times its earnings for the last four quarters. That extravagant valuation is misleading, he said, because Amazon has a history of forgoing earnings today by investing in new business lines that will pay off tomorrow.Other portfolio holdings include Alibaba, a Chinese e-commerce giant; and Mastercard and Visa, which dominate the credit card business. Mr. Umansky called Mastercard \u201cthe digital railroad\u201d taking financial transactions from paper to the electronic world, a process that he expects to be larger and more lucrative than investors anticipate.Mr. Rosenbluth recommends the Guinness Atkinson and Baron funds.

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Another bank takes steps toward gun safety.\u2022 The next steps in the tariffs tit-for-tat.\u2022 Investigators are looking into the motive behind the shooting at YouTube\u2019s headquarters.Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union provides pointers for investors as President Trump ratchets up trade tensions with China.In the weeks following Britain\u2019s vote in 2016 for \u201cBrexit,\u201d fears grew that the post-war economic order was under serious threat. But European stock markets recovered, including Britain\u2019s. Investors came to see that the European Union was not going to break up, and Britain was not going to erect tall walls around its economy. Looking back, the panicky early reaction to Brexit seems to have sprung more from a fear of the unknown than any big threats to the global trading system. Investors took a deep breath and gained some perspective.Movements in the United States stock market suggests the same thing is happening in response to President Trump\u2019s trade policies. China on Tuesday evening announced the tariffs it plans in retaliation against those President Trump is threatening. Reacting to China\u2019s announcement, the S.&P. 500 index plunged early on Wednesday but recovered strongly to close up 1.2 percent.Investors may believe China\u2019s move will lead to drawn-out negotiations. Here, Brexit is again illustrative. As the back and forth between the European Union and Britain has gone on, investors have gained more clarity and confidence. If talks between the U.S. and China gain steam, the uncertainty now clouding relations between the two countries may gradually clear.But the standoff between the U.S. and China differs in important ways from the Brexit tensions. The U.S., for instance, is in a much stronger position than Britain. China exports far more to the U.S. than the U.S. does to China. Limiting access to the U.S. economy could hurt China\u2019s growth at a time when it is trying to overhaul important economic sectors. If investors believe that the U.S. can successfully exploit its advantages to make China more friendly to foreign businesses, they may even see the trade skirmish as positive for the global economy.But Brexit also flashes a warning to those expecting a big win for Mr. Trump. One of the reasons that the European Union has presented a united front is that it sees Brexit as a threat to its values and goals. Similarly, China may believe that Mr. Trump\u2019s trade attack puts some of its most deeply held aspirations under threat \u2013 and will fight back hard.- Peter EavisAfter Citigroup announced plans to limit firearms sales by business customers, the question was which lenders would be the next to make a move on guns. The latest: Amalgamated Bank, the union-owned bank known for its socially minded policies.\u2022 Require gun dealers to protect merchandise from burglary and theft and refuse sales to people who appear in distress or intoxicated\u2022 Require retailers to stop selling high-capacity magazines and bump stocks\u2022 Require gun makers to \u201ccommit to developing innovations in firearms that will allow law enforcement to more easily solve gun crimes\u201dAmalgamated said that it would not only require all business customers to adhere to those guidelines but added that it won\u2019t invest any of its own money in gun manufacturers or distributors.Here\u2019s what Amalgamated\u2019s C.E.O. Keith Mestrich, said in a news release:\u201cCollectively, banks and lenders have the power to promote responsible business practices from gun manufacturers and distributors, and ultimately contribute to a safer society for all. Amalgamated will do whatever we can to achieve that goal and we hope other banks and financial institutions will agree and act.\u201dThe new figure sharply increased the company\u2019s previous estimate of how many users\u2019 information was harvested by Cambridge Analytica. The number had been put at more than 50 million users.The sharing of the user data has unleashed a torrent of criticism at Facebook, the world\u2019s largest social network. The company\u2019s stock is down sharply since The New York Times and The Observer of London reported on how Cambridge Analytica improperly acquired users\u2019 data.The company released the revised estimate of affected users in an extended statement on Wednesday about its plans for handling personal data. The company said it will start alerting users on April 9 about whether their information may have been shared with Cambridge Analytica.In related Facebook news\u2022 Earlier on Wednesday, lawmakers in Washington had said Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, would testify before the House Energy and Commerce Committee on April 11 about the company\u2019s handling of sensitive user data.And is dragging down the Dow Jones industrial average. The blue-chip index is off nearly 350 points, or 1.4 percent.

Boeing is the highest priced stock in the price-weighted index, which means Boeing has an outsized impact on the index\u2019s moves.Boeing\u2019s shares have served as a proxy for investor concern about a possible trade war with China since the Trump administration announced tariffs on aluminum and steel.Over that period, the stock has fallen 12 percent.The streaming-music company\u2019s shares opened at $165.90, but they steadily decline throughout their first day of trading, closing at $149.01.The stock is down 4.1 percent to $142.91 in early trading Wednesday.Because Spotify eschewed a typical initial public offering in favor of a direct listing, there is no I.P.O. price off which to base the performance of its shares. But the company\u2019s current shares price remains well above the $132.50 its private shares changed hands at earlier this year.Sony.At Tuesday\u2019s close, Sony\u2019s 5.7 percent stake was worth $1.5 billion.What may change: security in Silicon Valley.

{"Headline": "Finding Emerging Markets Stocks With Social Consciences", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUntil recently, investors interested in emerging market funds had few ways of singling out companies with standout environmental, social and governance records.That has begun to change over the last several years, as the popularity of investing with an eye to these issues has surged. There are now 10 mutual funds and exchange-traded-funds that invest in stocks in emerging markets while making environmental, social and governance performance an explicit part of their mission, according to Morningstar.For its first several years, the E.S.G. index outperformed its peer benchmark. Mr. Varco wanted to determine whether that was luck. He crunched the data and concluded that selecting companies based on nonfinancial factors had helped. Simply put, the E.S.G. index did better because the companies within it appeared, on average, to be better run. \u201cThere\u2019s yet to be a year where the standard index did better,\u201d he said.People who opt for funds of this sort should understand that their performance will diverge from that of well-known emerging-markets benchmarks, said Todd L. Rosenbluth, director of E.T.F. and mutual fund research at CFRA, an investment research firm.\u201cBecause the holdings and the weightings differ, the performance is likely to differ,\u201d he said. \u201cE.S.G. strategies tend to have hefty weightings in technology stocks. So when tech is in favor, as it was in 2017, that will help them. If we hit a time when energy or old-line industrials shine, they won\u2019t perform as well.\u201dOver the last five years, emerging markets have chugged upward, with MSCI\u2019s conventional index gaining an annualized average of 4.99 percent. In the first quarter, the index gained 1.42 percent. MSCI\u2019s Emerging Markets E.S.G. Leaders Index has outpaced its peer \u2014 rising an annualized average of 8.6 percent over the last five years, though only 1.01 percent in the first quarter.When Mr. Varco, of Cambridge Associates, did his study, he didn\u2019t dig into precisely why companies in the E.S.G. index might excel or, conversely, why ones in the conventional index might lag. But he said one reason might be that state-owned enterprises, like Brazil\u2019s Petrobras, where a prominent bribery scandal has implicated dozens of government officials, loom large in the standard index. These outfits are often not run as well as their nonstate kin, he said.Managers of actively managed funds echoed his assessment.\u201cThe Chinese state doesn\u2019t work for you,\u201d he said. \u201cIt works for itself. Its goals and incentives aren\u2019t aligned with those of minority shareholders.\u201d Two Chinese state-owned enterprises \u2014 China Mobile and China Construction Bank \u2014 are among the top 10 constituents of the standard index.Put differently, the problem with state-run companies, besides potential political agendas, is governance. They don\u2019t have procedures in place, as developed-world public companies typically do, to ensure that minority investors are treated fairly and have access to all the information they need about company operations, investments and finances.\u201cFor me, the emphasis is sustainability,\u201d he said. \u201cCompanies that plan for the future, with adequate infrastructure and R.&D., and look to build long-term relationships with all their stakeholders, I believe they\u2019ll ultimately have higher returns.\u201dThe case for investing in the emerging world can be boiled down to a word: growth. Compared with developed countries, emerging ones are, on average, growing faster, and they are pulling hundreds of millions of people into the middle class for the first time. That\u2019s giving rise to new companies and creating huge new markets for existing ones, said Binu George, portfolio strategist for the emerging markets team at GMO, an asset management firm. \u201cThere are 24 emerging-market countries,\u201d he said. \u201cIn those countries and their stocks, there\u2019s a massive opportunity for you to make money.\u201dWith that faster growth comes greater risk: On average, the returns of emerging markets stocks roller coaster more than those of developed market ones.\u201cThe asset class is incredibly volatile, and yet there are still many great businesses in the emerging world,\u201d said Mr. Eidelman of the JPMorgan fund. Over time, patience \u2014 and attention to environmental, social and governance factors \u2014 can pay off, leading to superior performance, he said.\u201cThe time frame really matters. If you\u2019re looking to own a business for a long time \u2014 not just trade a stock \u2014 then factors around how that business interacts with all of its stakeholders become much more important. If you\u2019re just trading monthly, the fact that you think the management is dodgy might not matter.\u201dFor someone committed to so-called socially responsible investing, including a relatively small allocation \u2014 say 5 or 10 percent of a diversified portfolio \u2014 to this niche can make sense, added Mr. Rosenbluth of CFRA.\u201cE.S.G. factors are perhaps even more relevant outside the U.S., especially governance,\u201d he said. \u201cThis sounds obvious, but in less developed countries, the companies have less developed governance. By investing in ones that are providing better governance, you\u2019re encouraging other companies to act more responsibly.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Three Funds Find Routes to Top Performance in a Rough Market", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the first quarter, as the S.&P. 500 sputtered to a 1.2 percent loss and many sectors sagged, the managers of three of the top-performing mutual funds scooted ahead by betting on growth stocks and Latin America.\u201cWe\u2019re looking for growth in the intrinsic value of the business,\u201d Mr. Bonavico said. \u201cA lot of traditional growth investors just want high-revenue growth and earnings-per-share growth. But that\u2019s not enough to tell you whether something is a good business. We want to see a good return on invested capital and good free cash flow.\u201dThey sleuth among small- and mid-cap outfits and shy from the tech giants, like Alphabet and Amazon, that have felt so much investor ardor over the past several years. Instead, they\u2019ve toted up gains in holdings as diverse as Dunkin\u2019 Brands Group and Wix.com.Many people misunderstand the investment case for Dunkin\u2019, associating the company with its doughnuts and its omnipresence in the Northeast, particularly New England, Mr. Bonavico said. Its promise instead lies in caffeinated beverages and in the company\u2019s potential for growth in the rest of the United States.\u201cCoffee is the major driver \u2014 it\u2019s a daily purchase, it\u2019s habit-forming, and it\u2019s got a 90 percent margin,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s an enormous opportunity for them to add franchisees west of the Mississippi.\u201dWix, for its part, is known as a website builder for small businesses. Mr. Bonavico said he and Mr. Broad believe the company has a better strategy than competitors like Squarespace and GoDaddy.\u201cWix has zero salespeople \u2014 they compete only on the quality of the product,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re the only one using the freemium model.\u201d Wix customers can pay nothing for basic service or pay up for more features.The Jackson Square fund officially began in 2016, two years after Mr. Bonavico and Mr. Broad and several colleagues formed their own firm, Jackson Square Partners. Mr. Bonavico and Mr. Broad previously managed the Delaware Smid Cap Growth fund, starting in 2005 and continuing through 2016.Betting on Big ThemesAmong those themes are cloud computing, big data and sustainable energy. To winnow the many outfits clambering in these fields, Mr. Lippert will assess the durability of a company\u2019s competitive advantage and the quality of its management, in addition to its fundamentals.That led him to a stock that some investors might dismiss as a laggard \u2014 Microsoft. Mr. Lippert said Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, Satya Nadella, who took over in 2014, has reoriented the company by focusing on cloud computing and artificial intelligence. \u201cMicrosoft used to just sell you Office,\u201d he said. Today, thanks to its software-as-a-service approach, the company knows how customers are using its products and can continuously update and personalize them.Tesla is trying to optimize and control every phase of its electric-car production, he said, and that\u2019s both potentially revolutionary and extremely challenging, Mr. Lippert said. \u201cPeople understand that, but they aren\u2019t giving them room to do it.\u201dMr. Lippert\u2019s fund, with an expense ratio of 1.41 percent for its retail shares, returned 9.2 percent in the first quarter.Bulking up with Brazil \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting about Brazil is, when you compare it to any other major market in the world, it\u2019s the only one on its own economic cycle,\u201d he said. \u201cThey went through their own depression, and they\u2019ve just emerged from that. All economic data is signaling they\u2019re past the worst.\u201dThroughout Latin America, Mr. Pruett said, banks tend to be family-controlled and operated, which typically aligns their interests with those of outside shareholders. On top of that, \u201cMarkets are concentrated, and the penetration of financial services is low,\u201d he said.Consider Peru, home to one of his top holdings, Credicorp, a major bank in a country with 31 million people and an economy growing at 6 percent a year. It is one of four banks that dominate the country\u2019s financial system.\u201cThey each have about a quarter of the market,\u201d Mr. Pruett said. \u201cMargins are high.\u201dInvestors have noticed, pushing Credicorp\u2019s stock up nearly 50 percent over the last year. \u201cThe banks in Latin America are long-term winners.\u201dMr. Pruett\u2019s fund, with an expense ratio of 1.09 percent, returned 10.5 percent in the first quarter.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Shipping Costs Have Put Amazon in a Bind: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Good Friday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Does Amazon have its shipping costs under control?\u2022 What will come out of the Merkel-Trump meeting?\u2022 Why Deutsche Bank was so late to make necessary cuts.\u2022 More complaints have emerged about NBC News\u2019s response to harassment allegations.Amazon\u2019s shipping costs have suddenly become a hot subject, not just to President Trump, but also to the 100 million people who have Amazon Prime.Higher shipping costs are a reason Amazon is raising the cost of Prime membership to $119 a year from $99.But a 20 percent hike is a lot for even a popular service, and it could turn customers off. So why did Amazon do it? The e-commerce giant\u2019s results provide some clues.Members of Prime get free shipping, though their membership fees partially pay for that perk. As the Prime program covers more goods, it\u2019s getting more expensive for Amazon. \u201cOur two-day shipping, it\u2019s now available on over 100 million items, up from 20 million as recently as 2014,\u201d Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon\u2019s C.F.O., said on a conference call Thursday when announcing the increase in the Prime membership fee.The cost pressures from shipping are getting uncomfortable for Amazon. Worldwide shipping costs totaled $6.1 billion in the first quarter of this year, equivalent to 22.5 percent of Amazon\u2019s sales from its online stores during the period. That\u2019s up from 2017, when quarterly shipping costs averaged 19.9 percent of online sales. By bringing shipping costs back down to 20 percent of online sales, Amazon could, in theory, save over $2.5 billion a year (2.5 percent of annualized first-quarter sales comes to roughly $2.8 billion.)To save money, Amazon could offer free shipping on fewer goods, but that could undermine the company\u2019s efforts to bolster sales. And Amazon doesn\u2019t need to do that if it can increase its Prime fees, to help recoup the higher shipping costs. But the fee increase may not be enough. Charging 100 million Prime members an extra $20 per year, in theory, raises \u201conly\u201c $2 billion.- Peter EavisMore on her challenge, from the NYT:Few leaders seem less personally in sync with Mr. Trump than Ms. Merkel. Estranged by widely diverging temperaments and leadership styles, the two leaders have also clashed on substance \u2014 from climate change and military spending to Germany\u2019s chronic, yawning trade surplus with the United States, a particular bugbear of the president.Or as a former State Department official told the NYT, \u201cMerkel is going to Washington and it looks like the U.S. just doesn\u2019t care.\u201d But a foreign relations expert said, \u201cNever underestimate Merkel.\u201dA combination of the two companies would complete one of the telecommunications industry\u2019s most long-awaited transactions and would create the third-largest wireless carrier in the United States, with more than 127 million customers. Sprint and T-Mobile have tried to negotiate a merger twice before.Analysts have argued, and Sprint and T-Mobile themselves have acknowledged, that the companies need greater scale and more resources to better compete against the industry\u2019s leaders, Verizon and AT&T.Should the deal be completed, only three companies would dominate the market in the United States for cellphone service. It is unclear whether the transaction would get regulatory approval. A previous round of merger talks ended in 2014, having drawn strong opposition from the Obama administration.\u2014 Michael de la MercedWhat Mr. Ubben had to say: \u201cThe management and board of FOX has done a superb job of steering the company through a time of transition for the entertainment industry.\u201dWhat Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch had to say: \u201cJeff has been an important partner during a transformational period. Our board and, ultimately, our shareholders, have benefited enormously from his many contributions.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la Merced\u2022 Nonresidential fixed investment \u2014 what businesses spend on equipment, software, buildings and intellectual property \u2014 increased at a solid 6.1 percent.\u2022 Business spending on equipment climbed 4.7 percent, down from 11.6 percent in the fourth quarter.Bigger pictureEconomists on Wall Street and in Washington have repeatedly warned that the economy\u2019s upward streak is unlikely to extend beyond the next year or two.Over the longer term, the Fed expects real annual growth in the United States to fall to 1.8 percent. The Congressional Budget Office\u2019s 10-year outlook comes to the same disappointing conclusion.The nation\u2019s debt has topped $21 trillion and is growing, a level many view as unsustainable. And if the Federal Reserve follows through on its plan to raise interest rates, the cost of paying off that debt will grow larger.\u2022 Hubris: Unlike rivals, Deutsche Bank didn\u2019t raise capital after the financial crisis, ultimately leaving it significantly weaker. By the end of last year, its tangible equity capital ratio was still below JPMorgan Chase in 2011. (Perhaps Germany\u2019s banking regulator should have applied more pressure, as Switzerland\u2019s did.)\u2022 Fear: Did Deutsche Bank\u2019s leaders worry about scaling back the investment bank because of its huge importance for revenue? (Last year, it provided 54 percent.) And about the cost of unwinding some trades?The news organization asserted that the complaints that led to Matt Lauer being ousted from the \u201cToday\u201d show were the first of their kind. Others disagree:What NBC News has done: Brought in a consultant for in-person sexual harassment prevention seminars and pledged to share the results of an internal review.The online video giant has largely avoided the political heat that has burned Facebook, but it has still lurched from crisis to crisis, particularly over upsetting videos.The idea is that someday humans will be able to train the machines, in a similar manner, to sniff out misinformation, smut, and abuse.Sure, there\u2019s logic to it, in the face of the threat from Netflix and Amazon. But as the two companies continue to bicker over price and executive chairs, is there another reason Shari Redstone is pushing the idea so hard, when other CBS shareholders seem uninterested?What seems to be driving Shari Redstone is familial score-settling, a quest for victory over her father, who never wanted her to have a role in either Viacom or CBS. \u201cIt\u2019s the story of a person who was mistreated by her father,\u201d said the source who recently noted Sumner\u2019s physical condition, and has known the father and daughter for an extensive period of time.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With a Glance Backward, Brooks Brothers Looks to the Future", "Date": "2018-04-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn early 2002, just a few months after he officially took over as the new owner and chief executive officer of Brooks Brothers, Claudio Del Vecchio confronted the reality that the classic American retailer had largely lost its way.Mr. Del Vecchio knew that many of the clothing fabrics were no longer of high quality, that too many of its shirts were ill fitting and that there were often disconcerting irregularities, like a rack of navy blazers that weren\u2019t the exact same shade of navy.And longtime customers had noticed.Among Mr. Del Vecchio\u2019s first acts as owner was to read a stack of angry letters from Brooks Brothers loyalists who griped about how the merchandise quality had fallen under the previous owner, the British retailer Marks & Spencer. They also balked at the limited selection of classic blazers and suits in the stores.Those letters confirmed much of what Mr. Del Vecchio, a wealthy Italian entrepreneur, had seen for himself and stiffened his resolve to return to the company\u2019s roots. \u201cI saw the business opportunity to increase sales,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew how to fix this.\u201dAmong the upgraded versions were luxurious three-ply Italian cashmere sweaters, replacing the two-ply Mexican cashmeres, and three styles of blazers and khakis, instead of just one. By April 2003, the store had completely overhauled its merchandise \u2014 and its loyal fans started coming back.By 2004, Mr. Del Vecchio said, the privately held Brooks Brothers was modestly in the black, reversing a series of money-losing years that had begun in the late 1990s.\u201cBrooks Brothers is a special place,\u201d Mr. Del Vecchio said during an interview in his upper-floor office at the 346 Madison Avenue store, where an antique grandfather clock owned by the store\u2019s founder, Henry Sands Brooks, stands across from his mahogany desk. \u201cThis is a great institution with a heritage.\u201dElegantly attired in a Brooks Brothers navy tweed sport coat, a white button-down shirt, a burgundy knit tie, slim gray slacks and brown oxfords, the chief executive spoke about what he saw as his mission.\u201cI am here to reinforce a culture,\u201d he said. \u201cI have to make sure that we are building a company that will last after me. I don\u2019t want to be here another 20 years. Forget about another 200 years. It\u2019s really about trying to build a culture that will last longer than the business. That will make it very hard for the next guy to screw it up.\u201dMr. Del Vecchio, like many other Italian men, first learned about Brooks Brothers through the stylish Fiat patriarch Gianni Agnelli, who started wearing Brooks Brothers original oxford shirts in the early 1960s. (He customized his shirts by leaving the collar points unbuttoned.) Generations of Italian men idolized the dashing Mr. Agnelli and copied what he wore.When Luxottica sent Mr. Del Vecchio to New York to run its North American operations in 1982, the young executive headed straight to Madison Avenue to buy his wardrobe at Brooks Brothers. Later, in 1992, he got to know the store\u2019s executives when he signed up Brooks Brothers to be Luxottica\u2019s first eyewear licensee in the United States.Over the next few years, however, he observed with increasing alarm how Brooks Brothers was abandoning its long tradition of being the standard-bearer of American business classics, one that came with its status as an outfitter of the nation\u2019s presidents. It has clothed nearly all of them, including Donald J. Trump for his 2017 inauguration.Under Marks & Spencer, which bought it in 1988, Brooks Brothers enthusiastically embraced the casual wear boom of the 1990s, as the store\u2019s merchants were told to copy the business-casual look of Banana Republic. (Staff members jokingly called their store \u201cBanana Brothers.\u201d)In the mid-1990s, the company\u2019s executives even eliminated the signature Golden Fleece logo from its cotton knit polo shirts, which Mr. Del Vecchio, as an influential supplier, says he was able to talk them into restoring, he said.After those frantic first years, when management worked on both quality and public perception, retail sales began to steadily improve. By 2017, Brooks Brothers had 244 wholly owned stores in the United States, up from roughly 160 in 2001; in both cases, half were factory outlets. It also had wholesale accounts with stores like Bloomingdale\u2019s, Lord & Taylor and Dillard\u2019s.Globally, Brooks Brothers had blossomed with sales in 50 other countries, accounting for 35 percent of its total revenue. That was up sharply from 2002, when it operated international stores only in Japan, still its biggest overseas market.Today, Brooks Brothers is typical of most retailers: Online sales now represent its largest percentage of revenue and is now the company\u2019s fastest-growing category. As more people have migrated to shop online, Brooks Brothers has provided more detailed product descriptions and has featured photos of people in lifestyle situations, as opposed to models in studios, which a company spokesman said had helped increase sales.Mr. Del Vecchio credits Brooks Brothers\u2019 27 airport shops, operated by a licensee, for helping win back businesspeople who had rejected Brooks Brothers in the 1990s. He calls the shops a \u201cgreat showcase\u201d for the brand. (In the 2009 movie \u201cUp in the Air,\u201d George Clooney\u2019s traveling businessman character lingers over a display of striped ties at a Brooks Brothers airport shop.)Dress shirts, now in about 1,000 varieties, have long been the calling card of Brooks Brothers, accounting for 30 percent of its sales. In a nod to contemporary trends and to buffed, young guys, the shirts come in four fits: the Traditional, the Madison, the Regent and, the slimmest, the Milano. (Mr. Browne, famous for his tightfitting men\u2019s suits, helped steer Brooks Brothers toward slimmer silhouettes, said Lou Amendola, the store\u2019s chief merchandising officer. \u201cToday over 50 percent of our business is now in slim shirts and slim suits,\u201d he said.)Charles Moore, founder and president of the Banc Funds, a private equity firm in Chicago, said he had stopped wearing Brooks Brothers dress shirts for several years because \u201cthe quality of the shirt fabric suffered and the collar wasn\u2019t fitting.\u201d He shifted to $200 custom shirts until a few years ago when he returned to Brooks Brothers, for its trim Regent silhouette, which was new to him.\u201cI like the fine Supima cotton and the way the shirts ride on your neck \u2014 the spread collar and the button-down collar,\u201d he said. For around $80, \u201cthey\u2019re great value for the money.\u201dDrawing hip, millennial shoppers inside America\u2019s oldest retailer isn\u2019t easy \u2014 even to check out novelties such as Brooks Brothers\u2019 latest machine-washable merino sweaters, designed without side seams, and its lightweight hooded outerwear, rivaling labels like Moncler and Canada Goose.\u201cWe have a level of technology and performance that they can\u2019t even dream about,\u201d Mr. Del Vecchio said. \u201cWe are authentic, and we have the stories. We just need to do a better job with social media and the influencers.\u201dStill a big believer in physical stores, Mr. Del Vecchio sees promise with Brooks Brothers\u2019 latest concept, Red Fleece boutiques, featuring midprice casual wear. Its popular Flatiron location recently added a downstairs cafe, now a hangout for the tech workers in the neighborhood.\u201cWe need to refine it to create synergies between the cafe and the boutique,\u201d Mr. Del Vecchio said.\u201cClaudio has been very disciplined and measured on how he has grown Brooks Brothers, focused on where the brand will go, upping the quality, not going for the quick sales and not opening too many stores,\u201d Mr. Burke said. \u201cHe\u2019s elevated Brooks Brothers without deviating from its heritage and tradition.\u201dMr. Del Vecchio said, \u201cI am naturally a long-term thinker, and I don\u2019t see the benefit of going public.\u201dThough much of Brooks Brothers\u2019 apparel is imported, including its best-selling no-iron shirts (made in Malaysia), Mr. Del Vecchio says he remains committed to producing many signature items at home, including its made-to-measure suits, in company-owned factories where he has invested in new machinery and in the training of workers.Its ties, for example, are manufactured at a factory in Long Island City, with a label embroidered with an American flag and the words \u201cBrooks Brothers. Proudly Made in New York United States of America.\u201d\u201cPart of the Brooks Brothers institution are its factories and what it means from a social standpoint to put things together,\u201d he said. \u201cNot every consumer can afford to buy \u2018Made in America.\u2019 But we have a brand that can justify that cost, and there are enough customers who understand this.\u201dMr. Del Vecchio said he knows that closing the Garland factory would erase the livelihoods of half the town, which has fewer than 1,000 inhabitants.\u201cMany of the decisions we make are with that in mind as well,\u201d he said. \u201cWe keep saying every year this is the year we aren\u2019t going to lose money, so that\u2019s the reason to keep trying to improve. But until the day I can\u2019t afford it, we won\u2019t close it.\u201dThe philanthropic-minded Mr. Del Vecchio began the practice of hiring English-language tutors to teach the immigrants who work at his factories. In Haverhill, the workers speak 30 languages, from countries including Afghanistan, Poland and Myanmar.\u201cWe don\u2019t hire illegal immigrants, but now there are the laws that stop immigrant refugees, which were a great source of skilled labor for our factories,\u201d he said.He and his wife, Debra, and members of his executive team visit each factory every Christmas season, donning blue aprons embroidered with \u201cBrooks Brothers\u201d to serve lunch to workers. Mr. D., as they call him, joins in to dance and to speak Italian and Spanish with the workers. He also gives out certificates for graduates of the English classes and awards for years of service.\u201cWhenever he walks into the factory, everybody claps,\u201d said Adriana Lucin, the production manager at the tie factory. \u201cHe\u2019s like a star. Everyone wants to take a selfie with Mr. D.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated where Brooks Brothers\u2019 made-to-measure suits are manufactured.

{"Headline": "Why BlackRock\u2019s Move to Disarm Some Funds Is Good Business", "Date": "2018-04-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsBlackRock may have found a simple solution to its gun dilemma. The fund manager, led by Laurence D. Fink, will offer new products allowing individuals and institutions to invest in market indexes without putting money into manufacturers and retailers of firearms. Coupled with a plan to engage public gunmakers and sellers directly, the decision moves Mr. Fink closer to fulfilling a promise that BlackRock\u2019s business benefit society alongside the bottom line.Because it has over $6 trillion of client money to invest, much of it in products that follow stock and bond market indexes, BlackRock is among the top owners of nearly every public company. That includes American Outdoor Brands, maker of the AR-15-style rifle used to murder 17 high school students and their teachers in Parkland, Fla., in February. And that put Mr. Fink, who has urged companies to serve a social purpose, in an uncomfortable position at a time of mass demonstrations and consumer boycotts over gun violence.On Thursday, his firm unveiled a range of index products that will enable investors to withhold their support for gunmakers and sellers. They include an exchange-traded fund that will track the performance of the MSCI USA Small Cap Extended ESG Focus Index, composed of small stocks with favorable environmental, social and governance standards, while specifically excluding producers and large retailers of civilian firearms. It will also offer a similar credit-focused E.T.F. that eschews the debt of gunmakers and distributors.Perhaps more significant, BlackRock will offer an option to take the guns out of institutional strategies tracking major market indexes, including the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500, the Russell 2000 and three others. The reason: Amid the debate over gun safety that the Parkland tragedy has unleashed, many pension funds and company 401(k) plans have been looking to disarm, largely in response to the demand of their own members.BlackRock\u2019s moves may spark criticism from gun-rights supporters, who lashed out at companies, like Delta Air Lines, that severed ties with the National Rifle Association. But it\u2019s hard to see how offering customers more choice is ever a bad idea. Moreover, by getting out early, BlackRock makes clear to those young people lobbying for tighter gun laws \u2014 who it hopes will be customers for decades to come \u2014 that it has something for them. Far from virtue signaling, it\u2019s simply good business.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Three Takeaways from Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Senate Testimony: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Good Tuesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s first Congressional hearing is here.\u2022 Sprint and T-Mobile have restarted merger talks.\u2022 Wall Street continues to wade into the gun control debate.\u2022 The raid on Michael Cohen\u2019s office and residence raises a number of issues.\u2022 The C.B.O. is still underestimating how bad the deficit is going to be.Congressional hearings focusing on corporate missteps often reveal little, in part because lawmakers lack the expertise and the executives taking questions are good at stone-walling.Still, Tuesday\u2019s hearing turned out to be a serious attempt to grapple with the growing influence of a powerful company that is entwined in the lives of millions of Americans.Lawmakers, it became clear, no longer see Facebook and other large tech companies as mostly benign forces for innovation. In his responses, Mr. Zuckerberg was competent but notably did not reveal much that was new about how Facebook will respond to its enormous challenges.On balance, the hearing probably leaves Facebook and its peers on the back foot in three important ways.A Senate with a Republican majority may be less likely to pass legislation, but if the Democrats gain control, top senators from that party might push for new laws ahead of a potential run in 2020. Some of the most penetrating questions on Tuesday came from Kamala Harris, Democrat of California, and Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey.The fact that Facebook\u2019s stock rose through the hearing should not be taken as a sign that the company is in the clear.\u2014 Peter EavisInvestors certainly liked Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony on Capitol Hill Tuesday.Facebook\u2019s shares rose 4.5 percent on the day. It was the strongest single-day performance for the stock since April 2016.After being down as much as 24 percent this year, Facebook is steadily clawing back ground. Tuesday\u2019s gain left it down only 11.4 percent in 2018.\u2014 Matt PhillipsAmong the dominant themes of the hearing, and the past few weeks, has been whether Facebook needs to be regulated. In fact, Mr. Zuckerberg said he open to Facebook being regulated during his first interview after the Cambridge Analytica scandal.But some lawmakers expressed skepticism toward regulation during the hearing. Senator Dan Sullivan, Republican of Alaska, raised an important point about the impact of regulation: That it often benefits the biggest companies, at the expense smaller firms and startups.Here\u2019s Senator Sullivan\u2019s question to Mr. Zuckerberg:\u201cRegulations can also cement the dominant power. Do you think that that\u2019s a risk, given your influence, that if we regulate we\u2019re actually going to regulate you into a position of cemented authority?\u201dIn other words, if the government decides to crack down on Facebook, could that end up holding back the next Facebook?That\u2019s the question that Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina hit on and its a sensitive one for Facebook.On Tuesday, Mr.Graham asked Mr. Zuckerberg to name Facebook\u2019s biggest competitor. Mr. Zuckerberg responded that Facebook has a lot of competitors.Mr. Graham asked: \u201cIs there an alternative to Facebook?\u201dMr. Zuckerberg: \u201cWell, we provide a number of diff...\u201dMr. Graham: \u201cYou don\u2019t think that you have a monopoly?\u201dMr. Zuckerberg: \u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t feel like that to me.\u201dThe gap in knowledge about how Facebook\u2019s business works was on display at times during Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony.The company has faced questions about the possibility of creating a paid service that would allow users to opt-out of sharing their data or seeing advertisements.Mr. Zuckerberg insisted on Tuesday that there would always be a free version of Facebook, so that anyone in the world can afford to be part of its online community.At that point, Sentor Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican, asked Mr. Zuckerberg how he could sustain a business without charging anything for it.\u201cSir, we run ads,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg explained.Mr. Hatch replied: \u201cI see.\u201d\u2014 Alan RappeportSenator John Thune of South Dakota, the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, called Facebook and its role in society \u201cextraordinary\u201d and began the hearing by explaining why Facebook is being singled out and why Mr. Zuckerberg was asked to appear alone.He said the Cambridge Analytica situation underscored how Facebook can be used for nefarious reasons, saying it appeared \u201cto be the result of people exploiting the tools you created to manipulate users\u2019 information.\u201dIn an indication that he may support legislation for internet companies, Mr. Thune said, \u201cIn the past, many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have been willing to defer to tech companies\u2019 efforts to regulate themselves. But this may be changing.\u201dSenator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, who chairs the Judiciary Committee, said the tech industry \u201chas a responsibility\u201d to protect its users and said \u201cthe status quo no longer works.\u201d\u2014 Cecilia KangMr. Zuckerberg is the only technology chief in the room, but it is clear that members of Congress are treating him as a stand-in for the entirety of Silicon Valley.Mr. Grassley called the entire tech industry to account, saying \u201cthe tech industry has an obligation to\u2026restore the public\u2019s trust.\u201d Mr. Nelson put it even more bluntly: \u201cIf you and other social media companies do not get your act in order, none of us are going to have any privacy.\u201dIn his opening statement, Mr. Zuckerberg, who is 33, made a point to remind Congress that he was young when this all began.\u201cI started Facebook when I was in college,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. This is a recurring theme for Mr. Zuckerberg\u2014in many recent interviews, he has referred to starting Facebook in his Harvard dorm room. And perhaps it\u2019s wise to keep bringing up the fact that Mr. Zuckerberg is much younger than most of the business executives who come before Congress.But the strategy could also backfire. After all, Mr. Zuckerberg is a long way from his dorm room\u2014on paper, he has been a billionaire for more than a decade\u2014and by reminding lawmakers of his youth, he could also lead them to question whether he\u2019s mature enough to handle such enormous responsibilities and whether Silicon Valley needs more adult supervision in the way of additional federal regulation.\u2014 Kevin Roose\u2022 Privacy, and whether 2 billion Facebook users can consider their data safe.\u2022 The F.T.C.\u2019s 2011 consent decree with the company, and whether it was violated in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. (Facebook says not.)More from the column:The problem is that Mr. Zuckerberg has been apologizing for years for all sorts of breaches of trust with his \u201ccommunity.\u201d And guess what? After each mea culpa, the Facebook community has grown.The bank works with \u201cjust a handful of manufacturers,\u201d with whom it has had \u201cintense conversations over the last few months,\u201d Ms. Finucane said. Their reactions to the new policy have been \u201cmixed,\u201d she said.\u2014 Tiffany HsuLet\u2019s recap the tortured history of the telecom merger that hasn\u2019t quite been able to cross the finish line (which I\u2019ve covered multiple times over the years):But there\u2019s little surprise that the companies wouldn\u2019t give up on a deal. Mr. Son pursued Sprint in the first place with the idea of merging it with T-Mobile, creating a stronger competitor to Verizon and AT&T.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedOnce that determination is made, Mr. Cohen can argue that privileged materials should be returned because they are protected.Despite President Trump\u2019s tweet that \u201cthe attorney-client privilege is dead,\u201d the protection remains in place. But there is an important way around the privilege that the Justice Department may pursue. Under a doctrine called the crime-fraud exception, communications between a client and lawyer designed to assist the client to engage in a pending or future crime are not protected by the privilege.This is a slow process, likely to drag out for months. But don\u2019t be surprised to see the Justice Department claiming that communications with Mr. Cohen were made for a criminal or fraudulent purpose \u2013 whatever that might be.\u2014 Peter J. Henning(For non-lawyers: Mr. Conway\u2019s link points to the Justice Department\u2019s policies for conducting searches of lawyers.)Goldman Sachs economists point out that the C.B.O.\u2019s projections only extrapolate discretionary spending increases through 2019 fiscal year, whereas the bank\u2019s analysis points to more spending through 2021 fiscal year, raising the Goldman\u2019s deficit projections higher.Elsewhere, Jefferies economists noted that the analysis from the C.B.O. doesn\u2019t take into account the Federal Reserve\u2019s gradual reduction of the amount of government bonds it is holding, which means that the Treasury has to replace the Fed as a buyer.All else equal, the disappearance of a buyer like the Fed \u2014 which can create as much money as it needs \u2014 along with surging supply of Treasury borrowing needed to cover deepening deficits should add up one thing: Sharply higher interest rates.\u2014 Matt Phillips\u2022 \u201cSome of Novogratz\u2019s fellow hedge funders have questioned his grasp of the finer details of his trading strategies. \u2018He acts like a visionary, but at heart he\u2019s still a salesman,\u2019 one manager told me.\u201d\u2022 Novogratz is said to consider himself \u201chalfway between center-left and progressive,\u201d and \u201cDuring my lunch with him at the Mercer Kitchen, he told me, \u2018I\u2019ve always said I\u2019d run for office if I had a five-year period in my life where really I felt, like, Hey, my behavior is laudable.\u2019\u201dPublic negotiations between the corporate siblings have intensified. Viacom\u2019s counterproposal \u2014 0.68 of a CBS share for every Viacom share, or $14.7 billion; CBS had offered 0.55, or $11.9 billion \u2014 is likely to be rejected.Price may be less of a sticking point, however, than CBS\u2019s insistence on keeping its chief operating officer, Joe Ianniello, in the No. 2 spot after a merger. That\u2019s the job Viacom wants for its C.E.O., Bob Bakish. Michael has heard that this is a serious disagreement, with little movement toward a compromise as yet.\u2022 Canvas Ventures and Kirsten Green\u2019s Forerunner Ventures tied for first place on The Information\u2019s V.C. Diversity Index. Tied for last: Tiger Global Management and Slow Ventures.\u2022 The number of women in senior positions at U.S. venture firms rose to 14.2 percent last year, from 10.7 percent.

{"Headline": "Divides Over Trade Scramble Midterm Election Messaging", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump\u2019s trade policies enjoy the strong backing of his supporters but are less popular among independents, moderate Republicans and others whose votes could decide control of Congress in the midterm election this fall. That could complicate Republicans\u2019 plans to make their economic record a central argument in their case for re-election.Jeffrey Campbell, a 49-year-old lawyer in Minneapolis, said he liked the tax bill that Republicans passed late last year, and he gave Mr. Trump credit for moving to reduce regulation. But he opposes Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs, saying they will benefit a few favored industries while hurting the economy over all.\u201cA few people benefit from the protection,\u201d Mr. Campbell said. \u201cBut when prices rise as a result, the net effect, I think, is harmful to the economy.\u201dMinnesota is a key political battleground this year, with several competitive House seats and two Senate elections because of the resignation of Al Franken after a sexual-misconduct scandal last year. Mr. Campbell said that he was still likely to support Republican candidates, but that he was frustrated by the party\u2019s shift toward protectionism and support for increased government spending.\u201cI blame Republicans for that,\u201d Mr. Campbell said. \u201cA very significant portion of Republicans in Congress are not really conservative when it comes to spending.\u201dThe re-emergence of trade as a central political issue has scrambled traditional partisan alignments in ways that carry risks for both parties. Mr. Trump won the presidency partly by tapping into voters\u2019 concerns about the impact of globalization on jobs and wages, particularly in the industrial Midwest.Reflecting those tensions, congressional Republican leaders have criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs as potentially harmful to businesses and consumers while also praising the president\u2019s broader goals on trade.Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, opened a hearing on the effects of tariffs on the economy last week by saying the measures \u201ccurtail economic growth, discourage new investment, delay new hiring, and put American workers at a huge disadvantage to foreign competitors.\u201dBut he added, \u201cI remain committed to working with President Trump and the White House on strong, enforceable trade policies that will target bad actors and encourage economic growth here at home.\u201dDemocrats face their own challenges on the issue. As Republicans have shifted away from supporting free-trade agreements, Democrats have embraced them: In the Times poll, 73 percent of Democrats said they thought free-trade agreements helped the United States, compared with 51 percent of Republicans. But union members, long a key source of mobilization and support for Democrats, retain the party\u2019s longtime skepticism of free trade.\u201cIt\u2019s not an ideal issue for either party,\u201d said Robert J. Blendon, who directs the Harvard Opinion Research Program at the Harvard School of Public Health. \u201cIt makes the issue slightly more complex because their voters\u2019 views don\u2019t correspond to their interest groups.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re starting to certainly complicate the message,\u201d said Jon Cohen, chief research officer for SurveyMonkey.\u201cIt\u2019s possible the war of words over trade, tariffs and sanctions, and the financial market turmoil we had has led to some setback in consumer confidence,\u201d said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank.Ethan Brackenbury, a cost estimator for the federal Department of Energy in southeastern Washington State, said that he didn\u2019t like the idea of a trade war, and that he hadn\u2019t noticed any gain from the tax cut in his paycheck. But the economy seems strong in his area, he said, and he views any declines in the stock market as an opportunity to buy, not a signal to sell.\u201cI\u2019m certainly not worried, nor am I excited,\u201d Mr. Brackenbury said. \u201cI don\u2019t see long lines of unemployment or those kinds of things. Everyone seems to be gainfully employed.\u201dThe data in this article came from an online survey of 10,533 adults conducted by the polling firm SurveyMonkey from April 2 to April 8.

{"Headline": "Goldman\u2019s Gains in Trading Raise a Familiar Dilemma: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Tuesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 A \u2018Geneva Convention\u2019 for cyberwar?\u2022 Did Goldman\u2019s trading business perform too well?\u2022 The U.S.-China fight has pushed deeper into tech.Goldman Sachs\u2019s strong first-quarter earnings raise a familiar dilemma for the bank.The results got a significant fillip from trading, a business Goldman must do well in, but not so well that investors think the bank is too dependent on it. And a breakdown of first-quarter revenue shows the dominance of trading. Revenue from trading in stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities and derivatives totaled $4.39 billion during the first three months of the year. That works out at 44 percent of total revenue, well above the 37 percent share that trading had in 2017.Stock and bond markets are unpredictable, even in relatively good times, so the helpful trading conditions this quarter may not last. What can Goldman\u2019s senior executives do to persuade investors that the bank is a lot more than a trading shop? They can point to the fact that David M. Solomon is in line to succeed Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman\u2019s current C.E.O. Mr. Solomon ascent took place in the bank\u2019s powerful investment banking division, not its trading operations.Goldman\u2019s leaders can continue to talk about the steps the bank is taking to widen its client base and diversify into other businesses that might have more stable revenue, like its relatively new consumer lending operations. But such businesses are going to take time to make a meaningful contribution.And it\u2019s important to remember that other major businesses at Goldman are also volatile. Investing and lending, which mostly involves making longer-term investments in companies, and whose revenue can be unpredictable, made up 21 percent of total revenue in the first quarter, the second largest contribution.Despite the bumper results in trading along with investing and lending, Goldman\u2019s shares slid slightly on Tuesday, suggesting investors are waiting on longer-term trends than one quarter\u2019s results.But the volatility of revenue is not the only reason investors are often skeptical about Wall Street firms. The huge amounts that they pay out in compensation is also a concern. When revenue rises, so does pay. As a result, money that could have fallen to the bottom line at other types of companies instead gets paid out to traders and bankers. Compensation at Goldman Sachs made up 45 percent of non-interest revenue in the first quarter, up from 44 percent the first quarter of 2017.\u2014 Peter EavisHere are the numbers:The move comes amid an outcry prompted by the arrests of two African-American men at a Starbucks location in Philadelphia last week.The two men were arrested after asking to use the restroom in the shop. An employee refused their request, because the men had not bought anything, according to officials. The men sat down and were asked to leave, and an employee eventually called the police. The prosecutor\u2019s office in Philadelphia reviewed the case and declined to pursue charges against the men because of \u201ca lack of evidence that a crime was committed,\u201d according to a spokesman.Some may be optimistic that the $1.5 trillion tax cut will extend the business cycle.The strategists at Morgan Stanley are not among them.\u201cWhile there\u2019s a fair amount of debate about how much this fiscal expansion extended the economic cycle, for markets our analysis suggests we\u2019re closer to the end of the day than the beginning. Hence, there\u2019s less reason to behave like it\u2019s \u2018morning in America\u2019 than \u2018happy hour in America.\u2019\u201dKey points\u2022 Morgan Stanley argues that while the tax cuts will help lift growth in the near term, its benefits are already priced into the markets.\u2022 The new tax law creates economic cliffs, as many key provisions in the law are not permanent and end in just a few years.\u2022 The tax cuts may make it more difficult for the government to turn to fiscal stimulus to fight the next downturn.In conclusion\u201cWhile this policy supports growth in the near term, it may worsen the next downturn while limiting the fiscal reaction to it. Even if those concerns are unfounded, we think much of fiscal stimulus\u2019 \u2018good news\u2019 is already in the price of key markets.\u201dThe streaming video company added 7.41 million subscribers during the first quarter. Its profit jumped 62 percent, and sales grew 40 percent.Netflix also said it plans to spend $10 billion on content and marketing this year.Shares are up 8.6 percent Tuesday and 75 percent this year. That easily beats the S.&P. 500, which has gained just 0.2 percent this year. It also tops the performance of its fellow FANG stocks. Facebook is off 4.5 percent this year, Google-parent Alphabet is up about 3 percent, and Amazon has risen 28 percent.Stephen Ju, an analyst over at Credit Suisse, writes in a note titled \u201cGetting Closer and Closer to Achieving Escape Velocity\u201d:\u201cNetflix continues to reap the benefits of its programming win streak, as it wields its large content acquisition budget as a weapon to put greater distance between itself and its competitors (especially as Disney prepares to exit the platform). And we find it hard to argue with the accelerated pace of subscriber additions as the conceptual proof of its capital allocation decision, and we also expect the Street to continue to underwrite the investments.\u201dTwitter is having an even better day.The stock is up 87 percent over that period.The NYT\u2019s David Sanger says the impetus came largely from Microsoft\u2019s president, Brad Smith, \u201cwho has been arguing for several years that the world needs a \u2018digital Geneva Convention\u2019 that sets norms of behavior for cyberspace just as the Geneva Conventions set rules for the conduct of war in the physical world.\u201dAlso striking: Who hasn\u2019t yet signed, including Google, Apple and Amazon.More from Michael:Ms. Massenet and Mr. Brown are counting on Ms. Massenet\u2019s Net-a-Porter experience and contacts to help Imaginary Ventures stand out. The firm has already invested in companies like Glossier and Everlane, an upstart clothing brand.Mr. Ballmer said of the latest report, \u201cPublic companies owe this level of transparency to shareholders; I think citizens, as America\u2019s shareholders, deserve the same.\u201dAs more financial firms move to pressure gun makers and sellers into self-regulation, the advocacy group (backed by Mike Bloomberg) plans to ask them to press for more policy positions and operational changes.Among them: Requiring background checks for all gun sales; more funding for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; having gun makers require sellers to adopt a code of conduct; and adopting smart-gun tech.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Criticizes OPEC, Calling Oil Prices \u2018Artificially\u2019 High", "Date": "2018-04-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries makes an easy scapegoat for American politicians. It has been a target of derision by American leaders since the Arab oil embargo of 1973 caused long lines at the pump and badly damaged the economy.But OPEC doesn\u2019t have the same influence it once did, given soaring production in the United States, Canada and a few other countries. Now it is just one factor in lifting prices, which are being affected by everything from geopolitics to the growing demand for gasoline and diesel fuel.Mr. Trump could have been referring to OPEC\u2019s cutback in exports to increase prices. Saudi Arabia and other oil producers in the region have also made an alliance of convenience with Russia, a non-OPEC member heavily dependent on oil revenues to finance its government. Together they have restrained production since 2016, reducing global stockpiles.\u201cPrices are high,\u201d said Rob West, an analyst at Redburn, a London research firm. Noting that Mr. Trump may have a point, he added, \u201cI do see some artificiality in the prices we see today.\u201dOPEC and non-OPEC producers gathered Friday in the Saudi city of Jidda in an effort to continue the policy even as the price of Brent crude, the global benchmark, has climbed above $70.Not long ago, as prices plummeted from over $100 a barrel in 2014 to below $30 in early 2016, inventories were so high that tankers were needed to hold excess supplies. Now, even as United States oil production continues to grow, worldwide inventories are declining, increasing the pressure on prices. The International Energy Agency reported that global oil supply eased by 120,000 barrels a day in March.The price of crude is the major reason American drivers are paying more at the pump as the summer driving season approaches. The average price for a gallon of regular gasoline on Friday was $2.75 a gallon, according to AAA, up 19 cents over the last month and 33 cents from a year ago. It is the highest level since the summer of 2015.The increase has been particularly noticeable over the last week, with prices in some states rising more than a penny a gallon every day.Americans consume roughly 400 million gallons of gasoline a day, so the 33-cent increase over the last year means roughly $132 million less every day in consumer pockets. Working-class Americans, who usually drive older, less fuel-efficient cars and spend a higher percentage of their income on fuel, are disproportionately affected.\u201cThis hurts the pocketbooks of typical Trump voters in swing states who live paycheck to paycheck,\u201d said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service. He predicted gas prices would continue to increase modestly, probably rising above $2.80 a gallon in the coming weeks.Deutsche Bank analysts warned this week that the rise in gas prices was beginning to cut into the disposable-income gains from the tax cuts Mr. Trump signed into law late last year.Much of the recent price increase is a result of world tensions \u2014 some related to Mr. Trump\u2019s policies \u2014 that have bolstered investor expectations that oil prices could rise even higher.Oil production is plummeting in Venezuela, the country with the largest reserves, and the expectation of stepped-up American sanctions in the coming months could reduce its exports further. The threat that the United States could pull out of the nuclear deal with Iran has put the size of future Iranian exports in doubt.A doubling of American oil production in recent years, producing growing exports and a decline in imports, has helped stabilize the oil market and kept big price rises in check. But United States output represents only a bit more than 10 percent of the 98 million barrels a day produced worldwide, and there are limits to its growth.A shortage of oil and natural-gas pipelines in Texas could slow output over the next two years. In addition, American refineries, generally designed for heavier crudes, are reaching a saturation point for lighter shale oil produced around Texas and North Dakota.Still, there is no doubt that the orchestrated output curbs led by major producers have had an effect. It is not clear whether the agreement will be extended beyond the end of the year, but the Saudis appear to favor doing so.An earlier version of this article misstated, in one instance, a recent increase in gasoline prices. They have risen 33 cents in the last year, not the last month.Stanley Reed and Prashant S. Rao contributed reporting from London, and Jim Tankersley from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Redstones\u2019 Voting Power Leaves Moonves and CBS Few Options: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Friday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Lending in the first quarter is set to disappoint.\u2022 JPMorgan reported record revenue and profit.\u2022 Why is President Trump considering rejoining the TPP?\u2022 What the U.S.P.S. inquiry means for Amazon.Chief executives with Mr. Moonves\u2019s record don\u2019t often find themselves in this position, but he is there because of CBS and Viacom\u2019s unique corporate governance structure: namely, the super-voting powers of the Redstone family\u2019s vehicle, National Amusements.Let\u2019s recap the kind of power that National Amusements has over the corporate siblings, thanks to its dual classes of stock:\u2022 Despite owning just over 10 percent of the outstanding shares at CBS and just under 10 percent at Viacom, the Redstones have about 80 percent of the voting power at both companies.\u2022 With that kind of power, National Amusements could replace the board at either company at any point in time.It is that power that allows Shari Redstone to compel CBS and Viacom to explore a merger for the second time.CBS said in a statement Wednesday: \u201cThe industry and the marketplace know Leslie Moonves\u2019 record and we think it speaks for itself.\u201d Viacom declined to comment.Thanks to the dual-class stock structure \u2014 something CBS and Viacom share with the likes of Facebook, Alphabet and The New York Times Company \u2014 there\u2019s little that regular shareholders, or management of either company, can do.Legal experts say that National Amusements has fiduciary duties to shareholders of each company, but that the Redstones unquestionably have the power to replace board members.\u201cYou can stack the board,\u201d said John Coffee of Columbia Law School, though he added that \u201cit might be poor form to stuff the board\u201d before pushing through a merger or C.E.O. change.Charles Elson, director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware, said that companies controlled by a dual-class structure can sometimes opt for other shareholders to have a voice. But that isn\u2019t a requirement.Professor Elson said that Ms. Redstone has the ability to force through a deal or a board change. But, he added, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t mean that these things go without litigation.\u201d\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedTax cuts, bank deregulation and a recovering global economy were expected to unleash a surge of bank lending that could stoke an even stronger expansion. But lending in the first quarter is set to disappoint, at least going by the results of the four big banks that reported Friday.JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and PNC Financial had a combined $2.78 trillion of loans at the end of the first quarter, up 3 percent from $2.7 billion at the end of the same period a year ago. How does that growth rate stack up? It\u2019s more or less in line with the 2.9 percent increase in loans the banks notched up last year, but it is well below the 4.6 percent and the 4.4 percent rates that they together achieved in 2016 and 2015.Each quarter, much attention is paid to the performance of the big banks\u2019 Wall Street operations. But activities like trading are only remotely related to the real economy. As a result, to assess whether banks are assisting the wider economy, it makes more sense to look at trends in their lending, which directly finances consumer spending, home purchases and corporate investments.Investors may have been disappointed at the first-quarter lending numbers. Despite the four banks\u2019 strong profits, their stock prices on Friday slid.The unexceptional first-quarter loan growth may, of course, give way to bigger increases later this year as confidence builds. And beneath the aggregated loan totals are some numbers that suggest things could improve. Citigroup\u2019s loans grew 7.1 percent in the first quarter, compared with the year-ago period. The increase was driven by a 13 percent surge in corporate lending, much of which took place in Europe and Asia. And the first-quarter total for the four banks was held back by a 1.1 percent decline at Wells Fargo, which is operating under a strict regulatory edict.\u2014 Peter Eavis\u201cWe\u2019ve got a deal\u201d already, said Steven Ciobo, Australia\u2019s trade minister, who added, \u201cI can\u2019t see that all being thrown open to appease the United States.\u201dShares of the biggest banks are faring worse than the broader stock indexes.The KBW Bank Index, made up of 24 of the largest banks, is off nearly 1 percent while the S.&P. 500 is essentially flat in early trading.JPMorgan was down 1.1 percent, Citigroup was off 1.5 percent, and Wells Fargo fell 2.3 percent.The declines come despite JPMorgan announcing record profits and Citi reporting its highest earnings since 2015.Following widespread missteps at the bank, the Fed in February told Wells Fargo that, until sufficient improvements were made, it could not increase the amount of assets it holds. Some analysts said the cap need not stop the bank from making more loans, because it could sell securities and then use that money to do more lending. But loans did not grow in the first quarter. At the end of March, Wells Fargo had $947 billion of loans, down from $958 billion a year earlier, and also down from $957 billion at the end of 2017.But the decline is not large, and it\u2019s not clear how much the Fed\u2019s cap is to blame. Wells Fargo\u2019s loans had not been growing strongly in recent quarters.And here are Wells Fargo\u2019s numbers:\u2022 Wells Fargo\u2019s profit rose to $5.94 billion.\u2022 Earnings per share came in at $1.12 a share. Analysts had expected earnings of $1.06 a share, according to Thomson Reuters.\u2022 Revenues fell to $21.9 billion from $22.3 billion in the first-quarter 2017.\u2022 Costs rose 3% to $14.24 billion from $13.79 billion a year ago.\u2014 Peter EavisJPMorgan reported record revenue and profit for the first three months of this year.Here are the numbers:\u2022 The bank reported earnings of $8.71 billion, up 35 percent from a year ago.\u2022 That comes to $2.37 a share. Analysts had expected earnings of $2.28 a share, according to Thomson Reuters.\u2022 Revenue increased to $28.5 billion, up 10 percent.\u2022 Return on equity, a measure of profitability, hit 15 percent, up from 11 percent a year ago.\u2022 Trading revenues rose to $6.57 billion, up 13 percent from the first quarter of 2017.\u2022 Equities trading revenue rose 26 percent to $2.02 billion.\u2022 Bond-trading revenue rose 8 percent to $4.55 billion.\u2022 Earnings rose to $4.6 billion, up from $4.1 billion a year ago.\u2022 Earnings per share came in at $1.68. Analysts expected $1.61 a share, according to Thomson Reuters.\u2022 Revenue increased to $18.9 billion for the quarter, up 3% from a year earlier.\u2022 Revenue from fixed-income trading fell 7 percent to $3.4 billion.\u2022 Equity trading revenue jumped 38% to $1.1 billion.\u2022 Fees from investment banking fell 10 percent to $1.1 billion.One way to gauge the crosswinds blowing through financial markets and the global economy is by examining the results of JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo, which report their first-quarter earnings today.\u2022 Are trade tensions reducing demand for credit?\u2022 How concerned should we be with the volatility in the stock and bond markets?\u2022 Are regular Americans borrowing more, potentially boosting the U.S. economy?\u2022 How much will deregulation help the banks?\u201cI, maybe a bit na\u00efvely, believed that there was a need for someone in high elected office to be more open-minded and willing to not only govern from the middle but to try to shame everyone else into going to the middle.\u201dAlas, his company agreed to buy most of 21st Century Fox for $52.4 billion, and that was that.One intriguing possibility: Elliott pushing to be involved in a sale of some or all of the business through its private equity team, Evergreen Coast Capital.The deals flyaroundAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Quirks and Gossip in a Corporate Cellphone Branch", "Date": "2018-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn a recent Friday afternoon at an AT&T store in Park Slope, the scene was chaotic. A customer holding a bicycle helmet lingered over the iPhones, browsing; a sixtysomething man knelt on the floor, taking a selfie with a German pinscher named Polo; and a young Orthodox man wrapped a customer in tefillin, traditional Jewish prayer straps, while reading him prayers to repeat. \u201cI get an iPhone, and I get tefillin,\u201d said the customer, Harvey Rossel, a chiropractor and longtime local.Ari Kirtchuk, 55, the store\u2019s owner, took in the action from behind his counter. \u201cThey\u2019re monsters from Crown Heights,\u201d he said, \u201cfrom the Lubavitch cartel.\u201d A wave of laughter passed through the store.Many lament the mallification of New York City, with banks, chain restaurants and anonymous cellphone shops rapidly replacing the beloved mom-and-pops of generations past. But for some ineffable reason, there are certain chain stores that contain the warmth, diversity and conversation once associated with Greek diners or soda fountains. The AT&T \u201cauthorized retailer\u201d owned by Mr. Kirtchuk, near the corner of Union Street and Seventh Avenue, is one. At any moment, only about half of the people inside are there for cellphone problems. The others come to talk. Perhaps it\u2019s the two soft black chairs by the front window that encourage conversation, or the frequent presence of Polo, Mr. Kirtchuk\u2019s son\u2019s dog. Or perhaps it is the unique energy of Mr. Kirtchuk, who seems to value jokes, long stories and political debate as much as sales commissions.Elegant and handsome, with a lanky physique that resembles his hero Larry David\u2019s, he has a thin smile, carved cheekbones and a deadpan demeanor. On a given day, he helps seniors, delivery men, teenagers, caregivers, the homeless, celebrity locals such as the actor Peter Sarsgaard and the novelist Nicole Krauss, as well as the brownstone bourgeoisie. Though he has one full-time employee, John Rossello, 27, Mr. Kirtchuk himself comes in six days a week and often seven. \u201cThe reason they come here is because they know me and they need some company,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big city with a lot of lonely people.\u201dIn his Israeli accent, Mr. Kirtchuk likes to insert \u201cAnd?\u201d as someone is telling him a story, to cue them for the next detail. His signature phrase is, \u201cGimme a second,\u201d and he greets all customers, new and old, with \u201cHow ya doing.\u201dMichael Carr, a 65-year-old handyman, wandered in and sat on a stool near the service desk. He was there only to talk. \u201cAri\u2019s got respect for the older heads,\u201d he said in an accent part Dutch and part West Indian. \u201cHe\u2019ll tell them: \u2018This phone is not for you. You can\u2019t handle it at this age.\u2019\u201dThe store phone rang. \u201cAT&T,\u201d said Mr. Kirtchuk. \u201cYes, yes, you can bring it over. The SIM card is $10. But do you need internet? For an additional $10 you get 1G of data.\u201dHe hung up. \u201cPeople are used to a 1-2-3 situation. When they get extra service, they\u2019re surprised. I\u2019m not a diamond but I look like a diamond because of my competition.\u201dThere are two other AT&T retailers within a mile of his, one part of a large chain and the other owned by an individual. (There are also several other cellphone franchises in proximity.) Mr. Kirtchuk explained that authorized retailers are independent contractors that compete with one another, unlike, say, two branches of one clothing chain. They make commissions on each new activation or upgrade, based on the value of the transaction. The commission on a new activation is higher than that on a phone upgrade. \u201cThe AT&T competition I can control with my customer service,\u201d said he said. \u201cCompetition with Verizon is not under my control.\u201d (AT&T did not respond to requests for comment on this article.)Born in Argentina, Mr. Kirtchuk moved to Israel with his family when he was 3. He arrived in the United States in the late 1980s, when he was in his early 20s. He thought he would work, save some money, and return to Israel to study. He got a job in a clothing store in the South Bronx, and in 1988 he met the woman who would become his wife. They married, had two sons, and moved to Richmond Hill, Queens. A few years later Mr. Kirtchuk dropped his plans to return to Israel.A job in an electronics store led him to open his own business selling and servicing pagers in 1990, and as technology changed, he opened a series of cellphone dealerships. Soon he owned four in Queens. \u201cI was looking for stores all the time,\u201d he said recently. \u201cI thought I could grab the world.\u201dOne day in 2003 he was driving down Seventh Avenue in Park Slope, looking for future locations. \u201cI thought to myself, \u2018Nice area,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cI went to the landlord, and half an hour later I signed the lease.\u201d After his divorce, he closed all his Queens stores within a few years and installed himself full-time in Park Slope. Even today, he said, several former Richmond Hill customers travel nearly nine miles to see him.On a different weekday he was aiding a married couple, Arta Ukha, 32, and her husband, Ari Nikci, 37, who had come in for new phones. Mr. Kirtchuk\u2019s mind was on the stock market. \u201cIf the stocks are down two days in a row,\u201d he said, \u201cmaybe Wall Street knows something we don\u2019t. Maybe Trump is on his way out.\u201dMr. Rossello was on the store phone. \u201cI can\u2019t understand what you\u2019re saying,\u201d he told the caller.A discussion ensued on different accents. Ms. Ukha, originally from Kosovo, explained the challenges of helping her parents set up a smartphone. \u201cIn Albania the words are pronounced the way they\u2019re written,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to tell my parents, \u2018Press DO-neh\u2019 instead of \u2018DONE.\u2019\u201dA pizza delivery man came in and handed Mr. Kirtchuk his phone, leaving within a few minutes. \u201cHe just needed to wipe it,\u201d Mr. Kirtchuk explained. \u201cHe lost his password.\u201d He was philosophical about life as an authorized retailer. \u201cIf you take care of your customers, you\u2019re going to make a few dollars out of it. The money will follow. I represent a big corporation, but they allow me to work in an old-fashioned way, to find a balance between making them happy and doing what I want.\u201dWhat about the unpleasant customers? \u201cI recognize them right away,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll try to encourage them to go to my competition.\u201dHe often learns about people\u2019s problems as he helps them with their phones. Several months ago a regular, close to tears, came in and asked to pull up her husband\u2019s text messages for her. \u201cShe said, \u2018I think he has something going on,\u2019\u201d Mr. Kirtchuk recalled. \u201cI told her, \u2018First of all, I can\u2019t do that, and even if I could, I wouldn\u2019t.\u2019 I told her to wait 24 hours and cool down to think about it. Maybe she was jumping to conclusions.\u201dLater on the hectic Friday of the Jewish prayer ritual, the door burst open and Yanki Reichman, 56, who wore a prayer shawl beneath a TrueValue Hardware hoodie, went to Mr. Kirtchuk, joking with him in Hebrew. He stops in the store on his trips to the bank, often bringing Jewish delicacies from Crown Heights.The chiropractor, Mr. Rossel, who had come in to buy his first smartphone, waited for it to be activated. \u201cPhones bring people into the store,\u201d he observed. \u201cBecause they are a capitalistic pursuit they require updates. Since Ari put those chairs here there\u2019s always people sitting in them. This is the new barbershop.\u201d\u201cAT&T is a franchise that swallowed all the smaller ones,\u201d said Mr. Reichman, \u201cbut without Ari, people would get lost. He spends hours and hours trying to help them and he doesn\u2019t get paid for it.\u201dMr. Rossello, the full-time employee, asked Mr. Rossel a series of security questions as he set up the device, like his mother\u2019s maiden name or the city he was born in. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have it ask your dream job?\u201d Mr. Kirtchuk interrupted. \u201cBelly dancer? My dream job was always to be a belly dancer.\u201dA tall young man with broad shoulders came in. He carried a gym bag and lingered near the door. \u201cIt\u2019s your lucky day, Ari,\u201d he said in a strong Southern accent. \u201cI have a hundred dollars in here.\u201d\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you bring me a thousand?\u201d Mr. Kirtchuk asked.The man was Jonathan Jones, 33, a clothing designer, author and investor who works at the Whole Foods in Gowanus. He moved to New York from Vicksburg, Miss., six months ago and met Mr. Kirtchuk after coming into the store offering his web-building services. They became friendly.A woman who resembled Laurie Anderson, with a distraught face under her parka hood, came in and announced dramatically, \u201cI lost my phone.\u201d\u201cYou have insurance?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cAll right,\u201d Mr. Kirtchuk said. \u201cGimme a second.\u201d They spoke quietly. After typing her number into the computer he determined that she did, in fact, have insurance. She left, and returned 10 minutes with two cups of coffee, one for Mr. Kirtchuk. \u201cGood coffee,\u201d he said.They approached a display phone together, and an intense, guitar-heavy folk song emanated from the store speakers. It turned out to be a music video by her husband, also a customer. Mr. Kirtchuk complimented the music while he helped her set up a new phone, which would arrive in the mail. (Days later she would find her lost phone.)As afternoon turned to evening, a redheaded young woman came in and told Mr. Rossello she was a Verizon customer, asking him detailed questions about AT&T plans, including the number of gigabytes and international-calling details. Mr. Kirtchuk approached her and said she could switch, explaining how much she would save on a similar AT&T plan and handing her a business card. It seemed uncharacteristically aggressive; he prefers a soft sell. She said she would think about it. \u201cWhen you\u2019re ready,\u201d Mr. Kirtchuk said.She paused to pet Polo, remarking on his calm demeanor. After the door closed behind her Mr. Kirtchuk said, \u201cI think she was a secret shopper, sent by AT&T to check on things.\u201d When asked why he said, \u201cShe knew too much.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Trade War Will Test Corporate America\u2019s Openness: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Friday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Investors should get ready to feel \u201ca little pain.\u201d\u2022 Is the inflation scare over?\u2022 Hiring slowed in March.\u2022 The U.S.-China trade fight is getting hotter.\u2022 The Treasury Department sanctioned Russian mogul Oleg Deripaska.President Trump has supported combative trade policies for years, and in recent months, his administration has begun to pursue them. The actions have weighed on the stock prices of large international corporations, and if implemented, could hurt their bottom lines.But global companies mostly have not detailed the potential impact of Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policies. Will that now change? With first-quarter earnings imminent, and tensions with China escalating, shareholders may want companies to make specific disclosures. The companies may be tempted to say little. After all, Mr. Trump\u2019s trade restrictions have merely been threatened, and may not occur if deals are struck. But in the past, companies have refreshed their outlooks in the face of circumstantial economic and geopolitical events, like the Gulf War. And investors will likely press firms to estimate the impact of a trade war and describe the measures they will take to protect their businesses.Still, the prospect of a trade war raises questions about the adequacy of corporate disclosure. Those of G.M., contained in its latest annual report, seem quite detailed. They offer quite specific warnings about the risks of doing business in China, and the company even mentions the possibility of trade agreements falling apart. But financial reports from Boeing and Apple arguably have less on potential problems in China and trade disputes.Boeing\u2019s annual report did mention tariffs and embargoes as threats. But the report, released in February, also sounded a bullish note on the global economy that now almost sounds like it was from a different era:\u201cThe long-term outlook for the industry continues to remain positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel growth: economic growth and the increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization, and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries.\u201dWill such language remain in Boeing\u2019s reports?- Peter EavisFor years, investors had a singular focus on the Federal Reserve and its plans to raise rates.Any indication that the Fed could move more aggressively than expected to tighten monetary policies and stocks would pull back.Now the Fed has company in sending jitters through the market: Trade.A one-two punch from the White House and the Fed pushed stocks on Wall Street down Friday. The S.&P. 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average both finished off more than 2 percent.Markets began to slide at the start of trading after President Trump\u2019s threat on Thursday to heap fresh tariffs on China. Investors took little comfort in statements from the administration\u2019s top economic policymakers, Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary. Both men sought to tamp down the contentious back-and-forth between the two economic giants.Comments from Mr. Powell in the early Friday afternoon added to the unease. In a speech in Chicago, Mr. Powell highlighted the strength of the United States economic recovery and gave little indication that the Fed planned to deviate from its gradual path of lifting interest rates.On WABC Radio\u2019s \u201cBernie & Sid in the Morning\u201d show, Mr. Trump said:\u201cNow we could\u2014the easiest thing for me to do would be just to close my eyes and forget it.\u201d\u201cIf I did that, I\u2019m not doing my job. So, I\u2019m not saying there won\u2019t be a little pain but the market\u2019s gone up 40 percent, 42 percent \u2014 so we might lose a little bit of it\u2014 but we\u2019re going to have a much stronger country when we\u2019re finished. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m all about. We have to do things that other people wouldn\u2019t do.\u201dThe president also took to Twitter to defend his approach to trade policy. Mr. Trump, in a tweet, criticized both China and the World Trade Organization, saying that the Chinese \u201cget tremendous perks and advantages, especially over the U.S. Does anybody think this is fair. We were badly represented. The WTO is unfair to U.S.\u201dThat followed another early morning tweet, in which Mr. Trump boasted that the new metals tariffs he has put into effect on China and other nations had not hurt American consumers as his critics predicted.More from what a representative for China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce said:\u201cWe feel America is very arrogant. They have taken a wrong action. The result is that they will hurt themselves.\u201dThe Chinese official said that the two sides can\u2019t negotiate under the current conditions. And in an interview with Bloomberg on Friday, Larry Kudlow \u2014 who has been national economic adviser for just under a week \u2014 said he could not predict when talks would begin. He added:Earlier this year, stocks sold off after the jobs report for January showed a 2.9 percent annual increase in wages, a relatively strong rise. Investors feared that a sustained increase in earnings could prompt consumers to buy more goods and services, pushing up prices in the process. Concerns receded after February\u2019s report showed a 2.6 percent jump in wages, and March\u2019s rise of 2.7 percent is not likely to stir up more worries.The March report contained data that could do even more to quell investors\u2019 nerves over inflation. While the report revised February\u2019s gain higher to 326,000 jobs from 313,000, it sharply reduced the January figure to 176,000 from 239,000. The January revision prompted Jim Vogel, of FTN Financial, to write:\u201cThat collapsed what had been an upward slope to the last two years of payroll growth and implicitly reduced the upward pressure on wages that so many are still certain will arrive this year.\u201d\u2014 Peter EavisThe headline numbers The takeaways\u2022 \u201cThat\u2019s something I get no credit for, by the way,\u201d he says. \u201cI have been for equal opportunity in gay marriage for the last 12 or 13 years.\u201d\u2022 \u201cSee this?\u201d he says. \u201cThese are front-stabbing knives. You only use these in New York. In Washington you use a shiv, or mechanisms in the press, back-stabbing, subterfuge, opposition research\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Not in New York.

Deripaska has said that he does not separate himself from the Russian state. He has also acknowledged possessing a Russian diplomatic passport, and claims to have represented the Russian government in other countries. Deripaska has been investigated for money laundering, and has been accused of threatening the lives of business rivals, illegally wiretapping a government official, and taking part in extortion and racketeering.

{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Venture Capitalists Prepare for an I.P.O. Wave", "Date": "2018-04-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Jason Pressman spent Thursday morning cheering from the balcony of the New York Stock Exchange as shares of the software firm Zuora, which he backed in 2008, began trading.\u201cNot bad at all,\u201d Mr. Pressman said by phone on Thursday night, before heading to a celebratory dinner with about 60 people at a pricey Italian restaurant in Chelsea. Mr. Pressman, a venture capitalist at Shasta Ventures, said he had been up much of the night before but still expected to raise a few glasses. \u201cI\u2019m running a little bit on adrenaline.\u201dMr. Pressman and many other Silicon Valley venture capitalists expect the windfalls to continue. Many of these investors, who back tiny start-ups with the hope that they will someday go public or be sold for nine- or 10-figure sums, have enjoyed enormous paper gains in recent years. But few have cashed in, because their fast-rising companies, like Uber and Airbnb, have remained private.That finally may change. Investors, bankers and analysts said they expected a wave of initial public offerings to bring some of the most highly valued and recognizable start-ups to the public market over the next 18 to 24 months \u2014 and billions of dollars in returns to their executives and investors. The potential bonanza would follow years of waiting as a few dozen companies amassed valuations without precedent in the private market.The tide has turned, venture capitalists said. \u201cI talk to bankers all the time and they\u2019re like: \u2018Dude, we have stuff coming down the pike. There\u2019s a bunch of offerings teed up,\u2019\u201d said Rob Hayes, a general partner at First Round Capital, who led a $1.5 million funding round in Uber in 2010 that valued the company at $4 million. Uber is now worth $68 billion.A wave of tech I.P.O.s would have implications for Silicon Valley\u2019s start-up ecosystem. Once start-ups go public and their employees pocket some of the wealth, executives and engineers may leave with more resources to begin their own start-ups. That gives venture capitalists a fresh set of companies to invest in, renewing the cycles of innovation and experimentation that sit at the heart of Silicon Valley.The I.P.O.s will also earn the venture capitalists big returns \u2014 and bragging rights. According to an annual ranking of venture capitalists by CB Insights, a research firm that follows start-ups and venture capital, many of the top-ranked investors backed companies with 2017 I.P.O.s, including the software maker MuleSoft; Stitch Fix, a mail-order clothing service; and Snap. (While Snap has struggled on the stock market, investors bought in at far lower valuations.)Steve Anderson of Baseline Ventures, No. 2 on the list, also backed Stitch Fix. And Jeremy Liew of Lightspeed Ventures, who was No. 10, funded Snap, while his colleague Ravi Mhatre, No. 8, backed MuleSoft and Stitch Fix. (The list of top 20 venture capitalists is below.)\u201cEven though most firms have had fairly record numbers over the past four or five years, they\u2019ve been paper numbers,\u201d Mr. Gurley said. \u201cAt the end of day, cash-on-cash returns is what matters.\u201dWhile private capital has been so accessible that start-ups have been able to get ample funding without the headaches of an I.P.O., several factors are encouraging companies to go public now, investors and bankers said. Public investors are hungry to buy shares of fast-growing companies. Early employees are getting antsy to cash in their stakes. And some start-up executives are eager to prove themselves as public company chief executives after founders like Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter\u2019s Jack Dorsey have said going public improved their discipline and focus on profits.\u201cAt all levels, there are more and more companies who are thinking about should we go public this year or next?\u201d said Noah Wintroub, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s vice chairman of investment banking. \u201cYou\u2019ve got an environment now that\u2019s conducive to asking that question, and also a lot of companies that have scaled up to the point where they can go now.\u201dMatthew Kennedy, an I.P.O. analyst at Renaissance Capital, said nearly all private companies valued at more than $1 billion were strong candidates to go public in the next two years. He said he expected more immediate activity among midsize start-ups, such as Slack, the maker of corporate messaging software, which is valued at $5.1 billion, and DocuSign, an e-signature company valued at $3 billion that filed I.P.O. paperwork last month.Once this generation of start-ups goes public, investors said, it will ease the anxiety of the wealthy families, pension funds and university endowments that finance the venture capitalists\u2019 investment funds. Those so-called limited partners have been itching for their returns, venture capitalists said.\u201cThey\u2019re certainly eager for cash back,\u201d said Mr. Pressman, the Zuora investor. An I.P.O. boon would be good for the venture capitalists, too.\u201cFor sure,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the business to make money for our investors, but we make money when our investors do.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Venture Capitalists Seek \u2018Safe Harbor\u2019 for Virtual Currencies", "Date": "2018-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Venture capitalists and entrepreneurs have been lobbying federal regulators to protect at least some virtual currencies from being categorized as securities, a designation that would carry significantly more oversight.The venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz helped assemble a group of investors and lawyers that met with the Securities and Exchange Commission in late March. They also proposed a \u201csafe harbor\u201d for some virtual currencies, according to a copy of the proposal reviewed by The New York Times and three people briefed on the effort who agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity because the proceedings were confidential.Regulators have indicated in private meetings that they are considering whether virtual currencies \u2014 including Ether, the second most widely used digital token \u2014 should be categorized as a security, according to three people who have been in the meetings. That designation could cause a significant drop in the value of Ether.\u201cIt\u2019s a \u2018come to the lord\u2019 moment,\u201d said Richard Levin, a lawyer at the firm Polsinelli who works with companies in the space. \u201cWe are seeing a watershed moment in which many firms in the digital asset community who may have been ignorant of the law \u2014 or poorly informed \u2014 are now coming to terms with the fact that they are subject to regulators.\u201dThe group led by Andreessen Horowitz called themselves the \u201cVenture Capital Working Group,\u201d according to the proposal, dated March 26.The group included the two largest venture capital firms in the virtual currency industry, Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures. It also included lawyers from Cooley, Perkins Coie, and McDermott Will & Emery, the people involved in the effort said.The group met with the S.E.C. in Washington on March 28 to present their idea for a safe harbor that would allow some tokens to be categorized as \u201cutility tokens\u201d rather than securities. An S.E.C. spokesman declined to comment on the meeting.Thousands of virtual currencies have been created through so-called initial coin offerings in which entrepreneurs sold digital tokens to raise money for their projects. The tokens are generally intended to serve as internal payment methods in software that the entrepreneurs are building.Over the past year, entrepreneurs have raised more than $6 billion through initial coin offerings. These coins mostly trade on unregulated virtual currency exchanges. Many entrepreneurs have said that because their tokens have a utility, as a payment method, they should not be considered investment contracts or securities.But Jay Clayton, the chairman of the S.E.C., has said in recent months that he believes almost every token issued through an initial coin offering should be registered as a security \u2014 almost none are today.The S.E.C. has sent subpoenas to dozens of people and companies in the virtual currency industry asking for information about how various digital tokens were issued and marketed to investors.When investments are securities, they generally need to have paperwork filed with regulators and can only be traded on regulated exchanges, like those where stocks and commodities are bought and sold. No regulated securities exchanges offer virtual currency trading.Most investors assume that Bitcoin is safe from being categorized as a security because it was not originally issued through an initial coin offering or central organization. New Bitcoins are distributed on a daily basis to computers helping to maintain the network. Some large virtual currencies, like Litecoin and Monero, have similar designs.The group pulled together by Andreessen Horowitz said in its proposal that Ether \u201chas become so decentralized it should not be deemed a security.\u201dThe proposal suggests that digital tokens should generally be exempt from securities laws if they achieve \u201cfull decentralization\u201d or \u201cfull functionality.\u201d It adds that full decentralization could occur under several conditions, including \u201cwhen the token creator no longer has control of the network based on its ability to make unilateral changes to the functionality of the tokens.\u201dThe proposal says a token is fully functional when it can be used for its intended purpose on a computer network and is not just useful as a speculative investment, which is the case with many tokens today.The group notes that these definitions are only suggestions, but the \u201cproposed safe harbor has been vetted by, and has the support of, many of the key players in the industry.\u201dPeople briefed on the meeting said that regulators did not immediately embrace the safe harbor proposal.Many entrepreneurs and law firms have been creating new ways for virtual currency projects to issue their tokens as securities and some exchanges have talked about getting registered as official securities exchanges.It is still unclear what will happen to tokens that did not register as securities but are later categorized as securities.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Goldman Sachs May Be Getting Its Groove Back", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGoldman Sachs has gotten its groove back \u2014 for the first three months of 2018, at least.After a year of uncharacteristic struggles, the bank benefited from wild swings in prices for stocks and other assets to rake in cash in the first quarter, according to an earnings report released on Tuesday.No longer. Goldman booked $10 billion in revenue for the quarter, its highest total in three years and a 25 percent increase over the same period in 2017. It reported profits of $2.8 billion, compared with $2.3 billion a year earlier.Investors were unimpressed. After rallying in early trading on Tuesday, Goldman shares fell more than 1 percent. Its competitors\u2019 shares had followed a similar trajectory, falling or barely moving after they reported quarterly earnings on Friday and Monday.The stock market\u2019s roller-coaster ride in the year\u2019s first quarter enlivened Wall Street. It was a welcome change after a period of steady gains and muted trading activity that depressed bank profits, which are typically driven by frequent changes in the markets.\u201cIt\u2019s good to see a big recovery from last year,\u201d said Devin Ryan, an analyst at the investment bank JMP Securities.The upturn in trading was not the only good news for Goldman. The bank has been bulking up its lending business, which Mr. Blankfein has said the bank would rely on to maintain steady growth the next time financial markets start to skid. Goldman said on Sunday that it had bought Clarity Money, a lending app with more than one million users.The increase in lending appeared to pay dividends in the first quarter. Revenue from loans and other debt products rose more than 50 percent compared with last year. The push also helped Goldman take advantage of rising interest rates, which contributed to the business\u2019s $550 million in interest income for the quarter.Investors apparently want something more. The hedge fund manager Douglas Kass said in a message posted on Twitter early Tuesday that he expected Goldman\u2019s stock to drop. \u201cAll the gain relative to expectations came from lower tax rate,\u201d he said.Those in the market for bank stocks have mostly shown little enthusiasm for the biggest institutions\u2019 first-quarter performances, despite their apparent strength.Mr. Ryan of JPM Securities said he was not surprised that banks were recording healthy results because they had gotten plenty of help from the Trump administration\u2019s tax cuts and a general improvement in the United States economy. Investors, he said, wanted to know that the banks could continue their stellar performances after the initial stimulus from the tax cuts fades.\u201cPeople are looking for signs of sustainability,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re getting indications thus far on the earnings calls that the outlook is much better than what\u2019s already been anticipated.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Era of Very Low Inflation and Interest Rates May Be Near an End", "Date": "2018-04-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMoves in global bond markets over the last few months suggest changing expectations about prices.For years, the world economy has been trapped in a low-inflation, low-interest-rate rut. Yet the latest shifts in global markets suggest that this could, at long last, be ending. You see a similar pattern in the bond prices of other advanced nations. For example, German 10-year yields rose to 0.64 percent Wednesday from 0.31 percent in September.If this really is the start of a resetting of inflation and interest rates toward more historically normal levels, it will be mostly good news for the world economy. Central bankers have spent years trying unsuccessfully to get inflation to the 2 percent level many of them aim for. In many ways the low interest rates of recent years have been a reflection of economic weakness around the globe. So as long as the moves don\u2019t go too far, increases in inflation and interest rates would be a sign the global economy is returning to a more prosperous equilibrium like the one that prevailed before 2008.The shift looks to be driven mostly by a rise in investors\u2019 expectations for future inflation. In the United States, prices of inflation-protected bonds imply that investors currently expect consumer prices to rise 2.09 percent annually over the next five years, up from 1.65 percent expected in September.That, in turn, partly reflects a sharp run-up in oil prices over the same period, which seems likely to push up consumer prices for gasoline and other fuels in the months ahead. But strikingly, inflation expectations for the period between five and 10 years from now have also risen, when the impact of the recent oil price rise should have long since passed.A number of factors are involved in this shift. Economic growth is solid across almost all of the world\u2019s major economies for the first time in a decade, meaning there should be upward pressure on demand for all sorts of raw materials.And with the United States closing in on full employment (or arguably already there), the Federal Reserve is looking more confident than it has in years in its intentions to keep raising interest rates.Trump administration policies may also be playing a role.New tax cuts and spending legislation will result in hundreds of billions of dollars more in Treasury bonds being issued in the years ahead than had seemed likely not that long ago. This means the government may need to pay higher interest rates to find buyers of that debt. And if threats of a trade war with China or other countries turn into reality, this will tend to increase inflation, driving up prices both directly through new tariffs on imported goods and indirectly by encouraging less efficient production.All of those forces are doing battle with longer-standing pressures in the other direction that have been in place since the global financial crisis a decade ago. This includes a chronic shortage of demand for goods and services and declining growth in the working-age population in many rich countries.There have been fake-outs in bond and commodity markets on this front before, including in the second half of 2013 and in the months surrounding President Trump\u2019s 2016 election victory. This could be another one, and reverse itself soon enough.But in the meantime, you can view the higher volatility in the stock market in the last couple of months as a consequence of this standoff between forces of inflation versus deflation, between higher interest rates and lower rates, and between a world economy straining against the limits of its capacity versus one that still is working through chronic oversupply.On Tuesday, when long-term Treasury rates soared, the stock market fell, as investors tried to assess the consequences of this higher-rate environment for stocks.After nine years of economic expansion and rising stock prices, the market is richly valued relative to earnings. Each $100 invested in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 currently generates only $4.78 in earnings at Tuesday\u2019s closing price. That low return might be tolerable when money invested in an ultrasafe Treasury bond \u2014 or even in a savings account \u2014 generates very low returns. As a reminder, stock market volatility skyrocketed in early February upon publication of new wage data suggesting that inflation pressures might be building, which could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates faster.In the short run, markets can be shaped by all kinds of things, whether algorithmic trading or a run of bad news for a major company or a presidential tweet. But in the longer run, economic fundamentals are powerful forces. And if this really is the turning point toward something more closely resembling the pre-2008 inflation and interest rate environment \u2014 still a big if \u2014 it will have an impact for nearly everyone, not just people with money to invest.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Warren Buffett Isn\u2019t a Fan of Bonds. But They May Be Good for You.", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was a rough first quarter for bonds, which fell in value amid fears that inflation, the archnemesis of fixed-income investors, was coming back into the picture.Instead of rallying when stocks were falling \u2014 typically the case for the last three decades \u2014 bonds merely managed to lose less than stocks. When the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index lost 10 percent from late January to early February, the Bloomberg Barclays Aggregate U.S. Bond index fell more than 1 percent.It\u2019s not profitable to argue with Mr. Buffett about the markets. He is right, of course. The return prospects for bonds aren\u2019t particularly appealing today. That\u2019s because low bond yields reduce the odds that you will earn a return that keeps pace with inflation in coming years. And with the Federal Reserve pushing its target interest rate higher, bond prices are likely to suffer. (When rates rise, bond prices fall. A bond fund\u2019s total return is the sum of the interest paid plus changes in bond prices.)But Mr. Buffett is a singular investor, one with deep pockets and an extremely long-term perspective, and he has an excellent track record of exploiting market sell-offs. Most people aren\u2019t like that.According to Morningstar Direct, $59 billion is invested in long-term bond funds and exchange-traded funds (defined as portfolios with average durations above six years). But that total is dwarfed by the more than $1.5 trillion invested in intermediate-term portfolios (3.5- to six-year average duration), which include core bond funds hewing to the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate index. Another $431 billion is invested in short-term portfolios (one- to 3.5-year average duration).Ms. Jones points out that from a low yield of 1.38 percent in July 2016, the 10-year Treasury note now yields nearly 3 percent. \u201cWe are in a bond bear market,\u201d she said. But that\u2019s nothing like a stock bear market.Since July 2016, the average intermediate bond fund has managed to post flat performance as higher yields have offset price declines. Shorter-term portfolios have eked out a small gain. On an inflation-adjusted basis, bond funds have negative returns over that stretch. A stock bear market, by contrast, doesn\u2019t begin until stocks have fallen at least 20 percent.Still, core bond funds\u2019 struggles have been unsettling. And with a strong-enough economy spurring the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates, bond investors may need to reduce expectations.At the same time, the benchmark Bloomberg Barclays Aggregate is ratcheting up its risk. The duration of the index has increased from around 3.5 years in 2008 to six years today as the composition of the index shifted in response to the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy. Treasury bonds, which tend to have longer durations, now represent more than one-third of the index compared with 22 percent in 2007. And corporations have spent the last decade issuing longer-term bonds to take advantage of low interest rates.Mr. Chiappinelli said investing in a portfolio that is increasing its duration when interest rates \u201cwere at historic lows is the exact opposite of prudence.\u201d\u201cWe tend to talk about owning the aggregate index as a core, and then adding some risk around it. Well, now might be a time to keep your core but add some less risky bonds,\u201d Ms. Jones said.\u201cShorten up your entire bond portfolio to two or three years and you could probably afford to own fewer bonds and increase your stocks,\u201d Mr. Fisher said. His expectation is that the overall volatility of a portfolio 30 percent in short-term bonds and 70 percent in stocks is going to be on par with one that is 40 percent invested in a fund tracking the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate index and 60 percent in stocks.\u201cI don\u2019t know what the return of bonds will be, and I am not suggesting it will be as good as the past 17 years, but I do expect the volatility of bonds relative to stocks to stay the same,\u201d Mr. Roth said.Unless you are as patient and prescient as Mr. Buffett, owning a slug of less-volatile bonds can help you stick to a long-term investing strategy when stocks fall.An earlier version of this article misquoted Peter Chiappinelli. He said that investing in a portfolio of bonds that is increasing its duration when interest rates are \u201cat historic lows is the exact opposite of prudence.\u201d He did not say that adding more duration when \u201crates are rising is the exact opposite of prudence.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Markets Tumble Again as U.S.-China Trade Tensions Continue to Rise", "Date": "2018-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRising tensions between China and the United States pummeled stocks again on Friday, as investors began to take seriously the risk of a trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies.Investors took little comfort in statements from the administration\u2019s top economic policymakers, Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary. Both men sought to tamp down the contentious back-and-forth between the two economic giants. On CNBC, Mr. Mnuchin emphasized that the United States was willing to negotiate with China, but he acknowledged that there was \u201cpotential for a trade war.\u201dAnd investors found few bright spots in afternoon comments from Jerome H. Powell, the new chairman of the Federal Reserve. In a speech in Chicago, Mr. Powell gave little indication that he planned to deviate from the Fed\u2019s gradual path of lifting interest rates. He also suggested after his speech that he was unsure how the new tariffs imposed by the United States and China would affect the economy.By the time markets closed, both the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average had fallen more than 2 percent.Mr. Trump, who had been a cheerleader for the rising stock market, acknowledged in a radio interview that was aired on Friday that the trade friction could take a toll on the market. The S.&P. 500 is now down 2.6 percent for the year and more than 9 percent from its late January peak.\u201cI\u2019m not saying there won\u2019t be a little pain,\u201d Mr. Trump said. He added: \u201cBut we\u2019re going to have a much stronger country when we\u2019re finished.\u201dMr. Powell\u2019s comments underscored the shaky position stock investors are in, buffeted almost daily by conflicting announcements from the White House and by tariff announcements from Beijing that have strained one of the world\u2019s most important economic relationships. A deep trade freeze between the two countries could chill global growth.So far, though, there is little evidence of a slowdown. And without one, the Fed, as Mr. Powell suggested, will probably keeping raising rates, which traditionally is viewed as a drag on stocks.The losses on Friday were especially heavy for American companies reliant on global trade. The aircraft maker Boeing tumbled 3 percent, and Caterpillar, which sells lots of construction and mining equipment in China, sank 3.5 percent.With China tailoring its tariffs toward American agricultural products, investors also dumped stocks tied to the sector. The fertilizer giants CF Industries and Mosaic each fell more than 3 percent, as did Deere, the farm equipment maker.The gloomy trading day in the United States followed a mixed day elsewhere.Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 closed down 0.4 percent, while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng ended up 1 percent.

(Mainland Chinese markets were closed on Friday.)On Thursday, Mr. Trump said he had instructed his top trade officials to determine whether additional tariffs on $100 billion worth of Chinese imports were warranted and, \u201cif so, to identify the products upon which to impose such tariffs.\u201dThe comments were part of a roller-coaster week that has whipsawed investors.\u201cPeople have started to feel like this is a bit of the children\u2019s game.

Then on Tuesday, American officials detailed plans for tariffs on roughly $50 billion in Chinese goods.

So, I\u2019m not saying there won\u2019t be a little pain, but the market\u2019s gone up 40 percent, 42 percent \u2014 so we might lose a little bit of it \u2014 but we\u2019re going to have a much stronger country when we\u2019re finished. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m all about. We have to do things that other people wouldn\u2019t do.\u201dMr. Mnuchin said on Friday that a correction was normal after such a long stretch of rising stock prices. He insisted that Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policy would be good for economic growth and that he was not concerned about daily declines in stocks.\u201cI think these are all long term positive things that the president is willing to defend our interests,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.He added that he continued to be optimistic that a mutually beneficial agreement could be worked out.\u201cI think this could be good for us and good for them,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump, in a tweet on Friday, criticized both China and the World Trade Organization, saying that the Chinese \u201cget tremendous perks and advantages, especially over the U.S. Does anybody think this is fair. We were badly represented. The WTO is unfair to U.S.\u201dThat followed another early morning tweet, in which Mr. Trump boasted that the new metals tariffs he has put into effect on China and other nations had not hurt American consumers as his critics predicted.The U.S. and China have both demonstrated a willingness to offer concessions \u2014 and escalate tensions \u2014 to get what they want.On Friday morning, the White House issued an additional statement defending the president\u2019s actions.\u201cYear after year, China continues to distort global markets and harm U.S. businesses and consumers with unfair trade practices,\u201d the press office said.\u201cThe president is for free trade, but it must also be fair trade. Addressing unfair trade practices and ensuring that global trade is free, fair, and reciprocal will have a significant positive long-term impact on the U.S. economy,\u201d the statement said.But the approach has come under swift and stinging criticism from lawmakers of both parties, as well as industries whose businesses depend on access to China\u2019s markets.Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat from North Dakota, called Mr. Trump\u2019s actions \u201creckless,\u201d saying in a tweet that 60% of her state\u2019s exports to China are agricultural products. \u201cChina\u2019s unfair trade policies need to be reined in but this isn\u2019t the way to do it.\u201dIn his statement on Thursday, Mr. Trump said he had instructed the agriculture secretary to implement a plan to protect farmers and agricultural interests. It is unclear what that plan could entail, but Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said that if the president chose to subsidize farmers, he could spark a wider conflict with countries beyond China, which would object to unfair competition from American agriculture.White House trade advisers have described the tariff threats as a long overdue action against a pernicious cheater in global trade, saying China has long engaged in pressure, coercion and outright theft to gain access to valuable intellectual property. Yet the escalating threat of a trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies has unnerved many American businesses that depend on China as a source for goods or as a market for their own products.China was celebrating a national holiday Friday and did not immediately announce any concrete action against the president\u2019s threat of an additional $100 billion in tariffs. A spokesman said the Chinese Ministry of Commerce had \u201ctaken note\u201d of the White House\u2019s statement, adding that \u201cthe Chinese position has been made very clear. We do not want to fight, but we are not afraid to fight a trade war.\u201dIf the United States follows through with its threats, the Chinese \u201cwill follow suit to the end and will not hesitate to pay any price,\u201d he said, arguing that the United States initiated the conflict.In the meantime, the trade measures ignited a swift response from manufacturers, retailers and politicians from states whose economies depend on agriculture. Although China exports far more to the United States than it imports, China is still the United States\u2019 third largest export market after Canada and Mexico, a vital destination for American-made goods like Boeing airplanes, luxury automobiles and soybeans.\u201cHopefully, the president is just blowing off steam again, but if he\u2019s even half-serious, this is nuts,\u201d Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, said on Thursday. \u201cLet\u2019s absolutely take on Chinese bad behavior, but with a plan that punishes them instead of us. This is the dumbest possible way to do this.\u201dThe National Retail Federation criticized the new round of tariffs as a dangerous game of chicken ending with the United States on the losing end of a trading relationship that has benefited American companies and consumers.\u201cThis is what a trade war looks like, and what we have warned against from the start. We are on a dangerous downward spiral, and American families will be on the losing end,\u201d Matthew R. Shay, the president and chief executive of the retail group, said in a statement. \u201cWe urge the administration to change course and stop playing a game of chicken with the nation\u2019s economy.\u201dAlan Rappeport contributed reporting from Washington, and Alexandra Stevenson from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Trump Lashed Out at OPEC: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Friday morning. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Wells Fargo takes another hit.\u2022 What AT&T\u2019s Randall Stephenson said on the stand.\u2022 What Takeda has to weigh in its pursuit of Shire.But why has President Trump made the international oil cartel his latest b\u00eate noire? One potential reason: It makes life more difficult for many Americans, weighing on the benefits of the Republican tax cuts.The context: OPEC and Russia agreed two years ago to cut \u2014 and maintain \u2014 oil production caps to bring prices back up in the wake of U.S. shale boom. So far, that strategy has worked:With oil above $73 now, even after Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet, fuel prices are at reaching two-year highs as the U.S. gets into the summer driving season. More importantly, Americans are preparing to spend more on fuel, eating into whatever savings they are expected to receive on average from the tax cuts.Americans are expected to spend an average of $400 per household more on fuel this year than in 2016, as the rebound in crude prices is reflected in the cost of petrol at the pump. By contrast, middle-income US households will on average gain $930 each from the tax cut bill passed at the end of last year, according to the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.And Michael Lynch of Strategic Energy & Economic Research had this to say to Bloomberg:\u201cNinety-eight percent of what politicians say about oil should just be disregarded immediately and this falls in there.\u201dIn February, the Justice Department issued demands to AT&T, Verizon and the G.S.M.A., a mobile industry standards-setting group, for information on potential collusion to thwart a technology known as eSIM, said two of the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details are confidential.The technology lets people remotely switch wireless providers without having to insert a new SIM card into a device. AT&T and Verizon face accusations that they colluded with the G.S.M.A. to try to establish standards that would allow them to lock a device to their network even if it had eSIM technology.The investigation was opened about five months ago after at least one device maker and one wireless carrier filed formal complaints with the Justice Department, two of the people said.Representatives for the Justice Department, AT&T, Verizon and the G.S.M.A. declined to comment.\u2014 Cecilia KangShares of General Electric jumped nearly 4 percent Friday after the company reported better-than-expected earnings and reaffirmed its guidance for the year.Though G.E. reported a first-quarter loss on Friday, there were also signs that the struggling industrial giant is beginning to stabilize its business.G.E.\u2019s big power-generator division continues to drag down the company\u2019s overall performance, and it is still burdened with financial liabilities that linger from the conglomerate\u2019s pared-back finance arm, GE Capital.But G.E.\u2019s other major industrial divisions, led by aviation and health care, delivered solid results in the quarter. That should provide some assurance to investors as the company charts a future dependent on its industrial lines.Especially heartening for investors, G.E. reaffirmed its profit outlook for the year, predicting earnings per share of $1 to $1.07, though likely at the lower end of that range. Analysts had been skeptical that G.E. could do that well. The average analysts\u2019 forecast for the year was 95 cents a share, as compiled by Thomson Reuters.To recap: Wells Fargo has already paid $185 million over its fake accounts scandal and set aside $4.25 billion for liabilities tied to other infractions. And the Fed has prevented the bank from expanding its balance sheet.Yes, the upcoming $1 billion fine is the most stringent bank penalty imposed by the Trump administration to date. (The C.F.P.B., under pressure from Mick Mulvaney to go easier on financial firms, is involved here.)But Mr. Stewart writes, \u201cAt this point it\u2019s hard to imagine what more Wells Fargo can do (or how much more it can spend) to make amends.\u201dThat\u2019s the contention of the reporter Jonathan Greenberg, who, as a Forbes reporter in 1984, spoke with \u201cJohn Barron\u201d about Donald Trump\u2019s net worth. Mr. Barron \u2014 a now well-known alter ego of the real estate executive \u2014 contended that Mr. Trump had bought out most of his father\u2019s stake in their business.Over time I have learned that he should not have been on the first three Forbes 400 lists at all. In our first-ever list, in 1982, we included him at $100 million, but Trump was actually worth roughly $5 million \u2014 a paltry sum by the standards of his super-monied peers \u2014 as a spate of government reports and books showed only much later.Mr. Greenberg writes that the White House and the Trump Organization declined to comment.The Justice Department, which wants to block the deal, argued that AT&T is different because it\u2019s also a broadband internet provider, and that relations with Silicon Valley are chummier than Mr. Stephenson asserts.A big takeover would give Takeda more scale \u2014 the combined company would have some $30 billion in annual sales \u2014 and a bigger international footprint. But it would also be the company\u2019s biggest takeover by far, and perhaps too expensive.The Japanese drug maker said it intended to maintain its credit rating, which could be difficult if it bids too high \u2014 or is pressured to do so by yet another suitor.With its $16 trillion economy and reputation for tough negotiating, the E.U. could have been the immovable object in President Trump\u2019s trade fight. But that is looking less likely, Peter Eavis writes.Among the lessons if the E.U. concedes: The U.S.\u2019s large trade deficits can give it leverage.The sometimes controversial data consultant cut its teeth working for the Pentagon and the C.I.A. Now it\u2019s hoping that its latest product will attract more commercial clients.The company needs to figure out how to be rewarded on Wall Street without creeping out Main Street. It might not be possible. For all of Palantir\u2019s professed concern for individuals\u2019 privacy, the single most important safeguard against abuse is the one it\u2019s trying desperately to reduce through automation: human judgment.Victor Orlovski, Fort Ross\u2019s founder and managing partner, told Michael that the current state of U.S.-Russian political relations should not affect his firm\u2019s ability to operate. \u201cThe nature of start-ups is all about risk,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a political tension, but not when you\u2019re talking to start-ups.\u201dThe tech flyaroundThe only potential obstacle: Arturo Di Modica, the artist who made the bull, doesn\u2019t want it moved.An earlier version of this article, relying on information in a Bloomberg report, misstated the amount of Sumner Redstone\u2019s compensation that a court ruled CBS shareholders could challenge.

{"Headline": "Will Bank Earnings Flash Any Warnings?: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Good Thursday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 The big banks are getting ready to report first-quarter results.\u2022 Larry Fink believes robust global growth and earnings will support stocks.\u2022 There\u2019s a consensus that Facebook must be regulated. The question is, how?\u2022 What Paul Ryan\u2019s exit means for business.\u2022 Jack Ma argues that a trade war would hurt the U.S.Headwinds and tailwinds are blowing through the financial markets and the global economy.The strength of these crosscurrents can be gauged, in part, by examining the results of the big banks, three of which report their first-quarter earnings on Friday. They are JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, which have large operations around the world and big Wall Street businesses, as well as Wells Fargo, which is more of a traditional lender focused on the United States.At the start of the year, the big banks had the wind in their backs. The global economy seemed to be on a clear growth path, the United States had just enacted large tax cuts and the Trump administration was expected to loosen bank regulations. But the threat of a trade war between the United States and China helped plunge the stock markets into correction during the first quarter. The banks\u2019 results, as well as comments from their senior executives, could signal whether the tumult is seeping into the real economy. Here are some things to watch out for:\u2014 Peter EavisAmid the steep drop in its stock price, perhaps it was only a matter of time before Micro Focus drew an activist investor. Elliott Management was a logical candidate. Now, as the $34 billion activist investor has taken a stake in the software maker, here\u2019s what it could push for:\u2022 Potentially go private altogether\u2022 Potentially sell off Suse Linux, a popular maker of the Linux operating system that Micro Focus acquired as part of its takeover of AttachmateOne possibility is that Elliott will push to be involved in a sale of some or all of the business through its private equity team, Evergreen Coast Capital.A spokesman for Elliott declined to comment, while a spokeswoman for Micro Focus declined to comment.Despite one of more volatile quarters in recent years, the chief executive of BlackRock believes that robust global growth and stellar earnings results will be enough to keep the stock market from spiraling downward.But he concedes that worries over trade wars and increased political uncertainty \u2014 at home and abroad \u2014 has made for a riskier investing environment.\u201cMy optimism has abated somewhat,\u201d Mr. Fink said in an interview on Thursday. \u201cBut economically the world is in good shape.\u201dBut for all the turmoil and noise, the market is about flat for the year, he pointed out.The investment giant reported first-quarter earnings Thursday. Helped by continuing inflows into the firm's passive funds, better performance by its actively managed funds and a more favorable tax rate, earnings per share grew 28 percent compared with a year ago.\u201cThis quarter validates us institutionally,\u201d Mr. Fink said, making the point that BlackRock could attract money even when investors are in a jittery mood.Even though many investors yanked money out of the market over the past two months, BlackRock had $55 billion of net inflows for the quarter, with its fast-growing exchange-traded funds comprising $34 billion of that figure.Assets under management grew by 17 percent annually and now stand at a record high of $6.3 trillion.Critics\u2019 cornerIt would seem pretty serious.\u201cWillow initially not only hated the idea but put her foot down because she thought it would be highly destructive to our family and to our lives.\u201dThe idea kept nagging at him and his wife gave her reluctant permission.\u201cThe thought I had was coming from the patriot in me, growing up at a time when we respected our politicians not only for what they stood for but because of what they accomplished. I am horrified at the state of politics in America today, and I will throw stones in multiple directions. Dialogue has given way to disdain. I, maybe a bit naively, believed that there was a need for someone in high elected office to be more open-minded and willing to not only govern from the middle but to try to shame everyone else into going to the middle.\u201dAlso from the piece, Oprah Winfrey thought he would have been the ideal candidate.\u201cBob is one of the people I respect most in the world. That\u2019s a very short list. He is infinitely capable of multiple categories of expertise, and he has created an environment where you can disagree with him\u2014and that\u2019s not just because I\u2019m Oprah. I really, really pushed him to run for president, so much so that I said to him, \u2018Gee, if you ever decide to run for office, I will go door to door carrying leaflets. I will go sit and have tea with people.\u2019\u201d\u201cBerkshire\u2019s present intention is to vote against the four directors proposed by management,\u201d Mr. Buffett\u2019s assistant, Debbie Bosanek, said in an email.Two weeks ago USG rejected Knauf\u2019s $5.9 billion, or $42-a-share, offer. The rejection came despite Berkshire, which controls more than 30 percent of USG, saying it would take Knauf\u2019s offer if the German company agreed to buy the rest of USG for at least $42 a share.Knauf had called on USG shareholders to withhold support for USG\u2019s board nominees in an effort to bring USG to the table.Shares of USG rose 2.8 percent on the news.\u201cIt is therefore ironic that the U.S. administration is waging a trade war at a time when the largest potential consumer market in the world is open for business.\u201dShe seems to be trying to dial back that threat: National Amusements, the Redstone family holding company that controls CBS and Viacom, said in a statement that it has \u201ctremendous respect\u201d for Mr. Moonves, \u201cand it has always been our intention that he run a combined company.\u201dBut in a deal process that is playing out unusually publicly, consider the gantlet thrown.Through its $100 billion Vision Fund, SoftBank has pushed into businesses as wide-ranging as augmented reality, online commerce and dog walking. But the rationale for an investment like this one appears more elusive, other than being a play for lucrative sports content.\u201cIt is safe to say it is one of the largest tax bills on earned income in history.\u201dAdvertisement"}

A spokesman for the congressman said he was unavailable to comment.Blair Holmes, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Chamber, said the organization was reviewing the legislation. \u201cThis issue has always been important to many members,\u201d she said.If it goes through, the bill\u2019s text says it would \u201cprovide for exclusive federal jurisdiction over civil securities fraud actions.\u201d It also says that \u201cdiffering state regulatory requirements\u201d create \u201cinefficiencies,\u201d raise costs and harm markets \u201cwithout providing material investor protection benefits.\u201dMr. Greenberg and his staff said the legislation would only affect civil enforcement related to stocks, bonds and other securities listed on national exchanges. State regulators disagree, saying it would also hamper their criminal jurisdiction related to such securities.One feature of the Martin Act is that it does not require the state to prove that someone actually intended to defraud people, a lower bar than what is required at the federal level.\u201cIt\u2019s outrageous,\u201d Mr. Greenberg said of the intent issue. Asked if legislation broadly targeting all states was an appropriate remedy, he replied: \u201cSo is it better to have a law that violates every principle? Is that better? You can be tried for something without having to prove intent? Are we a third world country?\u201dThe case against him centered around two sets of transactions. One of them inflated A.I.G.\u2019s reserves at a time when analysts were criticizing the company for its flagging reserves. In a second series of deals, the insurer invested in an offshore entity in a way that allowed it to mask losses from one of its divisions.Mr. Greenberg has disputed much about the case.\u201cEliot Spitzer decided he wanted to take me down,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was successful. Destroyed a company that had a $180 billion market cap. Now it\u2019s what? A fraction of that. There\u2019s been seven C.E.O.s since I left the company. Destroyed a great asset.\u201dBut in a statement he made as part of his 2017 settlement, he said he \u201cinitiated, participated in and approved\u201d the transactions that \u201cinaccurately portrayed the accounting, and thus the financial condition and performance for A.I.G.\u2019s loss reserves and underwriting income.\u201dA.I.G. also faced a reckoning and near failure in the financial crisis.\u201cThe notion that we would weaken one of the few statutes that was used effectively to confront structural failures on Wall Street defies logic, at a moment so soon after the economic cataclysm of 2008,\u201d Mr. Spitzer said in an interview.Mr. Greenberg said he decided to settle last year because \u201cthere\u2019s a limit to how much any individual can endure fighting\u201d the state. He added: \u201cThere was no acknowledgment of any wrongdoing, No. 1. And that\u2019s important.\u201dMr. Schneiderman, the attorney general who settled the case, said Mr. Greenberg\u2019s case was \u201cvery straightforward,\u201d noting that A.I.G. had restated the transactions on its books.Regarding the legislation, he added, \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone who is saying we should have less regulation of securities fraud.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the name of an organization led by Joseph P.

{"Headline": "The Big Question for Markets: Is There a Kudlow or Powell \u2018Put\u2019? ", "Date": "2018-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInvestors are looking for evidence that the White House economic adviser or Federal Reserve chairman can act as an insurance policy against a trade war.These are unsettled times in financial markets.Stock prices rose or fell by more than 1 percent in four of five days last week, and if anything those closing numbers masked even larger swings within each trading session. A common measure of expected stock market volatility is about to double its level from early January.The proximate cause is pretty obvious: President Trump is threatening a trade war with China and perhaps other trading partners. But beneath those daily headlines are two more fundamental questions: Is there a Kudlow Put? And is there a Powell Put?More specifically, will the White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow (and his free-trader allies within the administration) be able to rein in the Trump administration\u2019s trade stance if markets keep falling? And will the Federal Reserve\u2019s chairman, Jerome Powell, be ready to take action, such as by delaying interest rate increases or even cutting rates, if markets tumble further?A \u201cput\u201d is an option contract that offers its buyer protection against losses. If you own a stock worth $100 and buy a put with a strike price of $80, you are ensuring the ability to sell for that price if you wish, so you can\u2019t lose more than 20 percent of your money.Back in the 1990s, traders started referring to the \u201cGreenspan Put,\u201d the notion that the stock market as a whole had the equivalent of a giant put option in the form of the Fed chairman Alan Greenspan. Amid an emerging markets debt crisis in 1998, the Fed cut interest rates to try to guard the United States against economic fallout, which helped the stock market gain a whopping 29 percent that year despite the global troubles.This notion that the Fed is always ready to act when the stock markets start to dip has almost become a piece of conventional wisdom in market circles over the years \u2014 often said with a bit of snark and implicit criticism of the Fed for supposedly bailing out investors whenever the going gets tough. Fed officials themselves hate the idea, and argue that they\u2019re looking out for the economy, not markets.Nonetheless, in the popular discourse the Greenspan Put gave way to the (Ben) Bernanke Put, and to the (Janet) Yellen Put, as Mr. Greenspan\u2019s successors engaged in multiple rounds of \u201cquantitative easing\u201d in recent years.Which brings us to the 2018 equivalents.Early last week, the stock market was losing ground as the Trump administration rolled out plans for punitive tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese imports, and the Chinese government said it would retaliate with comparable tariffs on American goods.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index ended that day up 1.2 percent.But the question is whether that dynamic is changing, with the departure of more internationalist voices within the administration like Mr. Kudlow\u2019s predecessor, Gary Cohn, and the former secretary of state Rex Tillerson.Then there is Mr. Powell, who is in his second month as Federal Reserve chairman. He delivered a speech Friday that threw into doubt whether the Powell Put exists \u2014 at least with respect to potential economic disruption from a trade war.He mentioned that business contacts had told Fed officials they were worried that trade tensions could spill into broader economic distress. But he did not go the next step of giving any hint that this might lead the Fed to reconsider its plans to raise interest rates gradually in the year ahead.There\u2019s good reason for that. If the trade skirmish escalates into a trade war, it will harm economic growth, but it will also be inflationary. Prices would rise for American consumers in the near term because of the new tariffs, and would rise in the medium term as production of goods moved to less economically advantageous locations.It is an economic problem that the Fed\u2019s tools would be particularly ill suited to solve; the Fed can help address weak demand in the economy but can\u2019t do much about a negative supply shock, which is what a trade war would be.So it\u2019s understandable that Mr. Powell would be quiet on the subject, and disinclined to float the possibility that Fed interest rate policy could or would prevent damage from a trade war. But if things continue to escalate, expect markets to hang on his every word even more in search of evidence that the Powell Put is real.The way to think of fluctuations in the stock market, both last week and in the months ahead, is as a continuing effort to determine whether the Kudlow Put and the Powell Put exist, and if so, how powerful they may be.But given President Trump\u2019s newfound willingness to chart his own aggressive path on trade policy, and the limits of the Fed\u2019s tools in the event of a trade war, these may not be options contracts you want to rely on.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "If the World Economy Is Looking So Great, Why Are Global Policymakers So Gloomy?", "Date": "2018-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs officials gather for the I.M.F. and World Bank meetings in Washington, worries about trade and debt are on the rise.By a lot of measures, these are very good times for the global economy. Nearly every major region of the planet is enjoying solid growth and prosperity simultaneously for the first time in a decade.\u201cThe present good times will not last for long,\u201d said Maurice Obstfeld, chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, as he released the fund\u2019s latest projections, which foresee a solid 3.9 percent expansion of the global economy in 2018.The pessimism among policymakers \u2014 who are attending spring meetings of the I.M.F. and World Bank in Washington this week \u2014 contrasts with financial markets. Despite a bumpy couple of months, stocks and most other financial assets are still priced at levels that suggest growth will continue apace for some time to come.\u201cEconomists are paid to worry,\u201d said Nathan Sheets, chief economist at PGIM Fixed Income and a former official at the United States Treasury and the Federal Reserve. \u201cWe\u2019re paid to find problems and challenges. I think the markets, on the other hand, are pretty good at living in the moment.\u201dWhat are these policymakers so worried about? Is this just a bunch of economists living up to their field\u2019s reputation as the dismal science \u2014 or worse, letting their own policy preferences shape their forecasts? Or is the world economy, for all its apparent prosperity, actually in peril?Let\u2019s look at the interrelated threats the economists see.For now, this remains more a theoretical risk than a cause of major disruption to economic expansion.Essentially the Trump administration pattern so far has been to pair belligerent language with comparatively restrained action. Trading partners have worked to find resolutions rather than let a full-scale trade war erupt. There is a tentative deal to renegotiate the United States\u2019 trade agreement with South Korea, for example, and Nafta negotiations are continuing.Global policymakers are worried about more than conflict over trade. They also see an emerging series of financial imbalances and risks that could cause, or worsen, the next downturn.For years, for example, some countries \u2014 Germany, Japan and China prominent among them \u2014 have persistently run current account surpluses, meaning they export more than they import and essentially export capital to the rest of the world. Others, including the United States and Britain, have run persistent current account deficits.Over time, these patterns can create vulnerability to financial shocks; they helped fuel both the 2008 global financial crisis and the 2010 eurozone crisis. And the I.M.F. projects that they will worsen in the next couple of years, despite steady economic growth.The tools to prevent those shifts are within each country\u2019s purview. Germany could spend more on domestic investment, and the United States could reduce its budget deficit, which might start to reduce those imbalances. Neither has much evident political appetite to do so.At the same time, years of efforts by central banks to fuel economic recovery have left interest rates low worldwide and prices in financial markets relatively high.So, for example, if inflation starts to perk up and the world\u2019s central banks raise rates to try to prevent it from taking root, there could be a cascading series of disruptions to financial markets that have become accustomed to cheap money.Another worry: While the major economies look relatively strong right now, they may also prove brittle when the next shock arises.Rather than using this period of stability and prosperity to pay down debts, some major economies are moving in the other direction \u2014 including with rising public debt levels in the United States and high private debt levels in China.\u201cIn the United States, the fiscal impulse is important, but that is something that at some point doesn\u2019t give you any more mileage in terms of growth,\u201d said Agust\u00edn Carstens, general manager of the Bank for International Settlements and former governor of the Bank of Mexico, in an interview Wednesday. \u201cAnd China need to continue improving the quality of growth from the point of view of the dependency on credit.\u201dThat dependency on debt means that whenever the next economic downturn arrives, governments may have less leeway to deal with it by opening the floodgates of public spending.And with interest rates still low across the entire advanced world, one of the normal tools for dealing with a recession still has limited power. For example, the Federal Reserve entered the last downturn with its short-term interest rate at 5.25 percent, before cutting to nearly zero by December 2008. Currently, that target rate is between 1.5 percent and 1.75 percent.The European Central Bank has even less room to maneuver, with its policy rates still near zero.In effect, a decade after the financial crisis, if another recession were to arise, both central banks and fiscal authorities may find themselves short of ammunition to fight it. There is surely an anthropological dimension to the kind of worrying that is emerging from conference halls in Washington this week.The people who end up as central bankers or finance ministers or I.M.F. officials tend to worry a lot about what could go wrong. They also tend to place greater value than most on the kinds of international institutions that underpin the global trade system, of which the Trump administration is deeply skeptical.But there\u2019s also no doubt that the largely good economic news of the moment comes with some warnings worth listening to. Even when enjoying sunny weather, it never hurts to know what you\u2019ll do if it starts to rain. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Falling Dollar Means Investors Should Look Abroad \u2014 Carefully", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySince the start of last year, the dollar has lost more than 12 percent of its value against a basket of foreign currencies. During that same stretch, stock funds that invest abroad have gone from being laggards to leaders.\u201cForeign investments tend to do better when the dollar is weak,\u201d said Jack A. Ablin, chief investment officer for Cresset Wealth Advisors. That\u2019s because \u201cwhen you invest in foreign stocks, you\u2019re actually buying two things \u2014 the foreign equities, but also the foreign currencies needed to buy them,\u201d he said.And as those foreign currencies strengthen against a weak dollar, the returns on foreign investments held by Americans get a lift.Over the last year, European equities have largely been flat when measured in their local currencies. But when translated into dollars, European equities have returned nearly 18 percent over the last 12 months for Americans.Many market observers think the dollar could weaken further, especially as inflationary fears build in the United States. \u201cThe dollar is still fundamentally overvalued against a number of currencies, particularly in the emerging markets,\u201d said Thomas Clarke, a portfolio manager of the William Blair Macro Allocation Fund.Does that mean investors should continue to look overseas? The short answer is yes, market strategists say. But it\u2019s complicated.The falling dollar is a double-edged sword for Americans investing abroad, said Harry W. Hartford, president of Causeway Capital Management.\u201cOn the one hand, if the dollar is weakening versus the euro or the yen or the Swiss franc, the value of your foreign investments is going to go up just on the currency alone,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there\u2019s another impact you cannot ignore.\u201dWhile the foreign funds held by American investors benefit from a currency tailwind, the international companies held within those funds face headwinds as they try to compete against United States businesses whose goods are cheaper because they\u2019re priced in dollars.Mr. Hartford notes that companies in the Morgan Stanley Capital International Europe, Australasia and Far East Index (known as the MSCI EAFE) generate roughly 15 percent of their revenue in the United States and an additional 10 percent in emerging markets, where many currencies are at least partially linked to the dollar.\u201cThe benefits investors will have seen from the decline in the U.S. dollar could be offset by the translation effect on company revenues,\u201d he said.This doesn\u2019t imply that American stock investors should avoid foreign exposure, however.Regardless of how the dollar trades from here, shares of foreign companies are more attractively priced, on average, than domestic stocks.Domestic blue-chip equities, for example, are trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 32, based on 10 years of averaged profits. That\u2019s twice as expensive as they\u2019ve historically been, according to Research Affiliates.By contrast, shares of foreign stocks based in developed economies such as Europe and Japan have a P/E of 17.5, which is a 30 percent discount from their historic median. Emerging market stocks are trading at a P/E of 15.\u201cI look on Europe as a bargain and the emerging markets as a bargain,\u201d said Robert D. Arnott, chairman and chief executive of Research Affiliates. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly happy about nondollar investments because they are cheap and the U.S. stock and bond markets are not.\u201dStill, to benefit from the gains a weak dollar produces while avoiding potential problems, investors may want to focus on specific types of companies \u2014 those domiciled abroad but whose profits are not going to be affected by any further decline in the currency.\u201cOne place to look is international small caps,\u201d said Mr. Ablin said, referring to shares of small companies domiciled abroad with a market value of around $3 billion or less. \u201cThese companies are denominated in foreign currencies. But because they are smaller, they tend to transact most of their business in their home markets.\u201dLast year, 93 percent of the health care company\u2019s revenue was generated in the eurozone and 99 percent in Western Europe, with a majority of sales based in its home country of France.Beyond smaller names, investors can also turn to foreign companies with commodity-based businesses.One important factor is inflation, which has bolstered commodity prices and is a big part of the explanation for the dollar\u2019s fall in the first place, said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group.Mr. Paulsen points out that the dollar fell last year even though the Federal Reserve had been raising rates. Higher rates typically tend to attract more cash flows and lift a currency\u2019s value, but rising \u201cinflation destroys the value of the U.S. dollar,\u201d Mr. Paulsen said.Commodities, as well as other \u201creal assets\u201d like real estate, are viewed as an inflation hedge and tend to outperform in periods of dollar weakness. \u201cThey\u2019re joined at the hip,\u201d Mr. Paulsen said.One good example of a foreign commodity play: Royal Dutch Shell, the multinational oil and energy giant.Though headquartered in the Netherlands and incorporated in the United Kingdom, Royal Dutch Shell reports its earnings in dollars, because oil is priced in that currency.If the dollar is falling because inflation is picking up in the United States earlier than in other parts of the world, then emerging market stocks ought to benefit. Many parts of the emerging world \u2014 such as Latin America \u2014 are dependent on commodities. Moreover, emerging economies are more tied to manufacturing than consumption compared with the developed world, and rising inflation often squeezes consumer companies first.Since the dollar began to sink in January 2017, emerging market equity funds are up 37 percent, nearly twice the gains of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index during that time. And in an earlier stretch in which the dollar was weak \u2014 from 2002 to 2008 \u2014 emerging market funds trounced those focused on the United States by nearly 20 percentage points a year for six years.\u201cA weaker dollar is beneficial to international investments relative to the U.S.,\u201d said Mr. Paulsen. \u201cAnd that\u2019s more true for the emerging markets.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "More Jobs, Faster Growth and Now, the Threat of a Trade War", "Date": "2018-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe rapidly escalating trade conflict with China has upended the prevailing economic dynamic of falling unemployment and faster growth, leaving policymakers and investors scrambling to figure out the way forward.And there was uncertainty in Washington, where lawmakers, lobbyists and even White House officials struggled to discern how much of Mr. Trump\u2019s move was policy and how much was bluster.The president acknowledged that the trade friction could take a toll. \u201cI\u2019m not saying there won\u2019t be a little pain,\u201d he said in a radio interview on Friday. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to have a much stronger country when we\u2019re finished.\u201dYet policymakers are wary of acting too aggressively to slow the economy at a time when wage growth has been tepid. The Fed\u2019s response has been gradual interest-rate increases.A trade war could act as a drag on economic growth, forcing the Fed to be even more cautious. But tariffs could also raise consumer prices by limiting cheap imports from China and other countries. That could increase the risk that the Fed will lift rates too quickly, choking off the recovery.\u201cThere\u2019s an immediate, knee-jerk reaction to tighten policy more,\u201d said Ellen Zentner, chief United States economist for Morgan Stanley.The trade upheaval threatens to undermine an American economy that is at its strongest point since the financial crisis struck a decade ago. Employers have added jobs for 90 consecutive months, by far the longest streak on record; the unemployment rate, at 4.1 percent, is the lowest since 2000.\u201cThe labor market has been strong, and my colleagues and I on the Federal Open Market Committee expect it to remain strong,\u201d Mr. Powell said on Friday, referring to the Fed\u2019s policy group.Wage growth, weak for much of the recovery, ticked up in March, and Mr. Powell said he expected the gains to continue in the months ahead. And while workers would, without a doubt, like to see their pay rise more quickly, the gradual pace is comforting for some investors, who have been watching for any hints that the economy is overheating.In his speech, Mr. Powell said the Fed saw \u201cother signs of economic strength,\u201d citing \u201csteady income gains, rising household wealth and elevated consumer confidence,\u201d which he said would continue to support consumer spending.Other economists agreed, saying that the recently passed tax and spending measures give the economy added momentum. A full-blown trade war might be enough to short-circuit the recovery, they said, but isolated tariffs \u2014 even large ones \u2014 most likely are not.Certain categories are more vulnerable. Among the retaliatory moves announced by China are new tariffs on soybeans, which could hurt American farmers already struggling with low prices for their crops.Just the prospect of tariffs \u2014 even before they begin to take a direct bite \u2014 could hurt the economy if it makes corporate executives reluctant to invest.Becky Frankiewicz, president of ManpowerGroup, a staffing firm, said she was already hearing from clients that they are more hesitant to commit to major projects, at least until they see whether this week\u2019s skirmishes develop into an all-out trade war.\u201cWe\u2019re not seeing the impact directly of tariffs yet, but we would say there\u2019s pretty broad conservatism as a result,\u201d she said.Mr. Powell said Fed policymakers, too, were conscious of concerns from corporate executives.\u201cWe did hear from a number of business leaders around the country that changes in trade policy had become a bit of a risk to the medium-term outlook,\u201d Mr. Powell said in the question-and-answer session.Continued turmoil in financial markets could begin to hurt spending, especially among higher earners, who are more likely to own stocks. Ms. Zentner said surveys suggested that some high-income consumers had already become more pessimistic as markets have become more volatile.\u201cIt\u2019s starting to affect those groups, whose spending is more tied to the stock market,\u201d Ms. Zentner said. \u201cIf they simply pause their spending or become more prudent in their spending because of market volatility, it drags down consumer spending in the aggregate.\u201dMr. Powell, like his predecessor, Janet L. Yellen, cast that gradual series of increases as a carefully planned strategy to ensure that the Fed will not need to raise rates abruptly in the event of a steep rise in inflation. But he also cautioned that policymakers could change course if necessary.\u201cOur views about appropriate monetary policy in the months and years ahead will be informed by incoming economic data and the evolving outlook,\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cIf the outlook changes, so will monetary policy. Our overarching objective will remain the same: fostering a strong economy for all Americans \u2014 one that provides plentiful jobs and low and stable inflation.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trade Wars, Stranded Assets, and the Stock Market (Wonkish)", "Date": "2018-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistAs I write this, China\u2019s announcement of a new round of tit-for-tat tariffs has stoked fears of trade war and sent stock futures plunging. If this morning\u2019s futures hold, the S&P 500 will be about 10.5 percent off its January peak, around 6 percent off its level when Gary Cohn, the last of the Trump \u201cglobalists,\u201d was pushed out.My question is, why such a large fall?One good answer is, that\u2019s a stupid question. The three rules you need to bear in mind when discussing the stock market are (1) the stock market is not the economy (2) the stock market is not the economy (3) the stock market is not the economy. And stocks move for all sorts of reasons, or no visible reason at all. As Paul Samuelson famously quipped, the market has forecast nine of the last five recessions.Another answer is that the trade war is a signal: Trump, Navarro et al are showing that they really are as unhinged and irresponsible as they seem, and markets are taking notice. Imagine how these people would handle a financial crisis.Still, I think it\u2019s worth noting that even if we are headed for a full-scale trade war, conventional estimates of the costs of such a war don\u2019t come anywhere near to 10 percent of GDP, or even 6 percent. In fact, it\u2019s one of the dirty little secrets of international economics that standard estimates of the cost of protectionism, while not trivial, aren\u2019t usually earthshaking either.Yet there is a reason why stock prices might overshoot the overall economic costs of a trade war. For a trade war that \u201cdeglobalized\u201d the U.S. economy would require a big reallocation of resources, including capital. Yet you go to trade war with the capital you have, not the capital you\u2019re eventually going to want \u2013 and stocks are claims on the capital we have now, not the capital we\u2019ll need if America goes all in on Trumponomics.First, about the costs of trade war. This is the wonkish part, so feel free to skim and don\u2019t worry if it seems incomprehensible, as long as you\u2019re willing to accept the bottom line for the sake of argument.And a trade war, by imposing artificial costs such as tariffs on international trade, undoes that productive specialization, making everyone less efficient.We can, with some heroic assumptions, put numbers to the kind of costs involved. Strictly speaking, we should do this using \u201cgeneral equilibrium\u201d \u2013 modeling the economy as a whole. But another dirty little secret of international economics \u2013 much littler than the previous one \u2013 is that you get pretty close with \u201cpartial equilibrium\u201d \u2013 just treating the market for imports as if it were the market for a single product that\u2019s a small part of the economy.If you imagine raising the tariff step by step, then, at each step we are imposing costs on the economy equal to the extra cost of the domestic product that replaces an import. The total costs of the tariff are represented by the area of the triangle: the reduction in imports caused by the tariff, multiplied by (roughly) half the tariff rate.(Somebody is going to ask, what about exports? They\u2019re implicitly included in this estimate. Trust me.)Obviously this is just an illustrative calculation; I\u2019ve tried to use reasonable-ish numbers, but you don\u2019t want to make too much of it. What it does suggest, however, is that even a trade war that drastically rolled back globalization wouldn\u2019t impose costs on the economy comparable to the kinds of movement we\u2019ve seen in stock prices.Since about 1990 corporate America has bet heavily on hyperglobalization \u2013 on the continuance of an open-market regime that has encouraged complex value chains that sprawl across borders. The notebook on which I\u2019m writing this was designed in California, but probably assembled in China, with many of the components coming from South Korea and Japan. Apple could produce it entirely in North America, and probably would in the face of 30 percent tariffs. But the factories it would take to do that don\u2019t (yet) exist.Meanwhile, the factories that do exist were built to serve globalized production \u2013 and many of them would be marginalized, maybe even made worthless, by tariffs that broke up those global value chains. That is, they would become stranded assets. Call it the anti-China shock.Still, my original question was why stocks are dropping so much more than the likely costs of trade war to the economy. And one answer, I\u2019d suggest, is disruption \u2013 which business leaders love to celebrate in their rhetoric, but hate when it happens to them.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "With Eurozone Economy Wavering, E.C.B. Leaves Policy Unchanged", "Date": "2018-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 The eurozone economy has been a puzzle lately. Some indicators are pointing up, some down and some sideways. It\u2019s hard to know whether growth is losing momentum or just pausing for breath.Even the eurozone\u2019s most influential economist, Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, expressed uncertainty on Thursday about what had been going on \u2014 whether recent economic data pointed to \u201cthe beginning of a decline or simply a normalization following a period of very strong growth.\u201dThe central bank\u2019s Governing Council didn\u2019t even discuss monetary policy during a meeting earlier in the day, Mr. Draghi said, preferring not to tamper with the status quo until there was more information. \u201c\u2018A steady hand\u2019 were words used\u201d in the council\u2019s discussion, Mr. Draghi said at a news conference.If he had sounded worried that growth was sputtering, that could have meant that the bank would take longer than expected to wean the eurozone off monetary stimulus. But his expression of concern on Thursday was not strong enough to prompt analysts to recalculate their estimates of when the Governing Council, the bank\u2019s policy-setting committee, will end its de facto money-printing program.However, the euro fell against the dollar after Mr. Draghi\u2019s remarks, a sign that they may have made traders more pessimistic about the outlook for the eurozone.The central bank has promised to continue the stimulus at least until September, and most analysts expect it to begin winding down the program soon after that. Many analysts now expect the central bank to provide a clearer picture of its intentions at its next meeting, in June.Among professional economists, there is no consensus about what is going on in the 19-nation eurozone. Every day seems to bring a new indicator that conflicts with one the day before.Amid so much uncertainty, Mr. Draghi\u2019s view of growth is critical. He has a large staff of experts and access to data not available to private sector economists, not to mention a doctorate in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.And unlike the view of your average economist, Mr. Draghi\u2019s is partly self-fulfilling. If he displays confidence, banks will be more eager to lend, businesses may be more willing to invest in expansion and to hire more people and, lo, it will be so.For financial markets, the key question in the weeks to come is whether recent economic data will alter the European Central Bank\u2019s schedule for ending the measures it used to keep the eurozone together during an existential debt crisis. Chiefly, the bank bought hundreds of billions of euros in government and corporate bonds as a way of pumping money into the economy.September is expected to be the last month of the purchases, though the bank will continue to reinvest money it gets back when bonds mature. The aim is to gently bring monetary policy back to normal. Sometime late next year, or maybe not even until 2020, the European Central Bank will then probably begin raising its benchmark interest rates, currently at a historic low of zero, for the first time since 2011.Any indication by the Governing Council that it is revising its timetable would be big news. But the council takes the long view and has shown in recent months that it won\u2019t be thrown off course by a few unsettling economic indicators.One thing is virtually certain: The bank is not likely to signal any acceleration of its schedule for ending the stimulus.\u201cIt would take a bold central bank to tighten monetary conditions when the economy is contracting, or even just slowing,\u201d Carl Weinberg, chief international economist for High Frequency Economics in New York, said in a note to clients.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Farmers\u2019 Anger at Trump Tariffs Puts Republican Candidates in a Bind", "Date": "2018-04-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As President Trump moves to fulfill one of the central promises of his campaign \u2014 to get tough on an ascendant China \u2014 he faces a potential rebellion from a core constituency: farmers and other agricultural producers who could suffer devastating losses in a trade war.Mr. Trump\u2019s threat to impose tariffs on Chinese goods came with a presidential declaration that trade wars are good and easily won. But the action has injected damaging uncertainty into the economy as Republicans are already struggling to maintain their hold on the House and the Senate in a difficult election year.While the battle for control of the House will be waged in large part in the suburbs, rural districts in Southern Illinois, Iowa, Arkansas and Missouri could prove important. And control of the Senate could come down to Republican efforts to unseat Democrats in North Dakota, Indiana, Missouri and Montana \u2014 all states staring down the barrels of a trade war\u2019s guns.With farmers angry and worried as China vows to retaliate, many Republicans find themselves torn between loyalty to a president who remains broadly popular in rural states and the demands of constituents, especially farmers, to oppose his tariffs.In North Dakota, a major soybean-producing state, Representative Kevin Cramer, a Republican who is running for the Senate, sounded restrained this past week when he urged Mr. Trump to \u201ctake a more measured approach\u201d to China. By Friday, he sounded panicked.China\u2019s aggressive response to Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs is aimed squarely at products produced in the American heartland, a region that helped send him to the White House. A trade war with China could be particularly devastating to rural economies, especially for pig farmers and soybean and corn growers. Nearly two-thirds of United States soybean exports go to China.The tariffs have not yet gone into effect, and the administration is engaging in back-channel talks with the Chinese to try to resolve their differences.In the meantime, Mr. Trump has been escalating his threats, and shows no sign of backing off. On Thursday night, he threatened to impose tariffs on an additional $100 billion in Chinese products.Trump administration officials argue that the tariffs on Chinese goods, while not intended to help certain American industries, are necessary to prevent China from continuing to violate international trade rules. They say that less aggressive measures by past administrations failed, and that China has stolen American jobs and technology that are the key to future prosperity.\u201cIt\u2019s not possible to have true gain without the pain,\u201d said Dan DiMicco, a trade adviser to Mr. Trump during the presidential campaign. \u201cThe battle is worth the victory, and we will win.\u201dBut farm-state Republicans like Mr. Cramer believe that their constituents could be a casualty, and they are begging the Department of Agriculture to intervene.Mr. Trump has directed the department to implement a plan to help farmers cope with the damage from tariffs. But few details have been forthcoming about how such a program would work or how much it might cost. And it is not clear how much the Agriculture Department could do to remedy the damage done to key trading relations in a global economy.The secretary of agriculture has some authority to help farmers by creating new programs that could draw on funds from the Treasury. For instance, the secretary could direct the Commodity Credit Corporation, a government-owned entity, to purchase soybeans to buoy farmers\u2019 revenues, said Kent Conrad, a former Democratic senator from North Dakota.In the past, these powers have been used to provide relief from wildfires and other natural disasters, farm groups said. But such a program could be time-consuming and costly.If the White House does end up subsidizing farmers, that may open trade conflicts on other fronts. Chad P. Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said that such a measure could spark trade challenges from countries beyond China, which would object to unfair competition from American agriculture.Patrick Delaney, a spokesman for the American Soybean Association, said his group was still focused on trying to prevent the tariffs from going into effect, rather than examining what kind of measures the administration might take to support farmers.\u201cIt\u2019s a whole lot easier not to wreck the car in the first place than it is to think about what a repair might look like,\u201d he said.Farmers have been among the most organized groups in lobbying the administration about its trade policy. But as trade tensions with China have escalated, farmers say these complaints appear to be falling on deaf ears. Many of them are now complaining to Congress.For Republicans like Mr. Cramer, who is in a tough race against an incumbent Democrat, Senator Heidi Heitkamp, the president\u2019s threat to sharply escalate the administration\u2019s tariffs on Chinese imports \u2014 and China\u2019s threat to retaliate against American farm products \u2014 spells trouble in this year\u2019s midterm races. Mr. Cramer\u2019s aides did not respond to requests for comment.\u201cThere\u2019s no question that it puts Republicans in a tough spot, because they\u2019ve got to talk to their farmers and affected business owners about the negative impact of the tariff, which I\u2019m sure they are hearing complaints about,\u201d said Scott Jennings, a Republican strategist in Kentucky. \u201cOn the other hand, they\u2019ve got constituents who probably think it\u2019s a good idea for the president to stand up to China.\u201dA number of Republicans are pushing back against the president. In Iowa, Representative David Young, who represents a district that Mr. Trump carried by just four percentage points, has publicly urged Mr. Trump to negotiate before imposing tariffs. His state is a major producer of soybean, grain and pork products, and farmers there are already seeing prices drop.Iowa\u2019s senators \u2014 Joni Ernst and Charles E. Grassley, both Republicans \u2014 have called on Mr. Trump to reconsider. In a statement, Ms. Ernst cited the \u201creal danger that increased tariffs on U.S. exports will harm Iowa producers and undermine the rural economy,\u201d and she said she had spoken directly with the president about it.The clash with China began last month, when Mr. Trump imposed tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum, fulfilling a central promise of his campaign. China responded with tariffs on $3 billion worth of American products, including pork, fruit and other items.Then, in late March, the president announced plans to impose tariffs on $50 billion worth of goods from China. Once again, China retaliated; this past week, it proposed its own tariff measure on $50 billion in American products, which, in turn, goaded Mr. Trump to propose the additional tariffs on Thursday night.It remains to be seen if China will answer Mr. Trump\u2019s latest tariff threat with an escalation of its own.In addition to soybean farmers, carmakers and Boeing would be hit hard by China\u2019s tariffs. Many American companies purchase products from Chinese factories, while others rely on the country\u2019s vast consumer market to sell their goods.The trade spat with China also comes on the heels of Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade accord that was to rope in countries on both sides of the Pacific in an alliance against a rising Beijing. The administration is also renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement. Both were valuable deals for American farmers, and Mr. Trump\u2019s move to upend them had already set agricultural producers on edge.Suffering has come quickly for the sector on the stock market. Investors dumped stocks linked to agriculture on Friday. Deere & Company and the fertilizer giant Mosaic dropped nearly 4 percent, while the fertilizer maker CF Industries fell by 4.5 percent.While some farmers and lawmakers have expressed hope that Mr. Trump\u2019s threats are merely a negotiating tactic, administration officials insisted this past week that was not the case.\u201cThere is the potential of a trade war,\u201d Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said in an interview with CNBC. \u201cThere is a level of risk that we could get into a trade war.\u201dMr. Mnuchin said he was hopeful that talks with his Chinese counterparts could avert a damaging escalation of tit-for-tat tariffs, but he declined to elaborate on the status of talks and whether he thought an agreement could be reached.The president\u2019s new economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said Mr. Trump\u2019s threat to China was not a bluff.\u201cTrump is not just using tariffs as a negotiating card. He said that to me,\u201d Mr. Kudlow told reporters on Friday.But the White House strategy to press China to reform its economic behavior seemed unclear. Mr. Kudlow said that the administration was holding back-channel talks with the Chinese, but that he would not characterize them as negotiations. He added that the United States was considering providing China with a list of the changes the United States would like to see, but that it had not yet done so.\u201cI cannot guarantee that, but it\u2019s something that is under discussion,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said.Matt Phillips contributed reporting from New York.Follow Sheryl Gay Stolberg and Ana Swanson on Twitter: @SherylNYT @AnaSwansonAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Looming China Trade Action Divides Industry and Roils Markets", "Date": "2018-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s promise to take tough action against China\u2019s unfair economic practices was one of his most popular campaign ideas. But as the United States prepares stiff trade measures and China retaliates, stock markets have plummeted and some of America\u2019s biggest companies are pushing back.Industry giants like General Electric and Goldman Sachs, as well as agricultural companies, have lodged objections with the White House, saying that tariffs on both sides of the Pacific and limitations on investments will cut off American companies from the world\u2019s most lucrative and rapidly growing market.Since then, the White House has announced another trade measure targeted at China that would place tariffs on at least $50 billion worth of products imported to the United States and would restrict investment flows between the two economic giants. This week, the Trump administration is expected to announce a list of Chinese imports subject to tariffs, which could include high-tech products like semiconductors as well as cheap electronics and other goods that many Americans buy.Josh Kallmer, the senior vice president for global policy at the Information Technology Industry Council, an advocate for companies like Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and IBM, said his group had been largely supportive of the administration\u2019s targeting of China\u2019s unfair trade practices. But the group had made it clear to the White House that it would not be pleased with any measure that had tariffs \u201cas the primary or even a significant remedy.\u201d\u201cThe reason is that it would be a tax on consumers,\u201d Mr. Kallmer said, \u201cprecisely the people we are trying to support.\u201dThat theory could make it more difficult for American companies to operate in a country that already puts up steep barriers.As Mr. Trump advances a series of tough trade measures to confront these behaviors, however, cracks have appeared in American industry\u2019s seemingly united front.Companies in technology, investment and other industries now say that the measures the administration is taking to help them may actually end up doing irreparable harm to supply chains they have built up over decades. Any American company that wants to be a global player cannot afford to lose access to China\u2019s growing market, executives say.The 25 percent tariff on pork that China imposed on Monday is expected to be particularly harmful, including in regions that supported the president, like Iowa, North Carolina and Indiana. Last year, American farmers sent more than a billion dollars\u2019 worth of pork to China, their largest export market by value after Japan and Mexico.\u201cBecause we\u2019re so blessed to have America feed the world, we\u2019re also the first industry to get slammed whenever there are trade difficulties between the U.S. and other countries,\u201d Denise Bode, the coordinator for the American Fruit and Vegetable Processors and Growers Coalition.\u201cAmerican farmers appear to be the first casualties of an escalating trade war,\u201d said Max Baucus, a former Democratic senator from Montana and a chairman of a group called Farmers for Free Trade. \u201cWith farm incomes already declining, farmers rely on export markets to stay above water. These new tariffs are a drag on their ability to make ends meet.\u201dHowever, analysts and companies involved in China said that these measures appeared unlikely to adequately resolve American concerns about China\u2019s longstanding encroachment on American intellectual property.Companies are waiting anxiously for the administration to release a list of Chinese products this week that will be subject to tariffs \u2014 most likely the kind of high-tech products that the administration has accused China of targeting. The retail industry, which lobbied the administration and Congress against an early plan to impose tariffs on Chinese-made apparel and footwear, is now cautiously optimistic that its products will be exempt.G.E. and IBM, which operate through joint ventures and other partnerships in China and around the world, have both lobbied against the expansion of Cfius over concerns that restrictions on joint ventures with foreign companies that include the transfer of valuable skills or technology could weaken the position of American companies abroad.Financial firms, including Goldman Sachs and the Carlyle Group, have also expressed concern about investment restrictions, saying they could provide a drag on the United States economy.White House advisers, in turn, have complained that previous approaches to dealing with China have not worked, and that companies are overreacting to legitimate trade measures.Speaking Monday on CNBC, the White House trade adviser, Peter Navarro, defended the administration\u2019s tough actions on China and said investors should not fear a trade war.\u201cEverybody needs to relax,\u201d Mr. Navarro said. \u201cThe economy is as strong as an ox.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "China Strikes Back at the U.S. With Plans for Its Own Tariffs", "Date": "2018-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 China hit back at the United States on Wednesday with proposed tariffs on $50 billion worth of American soybeans, cars, chemicals and other goods, in a move likely to stoke fears that the countries\u2019 escalating confrontation could become an all-out trade war.Moving with unusual speed, Chinese officials outlined plans to make it more costly to import 106 types of American goods into China. They are intended to hit the United States square in the farm belt \u2014 a major section of President Trump\u2019s political support but also a major supplier of what China stocks in its supermarkets.\u201cChina has never succumbed to external pressure,\u201d Zhu Guangyao, vice minister of finance, said at a news briefing on Wednesday. He added, \u201cExternal pressure will only make the Chinese people more focused on economic development.\u201dThe question now is whether the two sides will intensify their efforts to punish each other before they sit down to negotiate. Neither set of tariffs go into effect right away, though the exact timing of the Chinese measures was not clear.Letting the dispute turn into a test of wills would be a mistake, said Jie Zhao, a senior research fellow at Fudan University in Shanghai.\u201cWe should negotiate in a professional way,\u201d Ms. Zhao said, \u201cand make it less ideological and emotional.\u201dBy contrast, because the United States imports significantly more from China, tariffs on the same amount of products make up roughly one-ninth of its Chinese imports. That gives the United States more room to find other Chinese products to target.Even as Chinese officials struck a defiant tone on Wednesday, they still said they wanted to avoid escalating the conflict.\u201cChina\u2019s attitude is clear,\u201d Mr. Zhu, the vice minister of finance, said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want a trade war because a trade war would hurt the interests of both countries.\u201dMany companies in Europe and the United States say they fear the program will create state-supported competitors, an argument that has won backing in the Trump administration. Some companies say that Beijing finds ways to force them to hand over technology if they want to sell their wares in China, an allegation that Chinese officials dispute.For now, China\u2019s new tariffs could create a more immediate issue for the Trump administration.While they include plenty of goods Americans make, they have a heavy focus on products Americans grow: soybeans, corn, cotton, beef, frozen orange juice, even tobacco and whiskey. Many of those products come largely from Republican-dominated states, where lawmakers might be expected to have some influence with President Trump and could therefore persuade him to back down from his latest trade demands.For manufactured goods, the new Chinese tariffs include cars and car parts, plastics, aerospace products and chemicals. Many of those products are also sold by European companies, giving Chinese buyers alternatives. The new tariffs announced on Wednesday will amount to 25 percent on the American products.Chinese officials \u2014 who blamed President Trump for provoking the clash \u2014 have appealed to the World Trade Organization, which sets trade rules and moderates disputes, to resolve the feud. But both sides risk censure by the W.T.O. \u2014 the Trump administration for its tariffs, and China for swiftly retaliating without a proper review.\u201cA key time has come for the United States and China to form a new consensus that includes intellectual property and the opening up of markets,\u201d said Song Guoyou, the deputy chief of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University. \u201cOtherwise, trade may fluctuate a lot.\u201dKeith Bradsher reported from Shanghai, and Steven Lee Myers from Beijing.

{"Headline": "A Big Reason Wall Street Is Flocking to Spotify: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Good Tuesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Spotify\u2019s shares opened at $165.90.\u2022 If the markets fall again, we have some possible explanations.\u2022 Should Facebook offer \u201cWhy Me?\u201d buttons?\u2022 Disney has offered to buy Sky News to help Fox\u2019s Sky bid.Spotify is a loss-making company that might not report a profit until next decade, but that didn\u2019t stop investors from valuing the company at $30 billion when it debuted Tuesday on the United States stock market.Spotify is an impressive company. Its loyal, paying customer base is enormous and is expected to keep growing. Also, Spotify has so far held its own in the face of competition from Apple, Amazon and Google, all of which want to win new subscribers to their music streaming services.But there is an important reason that Wall Street is flocking to Spotify: It is doing a great job at getting record companies to roll over.Spotify\u2019s main cost is what it pays record companies for the music it streams to its customers. As Spotify has grown, that expense has fallen as a share of its total revenue, which shows that Spotify is negotiating increasingly advantageous deals with record companies.That has bolstered Spotify\u2019s gross profit margin, which measures how much money a company keeps after paying out the costs directly related to generating its revenue. Last year, that margin was 21 percent of revenue at Spotify, well up from 14 percent in 2016.Crucially, though, Spotify has said it expects its gross margin to expand to as much as 35 percent over the longer term. In other words, as Spotify\u2019s spending on music grows, so will its leverage over record companies. And it may well achieve its gross margin target. After all, Netflix, which occupies a similar position in the market for streaming video, has a gross margin of 35 percent.But Spotify\u2019s main rivals could complicate things. What if Amazon offered record companies better terms than Spotify? That would reduce Spotify\u2019s bargaining power, making it harder to deliver wider gross margins investors are expecting. And Amazon, along with Apple and Google, has far deeper pockets to slog it out over the long term.\u2014 Peter EavisSpotify\u2019s unusual path to the public markets was a success.On its first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the music streaming service finished with a valuation of $26.5 billion.Spotify\u2019s shares opened at $165.90 before closing at $149.01.That\u2019s well above the high of $132.50 that its shares changed hands at in private transactions this year. It\u2019s also well above the $137.50 the WSJ reported its private shares were trading at during the past week.Spotify had eschewed a typical initial public offering in favor of a direct listing. That meant there was no \u201cdeal price\u201d for investors to reference on the first day of trading and no underwriters acting as stabilizing agents if the stock began to plunge.Despite all that, Spotify\u2019s valuation at the close on Tuesday ranks among the highest for a tech company debuting on an American exchange.Here\u2019s a look at the tech companies with the 10 biggest market capitalizations after their first day of trading, courtesy of Dealogic:Alibaba \u2014 $233.9 billionFacebook \u2014 $81.7 billionPalm \u2014 $53.3 billionInfineon Technologies \u2014 $47.9 billionJD.com \u2014 $28.9 billionSnap \u2014 $28.9 billionGoogle \u2014 $27.2 billionSpotify \u2014 $26.5 billionTwitter \u2014 $24.9 billionAgilent \u2014 $20.1 billionTesla said:\u2022 It built 2,020 Model 3s in the past seven days.

With a starting price of $35,000, the car is supposed to be more affordable than Tesla\u2019s other cars. The company has been counting on a quick expansion of its Model 3 business to increase revenue.The president reiterated his claim that Amazon is \u201ccosting the United States Postal Service massive amounts of money\u201d in a post to Twitter on Tuesday morning.Shares are essentially flat on the day.\u201cPackage delivery has been a bright spot for a service that\u2019s lost money for 11 straight years. The losses are mostly due to pension and health care costs \u2014 not the business deal for the Postal Service to deliver packages for Amazon. Boosted by e-commerce, the Postal Service has enjoyed double-digit increases in revenue from delivering packages, but that hasn\u2019t been enough to offset declines in first-class letters and marketing mail, which together make up more than two-thirds of postal revenue.\u201cWhile the Postal Service\u2019s losses can\u2019t be attributed to its package business, Trump\u2019s claim that it could get more bang for its buck may not be entirely far-fetched.

{"Headline": "Russian Markets Reel After U.S. Imposes New Sanctions", "Date": "2018-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRussia paid a price in the financial markets on Monday for its standoff with the West.Investors dumped Russian stocks, bonds and the ruble in the face of new American sanctions and signs of cracks in the relationship between President Trump and Vladimir V. Putin, Russia\u2019s president.The sell-off left Russian stocks down more than 8 percent and sharply raised borrowing costs for some of the country\u2019s most important companies. The ruble dropped more than 4 percent against the dollar, and the price of government bonds fell.The combined effect is that life will be at least a bit more expensive for Russian companies and consumers.\u201cWe\u2019re still dealing with an economy that is run by an authoritarian regime that is very dependent on global oil and oil prices,\u201d said Jacob Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of downside, and most of it is geopolitical.\u201dOf course, none of this is a grave threat to the Russian economy, or to Mr. Putin, as long as oil prices \u2014 up roughly 25 percent over the last year \u2014 remain relatively high.Since Russia\u2019s military involvement in Ukraine four years ago, relations with the West have corroded to their worst level since the Cold War.Then on Sunday, after a deadly chemical attack, Mr. Trump took a rare swipe at Mr. Putin for his support of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria.\u201cMany dead, including women and children, in mindless CHEMICAL attack in Syria,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. \u201cPresident Putin, Russia and Iran are responsible for backing Animal Assad.\u201dA tweet might appear minor, but it signaled to investors that Russia is likely to remain at risk of further sanctions.\u201cAnyone who had hopes that sanctions might be lifted, it\u2019s not happening,\u201d said William Jackson, the senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics.Despite Moscow\u2019s rancorous relationship with the United States and Europe, investors have tiptoed back into Russian stocks and bonds over the last year, as the economy proved resilient to the raft of sanctions in recent years.Inflation, which surged after the sharp drop in the ruble in 2014, has declined. After shrinking in 2015 and 2016, the Russian economy grew a modest 1.5 percent last year, thanks to rising global prices for oil. (The oil and gas sector accounts for an estimated 25 percent of the gross domestic product, according to Goldman Sachs.)The new round of sanctions jeopardizes those gains.Companies targeted by the latest round of American sanctions suffered some of the sharpest drops Monday. The shares of United Company Rusal, one of the world\u2019s largest aluminum producers, fell more than 20 percent. The company was included in the Treasury Department\u2019s sanctions.The stock sell-off spread to large Russian banks, with Sberbank tumbling 17 percent and VTB 9 percent.The widespread nature of the rout \u2014 battering companies not directly controlled by the Kremlin and roiling the normally resilient bond markets \u2014 is a sign of how nervous investors suddenly are about Russia\u2019s prospects, especially the possibility of sanctions targeting a wider range of people and companies.\u201cIt is very hard to evaluate who is going to be included on the list in the future, if this happens again,\u201d said Vladimir Tikhomirov, chief economist at BCS Global Markets in Moscow. \u201cRussia country risk has increased quite substantially.\u201dAndrew E.

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Facebook reports earnings\u2022 Twitter\u2019s strong results were driven by an impressive performance overseas.\u2022 The fight is on for Sky.\u2022 Why investors are feeling blue.\u2022 What\u2019s behind the fight over an important banking regulation.- Peter Eavis\u2022 Net income rose 63 percent to $4.99 billion, up from $3.06 billion a year ago.\u2022 Earnings per share came in at $1.69. Analysts expectations of $1.35 per share.\u2022 Revenue jumped 49 percent to 11.97 billion.

But anyone wanting to assess where the stellar foreign growth came from \u2013 and whether it can continue \u2014 would have little company data with which to work.Twitter on Monday did not break down international revenues by region. It did say that Japan, its second largest source of revenue, brought in $117 million, a 61 percent increase. Facebook, in contrast, releases revenue and user numbers for four regions. That Twitter offers limited international data is perhaps not that surprising, given that the company does not release a tally for daily active users, a number Facebook provides. (Twitter does release a growth number for daily users but only provides an actual total for monthly active users.)Twitter\u2019s revenue trends may at some point prompt it to divulge more. Foreign advertising revenue accounted for half its sales in the first quarter, compared with 40 percent in the same period a year ago.Ned Segal, Twitter\u2019s chief financial officer, on Wednesday said the strength of international revenue could mean that they account for more than half of the total. In the first quarter, foreign ad revenue surged 51 percent, compared with the year-earlier period. In the United States, the increase was just 1 percent.Mr. Segal did mention some first-quarter \u201chighlights\u201d for the international operations. A good ad sales performance and audience growth powered Japan\u2019s results, he said, adding that ads outside of China for Chinese exporters were also a source of strength. Britain, Brazil and the Middle East were also bright spots, Mr. Segal said.Twitter\u2019s stock slid on Wednesday despite the good numbers. With a little more clarity, investors may be willing to give them more weight.- Peter EavisComcast has formally bid nearly $31 billion for the European broadcaster. Sky has withdrawn its recommendation of Fox\u2019s year-and-a-half-old bid for full control.What\u2019s next?Keep these dates in mind\u2022 On May 1, Britain\u2019s competition regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority, is expected to offer its recommendation on whether Fox\u2019s bid should allowed to go through.\u2022 By June 13 or so, Britain\u2019s culture secretary, Matthew Hancock, is expected to make a final decision on Fox\u2019s offer.In the meantime, Comcast is working to obtain regulatory approvals for its own bid. Given the American telecom giant\u2019s relatively small presence in Britain, that shouldn\u2019t be too much of an issue.\u2014 Michael de la MercedPutting together a nearly $31 billion takeover requires a fair amount of help. Here\u2019s who\u2019s working for Comcast and Sky \u2014 and Fox, which may come back with a higher bid.Comcast\u2022 Robey Warshaw, the small boutique investment bank run by \u201cthe two Simons.\u201d Both Mr. Robey and Mr. Warshaw are on the deal.\u2022 Evercore Partners, led by co-founder Roger Altman and senior deal maker Eduardo Mestre\u2022 Bank of America Merrill Lynch (which is working as corporate brokers, a peculiarly British function that is something like relationship banking and market surveillance), led by Adrian Mee, a global co-head of M.&A., and Tim Waddell, a vice chairman of corporate and investment banking for Europe and a veteran corporate broker.\u2022 Wells Fargo, led by Stephen Locke, a managing director.Sky\u2022 Morgan Stanley (financial adviser and corporate broker), led by Simon Smith, head of investment banking in Europe; Anthony Zammit, a managing director; and Ben Grindley of corporate broking.\u2022 PJT Partners, led by partners Simon Lyons and Scott Matlock.\u2022 Barclays (as financial adviser and corporate broker), led by Mark Astaire, chairman of corporate broking and Richard Taylor, co-head of investment banking.Fox\u2022 Centerview Partners, led by co-founder and longtime Fox adviser Blair Effron and partners David Cohen and James Hartop\u2022 Goldman Sachs, led by investment banking co-head and longtime Fox adviser John Waldron; Mark Sorrell, head of M.&A. for EMEA (and a son of Martin Sorrell); and managing directors Mike Smith and Owain Evans\u2022 JPMorgan Chase, led by Jennifer Nason, global chairwoman of T.M.T.; Hugo Baring, co-head of T.M.T. banking for EMEA; Marco Caggiano, a managing director; and Dwayne Lysaght, head of U.K. M.&A.How the offers stack up:\u2022 Comcast: \u00a312.50 a share, and pledges to maintain Sky News\u2019s independence\u2022 Fox: \u00a310.75 a share for the 61 percent of Sky it doesn\u2019t yet own. (Disney, which had already agreed to buy the bulk of Fox in a separate deal, has also offered to buy Sky News to satisfy editorial independence concerns.)Financial companies are on the brink of having one of their top demands granted: an end to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s public database of complaints about their products and services.What\u2019s in the databaseWhy finance institutions want it shut downThey say the database can be misleading because the agency publishes a record of all the complaints that it receives, without vetting them. The companies also argue that they already have channels for resolving customer disputes.Why consumer groups say that could be problematicConsumer groups argue that taking the database offline would neuter one of its core purposes: pushing companies to take complaints more seriously.More than 185,000 complaints to the bureau have been resolved with some form of compensation or relief, often with financial institutions changing their practices or making customers whole.The social media company became the latest firm to easily beat expectations, only to have its shares tumble.If those stock moves sound familiar, that\u2019s because similar moves happened at 3M and Caterpillar on Tuesday. Despite meeting expectations, 3M tumbled after it lowered the high end of its outlook. Caterpillar, meanwhile, raised its guidance for the year, but comments on its conference call that the first quarter would be the \u201chigh-water mark\u201d for earnings per share sent the stock sliding.Why such big moves? It\u2019s worth pointing back to what DealBook\u2019s Peter Eavis wrote Tuesday:\u201cDespite all the bullish talk about earnings and the economy, stocks looked vulnerable going into the first-quarter earnings season. Analysts are expecting earnings for companies in the S.&P. 500 to grow 25 percent this year, an unusually large increase. At the 2018 forecast, the S.&P. 500 looks temperately valued at 17 times earnings. But looking back, stocks appear expensive, at 21 times the S.&P. 500\u2019s earnings for 2017. This large gap between future and historical valuations creates a chasm that stocks can fall into if profits disappoint. If companies, like 3M did on Tuesday, provide underwhelming earnings outlooks, investors will stop believing that stocks are cheap, based on 2018 earnings.\u201dIn the case of Twitter, the stock is up about 30 percent this year and more than 75 percent since late October. A rally like that leaves little room to disappoint.Wall Street executives are eagerly awaiting a relaxation of the supplemental leverage rule, which governs how much their firms can borrow. The Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of Currency are for it; the F.D.I.C. and Lael Brainard, an Obama administration appointee at the Fed, are opposed.Why relax the rule? It\u2019s making it too hard for banks to do business. \u201cThe best analogy is that it\u2019s like having the same speed limit for every road in the country,\u201d Greg Baer of the Clearing House Association told Peter.Why keep it? The rule provides adequate protection in case there\u2019s another downturn, and banks have been doing fine otherwise. \u201cU.S. bank lending has been healthy over recent years and profits are strong,\u201d Ms. Brainerd said in a speech last week.\u2022 There are more Republican senators and Democratic governors named John than there are women in either group.\u2022 There are almost as many C.E.O.s named John in the Fortune 500 as female C.E.O.s in that group.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Brexit Vote, Town\u2019s Nostalgia for Seafaring Past Muddied Its Future", "Date": "2018-04-23", "News": "Branded \u201cidiots,\u201d residents of Grimsby, England, choose romance for a dying fishing industry over another that is thriving.Supported byGRIMSBY, England \u2014 There aren\u2019t a lot of fishermen left in this town in North East England, once home to one of the largest fleet of trawlers in Britain. But nostalgia for the fishing industry permeates the place. So the result seemed inevitable when 70 percent of residents voted to leave the European Union. Britain\u2019s fishermen have complained for years about regulations imposed on all members. The surprise came later when a local business group began lobbying to avoid tariffs, customs and the other burdens of departing the European Union. Social media scorn ensued. In thousands of tweets across the country, the people of Grimsby were derided as dummies and hypocrites. Either they wanted the upsides of Brexit with none of its costs, or they didn\u2019t grasp the harm that leaving would cause until it was too late.\u201cGrimsby residents branded \u2018idiots\u2019 for Brexit vote as seafood industry seeks free trade deal,\u201d read a headline in a local newspaper.\u201cSome industries that are economically insignificant have enormous public resonance,\u201d said Bronwen Maddox, director of the Institute for Government, an independent think tank in London. \u201cAnd because of that, they have political influence that is way out of proportion.\u201dIt isn\u2019t fishermen who are pushing for a kind of exemption from Brexit. It is a group of fish processors, an industry that is thriving in Grimsby, where fish from all over the world are gutted, packaged and sold to wholesalers. This town of around 88,000 is a hub in a global supply chain.\u201cWe haven\u2019t fished here for 25 years,\u201d said Simon Dwyer, who leads Seafood Grimsby & Humber Group, the organization arguing for a special free trade deal. \u201cWe\u2019ve reinvented ourselves.\u201dThe once-bustling docks here would be pretty desolate were it not for 70 processing warehouses with some 5,000 employees, about one-third of whom are foreign nationals, mostly Poles and Lithuanians. To stay competitive, these companies want the kind of frictionless trade and immigration policy that they currently enjoy, and will probably lose, after Brexit.The goal of fishermen, on the other hand, is regaining full control of British waters so that they aren\u2019t forced to compete with trawlers from other countries.The first problem with this dream is the scarcity of local fishermen. Today, there are not enough here to fill a service elevator.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t put it past 20,\u201d said John Hancock, a skipper with three decades of experience and a fan of Brexit. \u201cAnd most of them are retired or dead.\u201dSo how did the interests of a tiny, shrinking industry defeat a larger, thriving one at the polls? While active fisherman here are nearly extinct, the job maintains an almost folkloric hold throughout Britain. Brexit passed for a complex variety of reasons in Grimsby and elsewhere, including fears about immigration, sovereignty and the loss of a way of life. All of those factors played a role here and will privilege a moribund industry at the expense of one that is growing.A similar calculus is evident in the United States, where President Trump has promised to resuscitate coal mining. It\u2019s an industry that now employs roughly 55,000 people, a figure that has been trending downward for years. If economic agendas were driven strictly by data, a lot more would be heard about solar power, which employs about five times the number of people.In Grimsby, the fishing past is very much alive. Pubs are filled with sepia-toned photographs of the town in its 1950s heyday, when 500 boats were crammed into what was then one of the largest ports in the world. Locals speak wistfully about the work of their fathers, taking an almost perverse pleasure in underscoring the hardships that were part of their lives.\u201cWhen I was a kid, I hardly saw my dad for 20 years,\u201d said Steve Swallow, a port operative who was having a drink at the JD Wetherspoon pub one recent afternoon. \u201cHe used to go to Iceland, Norway, the Arctic Circle, and that\u2019s like a month\u2019s trip.\u201dOn occasion, these voyages yielded no income at all. The owners of trawlers were always paid first, and when hauls weren\u2019t large enough, fishermen went home empty-handed. It was known as \u201clanding in debt.\u201d\u201cYou needed a cup of sugar,\u201d Mr. Swallow said, \u201cyou\u2019d go ask your neighbor.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a recording of an actual BBC broadcast,\u201d said Dave Ornsby, the center\u2019s operations officer. \u201cThirty-two ships from Grimsby sank in the \u201950s.\u201dApparently, none of this work or lifestyle appeals to British youths.\u201cYou can\u2019t get young people to fish these days,\u201d said Danny Normandale, a skipper with three decades of experience. \u201cIf you say to them, \u2018I\u2019ll take you if you\u2019re willing to learn,\u2019 their next question is, \u2018Do you have Wi-Fi on the boat? Do you have the internet?\u2019\u201dIn other words, Britain exports most of what it catches and imports most of what it eats. Either the country will need to change its appetite or it will need to trade.With enough investment and the right incentives, he believes that British fleets could catch as much as $5 billion worth of fish a year, five times their current annual haul.\u201cAfter Brexit, our government won\u2019t be in a position to create more fish,\u201d Mr. Boyers said. \u201cWe\u2019re all cogs in wheels. If you don\u2019t integrate, you won\u2019t get anywhere.\u201dThe cog that Mr. Boyers oversees is one of the few that are largely unchanged from decades ago. The daily auction takes place in a chilled and cavernous hall, which one recent morning was filled with more than 2,500 yellow boxes of fish on ice, each weighing about 110 pounds. A scrum of wholesalers looked over the merchandise and then trailed auctioneers holding pen and paper.The scene unfolded the same way 30 years ago except for one detail: Nearly all of the fish now come via the highway. They are off-loaded at a port eight miles away then packed onto a truck. The residents of Grimsby are well aware of the role that fish processing plays in the local economy, and many doubt that a sizable fishing fleet will ever return. \u201cEurope needs the U.K. more than the other way around,\u201d said Ian Thompson, a Grimsby resident and former merchant marine, having a drink under one of those sepia-toned photographs. \u201cWe will prevail.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the population of Grimsby, England. It is around 88,000, not 27,000.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Grumpy Investors Can\u2019t Find Anything to Look Forward To", "Date": "2018-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe stock market is forward-looking. That\u2019s a problem when there\u2019s not much to look forward to.Stocks sank for the fourth-straight day on Tuesday, as investors looked past a series of outwardly positive earnings reports and fixated on threats to the nine-year-old bull market.Foremost among them is the Federal Reserve. Super-low interest rates from the central bank have fueled the rally, pushing up the prices of stocks and bonds since the Great Recession.But that was then. Now, the Fed is slowly withdrawing some of its support. It is shrinking its portfolio of government bonds and lifting interest rates. As a result, a yearslong tailwind for the stock market is disappearing.The new environment is evident in interest rates on government bonds, closely watched by many investors. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note touched 3 percent in trading early Tuesday. That benchmark interest rate \u2014 which influences the price of borrowing for both consumer loans and corporate bonds \u2014 has not been that high since early 2014.Other pressures rattled the markets, and worries began to set in after 3M and Caterpillar reported a gloomy outlook.The threat of a trade war, or even a real war, is unnerving investors. Oil prices have surged higher because of tensions in the Middle East, as well as President Trump\u2019s public musings about withdrawing the United States from its nuclear deal with Iran.Those rising commodity prices represent something of a double worry for investors. For one, they feed into price inflation, making it even more likely that the Fed will continue to raise interest rates. (One of the Fed\u2019s main objectives is keeping prices stable.) At the same time, higher commodity prices eat into profit margins for companies, which is bad for their stock prices.Last year, investors might have shrugged off those concerns, preferring to focus on the buoyant global economy and the prospect of a major reduction in American corporate tax rates.That tax cut came to fruition in December, and it supercharged corporate profits, but that was a one-time event.Investors were heartened by the tax cuts, said Evan Brown, director of asset allocation at UBS Asset Management. But their focus has shifted since then.\u201cThe market\u2019s attention is rotating to other things, and one of those things is rising inflation and rising yields,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cOne of those things is the potential for increasing trade tensions.\u201dOther events are looming, and investors see little to be excited about. With congressional elections later this year, the prospects of pro-business legislation \u2014 or any legislation, for that matter \u2014 are dim. The biggest economic action out of Washington might be the Fed raising interest rates \u2014 a clear negative for investors.In short, it\u2019s up to companies themselves to give investors reasons to believe their shares can keep climbing.Recent earnings reports suggest that is becoming harder to do. Shares of Alphabet, the parent of Google, dropped sharply Tuesday despite the company reporting Monday that quarterly profits rose 73 percent to $9.4 billion. Investors appeared concerned with a surge of spending at the company that hurt its profit margins.Earnings reports also provoked a sell-off in the industrial firms 3M and Caterpillar. Investors were rattled by lower sales and profit forecasts and by sluggish demand for the products that 3M sells to auto body shops. Its shares sank 6.8 percent.And investors, after initially applauding Caterpillar\u2019s first-quarter results, were unnerved when a Caterpillar executive told analysts that the first quarter might be a \u201chigh-water mark\u201d for the year. The shares fell 6.2 percent.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index sank 1.3 percent, and the Dow Jones industrial average finished with a loss of 1.7 percent. The Nasdaq composite dropped 1.7 percent.The decline in the S.&P. on Tuesday left the benchmark index down 1.5 percent for the year.Advertisement"}

But in this case it\u2019s pretty clear what\u2019s going on.

In particular, it has pretty much thumbed its nose at international rules on intellectual property rights, grabbing foreign technology without proper payment. And to be fair, Trump officials do sometimes raise the intellectual property issue as a justification for getting tough.But if getting China to pay what it owes for technology were the goal, you\u2019d expect the U.S. both to make specific demands on that front and to adopt a strategy aimed at inducing China to meet those demands.In fact, the U.S. has given little indication of what China should do about intellectual property. Meanwhile, if getting better protection of patent rights and so on were the goal, America should be trying to build a coalition with other advanced countries to pressure the Chinese; instead, we\u2019ve been alienating everyone in sight.Beyond this conceptual confusion, there\u2019s a raw fact few people \u2014 and, as far as I can tell, nobody in the Trump administration \u2014 seem to appreciate: China no longer runs big trade surpluses.It\u2019s not clear why we should demand that China stop playing that role. Indeed, it\u2019s not clear that China could even do much to reduce its bilateral surplus with the U.S.: To do so, it would basically have to have a completely different economy. And this just isn\u2019t going to happen unless we have a full-blown trade war that shuts down much of the global economy as we know it.And that\u2019s why things seem so incoherent. One day Trump talks tough on trade; then stocks fall, and his advisers scramble to say that the trade war won\u2019t really happen; then he worries that he\u2019s looking weak, and tweets out more threats; and so on. Call it the art of the flail.Advertisement"}

Or Five.", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRockefeller still rings true as one of the greatest names in wealth and philanthropy \u2014 most everyone has heard of the center, the foundation, the oysters.Peggy and David Rockefeller were also known for their prodigious art collecting, and Christie\u2019s New York is staging an auction of their trove, with multiples sales spread over three days, May 8 to 10.The house will offer masterpieces by Matisse and Picasso, as well as truckloads of valuable porcelain. Highlights from the collection have been touring the globe to increase anticipation.It has the potential to be the largest single-owner sale, and the largest charitable one, in history.The heart of the collection is a group of five works by Claude Monet (1840-1926), the most-represented artist in the Christie\u2019s lineup, which will be auctioned in the first evening sale. The pictures arrive freighted with anticipation, given that five paintings by the artist have brought more than $40 million each at auction.The Rockefeller grouping forms a kind of Monet variety pack, spanning 1868 to 1917 and offering an overview of his career.\u201cIt\u2019s very rare that you have five masterpieces by one artist in a single collection,\u201d said Adrien Meyer, a co-chairman of the Impressionist and Modern department at Christie\u2019s. \u201cThey cover all of Monet\u2019s facets.\u201dThe works include one urban scene, \u201cExt\u00e9rieur de la Gare Saint-Lazare, Effet de Soleil\u201d (1877), and three water scenes: \u201cBord de Mer \u00e0 Sainte-Adresse\u201d (1868), \u201cCamille Assise sur la Plage \u00e0 Trouville\u201d (1870-71) and \u201cLa Seine \u00e0 Lavacourt\u201d (1879).The most valuable piece is from Monet\u2019s popular Water Lilies series, \u201cNymph\u00e9as en Fleur\u201d (1914-17). That\u2019s the one the auction house expects to bring the most money: from $50 million to $70 million, Mr. Meyer said, given the track record of similar pictures.\u201cIt\u2019s elastic, catholic and embracing of all the periods, the real hallmark of enlightened collecting,\u201d he said.Mr. Tucker said he discovered Monet as a student at Williams College in Massachusetts, where he later taught. Since then, he said the painter \u201chas been my companion, my guide, my soothsayer.\u201dBut only from a distance: He has never owned one of Monet\u2019s works. That privilege is reserved for a lucky few like the Rockefellers and Scott M. Black, the Boston-based founder of the investment firm Delphi Management.Mr. Black\u2019s collection of more than 50 works includes three Monets, which he has lived with on and off over the years, when they are not on loan to museum exhibitions.Mr. Black made a fortune picking winners in stocks, which is why his clients include business titans like Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City. And in his estimation, Monet is a consistent performer.\u201cHe didn\u2019t have too many off days,\u201d Mr. Black said. \u201cHe\u2019s my favorite single painter of the 19th century.\u201d And he knows the comparables, as they say in the investment game: He owns works by Degas, Renoir, Cassatt and Pissarro.\u201cThere\u2019s such an exuberance on the canvas,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a pleasing aesthetic experience.\u201dMr. Black bought his first Monet for around $1 million in 1986 \u2014 what he now considers a bargain. \u201cIt\u2019s worth a lot more now,\u201d he said.From the marketplace\u2019s perspective, one notable facet of the demand for Monet\u2019s work is its universality. \u201cIt attracts a broader market than ever,\u201d Mr. Meyer said. \u201cEvery major Monet we\u2019ve sold in the last few years has had serious bidders from America, Europe and Asia.\u201dThat\u2019s music to the ears of anyone at an auction house. \u201cIt makes him an extraordinarily stable and sound name,\u201d Mr. Meyer said. \u201cHe\u2019s become a brand.\u201dOf course, the brand wasn\u2019t always gold-plated.The word Impressionism was coined by the French critic Louis Leroy, writing for the satirical magazine Le Charivari in 1874, to insult Monet\u2019s \u201cImpression Sunrise,\u201d painted a few years earlier. Leroy imagined a conversation between two viewers in which one scolded, \u201cWallpaper in its embryonic state is more finished than that seascape.\u201dMr. Tucker noted that it wasn\u2019t just Leroy who had been skeptical of Monet\u2019s talent. As recently as the 1950s, Monet\u2019s late work \u2014 now the most prized of all for its abstract beauty \u2014 was misunderstood and shunted aside.\u201cImpressionism fell out of favor, with some exceptions, between the world wars,\u201d Mr. Tucker said. \u201cAnd many of the late works had been left in the studio. People didn\u2019t know them.\u201dEven the Water Lilies, Mr. Tucker added, were \u201cstill avant-garde for some in the 1950s.\u201dJust a few years after pooh-poohing the painter\u2019s last phase in The Nation as offering \u201cthe mere texture of color as adequate form in painting,\u201d Mr. Greenberg finally came around.He wrote in the essay \u201cThe Later Monet\u201d that \u201cthe 20 years by which Monet outlived C\u00e9zanne turn out not to have been in vain.\u201dFast-forward to today, when Impressionists are beloved drivers of museum attendance, as evidenced by \u201cPublic Parks, Private Gardens: Paris to Provence,\u201d currently at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and featuring 13 Monets.It seems that only Renoir could use a bit of public-relations help. His more flowery scenes, particularly some of the female portraits, not only seem unlikely to come back in style, they have active detractors: The Instagram account renoir_sucks_at_painting has some 12,000 followers.But anyone wanting to write off Renoir, or anyone else, is encouraged to remember that markets are made by buying low and selling high. The wheel of fortune has a way of turning.\u201cNo, the prices are too high,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to come down to see them.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching.\u2022 Elon Musk finally responded to last week\u2019s bad news about Tesla.\u2022 Trump continues to go after Amazon.\u2022 China retaliated to President Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs.\u2022 Tech leaders have been keeping mum on Facebook.For months, the stock market rally seemed to have the strength to plow through the obstacles that the Trump administration threw in its way.But now, the S.&P. 500 index is down more than 10 percent from its all-time high.Too much blame can be placed on the White House, however.Before investors began fretting about tech and trade, the underpinnings of the stock market\u2019s ascent were perhaps not as robust as they looked. Wall Street analysts expect earnings for the companies in the S.&P. 500 to increase 25 percent this year, according to data compiled by Standard & Poor\u2019s, an unusually large jump that was reflected in the stock market valuations. Much of that projected earnings increase is coming from tax cuts and some from expectations that companies\u2019 revenue would grow at a nice clip as global growth stayed strong.\u2014 Peter EavisA little humor has not cleared the clouds over Tesla.The accident renews questions about Autopilot, a signature feature of Tesla vehicles, and whether the company has gone far enough to ensure that it keeps drivers and passengers safe.Raj Rajkumar, who researches autonomous driving at Carnegie Mellon University, thinks those assumptions concern one of Tesla\u2019s key sensors. \u201cThe radars they use are apparently meant for detecting moving objects (as typically used in adaptive cruise control systems), and seem to be not very good in detecting stationary objects,\u201d he says.Doubts about the fundamental capabilities of Tesla\u2019s Autopilot could crimp demand for its cars among a customer base that is often seeking the best technology.Out of respect for the privacy of our customer and his family, we do not plan to share any additional details until we conclude the investigation.- Peter EavisTech companies are again dragging down stocks on Wall Street.The S.&P. 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite are off 3.1 percent and 3.5 percent Monday. The continued fall in the share prices of some of the biggest tech companies is weighing heavily on the indexes.Amazon is down 5.4 percent, Netflix is off 5.9 percent, Facebook fell 3 percent, Google-parent Alphabet slipped 3.6 percent and Apple dropped 5.9 percent.After leading the market higher for much of the past two years, tech stocks have hit some turbulence. Since March 16, Facebook, Alphabet, Netflix and Amazon are all down more than 12 percent, while Apple is down 7.3 percent.Over that period the business models of those companies have come under increased scrutiny. News that Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm hired by President Trump\u2019s 2016 election campaign, gained access to private information on more than 50 million Facebook users has weighed not only on the shares of Facebook but on Alphabet as well. Amazon, meanwhile, has come under attack from President Trump.President Trump attacked the e-commerce again on Monday morning.Monday\u2019s tweet is the latest over the past five days from Mr. Trump criticizing Amazon. Over that period, Mr. Trump has accused Amazon of not paying enough taxes, of putting thousands of local retailers out of business and of using the United States Postal Service as its \u201cDelivery Boy.\u201dAmazon\u2019s shares are down 4 percent and are off nearly 11 percent since Axios reported on Wednesday about Mr. Trump\u2019s anger toward the company.Context\u2022 Amazon has said that the Postal Regulatory Commission, which oversees the service, has consistently found that its contracts with Amazon are profitable.Critic\u2019s cornerDA Davidson analyst Tom Forte wrote in a note via Reuters:\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s comments are consistent with industry sources we have spoken to in the shipping industry, who often label Amazon\u2019s deal with the USPS as a sweetheart deal. An argument, however, could be made that the USPS was losing billions before it expanded its service offerings for Amazon and would, still, likely lose billions if Amazon discontinued its use of the USPS tomorrow.\u201dCiting anonymous sources, Bloomberg\u2019s Ian King and Matt Gurman report:\u201cThe initiative, code named Kalamata, is still in the early developmental stages, but comes as part of a larger strategy to make all of Apple\u2019s devices \u2014 including Macs, iPhones, and iPads \u2014 work more similarly and seamlessly together.\u201dApple provides Intel with about 5 percent of its annual revenue.Kenneth C. Griffin\u2019s Citadel has just hired Phil Villhauer, a former top trader at Steven A. Cohen\u2019s investment firm. Mr. Villhauer will become deputy head of global equities at Citadel, a newly created position. He will officially join the Chicago-based hedge fund in the middle of April and work out of Citadel\u2019s office in New York, a Citadel spokesman confirmed.\u201cWe see this as a big hire for us,\u201d said Zia Ahmed, a Citadel spokesman.In January, Mr. Cohen reconfigured Point72 as a hedge fund after establishing it as a family office in 2014 to manage $11 billion of his personal wealth. Point72 has said it has raised between $2 billion and $4 billion in outside money.Mr. Villhauer had been with Mr. Cohen through both the good days and bad days. He was there when SAC turned into a powerhouse hedge fund, and he was there when the fund pleaded guilty to insider trading charges in 2013. The guilty plea required the firm to stop managing money for outside investors.When Mr. Villhauer left Point72, Mr. Cohen, in a letter to employees, called the departure a \u201cretirement\u201d and said he was sad to see Mr. Villhauer go.Now Mr. Villhauer will start a new chapter in his career at another well-known hedge fund firm.____________________________Part of the silence, people in the industry say, comes from a desire to avoid the business equivalent of bad karma \u2014 knowing that they, too, may one day face the buzz saw of public censure.Critic\u2019s corner More on data and privacy The Chinese government said on Monday that it would place tariffs on the imports of 128 American-made products in retaliation for to President Trump\u2019s tariffs on steel and aluminum.The Washington flyaroundWhen the Justice Department allowed Live Nation to merge with Ticketmaster, it tried to assuage concerns that the deal would cripple competitors.But critics have reason to be skeptical. Here\u2019s how Beau Buffier, the chief of the New York Attorney General\u2019s Antitrust Bureau, described Live Nation:\u201cIt is now widely seen as the poster child for the problems that arise when enforcers adopt these temporary fixes to limit the anticompetitive effects of deeply problematic vertical mergers.\u201dThe inquiries come as the department is reviewing two more mergers, between AT&T and Time Warner, and Disney and Fox.The department\u2019s new antitrust chief has said that the Live Nation deal and several other deals posed problems because they relied too much on the federal government\u2019s ability to police corporate behavior.\u201cEven if we wanted to do that, we often don\u2019t have the skills or the tools to do so effectively,\u201d the antitrust chief, Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, said in a speech.More for your playlistThe deals flyaroundAdvertisement"}

What\u2019s an investor to do? For insight and perspective, check out our quarterly report on investing. In retrospect, 2017 was an extraordinary time for investors. The American stock market rose steadily, and it never declined sharply, not even once. It was easy to make money in stocks, and to do so with relatively little skill or worry. That\u2019s not what it has been like so far this year. Stocks have been bouncing up and down, and while they haven\u2019t really fallen that much by historical standards, the nine-year-old bull market stumbled in February and hasn\u2019t entirely recovered. Bonds, which are typically a source of stability when stocks fall, lost ground, too, though not as much as stocks.Still, even for people with diversified portfolios and a long-term outlook, 2018 has been a trying time. This may be a good moment to get some perspective.We\u2019ve chosen nine articles with reporting and analysis on where the markets have been and some clues on where they may be heading. As always in these quarterly reports, the selection provides an introduction to investing. And we hope that at least some of these articles will entertain you as well. Stocks remain fragile after fears of protectionism and inflation helped produce the first quarterly loss since 2015, as equity and bond funds both fell. What happens from here may hinge on the Federal Reserve and on the prospects of a rapprochement \u2014 or a trade war \u2014 between the United States and China.It\u2019s possible to invest in emerging markets by focusing only on companies whose environmental, social and governance records adhere to core principles. What\u2019s more, early evidence suggests that these feel-good funds may be able to outkick their conventional kin.International stock funds are enjoying a currency advantage, but the weaker dollar could spell trouble for foreign-based exporters. It may make sense to focus on firms that are domiciled abroad but whose profits are not going to be affected by any further decline in the dollar.The president says trade wars are \u201cgood\u201d and \u201ceasy to win.\u201d Our columnist decided to get in on the fun. But it turns out that winning is not that simple.Three stock mutual funds benefited from the coffee of a doughnut king, the renaissance of a tech stalwart and renewed growth in Brazil.Managers of so-called focus funds, which have only 30 or 40 holdings, say broad diversification isn\u2019t so great. But as a group, neither are those funds, though there are some apparent exceptions.Bonds lost value along with stocks in the first quarter. But holding them still makes sense for many people.Debt needn\u2019t be a big problem for companies with strong cash flow. But in those three industries, some companies are facing stress.An updated version of a classic asks readers if more is really better and suggests that they weigh purchases against the work needed to make them.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Three Reasons Deutsche Bank Didn\u2019t Exit Wall Street Earlier: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Thursday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Deutsche Bank is finally, and drastically, shrinking itself.\u2022 Facebook can afford to clean up its act.\u2022 Is the problem with I.P.O.s a \u2018middle-market tax\u2019?\u2022 On today\u2019s earnings calendar: Amazon, Microsoft, PepsiCo and Lazard.Since the financial crisis a decade ago, the German institution\u2019s giant investment banking operations have lagged well behind those of its rivals. And Deutsche Bank\u2019s problems had relevance well beyond the trading desks of Wall Street; its difficulties have at times pumped uncertainty into the global financial system. Deutsche Bank\u2019s post-crisis behavior stands in contrast to that of other European investment banks that had also become risky and bloated before the 2008 meltdown. Switzerland\u2019s Credit Suisse and UBS made hard decisions several years ago that helped them adapt to new realities. But Deutsche Bank wavered and delayed. And since this probably won\u2019t be the last time that a too-big-to-fail bank takes too long to fix itself, it\u2019s worth asking why Deutsche Bank dragged its feet. Some reasons follow:- Peter EavisDeutsche Bank\u2019s decision to end its Wall Street ambitions should benefit its American rivals.The German lender said on Thursday that it was scaling back operations such as trading and providing services to hedge funds. According to a note from Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Deutsche Bank\u2019s decision to shrink its investment banking business should \u201chelp industry pricing and provide a revenue opportunity\u201d for United States banks.Deutsche Bank\u2019s scale of tradingLast year Deutsche Bank had a 7.7 percent share of the trading in bonds, currencies and commodities, and a 5.1 percent share of stock trading.Deutsche Bank reported \u20ac4.4 billion in revenue from fixed-income trading last year and another \u20ac2.1 billion from equity trading. Of the combined \u20ac6.5 billion in revenue it generated, 40 percent came from the United States, according to a note from Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.Which banks stand to benefitJPMorgan, Bank of America and Citigroup should get a lift from Deutsche Bank\u2019s pull back from fixed-income trading. The three banks\u2019 market share of fixed-income trading is nearly 50 percent.For stock trading, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan have about 45 percent of the market.Amazon\u2019s profit more than doubled during the first quarter, while Microsoft\u2019s earnings jumped 35 percent. A driver for both companies was their cloud-computing businesses.Amazon\u2019s numbers\u2022 The e-commerce giant reported a profit of $1.6 billion, up from $724 million a year ago.\u2022 Earnings per share came in at $3.27. Analysts expected $1.26 per share, according to Thomson Reuters.\u2022 Revenue jumped 43 percent to $51 billion, beating analysts\u2019 expectations of $49.78 billion.\u2022 Operating income increased 92 percent to $1.9 billion in the first quarter.\u2022 Sales for Amazon Web Services, its cloud-computing business, increased 49 percent to $5.4 billion.Critic\u2019s corner\u201cSales have more than doubled in five years, but it\u2019s taking more fixed assets to get there. Amazon now uses property and such with less efficiency than Walmart.\u201dMicrosoft\u2019s numbers\u2022 The software giant posted a profit of $7.42 billion, up from $5.49 billion a year ago.\u2022 Earnings per share came in at 95 cents. Analysts expected 85 cents per share.\u2022 Revenue rose 16 percent to $26.82 billion, beating expectations of $25.77 billion.\u2022 Operating income rose 23 percent to $8.3 billion.\u2022 Revenue at Azure, Microsoft\u2019s could-computing business, surged 93 percent.Shares of Amazon climbed 7 percent after hours, while Microsoft\u2019s stock rose 2.1 percent.Critics\u2019 cornerSince hitting an intraday low of $150.80 on March 28, the stock has climbed 15 percent and reclaimed more than $60 billion in market value.Ross Sandler, an analyst at Barclays, writes:\u201cWe don\u2019t think 1Q marks the \u201call clear\u201d for FB shares by any means, but given the drubbing over the past two months, we think it may start an overdue stabilization period (next week\u2019s f8 should also help move the conversation back to innovation to some degree). Stepping back, FB\u2019s valuation is attractive vs. its peers, and while we fully expect more tape-bombs in 2018 we think patient investors will be rewarded at current levels when sentiment eventually improves.\u201dFacebook\u2019s first-quarter earnings featured a 63 percent jump in profit and a 49 percent rise in revenue. And roughly 70 million new monthly active users.Peter Eavis\u2019s take: If Facebook wants to spend more on protecting its community, it can: Its operating earnings are equivalent to 46 percent of its revenue. But its expense numbers haven\u2019t provided clear evidence that the company is going the extra mile yet.The key assessment, from the Pivotal analyst Brian Wieser:\u201cAll the data privacy issues, the congressional hearings, none of that will get as much scrutiny from investors as the bottom line.\u201dThe chipmaker reported results Wednesday that topped Wall Street\u2019s expectations. The conference call that followed provided analysts an opportunity to ask about where Qualcomm\u2019s acquisition of NXP stands. The deal is awaiting approval from Chinese regulators, but growing trade tension between China and the United States has increasingly put the deal in doubt.Here is what Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm\u2019s chief executive, said on the call:\u201cWe continue to work closely with China. The environment is obviously quite difficult from a geopolitical point of view, at least right now. However, we expect to ultimately receive approval. And I\u2019ll just remind folks that we have 8 of 9 jurisdictions that have already ruled on it. So although we \u2014 we remain committed to it. And we think it\u2019s going to get done. However, if it does not get done, as you mentioned, we think we have the ability to move very rapidly on a buyback as we communicated earlier in the January time frame. I\u2019ll just remind everyone that we did a 90-day extension to the merger agreement. And we\u2019re going to work very hard to get that done. And if it doesn\u2019t get done, we\u2019re going to move on to another approach. So hopefully, that answers the question.\u201dA bit later in the call Mr. Mollenkopf added:\u201cWith respect to MOFCOM and remedies, our evaluation of the environment is such that really, I think the issue is probably more related to the higher-level discussions between the countries as opposed to any individual issue related to MOFCOM. Of course, we continue to work with the regulators and work through any issues that pop up. But I think the environmental issues between the countries are probably more the situation today than anything else. But obviously, we work closely with the regulator.\u201dIt\u2019s not just regulations like Sarbanes-Oxley that put smaller companies off public listings, argues Rob Jackson, a Democratic S.E.C. commissioner \u2014 it\u2019s the fact that they pay on average 7 percent of proceeds raised in their offerings, way more than bigger clients.\u201cWith the deck stacked against them, it\u2019s no wonder that middle-market I.P.O.s have been on a steady decline. And this has had real effects across our economy, which is now dominated by fewer, and larger, public companies than ever before.\u201dHe suggests the S.E.C. should make underwriters disclose more about the costs of going public, including companies\u2019 potential losses from underpricing, and that bankers should do more to explain why they\u2019re worth their fees.What Jeffrey Lurie, the owner of the Philadelphia Eagles, said, according to the NYT:\u201cWe\u2019ve got to be careful not to be baited by Trump or whomever else.\u201dBob Kraft of the New England Patriots, a friend of Mr. Trump, said:\u201cThe problem we have is, we have a president who will use that as fodder to do his mission that I don\u2019t feel is in the best interests of America.\u201dThere\u2019s no question that it will help make sense of Randall Stephenson\u2019s expansion of AT&T into the pay-TV market and improve AT&T\u2019s positioning and value proposition.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jamie Dimon\u2019s Letter \u2014 Handicapping a Run for President in 2020: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Good Thursday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Jamie Dimon chafes under liquidity rules.\u2022 Mark Zuckerberg has disclosed more on how much Facebook user data may have been accessed.\u2022 The White House is still talking tough on trade with China.\u2022 Blackstone\u2019s infrastructure fund isn\u2019t doing so well.On Wall Street, there\u2019s been a running parlor game about whether Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s chief executive, would try to run for president in 2020. His annual letters, filled with commentary on U.S. policy, have only increased the chatter, and this year\u2019s letter, released Thursday, is no different. It touches on everything from trade to immigration. While Mr. Dimon, who once called himself \u201cbarely a Democrat,\u201d says he plans to stay at the bank for the next five years, the question among political prognosticators is whether Mr. Dimon\u2019s policy views could ever find a home among voters in this politically polarized environment.Mr. Dimon\u2019s sensible letter was seemingly supportive of some of President Trump\u2019s policies, while taking the opposing side on others. Mr. Dimon particularly applauded the corporate tax cut and deregulation efforts. On China trade, Mr. Dimon writes: \u201cIt is not unreasonable for the United States to press ahead for more equivalency,\u201d and that \u201cone of the administration\u2019s best arguments is that negotiation alone has not worked.\u201d However, he said he would like to see more cooperation with U.S. allies on talks with China and added that the U.S. should \u201crevisit the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\u201dOn immigration, he called for tougher border control, writing, \u201cAmerican citizens have the right to complain that we have not successfully protected our borders since the last immigration reform in 1986.\u201d He also said, \u201cPeople immigrating to this country should be taught American history, our language and our principles.\u201d At the same time, he also advocated for \u201ca path to legal status and citizenship\u201d for \u201cDreamers\u201d and improving \u201cmerit-based immigration\u201d programs so that immigrants educated here can stay.Mr. Dimon made a point of saying that part of the problems facing the country is that too many people are talking past each other.\u201cWhen people argue as if there are binary solutions, the argument is almost always wrong,\u201d he wrote, advocating that people try to look at all sides of a situation. \u201cI tell my liberal friends to read columnists like Arthur Brooks and George Will. And I tell my conservative friends to read writers like Tom Friedman.\u201dIf Mr. Dimon were to run, he would likely have to do so as an independent. It is hard to see how liberal Democrats would embrace much of his deregulatory positions. And yet many of his positions \u2013 and especially some of his social positions not enunciated in his letter \u2014 may not be far right enough to capture the interest of Republicans.Maybe the country needs someone in the middle, but history has not been kind to third-party candidates.\u2014 Andrew Ross SorkinBut he also addressed a policy area much closer to home \u2013 bank regulation. Mr. Dimon often has expressed skepticism about aspects of the banking overhaul that took place in the wake of the financial crisis. But his remarks on regulation arguably carry more weight now. Congress is closer to modifying the post-crisis rules than at any point since Dodd-Frank was signed into law in 2010. An important regulatory requirement Mr. Dimon criticized, therefore, might become a focus for those wanting to roll back the rules.Mr. Dimon in this year\u2019s letter zeroed in on regulations that require banks to have a certain amount of liquidity, the financial term for access to cash or low-risk assets that can be easily sold for cash.In 2008, some large financial firms were crippled when customers, depositors and creditors withdrew their money. The Federal Reserve and taxpayers had to step in to support the banks. To help prevent a repeat of this, post-crisis rules require that banks hold a certain amount of liquid assets to cover a theoretical level of outflows. Mr. Dimon is in favor of banks having more liquidity than before the crisis, but in the letter, released Thursday, he wrote:Liquidity requirements, while much higher, now have an element of rigidity built in that did not exist before. Banks will be unable to use that liquidity when they most need to do so \u2014 to make loans or intermediate markets. They have a \u201cred line\u201d they cannot cross (they are required to maintain hard and fast liquidity requirements). As clients demand more liquidity from their banks, the banks essentially will be unable to provide it.First, a bank that lacks liquidity is in no position to lend. When a bank\u2019s creditors and customers fear it doesn\u2019t have enough cash in reserve, they will most likely withdraw their money. This not only deprives the bank of the money it needs to lend, it also sharply reduces its chance of survival. Or as Gregg Gelzinis of the left-leaning Center for American Progress puts it, \u201cYou won\u2019t be able to take this action if you fail.\u201dThe nation\u2019s largest bank holding companies have strong capital levels and retain their ability to lend to households and businesses during a severe recession.Andrew Gray, a JPMorgan spokesman, followed up with more material on Mr. Dimon\u2019s thinking on liquidity.He re-emphasized Mr. Dimon\u2019s point about having to tie up funds that could be used to make loans. Mr. Gray noted that a bank facing outflows would be expected to keep refilling its pool of liquid assets to be in compliance with a liquidity regulation. This would leave fewer funds for lending and making markets, Mr. Gray asserted.He also addressed the argument that higher capital levels, not liquidity, will largely determine the extent to which banks will lend through a downturn. Mr. Gray asserted that liquidity rules play an important role in ensuring banks have the resources to participate in wider financial markets. Rules forcing the hoarding of liquidity may, thus, crimp that activity.\u2014 Peter EavisMick Mulvaney, the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has complained that the regulator engages in \u201cwasteful spending.\u201d He even submitted a quarterly budget request recently of $0.That attitude apparently didn\u2019t apply to two of his recent hires.ContextThe consumer bureau, as well as fellow financial regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, is allowed under federal law to pay employees significantly more than other government agencies can pay. The rationale is that the higher salaries are necessary to recruit skilled employees who otherwise might land jobs on Wall Street.As a result, the C.F.P.B. is stocked with employees who earn more than the average Washington bureaucrat. Of the agency\u2019s 1,600 employees, 219 make more than $200,000, according to the records reviewed by The Times.\u2014 Stacy CowleyBlackRock, the world\u2019s largest money manager, plans to offer a series of new products allowing individuals and institutions to invest in market indexes without putting money into manufacturers and retailers of firearms.They include:\u2022 a new exchange-traded fund that will track the performance of the MSCI USA Small Cap Extended ESG Focus Index, composed of small stocks with favorable environmental, social and governance standards, while specifically excluding producers and large retailers of civilian firearms.\u2022 a similar credit-focused ETF that eschews the debt of gunmakers and distributors.\u2022 an option to take the guns out of institutional strategies tracking major market indexes, including the S&P 500, the Russell 2000 and three others.Critic\u2019s cornerRob Cox of Breakigviews writes:\u201cBlackRock\u2019s moves may spark criticism from gun-rights supporters, who lashed out at companies like Delta Air Lines that severed ties with the National Rifle Association. But it\u2019s hard to see how offering customers more choice is ever a bad idea. Moreover, by getting out early, BlackRock makes clear to those young people lobbying for tighter gun laws \u2013 who it hopes will be customers for decades to come \u2013 that it has something for them. Far from virtue signaling, it\u2019s simply good business.\u201d\u2022 Facebook said Cambridge Analytica harvested the data of 87 million users, not 50 million.\u2022 A vulnerability in search and account recovery functions may have exposed \u201cmost\u201d of Facebook\u2019s 2 billion users to unauthorized harvesting of their public profile information.A brighter note for Facebook: Its shares are up in premarket trading today, after Mr. Zuckerberg said that #DeleteFacebook didn\u2019t appear to be having much effect.The Facebook calendar\u2022 April 9: Alerts should start popping up for users whose information may have been shared with Cambridge Analytica.\u2022 April 10: Mr. Zuckerberg is scheduled to testify before the Senate\u2019s Commerce and Judiciary committees.\u2022 April 11: He will testify before the House Energy and Commerce Committee.People familiar with the negotiations say Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, and Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, have at times argued for more dialogue with the Chinese and quicker concessions that would help diminish the trade deficit. \u2026 Other top trade advisers, including longtime China critics like Robert Lighthizer and Peter Navarro, have taken a tougher stance.The United States trade deficit rose 1.6 percent to $57.6 billion, its highest level since October 2008. The deficit has now risen for six straight months, the longest such streak since 2000.The merchandise-trade gap with China narrowed to $34.7 billion in February from $35.5 billion. The Trump administration wants to cut $100 billion, or about 25 percent, from the annual deficit with China, Bloomberg points out. During President Trump\u2019s first year in office, the United States\u2019 trade deficit with China rose to $375.2 billion in 2017, a record high.Last May, Blackstone announced with great fanfare that it planned a $40 billion fund with Saudi Arabia to invest in U.S. infrastructure: up to $20 billion from the Saudis, who would match commitments by other outside partners. But as of now, Blackstone has secured just $575 million in such commitments \u2014 and missed two fund-raising deadlines.\u2022 The Saudis wanted the fund overseen by an investment committee, with a seat for them. Blackstone refused.\u2022 Many potential investors balked at committing money until an investment team was in place, a process that took some time.More from Scott Shane and Dai Wakabayashi of the NYT:That kind of idealistic stance, while certainly not shared by all Google employees, comes naturally to a company whose motto is \u201cDon\u2019t be evil,\u201d a phrase invoked in the protest letter. But it is distinctly foreign to Washington\u2019s massive defense industry and certainly to the Pentagon, where the defense secretary, Jim Mattis, has often said a central goal is to increase the \u201clethality\u201d of the United States military.The company line: \u201cWe\u2019re actively engaged across the company in a comprehensive discussion of this important topic.\u201dThe tech flyaround\u201cThe future of a combined Viacom and CBS is going to be driven by an increasing focus on international and scaling up,\u201d he wrote \u2014 an agenda better suited to Viacom\u2019s C.E.O., Bob Bakish.\u201cRetreating from the world is not the solution, nor is burning down the current system and starting anew.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Markets That Climbed the Trump Bump Are Tumbling Down From It", "Date": "2018-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Trump Bump is becoming the Trump Slump.In the first year of Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidency, ebullient investors propelled stock markets to one record high after another. And Mr. Trump was the bull in chief, celebrating the record-breaking march as validation of his economic policies.Those days are done.Even after a fast start to 2018, stock markets finished the first quarter down for the year \u2014 the first quarterly decline since 2015. It suggested that a period of calm and steadily rising markets had given way to a turbulent new era with a bearish bent.The plunge continued Monday, with the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index sinking 2.2 percent. Investors jettisoned shares of financial, technology and many other businesses, spooked at least in part by a tweet from Mr. Trump aimed at one of the country\u2019s biggest companies: Amazon.Monday\u2019s decline left stocks down more than 4 percent so far in 2018. They are now down more than 10 percent from their peak in late January. That means the market has entered a so-called correction \u2014 a term used to indicate that the downward trend is more severe and lasting than simply a few days of bearish trading.The stock market is still up more than 20 percent since Nov. 8, 2016, the day Mr. Trump won the White House \u2014 a roller-coaster ride driven in part by expectations about what a Trump presidency could bring to Washington.At first, the prospect of Republicans controlling the White House and both houses of Congress thrilled investors. They anticipated a wave of regulatory rollbacks and the slashing of corporate and personal tax rates. Many of those dreams have been realized, culminating in Mr. Trump signing a huge tax cut into law in December. When the S.&P. 500 notched its high-water mark of 2872.87 on Jan. 26, it represented a roughly 325 percent increase since the bull market began in March 2009.But since February, a toxic stew of factors \u2014 many but certainly not all of them emanating from Washington \u2014 has polluted what had been the market\u2019s placidly rising waters. And there\u2019s little prospect of the messes dissipating anytime soon.First there was the risk that the economy might be growing too fast, which could prompt central banks to hike interest rates sooner than expected. Then there was the risk of a trade war ignited by the White House imposing tariffs on certain products, an action that quickly prompted countries like China to erect trade barriers of their own. Next came the threat of a government crackdown on technology companies, after revelations of their misuse of customer data.Monday\u2019s dose of unnerving news was a presidential tweet aimed at Amazon, which Mr. Trump accused of hurting the United States Postal Service. Mr. Trump\u2019s feud with the company has been going on sporadically since before he became president, but the onslaught has accelerated lately. On Monday, Mr. Trump tweeted that the Post Office loses money by working with Amazon \u201cand this will be changed.\u201dIn the face of these factors, the optimism of just two months ago has all but evaporated.\u201cIt certainly adds to uncertainty, and the market doesn\u2019t like uncertainty,\u201d said Ed Clissold, chief United States strategist at Ned Davis Research, a stock market research firm.One thing is clear: The days of calm markets marching steadily higher, shattering one record after another, are gone for now. That carries risks for Mr. Trump, who spent the first year of his presidency as a stock-market cheerleader but in recent months has been mostly silent about the market\u2019s gyrations.It also could be a danger for the United States economy. Academic research suggests that long-term market declines can rub off on consumers, leading them to feel less affluent and therefore spend less money. That is bad news for an economy that hinges largely on zesty consumer spending.The market\u2019s decline over the past two months has been broad based. Six of the 11 sectors included in the S.&P. 500 index are down more than 10 percent from the market high in late January.On any given day, a particular sector might be clobbered. One day it could be industrial companies such as Boeing or Caterpillar, which export lots of products and therefore could be harmed in a trade war. Another day could bring declines to technology companies like Facebook and Twitter, whose profits are vulnerable to tougher government regulation of social media networks. The next day it could be energy and financial companies, whose fortunes would be diminished if the economy slows.On Monday, just 13 stocks in the S.&P. 500 rose.The meat producer Tyson dropped more than 6 percent, after China imposed duties on pork and fruit from the United States in response to the tariffs that the Trump administration has imposed on products imported from China. China is one of Tyson\u2019s most important export markets. Lean hog futures \u2014 which reflect the anticipated prices of pig carcasses \u2014 were down 3.9 percent.After Mr. Trump\u2019s complaint about Amazon, it too, was a big loser, falling 5.2 percent. Other giant tech firms were sucked into the downdraft. Microsoft dropped 3 percent. Facebook tumbled 2.8 percent, bringing its year-to-date decline to 14.4 percent. And Intel dove 6 percent after a Bloomberg News report that Apple was planning to use its own chips in its computers instead of Intel processors.And Tesla, reeling amid doubts about its ability to churn out electric vehicles, tumbled more than 5 percent.The tech sector has been the epicenter of stock market pain in recent weeks, hurt by concerns about trade friction with China \u2014 a key market and supplier for tech firms \u2014 and fears of tighter government regulation. Even before Monday\u2019s fall, some $457 billion had been wiped off the sector\u2019s total market value.\u201cPeople think that tech is going to go from the Wild West to a much more regulated, scrutinized environment,\u201d said Dan Suzuki, an equity strategist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Even the shares of financial institutions \u2014 the companies that would most likely benefit from a looser regulatory environment favored by Republicans \u2014 have been battered. The sector dropped 2.1 percent Monday, with investors worried about an unfavorable lending environment.For markets, nothing is for sure. They could rebound mightily later this week and shake off jitters about a trade war. But some observers believe conditions may have to get worse before they can get better \u2014 and there could be more declines before that happens.\u201cIn order for the market to bottom, there probably has to be more consternation and more pessimism about the current environment,\u201d said Mr. Clissold, of Ned Davis Research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Washington Moves to Soften a Big Bank Capital Rule: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Tuesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Earnings are dragging stocks lower.\u2022 The yield on the 10-year Treasury note broke through 3 percent.\u2022 A new study found that female and male C.E.O.s tend to earn similar levels of compensation.\u2022 What does Eddie Lampert have in mind for Sears?\u2022 A thought experiment with Amazon\u2019s pay and profits.One of the simplest and strongest protections against another financial crisis could soon be weakened.Two federal banking regulators have in recent weeks proposed adjustments that could ease a stringent, no-frills bank capital requirement, much disliked on Wall Street, called the supplementary leverage ratio. The Trump administration\u2019s effort to loosen financial regulation is moving forward on several fronts, but the changes to the leverage ratio would arguably put the deepest dent in the post-crisis overhaul.Under the adjustment, the ratio would fall for all of the eight big banks that are subject to it. Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs stand to enjoy some of the biggest declines.Compared with the current rules, the new leverage ratio would reduce capital required at the eight banks by around $86 billion. But other capital rules would, for the time being at least, prevent the banks from cutting their capital by that amount.Not all regulators support the proposed adjustment.The new leverage ratio swaps a fixed capital requirement for one that is in part based on a bank\u2019s size and reach in the global financial system.Critics of the current leverage ratio said it was causing banks to reduce certain important activities.- Peter EavisBut they are dragging them lower on Tuesday.The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 500 points, or 2.1 percent, while the S.&P. 500 and the Nasdaq Composite slid more than 1.5 percent. For the Dow, Tuesday\u2019s move lower push the blue-chip index back down more than 10 percent. If its losses hold through the close, it will mark the Dow\u2019s fifth consecutive down day, its longest such streak since 2017.Disappointing earnings from some of the stock market\u2019s biggest companies are weighing heavily on stocks.\u2022 Despite a 73 percent jump in Alphabet\u2019s net profit, shares fell more than 4 percent as Wall Street analysts raised concerns that a jump in capital spending could crimp profitability\u2022 Travelers is off 4 percent after its earnings missed expectations.In all, Apple, 3M, Travelers and Caterpillar have accounted for 260 points of the Dow\u2019s decline.ContextAs of Friday, with 17 percent of companies in the S.&P. 500 having reported, profits were on pace to rise more than 18 percent, the high quarterly rate in seven years. So far, 80 percent of companies in the indexes have reported have beaten expectation.Peter Eavis\u2019s takeDespite all the bullish talk about earnings and the economy, stocks looked vulnerable going into the first-quarter earnings season. Analysts are expecting earnings for companies in the S.&P. 500 to grow 25 percent this year, an unusually large increase. At the 2018 forecast, the S.&P. 500 looks temperately valued at 17 times earnings. But looking back, stocks appear expensive, at 21 times the S.&P. 500\u2019s earnings for 2017. This large gap between future and historical valuations creates a chasm that stocks can fall into if profits disappoint. If companies, like 3M did on Tuesday, provide underwhelming earnings outlooks, investors will stop believing that stocks are cheap, based on 2018 earnings.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note broke through 3 percent early Tuesday, the first time since 2014 that the benchmark borrowing rate has carried a \u201cthree handle.\u201d Big picture, there\u2019s not much news here. Rates are rising on the back of solid global growth and a Federal Reserve that continues to gradually raise rates this year.No news, however, doesn\u2019t mean no worries. Nearly a decade after the worst of the Great Recession, no one knows exactly how reliant the American economy has become on rock-bottom interest rates. With average 30-year fixed mortgage rates now topping 4.4 percent, housing data has been persistently soft in recent months. And residential real estate is expected to be a drag on first quarter G.D.P. numbers when they\u2019re published on Friday, suggesting that if rising rates are no reason to panic, they shouldn\u2019t merely be shrugged off either.A number of prominent bond investors have long eyed the 3 percent level. Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive of DoubleLine Capital and manager of one of the largest U.S. bond funds, warned that hitting 3 percent would trigger bear market for bonds.A similar move higher in February caused stocks to tumble. So far, though, equities have taken Tuesday\u2019s climb above 3 percent in stride. The Dow Jones industrial average and the S.&P. 500 are essentially flat in early trading.That stunning conclusion, from a new study, could shake up discussions in boardrooms and C-suites everywhere. (The study tracked compensation at 2,282 companies from 1996 to 2014.)One of the most interesting theories about why women may have bridged the pay divide at the highest levels has been offered by previous studies and experts: that a premium has been applied because there is such a limited supply of women in the chief executive role. Some readers may find that an offensive idea on its face \u2014 that women in effect are being overpaid because of their scarcity \u2014 but it\u2019s one that has gained currency among some academics.Shares in Shire jumped in Tuesday trading, reaching 3,977.20 pence by late trading London time.\u2014 Michael de la MercedWhat does this mean for Uber?\u2022 Uber sold its business in China to Didi in 2016.
