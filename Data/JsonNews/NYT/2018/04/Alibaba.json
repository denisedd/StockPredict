{"Headline": "Focusing on a Manager\u2019s Best Stock Ideas May Not Be a Good Idea", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStock funds with concentrated portfolios \u2014 30 or 40 holdings, tops \u2014 are supposed to contain only the managers\u2019 best investment ideas.It turns out, though, that those ideas generally haven\u2019t been good enough to help the funds beat more diversified rivals.In the first quarter, and in the one, three and five years that ended on March 31, the average such stock fund, known as a focus fund, failed to beat at least half of the funds with the same objective \u2014 large-company growth, Asian smaller companies, whatever \u2014 according to Morningstar.At our request, Morningstar examined all actively managed stock funds that had no sales load, a minimum investment of $10,000 or less and at least $100 million in assets. A focus fund was defined as being in the 10 percent of funds with the fewest portfolio holdings, meaning it owned fewer stocks than any of the other 90 percent.Despite the so-so performance of focus funds as a group, some did exceptionally well, and that reveals the good and bad news about them: Their portfolio concentration can accentuate the gap between the best and worst.\u201cConcentration can propel you to greater heights and drive you to greater depths,\u201d said Christopher Davis, a senior analyst specializing in equity strategy for Morningstar. \u201cA concentrated fund is harder to own.\u201dAmid the ordinariness, or worse, there were many apparent standouts. A greater number of concentrated funds performed in the top 10 percent within their respective investment objectives in each period than would be expected by chance, the Morningstar data reveals.In the year through March, for instance, in a universe of 1,938 funds, 19 or 20 in the group with the 10 percent fewest holdings should be in the top 10 percent of returns, strictly by chance, but 26 were.Todd Rosenbluth, director of exchange-traded fund and mutual fund research at CFRA, views the wide performance range among focus funds as a silver lining.\u201cConcentrated funds put only their best ideas into the portfolio and tend to stick with them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can be more volatile, as they are driven by a smaller number of stocks and tend to be more concentrated in certain sectors.\u201dThat may give any of them a chance to beat the market. Diversified portfolios, in contrast, may not deviate much from benchmark stock indexes, he said, and so \u201care more likely to lag a considerably cheaper Vanguard index mutual fund.\u201dThe potential to substantially outperform allows providers of focus funds to charge more money. The average focus fund has annual expenses of 1.06 percent, compared with 0.98 percent for the average actively managed stock fund, according to Morningstar. Focus funds also typically have smaller asset bases, providing fewer economies of scale.\u201cConcentrated funds start off deeper in the expense hole and have a deeper expense gap to traverse,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cIf you bet on the right one, your upside potential is all that much greater. Investors choose to make that bet. If they choose well, the expense ratio doesn\u2019t really matter. If they don\u2019t, the additional expenses will add insult to injury.\u201dThere have been clear, consistent winners among focus funds, even if their inherent volatility can cause periodic weakness. Many names appear on several lists of top concentrated portfolios this year and over one, three and five years, with seven funds on all four.One of those, Guinness Atkinson Global Innovators, maintains a portfolio of about 30 stocks. They are often the same ones because the managers like to hold positions for many years.As the fund\u2019s name suggests, its managers \u201ctry to identify companies that use innovation to drive their growth,\u201d said Matthew Page, one of those managers. \u201cWe believe that, ultimately, companies like that should outperform because they\u2019re smarter and better than their average peers. That means higher growth prospects and profits.\u201dAmong the themes that appeal to him are big data and machine learning. The first refers to the storage, processing and analysis of immense sets of related data. The second involves developing programs that allow computers to learn from and make predictions about data almost instantaneously, a skill that will be needed for technologies such as self-driving cars.It\u2019s hard to invest in these areas directly, Mr. Page said, so the portfolio holds stocks in related ones, including Nvidia, which makes graphics processing units, Fanuc, a Japanese robotics business, and Infineon, a German maker of semiconductors for the automotive industry that is expanding into chips for electric and self-driving vehicles.The Baron Fifth Avenue Growth fund, another that appears on all four lists of top-performing focus funds, favors large companies that sell for less than their intrinsic worth because investors misunderstand their businesses, Alex Umansky, the fund\u2019s manager, says. He adds that there are so few mispricings among these well-researched companies that the fund usually holds just 30 to 35 stocks.He keeps most of them for long periods \u2014 \u201cour time horizon is forever,\u201d he said \u2014 and accepts price swings that other managers try to avoid by maintaining bigger portfolios.\u201cWe think overdiversification has been massively value-destructive over the last decade because people are worried about managing volatility,\u201d Mr. Umansky said.The fund\u2019s largest constituent, accounting for 15 percent of its assets, is hardly obscure \u2014 Amazon \u2014 but Mr. Umansky contends that its price is too cheap, even at 235 times its earnings for the last four quarters. That extravagant valuation is misleading, he said, because Amazon has a history of forgoing earnings today by investing in new business lines that will pay off tomorrow.Other portfolio holdings include Alibaba, a Chinese e-commerce giant; and Mastercard and Visa, which dominate the credit card business. Mr. Umansky called Mastercard \u201cthe digital railroad\u201d taking financial transactions from paper to the electronic world, a process that he expects to be larger and more lucrative than investors anticipate.Mr. Rosenbluth recommends the Guinness Atkinson and Baron funds. Others that he likes and that appear on at least one of the lists of top-performing focus funds include Columbia Select Large-Cap Value, Axa Loomis Sayles Growth and Parnassus Endeavor.Mr. Davis is a fan of the Baron and Parnassus funds, though he is agnostic about focus funds generally.\u201cWe haven\u2019t been able to discern a real advantage investing in concentrated portfolios, but there\u2019s not a big disadvantage, either,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should expect to have a range of outcomes the more concentrated the portfolio is,\u201d he added. \u201cEven some of the best performers over the last five years underperform their peers sometimes.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Shipping Costs Have Put Amazon in a Bind: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Good Friday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Does Amazon have its shipping costs under control?\u2022 What will come out of the Merkel-Trump meeting?\u2022 Why Deutsche Bank was so late to make necessary cuts.\u2022 More complaints have emerged about NBC News\u2019s response to harassment allegations.Amazon\u2019s shipping costs have suddenly become a hot subject, not just to President Trump, but also to the 100 million people who have Amazon Prime.Higher shipping costs are a reason Amazon is raising the cost of Prime membership to $119 a year from $99.But a 20 percent hike is a lot for even a popular service, and it could turn customers off. So why did Amazon do it? The e-commerce giant\u2019s results provide some clues.Members of Prime get free shipping, though their membership fees partially pay for that perk. As the Prime program covers more goods, it\u2019s getting more expensive for Amazon. \u201cOur two-day shipping, it\u2019s now available on over 100 million items, up from 20 million as recently as 2014,\u201d Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon\u2019s C.F.O., said on a conference call Thursday when announcing the increase in the Prime membership fee.The cost pressures from shipping are getting uncomfortable for Amazon. Worldwide shipping costs totaled $6.1 billion in the first quarter of this year, equivalent to 22.5 percent of Amazon\u2019s sales from its online stores during the period. That\u2019s up from 2017, when quarterly shipping costs averaged 19.9 percent of online sales. By bringing shipping costs back down to 20 percent of online sales, Amazon could, in theory, save over $2.5 billion a year (2.5 percent of annualized first-quarter sales comes to roughly $2.8 billion.)To save money, Amazon could offer free shipping on fewer goods, but that could undermine the company\u2019s efforts to bolster sales. And Amazon doesn\u2019t need to do that if it can increase its Prime fees, to help recoup the higher shipping costs. But the fee increase may not be enough. Charging 100 million Prime members an extra $20 per year, in theory, raises \u201conly\u201c $2 billion.- Peter EavisMore on her challenge, from the NYT:Few leaders seem less personally in sync with Mr. Trump than Ms. Merkel. Estranged by widely diverging temperaments and leadership styles, the two leaders have also clashed on substance \u2014 from climate change and military spending to Germany\u2019s chronic, yawning trade surplus with the United States, a particular bugbear of the president.Or as a former State Department official told the NYT, \u201cMerkel is going to Washington and it looks like the U.S. just doesn\u2019t care.\u201d But a foreign relations expert said, \u201cNever underestimate Merkel.\u201dA combination of the two companies would complete one of the telecommunications industry\u2019s most long-awaited transactions and would create the third-largest wireless carrier in the United States, with more than 127 million customers. Sprint and T-Mobile have tried to negotiate a merger twice before.Analysts have argued, and Sprint and T-Mobile themselves have acknowledged, that the companies need greater scale and more resources to better compete against the industry\u2019s leaders, Verizon and AT&T.Should the deal be completed, only three companies would dominate the market in the United States for cellphone service. It is unclear whether the transaction would get regulatory approval. A previous round of merger talks ended in 2014, having drawn strong opposition from the Obama administration.\u2014 Michael de la MercedWhat Mr. Ubben had to say: \u201cThe management and board of FOX has done a superb job of steering the company through a time of transition for the entertainment industry.\u201dWhat Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch had to say: \u201cJeff has been an important partner during a transformational period. Our board and, ultimately, our shareholders, have benefited enormously from his many contributions.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la Merced\u2022 Nonresidential fixed investment \u2014 what businesses spend on equipment, software, buildings and intellectual property \u2014 increased at a solid 6.1 percent.\u2022 Business spending on equipment climbed 4.7 percent, down from 11.6 percent in the fourth quarter.Bigger pictureEconomists on Wall Street and in Washington have repeatedly warned that the economy\u2019s upward streak is unlikely to extend beyond the next year or two.Over the longer term, the Fed expects real annual growth in the United States to fall to 1.8 percent. The Congressional Budget Office\u2019s 10-year outlook comes to the same disappointing conclusion.The nation\u2019s debt has topped $21 trillion and is growing, a level many view as unsustainable. And if the Federal Reserve follows through on its plan to raise interest rates, the cost of paying off that debt will grow larger.\u2022 Hubris: Unlike rivals, Deutsche Bank didn\u2019t raise capital after the financial crisis, ultimately leaving it significantly weaker. By the end of last year, its tangible equity capital ratio was still below JPMorgan Chase in 2011. (Perhaps Germany\u2019s banking regulator should have applied more pressure, as Switzerland\u2019s did.)\u2022 Fear: Did Deutsche Bank\u2019s leaders worry about scaling back the investment bank because of its huge importance for revenue? (Last year, it provided 54 percent.) And about the cost of unwinding some trades?The news organization asserted that the complaints that led to Matt Lauer being ousted from the \u201cToday\u201d show were the first of their kind. Others disagree:What NBC News has done: Brought in a consultant for in-person sexual harassment prevention seminars and pledged to share the results of an internal review.The online video giant has largely avoided the political heat that has burned Facebook, but it has still lurched from crisis to crisis, particularly over upsetting videos.The idea is that someday humans will be able to train the machines, in a similar manner, to sniff out misinformation, smut, and abuse.Sure, there\u2019s logic to it, in the face of the threat from Netflix and Amazon. But as the two companies continue to bicker over price and executive chairs, is there another reason Shari Redstone is pushing the idea so hard, when other CBS shareholders seem uninterested?What seems to be driving Shari Redstone is familial score-settling, a quest for victory over her father, who never wanted her to have a role in either Viacom or CBS. \u201cIt\u2019s the story of a person who was mistreated by her father,\u201d said the source who recently noted Sumner\u2019s physical condition, and has known the father and daughter for an extensive period of time.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Marissa Mayer Is Still Here", "Date": "2018-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCorner OfficeThe former Yahoo chief is renting Google\u2019s original office, where \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of good juju,\u201d and planning her next act. She just won\u2019t say what it is. Marissa Mayer was celebrated as a savior when she left Google to become chief executive of Yahoo in 2012. A brilliant computer scientist, Ms. Mayer was the 20th employee at Google, and influenced many of the company\u2019s signature features \u2014 including Gmail and Google Maps.But could she save Yahoo? The company was reeling from boardroom tumult and a series of executive changeovers when she arrived, and Google and Facebook were winning the war for online eyeballs and ad dollars. Her tenure was ferociously controversial. Investors did well during Ms. Mayer\u2019s five years at the helm, seeing the value of their shares more than triple. But Ms. Mayer\u2019s every decision was second-guessed by Silicon Valley, and she was unable to make Yahoo relevant again. Last year, Yahoo was sold to Verizon, and Ms. Mayer left the company. This interview \u2014 Ms. Mayer\u2019s first since leaving Yahoo \u2014 was condensed and edited for clarity, and conducted in her personal office in Palo Alto, Calif. I rented the old Google office. So this is actually the office where I started my career in 1999. This is also where PayPal started, so there\u2019s a lot of good juju here. Coming back here, it reminds me of what Google felt like in those early moments. I remember running up those steps, because if you didn\u2019t get here fast enough on Saturday morning, someone in the world was going to get worse search results, and it might change their life for the worse. So you haven\u2019t joined a company or founded a company yet?We have this little lab that we\u2019re working on called Lumi Labs. In Finnish, lumi means snow, and I just love snow. I had a snowflake-themed wedding. We have some ideas in the consumer space. So I\u2019ve been meeting with different founders and just seeing what\u2019s happening in the industry.What kind of managers were Larry Page and Sergey Brin during the early days, and how did you think about developing your own management skills?Larry and Sergey just yelled at us until we became what they needed us to become, and get done what they needed to be done. And so I said, look, I\u2019m going to just rinse and repeat that, hopefully with less yelling. We ultimately brought in management coaches and all kinds of mentoring.I think you can have high expectations as a leader, and as long as they\u2019re consistent and clearly communicated, a lot of people find that really inspiring. I always knew what Larry and Sergey wanted. I knew what good looked like to them, and so I never got discouraged by them saying, \u201cWait, I don\u2019t think this is ready\u201d or \u201cI think this is overly ready.\u201d At a start-up you never really know when should you launch something. So Google built the philosophy of launching early and often. Try things out and see what works.As Google grew, how did you work to maintain a cohesive culture?There are different phases of companies. When you\u2019re in the tens of people, the idea itself either attracts people or it doesn\u2019t. People are there because they think the problem you\u2019re trying to solve is just that important.The next phase is where it\u2019s really critical and it\u2019s hard. Getting from 100 employees to 1,000, you have to be very careful. There\u2019s a strategy around compensation at that point, where you really want somebody who\u2019s coming for the right reasons. To get the people who are really aligned with the mission, you want to make sure that they\u2019re fairly compensated, but not necessarily motivated by that compensation. I had a strategy both at Yahoo and at Google of \u201cmeet, not beat.\u201d It\u2019s the trade-off between mercenaries and missionaries. And then around 1,000 people, the culture and the mission become self-reinforcing. At Google I\u2019d always ask new people, \u201cWhy did you come?\u201d When we were about 1,200 people, all of a sudden, for the first time, I actually heard the answer, \u201cI came for the culture.\u201d Why did you leave Google? I was 37, and I had been working at Google for 13 years. I had been on search for 10 of those years and just had very recently made the change over to focus on Maps as a search technology. And I was like, \u201cYou know, I\u2019m just not sure that I want to be like the 50-year-old search girl.\u201dI\u2019d always had huge respect for Yahoo as a company. When we were here in this office, we dreamed of maybe getting the Yahoo contract, maybe one day powering Yahoo search. In 1999, Yahoo was the internet. And I knew that while there were a lot of things going wrong for the board and leadership at Yahoo, there were a lot of really good people there working on the products. What was the best-case scenario for Yahoo when you took over? Returning it to the pre-eminence in its users\u2019 daily lives, where it used to be people were on Yahoo for half an hour to many hours a day. Could we get back to that type of usage? Yahoo had to deal with some nasty shareholder activist campaigns, and several readers asked about your thoughts on activism. Were there upsides, or was it more of a distraction? One of the more tragic cases of Yahoo is the Alibaba stake. Both Carl Icahn\u2019s campaign and some of the people who were part of Dan Loeb\u2019s campaign really wanted a commitment to see that stake sold. And Yahoo sold half of that stake in a $35 billion market cap for Alibaba, eroding tens of billions of dollars of upside. So certainly that was not positive. Sometimes that shortsightedness of wanting to get a return quickly can cause you to miss a much bigger gain.What would it have taken to fix Yahoo? I was playing with Magna-Tiles with my son one Sunday, and we had built this giant kind of castle complex, and it collapsed. And my son was crestfallen. I stopped, and I said: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be upset about. We built it and it worked once, and we\u2019ll just rebuild it.\u201d When I said that to him, I realized that\u2019s how I felt about Yahoo. You\u2019re rebuilding something and you know that it worked once, so it should be able to work again. With #MeToo in the news, lots of readers wanted to hear your thoughts on being a woman in Silicon Valley right now. I think it\u2019s an important set of conversations that\u2019s happening. I also want to take a longer-term view. As important as these conversations are, I hope we\u2019re able to have them in a concentrated way, fix the problems and move on from them. Because I worry about what happens to the next generation.You\u2019ve just got to keep at it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "T-Mobile-Sprint Merger Would Give Japan\u2019s SoftBank Bigger Foothold in U.S.", "Date": "2018-04-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn an era of increasing foreign investment in the United States, few have been as acquisitive \u2014 or disruptive \u2014 as Masayoshi Son, the billionaire Japanese founder of SoftBank.In the United States, his highest profile wager has been his majority ownership of Sprint, the nation\u2019s fourth-largest wireless provider.SoftBank owns 80 percent of Sprint, which is perhaps Mr. Son\u2019s marquee American investment, but that control would be relinquished under the terms of the merger announced Sunday. SoftBank would own just 27 percent of the combined company, which would be named T-Mobile, and have four of the 14 seats on the company\u2019s board of directors. (T-Mobile\u2019s current parent company, Germany\u2019s Deutsche Telekom, would own 42 percent of the new company and hold nine seats.)Even with an agreement in place, the deal is not done. Regulators in Washington will scrutinize the merger, which would cede control of the United States wireless market to just three carriers. In the past, attempted mergers in the industry have been rejected on the grounds that more competitors are better for consumers because they result in lower prices and superior services.Regardless of the outcome, the agreement is the latest in a series of bold wagers that have defined Mr. Son\u2019s investing career.In 2000, he put $20 million into Alibaba, the Chinese internet company. As a result of that investment, Mr. Son now owns 30 percent of the $440 billion shopping giant.Mr. Son and SoftBank became serial acquirers. The company built up positions in the Japanese mobile phone market, including by purchasing the British semiconductor designer ARM Holdings, which develops critical technologies for the mobile market.While some have hailed Mr. Son as the Warren Buffett of technology investing, that comparison misses the mark. Mr. Buffett is a forensic analyst of companies rather than trends, and he usually opts for what he perceives to be strong, undervalued brands rather than putting his money into fast-growing, innovative \u2014 and risky \u2014 firms.Mr. Son is more entrepreneur than investor in the classic style.As a university student, he invented a language translator that he sold to a computer company. As an investor, his forte has been identifying futuristic themes and investing based on them. He now is predicting that interconnected devices and artificial intelligence will be the next big trends to disrupt life and industry.Unlike Mr. Buffett, Mr. Son, 60, relies on an army of hundreds of investment bankers and analysts. They travel the world, identifying potential corporate targets and then structuring deals to acquire them.But such thematic investing can backfire. Many of Mr. Son\u2019s technology bets fell victim to the 2000 technology crash. And skeptics say the enormous Vision Fund could stumble into bad, overpriced deals as it tries to deploy tens of billions of dollars in a short period of time. One such eyebrow-raising deal was a $300 million investment in Wag, a dog-walking service built around a smartphone app.Mr. Son also faced criticism for his purchase of 80 percent of Sprint, given the company\u2019s size, shaky finances and the difficulties of winning American regulators\u2019 blessings for any mergers.Mr. Son had long dreamed of combining Sprint with T-Mobile \u2014 but, for a long time, on his terms. The carriers\u2019 merger discussions last year fell apart because he wanted more control of the combined business.Marcelo Claure, Sprint\u2019s chief executive and a confidant of Mr. Son, dismissed SoftBank\u2019s diminished role at the combined company as a setback. \u201cWe\u2019re happy with the percentage of our ownership and happy to put the company in the hands of such a strong management,\u201d Mr. Claure said in an interview. \u201cThis is the fulfillment of an initial vision that was laid out in 2012.\u201dIt is no sure thing \u2014 the Trump administration is suing to block a proposed merger between AT&T and Time Warner, citing the size of a combined entity.While not known for his political instincts, Mr. Son was savvy enough to get a meeting with Mr. Trump in the early days after the election.The president-elect publicly praised Mr. Son\u2019s promise to invest $50 billion in the United States and create 50,000 jobs.The question was then put to Mr. Son: Why had he come to meet Mr. Trump so soon after the election?\u201cI came to celebrate the president\u2019s new job,\u201d Mr. Son said. And in their meeting, he said, Mr. Trump told him \u201cthat he would do a lot of deregulation.\u201dThat was music to Mr. Son\u2019s ears, given his ambition to secure a merger.\u201cI said this is great,\u201d Mr. Son said. \u201cThe United States would be great again.\u201dMichael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

By then, debt held by the public will almost match the size of the nation\u2019s economy, reaching 96 percent of gross domestic product, a higher level than any point since just after World War II and well past the level that economists say could court a crisis.The new C.B.O. projection is the first since President Trump signed a tax cut that is expected to cost the government nearly $1.9 trillion over 11 years, then signed legislation to significantly boost military and domestic spending over the next two years. The figures are sobering, even in a political climate where deficit concerns appear to be receding.This fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, the budget deficit is expected to total $804 billion, up from $665 billion last fiscal year, according to the C.B.O. projections. In a decade, the red ink is expected to reach $1.5 trillion.\u2014 Thomas KaplanWhen he goes before Congress this week, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, will issue a broad apology for letting the website be used as a conduit for fake news, election meddling by foreign entities, hate speech and privacy abuses, according to a copy of his testimony released on Monday.Mr. Zuckerberg, in his prepared remarks, addresses the scandal, saying that Facebook must do more to protect its users\u2019 personal information. The company, he says, will block app developers from gaining access to the data of users who have been inactive for three months; restrict the ability of users to inadvertently share information about others in their networks; and adopt stricter permissions guidelines and search features.Democrats are expected to grill Mr. Zuckerberg about the privacy scandals, and how the social network is guarding against possible interference in this fall\u2019s midterm elections. Republicans are expected to be more reticent about privacy regulations, and may use the hearings to raise suspicions of political bias on the social network.More from The Information:\u201cOverall, there has never been a time where we have seen so much focus on diversity.

But downsizing could mean lost revenue, executive departures and even surprise losses. If the next C.E.O. plays down the pain of such an adjustment, be skeptical.In a blog post Monday morning, Uber said it reached an agreement with Jump Bikes, a provider of battery-powered bicycles, for an undisclosed sum. It would be the first acquisition for Uber since Dara Khosrowshahi took over as the company\u2019s chief executive in August.Even as Uber is backing away from some international markets, the Jump acquisition shows the company is still willing to invest in new ways to reach customers.\u2014 Daisuke WakabayashiFrom Zillow:In fact, homes are appreciating at a faster per hour than minimum wage in half of America\u2019s largest cities. They include San Francisco ($60.13), Seattle ($54.24), New York City ($42.17), Oakland ($38.57), San Diego ($30.86), Los Angeles ($26.35), Long Beach ($18.64), Honolulu ($17.44), Boston ($16.91), Las Vegas ($16.87), Denver ($15.91), and Sacramento ($15.62).More context from Zillow: \u201cThe median U.S. household earned roughly $60,000 in 2017 ($58,978 to be exact) or a little more than $28 per hour.\u201dFounded in 2008, Casa Dragones\u2019 sales have grown 50 percent by volume over the last three years.The back story: The Casa Dragones co-founder Bertha Gonz\u00e1lez Nieves (the other is Bob Pittman, the media veteran), got to know BDT over the past year, and began negotiating a deal last fall. \u201cTo have a partner that believes in entrepreneurship and is a long-term investor enables us to continue to write our growth chapter,\u201d she said. Mr. Trott told Michael, \u201cBertha is just one of these great, passionate visionary entrepreneurs.\u201dThe context: Casamigos sold to Diageo for as much as $1 billion, but both Ms. Gonzalez and Mr. Trott said that wasn\u2019t a factor in striking this deal.What comes next: Ms. Gonzalez said that the new money will help Casa Dragones expand internationally, especially helpful as countries outside Mexico and the U.S. become more interested in tequila.

{"Headline": "Is Trump Serious About Trade War? China\u2019s Leaders Hunt for Answers", "Date": "2018-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 In an elegantly furnished back room at a conference in eastern China in December, a member of the Chinese leadership asked American tech executives for help.He has not been alone.In these meetings, the Americans have warned that Mr. Trump\u2019s complaints should be taken seriously because of widespread frustration in Washington with Chinese policies, especially a $300 billion program to dominate critical high-tech industries, known as Made in China 2025, that has alarmed the United States national security establishment.It is unclear whether that message is making it through to Mr. Xi \u2014 or whether he has chosen to ignore it after concluding that Mr. Trump is bluffing and that the United States will back off, as it has in the past.\u201cWhen you have this kind of regime, you want to report the good story,\u201d said Tao Jingzhou, a managing partner at the global law firm Dechert who deals with senior Chinese officials. \u201cI have the impression the leadership is not fully briefed about the seriousness of the atmosphere against China in the U.S. establishment.\u201dDespite this deep bench of expertise, the Chinese leadership appears at a loss, grasping for interlocutors in an American political landscape that has been scrambled by Mr. Trump. For more than two decades, Beijing has watched corporate America make the case for trade with China and one American president after another embrace that agenda. But Mr. Trump has defied that pattern.\u201cChinese experts do not understand the current state of the United States,\u201d said Jie Zhao, a professor at the China Executive Leadership Academy Pudong, which trains senior civil servants in Shanghai. \u201cThey do not understand Trump, do not understand his team and do not understand the source of his policies.\u201dPart of the problem is that the leadership\u2019s usual contacts in the United States \u2014 often establishment figures with backgrounds in international finance and diplomacy \u2014 have been largely sidelined by Mr. Trump.\u201cThe people with whom Chinese officials are familiar in Washington are mainly the enemies of Trump,\u201d said Shi Yinhong, professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. \u201cTrump hates those people.\u201dLooking for answers, Vice President Wang has met instead in recent weeks with three former Treasury secretaries \u2014 Timothy Geithner, Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Lawrence H. Summers \u2014 as well as Robert B. Zoellick, the former United States trade representative, and William S. Cohen, the former defense secretary.Business leaders who have met with Chinese leaders in the same period include Timothy D. Cook of Apple, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, Chuck Robbins of Cisco, Stephen A. Schwarzman of the Blackstone Group and David M. Solomon of Goldman Sachs.\u201cThey ask, \u2018Who can we talk to?\u2019\u201d said David M. Lampton, the scholar who has recently hosted five Chinese officials. \u201cThey don\u2019t see a stable structure.\u201dBut Professor Lampton, of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, added that despite their frustration, the Chinese seemed satisfied that they can \u201coutlast a U.S. administration that alienates its allies, erodes its own political base and has a public with a low threshold for pain.\u201dThere are vague hints of disagreement in Beijing over how to respond to Mr. Trump\u2019s trade threats. Some in the elite have emphasized the potential impact of a trade war on the Chinese economy and urged negotiations, while others have argued that the dispute is part of a broader effort to thwart China\u2019s rise \u2014 and that Beijing must respond accordingly.\u201cOn the trade war issue, the hawkish atmosphere in China is quite strong right now,\u201d said Chen Jieren, a political commentator in Beijing.Although the tariffs that Mr. Trump has enacted thus far hit only a small segment of China\u2019s steel and aluminum sector, the pain of a proposed additional set would be spread across manufacturers of more than 1,300 goods.Given the party\u2019s tight control of the media, there has been no outcry against Mr. Xi\u2019s policies like that by some American business leaders against Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs. It helps that no single sector or region in China stands out as especially vulnerable, though the aerospace industry could be stung and Chinese automakers eyeing exports to the United States would be disrupted.But speaking at the conference, Fan Gang, the director of China\u2019s National Economic Research Institute, warned of \u201csystematic risk\u201d to manufacturing supply chains. And Jack Ma, the founder of the e-commerce giant Alibaba, suggested that a trade war could destroy 10 million jobs.One sensitive question in Beijing is the fate of the Made in China 2025 plan, which has been the focus of the Trump administration\u2019s complaints. The program would provide subsidies and loans to help Chinese firms acquire foreign competitors, develop advanced technologies and dominate key sectors such as alternative energy, robotics, telecom and artificial intelligence.The military and security apparatus, and the industries close to them, regard the program as essential to China\u2019s strategic ambitions. But discerning the attitude of China\u2019s economic policymakers is more difficult, and not simply because it would be politically taboo to back away from a plan that Mr. Xi has blessed.Premier Li Keqiang, for example, has tended to take more conciliatory positions in trade disputes than colleagues in the leadership who favor asserting China\u2019s clout as a global power. But Mr. Li also leads a cluster of government ministers who are the main architects and advocates of the Made in China 2025 program.They include Miao Wei, the minister of industry and information technology, and Wang Zhigang, the minister of science and technology. Like Mr. Li, both grew up in central China\u2019s impoverished Anhui Province and favor an extensive role for the state in upgrading Chinese industries, acquaintances said.On the other hand, the policymakers closest to Mr. Xi \u2014 men with finance backgrounds including Mr. Liu and Vice President Wang \u2014 are more interested in seeking geopolitical parity with the United States and less enthusiastic about industrial policy in general.They worry that state intervention may distort markets and exacerbate the problems of China\u2019s already debt-laden financial system, people who know them said.Yet such concerns have not translated into a willingness to retreat on the Made in China 2025 program in the face of Mr. Trump\u2019s threats. \u201cI don\u2019t think China is willing to compromise Made in China 2025,\u201d said Da Wei, a professor at the University of International Relations in Beijing. \u201cThis is the core of the competition.\u201dMr. Xi has charted a moderate course so far, retaliating in equal measure when the Trump administration has imposed tariffs, while urging that the dispute be resolved through negotiation.But talks have stalled since Chinese officials rejected American demands that Made in China 2025 be rolled back. A Chinese spokesman said on Thursday that no actual trade negotiations were underway.Reporting was contributed by Jonathan Ansfield, Javier C.

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 What might happen to Amazon\u2019s bottom line if it paid its workers more?\u2022 Sears shares jumped after ESL called on the Sears to sell the Kenmore brand.\u2022 Walmart is said to be close to gaining a majority stake in Flipkart.\u2022 Mike Bloomberg opened his wallet for climate change.\u2022 Learn more about \u201ctransshipping,\u201d one of President Trump\u2019s big trade bugbears.What might happen to Amazon\u2019s bottom line if it paid its workers more? This question may become more pressing if labor shortages start to force companies to up their pay to attract and retain employees.Amazon does not disclose its total compensation expense, so it\u2019s not possible for outsiders to accurately compute what would happen to profits if it raised pay.But the disclosure of median pay provides a little insight. Under S.E.C. rules, public companies must now disclose the median pay figure for all their employees. In annual filings, that number is then compared with the pay of the chief executive. In Amazon\u2019s case, the $1,681,840 that Jeff Bezos earned in 2017 was 59 times that of the median employee, a lower ratio than exists at other large public companies.One way to get a rough proxy for a company\u2019s overall compensation expense is to multiply its median pay number by its total number of employees. For Amazon, that would produce a purely hypothetical compensation expense of $16.1 billion (566,000 employees times $28,466.)Increasing Amazon\u2019s median pay number by 10 percent would bump the $28,466 up to $31,313, and the putative compensation expense would rise to $17.7 billion. Such an increase would have cut Amazon\u2019s $3.8 billion of pretax income in 2017 by 42 percent to $2.2 billion. A 20 percent raise would have slashed those earnings by 85 percent.How does Amazon stack up against Walmart? The C.E.O. of Walmart, Doug McMillion, made $22.8 million in the company\u2019s latest fiscal year. That sum was 1,188 times as large as the median employee\u2019s pay of $19,177 (a number that excludes some foreign employees.)At Walmart, increasing the hypothetical compensation expense would have less of an impact on earnings. A 10 percent increase would reduce Walmart\u2019s latest annual pretax profits by 28 percent, while a 20 percent pay increase would lower profits by 56 percent.There are two ways to view such numbers. One is that retail is a cutthroat business and wages cannot rise by much if a company is going to be healthily profitable. The other is that large retailers have used their heft to lower as many of their costs as possible, including wages.\u2014 Peter Eavis\u2022 Net profit jumped 73% to $9.4 billion in the first quarter, up from $5.4 billion a year ago.\u2022 Earnings per share came in at $13.33 per share, beating analyst estimates of $9.28 per share.\u2022 The company reported a $3 billion, or about $3.40 a share, gain on equity securities in the first quarter.\u2022 Sales rose to $31.1 billion, beating the consensus estimate of $30.3 billion.Shares of Alphabet bounced around after hours. The stock rose as much as 2.2 percent but is now down slightly.Critics\u2019 cornerRobert Cryan of Breakingviews writes:\u201cThe tech group\u2019s $9.4 billion of earnings in the first quarter came with new noise after it adjusted the way it accounts for investments like ride-hailing app Uber, moved some smart-home appliances into Google and started stressing \u201cimpressions\u201d over clicks. Investors wanting concrete measurements are getting squishy ones instead.\u201dShares of Sears Holding are up about 4 percent in recent trading on Mr. Lampert\u2019s latest attempt to save the troubled retailer.In a letter to the Sears board, Mr. Lampert, whose ESL Investments hedge fund owns a controlling stake in the company, said ESL would also be willing to buy the retailer\u2019s home-services and its appliance-parts units.Mr. Lampert offered to pay Sears $500 million for the home-services and appliance-parts units, but did not mention a price for the Kenmore brand or the real estate. He noted that the company had been trying to sell the assets for nearly two years, but had failed to find other buyers.Mr. Lampert is Sears\u2019s chief executive. Any deal involving Sears and Mr. Lampert is complicated by his dual roles running both the retailer and the hedge fund, which is also a major Sears lender.Mr. Lampert said in his letter that he would recuse himself from any board discussions about his proposal. Any deal would need to be approved by a majority of Sears shareholders not affiliated with ESL, the letter said.\u2014 Michael CorkeryMargrethe Vestager, the European Union\u2019s competition commissioner, said in a statement:\u201cThe way people listen to music has changed significantly in recent years, with more and more Europeans using music streaming services. Our investigation aims to ensure that music fans will continue to enjoy attractive music streaming offers and won\u2019t face less choice as a result of this proposed merger.\u201dThe European Commission is concerned that Shazam\u2019s strong position in music recognition would enable Apple to \u201cobtain access to commercially sensitive data about customers of its competitors.\u201d\u201cAccess to such data could allow Apple to directly target its competitors\u2019 customers and encourage them to switch to Apple Music. As a result, competing music streaming services could be put at a competitive disadvantage.\u201dThe European Commission has until Sept. 4 to finish its investigation.Apple reached a deal to buy Shazam for roughly $400 million in December.Why it\u2019s important: Both Walmart and Amazon have hungrily watched India, where the e-commerce market trails only the U.S. and China in terms of size but where foreign retailers have struggled. But don\u2019t expect Amazon, Flipkart\u2019s biggest rival, to give up.What the parties said about the deal\u2022 Michael Polk, Newell\u2019s C.E.O.: \u201cThis agreement will enable the Company to now focus exclusively on the execution of our transformation plans and our efforts to strengthen our financial and operational performance.\u201d\u2022 Mr. Icahn: \u201cI am pleased that we were able to facilitate peace between the company and Starboard.

And he\u2019s willing to put his own money to work as well.Mike Schroepfer, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, will appear on Thursday before the British government committee investigating fake news and social media following the Cambridge Analytica scandal. (No Mark Zuckerberg this time.)The issue: Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks appear rooted in personal animus, clouding what others feel are legitimate criticisms. Matt Stoller of the Open Markets Institute told the NYT, \u201cWhat he\u2019s doing is a threat to democracy, but so is Amazon.\u201dThe problem: Customers often aren\u2019t notified when money is transferred; customers are subjected to phishing attacks that drain money from their accounts; buyers have no protections if sellers don\u2019t provide paid-for goods.Why it matters: Banks want their share of digital payments, and 18 so far have signed up with Zelle.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Finds California Wine Pairs Well With a Trade War", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "Retaliatory tariffs are a blow to exporters increasingly catering to young, newly wealthy Chinese looking for bottles with cachet.Supported byCabernet isn\u2019t the most obvious pawn in a trade war between the United States and China. Airplanes and their parts are the leading American export to China. Soybeans and wheat grow in Trump country.But China\u2019s selection of wine as a target of retaliatory tariffs did not surprise Michael Honig, a winemaker in the Napa Valley, where the tariff would hit hardest.\u201cThe reason the government realizes they should penalize us is, we are branded,\u201d said Mr. Honig, the president of Honig Vineyard and Winery. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to go after a wheat grower, because who is a wheat grower? It\u2019s a commodity. We are not a commodity.\u201dThe news was an unwelcome turn of events for Mr. Honig and many California winemakers, who have spent years trying to carve out a place in the hearts of wealthy Chinese consumers. That hard work has earned them a prized sliver of what is becoming one of the fastest-growing markets for wine imports.China\u2019s imports of American wine reached $82 million last year \u2014 not including bottles entering duty-free through Hong Kong \u2014 a sevenfold increase in the last decade. But growing visibility may have turned Napa wine into easy prey.\u201cWine is something people can relate to,\u201d said Jim Boyce, who has been covering the industry from Beijing for a decade on his blog, the Grape Wall of China. \u201cIt\u2019s like putting a tariff on Chinese dumplings. It\u2019s something you can feel on an emotional and personal level.\u201dIt is that group, one or two levels below China\u2019s ultrarich, that holds huge potential for California vintners. Those consumers are far more numerous than 1-percenters. And more crucially, they\u2019re the ones driving the recent blossoming of a wine culture in China in which bottles are actually consumed rather than simply traded among elites as trophies.Mr. Honig and his business partner and wife, Stephanie, have spent a decade wooing that clientele, making a trip a year to China to pitch sommeliers in top restaurants and hotels. He has recently expanded beyond the obvious stops in Beijing and Shanghai, visiting cities like Guangzhou, in southern China.\u201cThere are people who want to spend the most, but there are also aspirational buyers,\u201d Mr. Honig said. \u201cYou may want to buy the Rolls-Royce, but you can afford the Mercedes.\u201d And that\u2019s his sweet spot.His most popular cabernet goes for around $25 a bottle wholesale, and he sends more than 500 cases of it every year to a plucky Shanghai importing business started by two brothers with dual citizenship. With existing tariffs and value-added taxes mixed in, the total charge tacked on to California wine was already close to 50 percent. After the importer factors in shipping, takes its cut and passes the bottles to a hotel or retail store, which takes its cut, the Napa red ends up selling for the equivalent of around $100.An extra 15 percent charge would be brutal. \u201cNo one wants to overpay,\u201d Mr. Honig said. \u201cIf all they\u2019re looking at is two different bottles side by side, and we are competing with Australia and Chile, that\u2019s a big competitive disadvantage.\u201dChilean and New Zealand wines face no Chinese levies, thanks to free-trade agreements. Australian bottles will enter the country tariff-free next year.Larry Yang, an importer in Shanghai, said his customers liked California wines, but not enough to ignore an even higher price tag. The wine isn\u2019t cheap as it is, he said, and if it gets pricier, he will look elsewhere.\u201cThere are so many countries producing fine wine,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have to buy relatively expensive California wine. I could choose from New Zealand, Australia, Chile and South Africa.\u201dAnd Chinese drinkers have a growing array of homegrown brands to choose from. Expert winemakers have spent years harvesting cabernet sauvignon, merlot and cabernet franc varietals at the foothills of the Helan Mountains in Ningxia, a region that borders Inner Mongolia. They have started winning international awards, even beating out French favorites.Then the government began protecting its domestic players.Sophisticated wine shops have sprouted up across Shanghai, the online retailer Alibaba now runs a yearly wine sale, and other sites will deliver cases to people\u2019s doors within two days. In August, China got its first master sommelier, a distinction reserved for people who can pass a rigorous series of tests, including verbal and tasting exams.It wasn\u2019t like this when David Pearson made his first business trip to Beijing 15 years ago, intent on selling Chinese customers on his super-premium Napa wine Opus One. The rich drank French Bordeaux if they drank wine at all. He had to make the case for his California winery, a joint venture between Robert Mondavi and Baron Philippe de Rothschild.He found a natural audience.\u201cPeople will buy symbols of luxury \u2014 watches, cars, expensive bottles of wine \u2014 to demonstrate they have the means to do that,\u201d said Mr. Pearson, the Opus One chief executive. \u201cThere was no middle market. You were either spending all your money on the highest quality of wine or you couldn\u2019t afford to buy anything other than the least expensive wine.\u201dThe change started when Xi Jinping became president in 2013 and began an anti-corruption campaign that zeroed in on illicit gift-giving. Wine imports dipped for a couple of years but then recovered as sellers began to learn how to market to a person who would buy a bottle at a time, not several cases.\u201cThe distributors who learned how to deal with consumers survived and got better at it,\u201d said Mr. Boyce, the wine blogger.It isn\u2019t clear how exactly the new tariffs will affect Opus One. Mr. Pearson sells the wine to a group of intermediaries in France known as negociants, who then send it to Chinese importers. It\u2019s also unlikely that anyone willing to spend the $600 for Opus One in China would even notice the added charge.The middle-market wine buyer \u2014 with $20 or so to spare \u2014 would notice. France and Australia are already monsters in that market, sending half of all of the foreign wine that went to China last year. The United States share is just 2 percent, and it has been shrinking. The Wine Institute, which represents California growers, says that\u2019s partly because they\u2019re selling less for a higher price.\u201cCalifornia has had a tough time getting into the conversation,\u201d said David Amadia, the president of Ridge Vineyards. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t considered a top wine region in China.\u201dAfter his Geyserville zinfandel blend was served at a meeting between Mr. Xi and President Barack Obama in 2013, a flurry of new importers began asking for 1,000 cases at a time. He was initially excited about the attention. Then he realized he had no idea where it was going, or who exactly was so interested in it.\"We had concerns about gray market and counterfeiting,\" he said. So he rejected those orders, and says other American winemakers may also be choosing control over quantity. No one knows how much fake wine flows in China, but experts say French and Australian labels are stolen most often, and slapped on random bottles, because they are so well known and abundant.On Mr. Pearson\u2019s desk, in Napa, he has a box of counterfeit Opus wines on display. The scammers did a terrific job on the box, he said, other than the \u201cX\u201d they inserted into the name Rothschild.\u201cPart of me takes a strange amount of pride in it,\u201d he said. \u201cYour brand has to have enough value associated with it in order for someone to think it\u2019s worth counterfeiting.\u201dAilin Tang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Demise of Watchdog Journalism in China", "Date": "2018-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byContributing Opinion WriterBEIJING \u2014 As unfettered capitalism reached a fever pitch in China in the early 2000s, a boom in investigative journalism was hailed as the most salient example of growing citizen power. National politics, which had disappeared from public conversations after the Tiananmen massacre in 1989, again felt immediate and personal.A middle school student at the time, I spent weekend afternoons poring over Southern Weekly, the standard-bearer of investigative journalism, devouring expos\u00e9s of urban crimes and corporate scandals, a reality that was worlds apart from my cocooned life in a university neighborhood.The newspaper\u2019s journalists, heralding the new era, wrote in a 1999 editorial that investigative journalism should \u201cgive power to the powerless, and motivate the pessimists to march on.\u201dBut we don\u2019t hear that pledge, or anything like it, today.More than five years into President Xi Jinping\u2019s rule, the more insidious implications of his authoritarian revival are coming into focus. One casualty is investigative journalism. Having suffered a decline as rapid as their rise, muckraking journalists feel lost.And these sentiments are widespread, felt beyond the world of journalism. State oppression has decimated civil society and negated years of social progress, casting a pall on the public mood. The diminished spirit threatens to stifle innovation, professionalism and the long-held \u201ccan-do\u201d ethos among the Chinese. The consequences may be ruinous to the leadership\u2019s aspirations for China to become an economic superpower.The investigative journalism boom had emerged from a propitious alignment of political and social conditions. The government had decided, as part of a vast rollback of economic control, to cut subsidies to state newspapers, forcing them to seek more of their revenue from sales. Editors, in turn, felt they had a license to push boundaries. Sensing a public appetite for hard-hitting watchdog journalism, they encouraged reporters to pursue stories with an eye to social impact.The fruit of this labor fueled hope among citizens for social change. Reports disclosing the true scale of the 2003 SARS epidemic pressured evasive officials into taking action. An inquiry into an unexplained death in police custody led to the scrapping of a nationwide illegal detention system. All over the country, corrupt bureaucrats were brought down for crimes from illegal urban demolitions to embezzling state funds that they could no longer sweep under the rug owing to the new army of whistle-blowers.Riding on those successes, regional newspapers like Southern Weekly, Southern Metropolis Daily, and Dahe Daily rose to national prominence. Despite their government affiliations, these papers enjoyed relative freedom thanks to liberal-minded political leaders who considered investigative reporters political allies. The few muckraking journalists who lost their jobs in these years were far outnumbered by those who carried on, united in their belief in the importance and power of their work.As censorship increased under Mr. Xi, investigative journalism lost its edge \u2014 and then its audience. Dwindling revenues forced newspapers to lay off investigative journalists and, at times, to eliminate entire departments. The number of investigative journalists dropped by more than half in six years, to a total of 175, according to a report from Sun Yat-sen University in December.For the journalists who have remained, survival has hinged on their ability to navigate this new reality. When Mr. Xi started his high-profile anticorruption campaign in 2013, many investigative journalists had taken it as a cue for action. The optimism changed to fear when those who ousted corrupt officials not on the Communist Party\u2019s target list landed in prison, while the reporters revealing corruption evidence of already disgraced cadres were commended for their political loyalty.But the scarce triumphs barely console investigative journalists. In an essay, Chu Chaoxin, a prominent political reporter, pleaded with readers \u201cnot to call him an investigative journalist,\u201d saying that what he can accomplish no longer qualifies him as one.Tuning out is increasingly the choice of disaffected young journalists. Where there had been idealism and mettle a decade ago, there is now a breezy acceptance of the status quo.And the feeling of resignation in response to the oppression under Mr. Xi is so widespread among young people that it has a label: the Buddhist youth attitude. It denotes a noncompetitive, laissez-faire existence based on the idea that little that is out of reach is worth striving for.Millennial journalists have reluctantly embraced the Buddhist attitude. After all, their preparation for professional life \u2014 a rigorous education that valorized hard work, experience in liberal societies overseas, inspiring stories from older journalists \u2014 hardly prepared them for what surrounds them now: the gleaming fortress that is Xi Jinping\u2019s New China, where alternative social visions are methodically suppressed, and individual ambitions have no place, except as bricks in the wall.In his words and actions, Mr. Xi seems to believe that nationalism and top-down financial largess will spur writers, scientists and entrepreneurs into helping China achieve national greatness. It is a misguided belief.It is no coincidence that the golden era of investigative journalism accompanied an all-around flourishing of society. The scandals that journalists uncovered prompted animated conversations on college campuses. The transparency that reporters\u2019 work fostered put businesses on firmer footing in navigating mercurial markets: some of China\u2019s largest conglomerates, like the e-commerce giant Alibaba, were founded in that period.The principles and beliefs that took root at newspapers more than a decade ago did not remain in the newsrooms. And in tearing down the social ecosystem that investigative journalists helped build, Xi Jinping may be draining not just the vitality of society, but also his vision of the country\u2019s future.Helen Gao is a policy analyst at a research company and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Retailers Race Against Amazon to Automate Stores", "Date": "2018-04-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySoon, though, more technology-driven businesses like Amazon Go may be coming to them.A global race to automate stores is underway among several of the world\u2019s top retailers and small tech start-ups, which are motivated to shave labor costs and minimize shoppers\u2019 frustrations, like waiting for cashiers. They are also trying to prevent Amazon from dominating the physical retail world as it does online shopping.Companies are testing robots that help keep shelves stocked, as well as apps that let shoppers ring up items with a smartphone. High-tech systems like the one used by Amazon Go completely automate the checkout process. China, which has its own ambitious e-commerce companies, is emerging as an especially fertile place for these retail experiments.In addition, the efforts have raised concerns among privacy researchers because of the mounds of data that retailers will be able to gather about shopper behavior as they digitize their locations. Inside Amazon Go, for instance, the cameras never lose sight of a customer once he or she enters the shop.Retailers had adopted technologies in their stores long before Amazon Go arrived on the scene. Self-checkout kiosks have been common in supermarkets and other stores for years. Kroger, the grocery chain, uses sensors and predictive analytics tools to better anticipate when more cashiers will be needed.But the opening of Amazon Go in January was alarming for many retailers, who saw a sudden willingness by Amazon to wield its technology power in new ways. Hundreds of cameras near the ceiling and sensors in the shelves help automatically tally the cookies, chips and soda that shoppers remove and put into their bags. Shoppers\u2019 accounts are charged as they walk out the doors.\u201cUnanimously, there was an element of embarrassment because here is an online retailer showing us how to do brick and mortar, and frankly doing it amazingly well,\u201d said Martin Hitch, the chief business officer of Bossa Nova Robotics, a company that makes inventory management robots that Walmart and others are testing.Nowhere are retailers experimenting more avidly with automating store shopping than in China, a country obsessed by new tech fads.One effort is a chain of more than 100 unmanned convenience shops from a start-up called Bingo Box, one of which sits in a business park in Shanghai. Shoppers scan a code on their phones to enter and, once inside, scan the items they want to buy. The store unlocks the exit door after they\u2019ve paid through their phones.Alibaba, one of China\u2019s largest internet companies, has opened 35 of its Hema automated grocery stores, which blend online ordering with automated checkout. Customers scan their groceries at checkout kiosks, using facial recognition to pay electronically, while bags of groceries ordered by customers online float overhead on aerial conveyors, headed to a loading dock for delivery to shoppers.Not to be outdone, JD, another big internet retailer in China, said in December that it had teamed up with a developer to build hundreds of its own unmanned convenience shops. The businesses put readable chips on items to automate the checkout process.At its huge campus south of Beijing, JD is testing a new store that relies on computer vision and sensors on the shelves to know when items have been taken. The system tracks shopping without tagging products with chips. Payment, which for now still happens at a kiosk, is done with facial recognition.JD and Alibaba both plan to sell their systems to other retailers and are working on additional checkout technologies.Back in the United States, Walmart, the world\u2019s largest retailer, is testing out the Bossa Nova robots in dozens of its locations to reduce some tedious tasks that can eat up a worker\u2019s time. The robots, which look like giant wheeled luggage bags, roll up and down the aisles looking for shelves where cereal boxes are out of stock and items like toys are mislabeled. The machines then report back to workers, who restock the shelves and apply new labels.At 120 of Walmart\u2019s 4,700 American stores, shoppers can also scan items, including fruits and vegetables, using the camera on their smartphones and pay for them using the devices. When customers walk out, an employee checks their receipts and does a \u201cspot check\u201d of the items they bought.Kroger, one of the country\u2019s largest grocery chains, has also been testing a mobile scanning service in its supermarkets, recently announcing that it would expand it to 400 of its more 2,700 stores.New start-ups are seeking to give retailers the technology to compete with Amazon\u2019s system. One of them, AiFi, is working on cashierless checkout technology that it says will be flexible and affordable enough that mom-and-pop retailers and bigger outlets can use it. In the United States, venture capitalists put $100 million into retail automation start-ups in each of the past two years, up from about $64 million in 2015, according Pitchbook, a financial data firm.\u201cThere\u2019s a gold rush feeling about this,\u201d said Alan O\u2019Herlihy, chief executive of Everseen, an Irish company working with retailers on automated checkout technology that uses artificial intelligence.While such technologies could improve the shopping experience, there may also be consequences that people find less desirable. Retailers like Amazon could compile reams of data about where customers spend time inside their doors, comparable to what internet companies already know about their online habits.\u201cIt\u2019s combined with everything else Amazon might know about you,\u201d said Gennie Gebhart, a researcher at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an online civil liberties organization. \u201cAmazon knows what I buy online, what I watch and now how I move around a space.\u201dDepending on how heavily retailers automate in the years to come, job losses could be severe in a sector that has already experienced wave after wave of store closings by the likes of Macy\u2019s, Toys \u201cR\u201d Us and Sears.\u201cWe see this as helping our associates,\u201d said John Crecelius, vice president of central operations at Walmart. \u201cWe are a people-led business that is technology enabled.\u201dSome traditional retailers are also skeptical about whether the sort of automation in Amazon Go can move to large stores. They say the technology may not work or be cost effective outside a store with a small footprint and inventory.\u201cThat\u2019s probably not scalable to a 120,000-square-foot store,\u201d said Chris Hjelm, executive vice president and chief information officer at Kroger.But he said it was just a matter of time before more cameras and sensors were commonplace in stores. \u201cIt\u2019s a few years out,\u201d he said, \u201cbefore that technology becomes mainstream.\u201dNick Wingfield reported from Seattle, Paul Mozur from Shanghai, and Michael Corkery from New York.Advertisement"}

Weinberg, chief international economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, N.Y., said in a note to clients on Tuesday.Monday\u2019s slump in the United States, however, had another driver that world markets did not: big-name technology companies.Tech shares were among the worst performers in other markets too, like China, Hong Kong and Japan, though the world\u2019s biggest technology companies primarily trade in the United States \u2014 in part to reach global investors.. Shares of Alibaba, a Chinese online retailer, joined the American tech rout on Monday, falling more than 3 percent, while shares of the Chinese search company Baidu fell more than 1 percent.The woes of tech companies may even be positive for some European companies.

{"Headline": "Will Bank Earnings Flash Any Warnings?: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Good Thursday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 The big banks are getting ready to report first-quarter results.\u2022 Larry Fink believes robust global growth and earnings will support stocks.\u2022 There\u2019s a consensus that Facebook must be regulated. The question is, how?\u2022 What Paul Ryan\u2019s exit means for business.\u2022 Jack Ma argues that a trade war would hurt the U.S.Headwinds and tailwinds are blowing through the financial markets and the global economy.The strength of these crosscurrents can be gauged, in part, by examining the results of the big banks, three of which report their first-quarter earnings on Friday. They are JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, which have large operations around the world and big Wall Street businesses, as well as Wells Fargo, which is more of a traditional lender focused on the United States.At the start of the year, the big banks had the wind in their backs. The global economy seemed to be on a clear growth path, the United States had just enacted large tax cuts and the Trump administration was expected to loosen bank regulations. But the threat of a trade war between the United States and China helped plunge the stock markets into correction during the first quarter. The banks\u2019 results, as well as comments from their senior executives, could signal whether the tumult is seeping into the real economy. Here are some things to watch out for:\u2014 Peter EavisAmid the steep drop in its stock price, perhaps it was only a matter of time before Micro Focus drew an activist investor. Elliott Management was a logical candidate. Now, as the $34 billion activist investor has taken a stake in the software maker, here\u2019s what it could push for:\u2022 Potentially go private altogether\u2022 Potentially sell off Suse Linux, a popular maker of the Linux operating system that Micro Focus acquired as part of its takeover of AttachmateOne possibility is that Elliott will push to be involved in a sale of some or all of the business through its private equity team, Evergreen Coast Capital.A spokesman for Elliott declined to comment, while a spokeswoman for Micro Focus declined to comment.Despite one of more volatile quarters in recent years, the chief executive of BlackRock believes that robust global growth and stellar earnings results will be enough to keep the stock market from spiraling downward.But he concedes that worries over trade wars and increased political uncertainty \u2014 at home and abroad \u2014 has made for a riskier investing environment.\u201cMy optimism has abated somewhat,\u201d Mr. Fink said in an interview on Thursday. \u201cBut economically the world is in good shape.\u201dBut for all the turmoil and noise, the market is about flat for the year, he pointed out.The investment giant reported first-quarter earnings Thursday. Helped by continuing inflows into the firm's passive funds, better performance by its actively managed funds and a more favorable tax rate, earnings per share grew 28 percent compared with a year ago.\u201cThis quarter validates us institutionally,\u201d Mr. Fink said, making the point that BlackRock could attract money even when investors are in a jittery mood.Even though many investors yanked money out of the market over the past two months, BlackRock had $55 billion of net inflows for the quarter, with its fast-growing exchange-traded funds comprising $34 billion of that figure.Assets under management grew by 17 percent annually and now stand at a record high of $6.3 trillion.Critics\u2019 cornerIt would seem pretty serious.\u201cWillow initially not only hated the idea but put her foot down because she thought it would be highly destructive to our family and to our lives.\u201dThe idea kept nagging at him and his wife gave her reluctant permission.\u201cThe thought I had was coming from the patriot in me, growing up at a time when we respected our politicians not only for what they stood for but because of what they accomplished. I am horrified at the state of politics in America today, and I will throw stones in multiple directions. Dialogue has given way to disdain. I, maybe a bit naively, believed that there was a need for someone in high elected office to be more open-minded and willing to not only govern from the middle but to try to shame everyone else into going to the middle.\u201dAlso from the piece, Oprah Winfrey thought he would have been the ideal candidate.\u201cBob is one of the people I respect most in the world. That\u2019s a very short list. He is infinitely capable of multiple categories of expertise, and he has created an environment where you can disagree with him\u2014and that\u2019s not just because I\u2019m Oprah. I really, really pushed him to run for president, so much so that I said to him, \u2018Gee, if you ever decide to run for office, I will go door to door carrying leaflets. I will go sit and have tea with people.\u2019\u201d\u201cBerkshire\u2019s present intention is to vote against the four directors proposed by management,\u201d Mr. Buffett\u2019s assistant, Debbie Bosanek, said in an email.Two weeks ago USG rejected Knauf\u2019s $5.9 billion, or $42-a-share, offer. The rejection came despite Berkshire, which controls more than 30 percent of USG, saying it would take Knauf\u2019s offer if the German company agreed to buy the rest of USG for at least $42 a share.Knauf had called on USG shareholders to withhold support for USG\u2019s board nominees in an effort to bring USG to the table.Shares of USG rose 2.8 percent on the news.\u201cIt is therefore ironic that the U.S. administration is waging a trade war at a time when the largest potential consumer market in the world is open for business.\u201dShe seems to be trying to dial back that threat: National Amusements, the Redstone family holding company that controls CBS and Viacom, said in a statement that it has \u201ctremendous respect\u201d for Mr. Moonves, \u201cand it has always been our intention that he run a combined company.\u201dBut in a deal process that is playing out unusually publicly, consider the gantlet thrown.Through its $100 billion Vision Fund, SoftBank has pushed into businesses as wide-ranging as augmented reality, online commerce and dog walking. But the rationale for an investment like this one appears more elusive, other than being a play for lucrative sports content.\u201cIt is safe to say it is one of the largest tax bills on earned income in history.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Mark Zuckerberg is back on Capitol Hill.\u2022 Why would a trade war with China be good for the United States economy?\u2022 Has Facebook opened itself up to regulation?\u2022 Bank of America\u2019s move on gun sales.\u2022 Why did the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of N.Y. recuse himself from the Michael Cohen raid?Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s second day of Congressional grilling lifted its shares again.The stock rose 0.8 percent, even as the broader market dropped 0.6 percent.While it remains to be seen whether Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s performance will keep regulations at bay, his testimony was certainly a tonic for investors. Facebook\u2019s two-day rise of more than 5 percent added over $24 billion to its market capitalization, according to Bloomberg data.\u201cZuckerberg appears willing to work with lawmakers on possible regulations, which may create a barrier to entry in the social network space and help Facebook maintain its market leadership.\u201d\u2014 Matt PhillipsMark Zuckerberg is back on Capitol Hill for a second day of congressional testimony.Here are some highlights :\u2022 Representative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon and chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee, kicked off the hearing by declaring that \u201cwhile Facebook has certainly grown, I worry it has not matured.\u201d Mr. Walden floated the prospect of regulation, saying that \u201cI think it is time to ask whether Facebook may have moved too fast and broken too many things.\u201d\u2022 Mr. Walden also asked: \u201cWhat exactly is Facebook?\u201d The definitions matter. If Facebook is viewed as a telecommunications service that is more like a utility, it may be regulated by the Federal Communications Commission. If lawmakers define Facebook as a publisher, it could also fall under regulations at that agency. \u201cI consider us to be a technology company,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg answered. \u201cThe primary thing we do is have engineers that write code and build services for other people.\u201d\u2022 Representative Frank Pallone, a New Jersey Democrat, pressed Mr. Zuckerberg on whether Facebook would agree or refuse to change Facebook\u2019s default settings to minimize collection and use of users\u2019 data. \u201cThis is a complex issue that deserves more than a one-word answer,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg answered. \u201cThat\u2019s disappointing to me,\u201d Mr. Pallone responded.\u2022 California Democrat Anna Eshoo put it more bluntly, asking Mr. Zuckerberg: \u201cAre you willing to change your business model to protect users\u2019 privacy?\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg was noncommittal, saying: \u201cCongresswoman, I\u2019m not sure what that means.\u201d\u2022 Representative Joe Barton, Republican of Texas, pressed Mr. Zuckerberg on why Facebook has been allegedly censoring content from conservative organizations and Trump supporters such as Diamond and Silk. Mr. Barton also asked Mr. Zuckerberg if he would agree that Facebook would work to ensure it is \u201ca neutral public platform.\u201d \u201cI do agree that we should give people a voice,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.\u2022 Rep. Gene Green, a Texas Democrat, and Jan Schakowsky, an Illinois Democrat, pressed Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s promise to give users worldwide the same privacy controls required by a tough new data protection law which will go into effect in the European Union next month. Mr. Green also asked Mr. Zuckerberg if Facebook planned to comply with the provision in the European law that allows individuals to obtain a copy of the data companies hold about them.\u2022 A number of lawmakers have tried to draw a comparison between the Obama campaign\u2019s use of a Facebook app to scrape data from users and their friends in 2012 and Cambridge Analytica. Those lawmakers have failed to mention one very important distinction between the Obama campaign\u2019s app and Cambridge Analytica\u2019s app: The Obama app was actually on Facebook itself, and it was very clear about who and what the data would be used for. The app used to scrape data for Cambridge Analytica was accessed through a personality questionnaire hosted on a site outside of Facebook, and it appeared to users to be for academic research, not for a political data company owned by a wealthy Republican donor and dedicated to reshaping the American electorate.Mr. Musk told co-host Gayle King:\u201cI think whenever something is \u2013 whenever there\u2019s something that affects the public good then there does need to be some form of public oversight. \u2026 I do think there should be some regulations on AI. I think there should be regulations on social media to the degree that it negatively affects the public good. We can\u2019t have like willy-nilly proliferation of fake news, that\u2019s crazy. You can\u2019t have more types of fake news than real news. That\u2019s allowing public deception to go unchecked. That\u2019s crazy.\u201dAndrew writes: These were the most important words from Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s five-hour testimony: \u201cI agree we are responsible for the content.\u201d They may come back to haunt him, given his previous rejection of calling Facebook a publisher. He later backtracked and called his business a tech company, but his acknowledgment may fundamentally shift the conversation \u2014 and how the company operates. (All in all, Mr. Zuckerberg did better than anyone had expected.)Lawmakers now seem much more aware of how much power large technology companies have. This was encapsulated in questions posed by Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina. He framed Facebook as a monopoly and brought up the possibility of regulating Facebook, asking Mr. Zuckerberg: \u201cBut you as a company welcome regulation?\u201dAnd Facebook may now only be one big scandal away from a more stringent government response.Critics\u2019 corner\u201cUnder a symbiotic U.S.-China relationship, America became a preeminent technology leader, and its brands are today the envy of the world. China improved the standard of living of its citizens with a tenfold increase in per capita gross domestic product over the past 20 years.\u201dBut that relationship will change over the next two decades, Mr. Ma said:\u201cChina is shifting its economy from the world\u2019s largest exporter to the world\u2019s largest consumer. Chinese citizens now have the wealth and income to pursue discretionary spending. They want to buy high-quality imported food, cosmetics, fashions and health and wellness products for themselves and their children.\u201dMr. Ma goes on to write:\u201cIt is therefore ironic that the U.S. administration is waging a trade war at a time when the largest potential consumer market in the world is open for business. Is America going to forfeit this opportunity?Instigating a trade war is the wrong solution because it will only provoke retaliation. The Chinese government responded to U.S. tariff threats with its own tariffs on American agricultural products, such as soybeans. China is the largest export market for American soybeans, worth $14 billion annually and accounting for 65 percent of all U.S. soybean exports.The U.S. has been a consistent defender of free and open markets, but this time it is resorting to protectionism that will not improve American competitiveness. Any country seeking to increase exports would do better to focus on developing good products and channels to access foreign markets rather than putting up trade barriers.\u201dShari Redstone, whose National Amusements controls CBS and Viacom, is seeking to combine the two media companies.From Reuters:\u201cHer longtime friend and business ally, powerful CBS Chief Executive Les Moonves, has emerged as one of the biggest obstacles to a potential CBS-Viacom tie-up, according to people familiar with the matter. Concerns are that his objections could either doom the transaction or that he might not lead the new entity, the people said.\u201cMoonves is chafing at Redstone\u2019s insistence on installing Viacom\u2019s CEO as his second-in-command and likely successor of a merged company, the people say.\u201dBank of America works with \u201cjust a handful\u201d of such manufacturers, according to its vice chairwoman Anne Finucane. Their reactions? \u201cMixed,\u201d she said.It\u2019s not exactly a surprise. SoftBank\u2019s Masa Son bought control of Sprint planning to merge it with T-Mobile, the better to fight Verizon and AT&T. And most analysts agree that both companies need to become bigger to survive.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Letter of Recommendation: AliExpress", "Date": "2018-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter of RecommendationShopping online can make you feel like little more than a data set with a bank account. That\u2019s partly because we do it in private, behind screens \u2014 immune to texture and smell, no friends to keep binges in check \u2014 but also because the interactions it facilitates say everything and nothing about us. \u201cLast Chance!\u201d warns the vitamin-subscription ad I once clicked on accidentally. \u201cA romantic getaway?\u201d asks the hotel newsletter, one week post-breakup.But there\u2019s one place on the internet where I feel less like Alice the Bodiless Cursor and more like Alice in Wonderland: AliExpress, the Chinese e-commerce site. Sixty million people spent $10 billion there in 2017, bewildering figures that only begin to make sense once you\u2019ve clicked through 17 pages of direct-from-Guangdong cocktail shakers. AliExpress has just about every product you could imagine, and plenty you probably couldn\u2019t, presented in no particular order. You\u2019ll discover everything from rain galoshes that fit over high heels to motion-activated toilet-seat lights. Shopping there feels like playing croquet with a flamingo or swimming in a pool filled with tears \u2014 bizarre but special, and if you find the right thing, you might feel special, too.AliExpress is not a destination so much as a hobby. While some people watch TV, count their pores or call their grandparents, I spend evenings savoring bot-translated product copy. (\u201cCan lay a beanbag chair ... Makeup nail beauty.\u201d Or perhaps you\u2019d prefer a \u201cFunny Pet High Temperature Wire Wig Hair Cat Exploding Hair Fancy Dog Wig.\u201d) I once uploaded a selfie into the app\u2019s reverse-image search and found that one of my face\u2019s nearest matches was a chaise longue. The chair was made by a company called DAMEDAI Fascinating Store, in Zhejiang Province. DAMEDAI\u2019s products were popular around the world: Its reviews featured praise from Russia, New Zealand, India, the United Arab Emirates and Iceland. Reading them, I wondered how many others were looking at this chair simultaneously, and whether any of their dimples happened to match its beige synthetic-suede folds as precisely as mine.While many websites generate the illusion of intimacy with personalized recommendation lists and curated feeds of familiar brands, AliExpress taps you directly into manufacturing hubs and supply chains \u2014 the sweep of global capitalism itself. Jack Ma, who co-founded the Alibaba Group, AliExpress\u2019s parent company, named it after the character in \u201cOne Thousand and One Nights.\u201d Today its sales are more than six times as large as eBay\u2019s. In addition to AliExpress, it encompasses Alibaba.com, which sells to businesses worldwide; Taobao Marketplace and Tmall, which primarily do business domestically; a film studio; an e-payment app; a grocery chain; Hong Kong\u2019s newspaper of record; and, with Ford, a vending machine that sells cars. Tmall can deliver groceries within hours in Beijing, but if you order something from AliExpress to New York City, it could take months. When it does arrive, the box will be collaged with port stamps, and when you open it, it will emit a chemically smell.In recent years, as Western awareness about AliExpress has grown, websites trying to organize its chaos have emerged. One, Thieve, offers AliExpress listings \u201ccurated by creatives.\u201d Its logo is clean, and its selection of products is blandly chic: velvet throw pillows, geometric planters, leather MacBook accessory pouches. In essence, Thieve is a skin layered atop AliExpress. Of course, all brands are myths, and to shop is to swallow them, trading knowledge for convenience. I\u2019d rather hunt for treasure and make up my own stories about what it means.One night, hours into a Taobao binge, I found a dress on sale for $16, hidden among thousands. It was simple black spandex, with a rough-edged denim belt, sold by a vaguely trend-aware store whose models posed in graffitied streetscapes. The dress in question was worn by a 20-something in maroon lipstick. I scrolled through the photos until I found one of her holding a poster stenciled with the phrase \u201cCapitalism Will Collapse From Within.\u201d I laughed until I cried, then sat quietly for a long time.Later, I spotted the phrase in an artwork by Elmgreen & Dragset, the duo behind Prada Marfa. Perhaps this was simple copy-and-paste luck, refracted through the prisms of international trade and e-commerce until it exposed a sinister truth. AliExpress does portend capitalism\u2019s collapse: Dresses that cost $16 degrade wages and the environment, for the sake of an obscene, always-accelerating demand for cheap stuff. Perusing fidget spinners and flat screens that sell for less than an IUD, you feel as if you\u2019ve been drawn directly into the global churn of goods. It\u2019s thrilling to behold, but a little terrifying too \u2014 like looking at the night sky, into the expanse of the universe.I think of \u201cOne Thousand and One Nights\u201d sometimes while I click through the site. In it, Ali Baba discovers a cave of treasure, but he takes home only a few bags of gold. His brother, Kasim, shows up later with donkeys for an epic raid and is chopped to death by 40 thieves. Ali Baba was able to escape the initial danger because he skimmed just a little off the top of the pile, in awe of its vastness.Alice Hines is a writer in New York City.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Xi Jinping Urges Dialogue, Not Confrontation, After Trump Seeks Tariffs", "Date": "2018-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBOAO, China \u2014 President Xi Jinping on Tuesday portrayed China as committed to opening its economy as he presented an alternative vision to President Trump\u2019s calls for tariffs and restricting trade, urging \u201cdialogue rather than confrontation.\u201dSpeaking publicly for the first time since the beginning of an escalating trade dispute between his country and the United States, Mr. Xi implicitly took aim at the Trump administration.\u201cThe Cold War mentality and zero-sum game are increasingly obsolete,\u201d Mr. Xi said. \u201cOnly by adhering to peaceful development and working together can we truly achieve win-win results.\u201dMr. Xi also pledged to rebuff efforts to impose barriers to world trade, saying that \u201cChina\u2019s door of opening up will not be closed and will only open up even wider.\u201dHe highlighted areas where China was willing to give, including pledging to ease restrictions on imported cars by the end of the year as well as repeating open-ended promises to give foreigners greater access to the country\u2019s financial markets \u2014 promises officials have made in the past. He also pledged to strengthen intellectual property rights, addressing one of Mr. Trump\u2019s main complaints.The speech also garnered an enthusiastic response from Mr. Trump, who pointed to the potential for negotiations. \u201cWe will make great progress together!\u201d he wrote in a Twitter post on Tuesday.But Mr. Xi\u2019s pitch runs counter to longstanding accusations that China violates trade rules and intellectual property rights. The Chinese president is also pushing a nationalistic agenda, as he tightens his grip on the country\u2019s political, social and economic life.Some were skeptical that China would follow through on its pledges of openness. \u201cPeople will say about the Boao speech: \u2018Show me.\u2019 We heard this in Davos last year,\u201d Joerg Wuttke, former president of the European Chamber of Commerce in Beijing, said in referring to Mr. Xi\u2019s 2017 speech at the World Economic Forum.In a briefing, the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said that the administration was encouraged by Mr. Xi\u2019s words but that it wanted to see concrete actions from China. In the meantime, she said it would keep moving forward with its plans to impose tariffs.On Tuesday, Mr. Xi appeared to have given Mr. Trump a concession by pledging to \u201csignificantly\u201d lower tariffs on imported automobiles by the end of the year. Just hours before, Mr. Trump had taken to Twitter to complain about China\u2019s 25 percent tax on imported automobiles.But Mr. Xi\u2019s pledges to open China\u2019s banking, auto and manufacturing sectors are not entirely new. Last November, China said it would ease and eventually remove limits on foreign ownership of banks and other financial firms, but financial firms have not received details about when and how that will happen.Even as trade disputes cast a shadow over the world\u2019s two biggest economies, Chinese officials see the increasingly strident tone from Washington as an opportunity. Since Mr. Trump was elected in 2016 and pursued an America First policy that has alienated some allies, Mr. Xi and other Chinese leaders have tried to fill the void left by America\u2019s declining presence on the world stage.At Boao, Chinese officials have promoted Mr. Xi\u2019s leadership as providing an opening to carry out ambitious plans to overhaul the country\u2019s economy and make it more open.On trade, government leaders and Chinese corporate chiefs have sought to strike a delicate balance: playing down worries about the effect on China of a protracted trade fight, while warning that the global economic system could be disrupted by a trade war and that the United States risks falling behind.\u201cIf a trade conflict becomes a trade war, the U.S. is more likely to be hurt worse by this than China,\u201d Dai Xianglong, a former governor of the People\u2019s Bank of China, said on Monday at the opening of the forum.Other countries could be hit as well, said Fan Gang, director of China\u2019s National Economic Research Institute. China is just a piece of a complicated regional supply chain across Asia, he said, citing the example of the Apple iPhone. Any retaliation from the United States would have a ripple effect from South Korea to Malaysia, Japan and Taiwan.\u201cThere is definitely a big uncertainty with this trade conflict. We started with trade friction and now conflict and possibly a war,\u201d Mr. Fan said. \u201cThis trade war has an impact on the whole supply chain, and this is the systematic risk for China right now,\u201d he added.Many Chinese business executives tried to strike a similar balance in their remarks at Boao. But some warned that the technological focus of Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs could further split the American and Chinese technology worlds \u2014 and, ultimately, stifle innovation.\u201cInternational standards come from Germany, America and Japan,\u201d said Dong Mingzhu, the chairwoman of Gree Electric Appliances, a leading Chinese manufacturer. \u201cWe in China don\u2019t have any \u2014 but I believe we will have international standards.\u201dOthers did warn of the potential economic impact if tensions worsen. On Monday evening, Jack Ma, the billionaire executive chairman of Alibaba, warned that his pledge to create a million jobs in the United States could be threatened by a trade dispute between China and the United States.\u201cIf China and the U.S. have good relations, we could create not just a million, but 10 million jobs.\u201dBut, he added, \u201cif they don\u2019t have good relations, we\u2019re going to destroy 10 million jobs.\u201dAna Swanson contributed reporting from Washington, Cao Li from Boao, Jane Perlez from Beijing, and Matt Phillips from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wanted at Chinese Start-Ups: Attractive Women to Ease Coders\u2019 Stress", "Date": "2018-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 China\u2019s vibrant technology scene is searching for people like Shen Yue. Qualifications: Must be attractive, know how to charm socially awkward programmers and give relaxing massages.Ms. Shen is a \u201cprogrammer motivator,\u201d as they are known in China. Part psychologist, part cheerleader, the women are hired to chat up and calm stressed-out coders. The jobs are proliferating in a society that largely adheres to gender stereotypes and believes that male programmers are \u201czhai,\u201d or nerds who have no social lives.\u201cThey really need someone to talk to them from time to time and to organize activities for them to ease some of the pressure,\u201d said Ms. Shen, a 25-year-old who has a degree in civil engineering from a university in Beijing.The country\u2019s laws against gender discrimination are not often enforced. Many companies are direct in their job ads. Males preferred. Only good-looking women need apply. With programmer motivators, it\u2019s more explicit, putting women in subservient positions to men.In tech, men dominate the top ranks. Just one woman sits on the 11-member board of Alibaba, the e-commerce giant. At Baidu, a search company, none of its five board members is a woman. At Tencent, a games and social media conglomerate, there are none. By comparison, Twitter has three women on its nine-person board. At Facebook, two of its nine directors are women.Like many other businesses, China\u2019s tech companies are blunt about gender bias in their job ads. Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent have repeatedly published recruitment ads boasting that there are \u201cbeautiful girls\u201d working for the companies, according to Human Rights Watch, a New York-based rights watchdog.In January, Alibaba said it was seeking a sales manager for Taobao, its e-commerce platform. Women were preferred, ages 28 to 35, \u201cwith a good personal image and class.\u201dIn November, Baidu advertised for a marketing position. Men were preferred \u201cbecause of business travel\u201d and other reasons.Both companies have since removed the references to specific genders in those ads.Alibaba said that the company has clear guidelines on providing equal opportunity regardless of gender and \u201cwill conduct stricter reviews of the recruiting advertisements to ensure compliance with our policy.\u201d It also said that one-third of the 18 founders of Alibaba are women and that female leaders account for one-third of the company\u2019s management positions.Baidu said that 45 percent of the company\u2019s 40,000 employees are female, which is reflected in midlevel and senior positions. \u201cWe value the important work that our female employees do across the organization,\u201d the company said in an emailed statement.In a statement, Tencent said it values diverse backgrounds and apologized for the ads.It is unclear how many companies employ programmer motivators. According to Baidu Baipin, a job search website run by Baidu, just seven companies are currently advertising for these jobs, mostly at smaller start-ups. There used to be more. Alibaba advertised for a programmer motivator with \u201crecognizably good looks\u201d in 2015 but deleted the ad after being criticized by Chinese internet users.Ms. Shen started work at Chainfin.com, a consumer finance company, in October. She declined to disclose her salary, but Zhang Jing, a human resources executive who hired Ms. Shen, said it was around $950 a month.Ms. Shen came to Beijing from the northeastern province of Heilongjiang. She has long black hair and pale skin and wears red eye shadow to the office, where she always has a ready smile for her colleagues. They call her by her nickname, Yueyue, which translates to Joy.At Chainfin.com, the bulk of her work is tending the front desk, organizing social events, ordering snacks for tea breaks and chatting with the programmers. She may call a programmer to a conference room and ask him, \u201cDid you have to work overtime?\u201d before listening to his various frustrations.\u201cI thought it was really novel,\u201d Ms. Shen said, \u201cbecause I had never seen such a job before.\u201dOn a recent Friday, she approached Guo Zhenjie, 28, who has a foldout bed next to his desk. Ms. Shen asked whether his waist was still hurting from the long hours at his desk. He said, yes, he had been working till 10 or 11 for the past few nights.\u201cThe company\u2019s intention is for me to give you a massage, though my technique might not be great,\u201d Ms. Shen told Mr. Guo.Both of them broke out in giggles.Ms. Shen stood over a seated Mr. Guo and started kneading his shoulders.\u201cIt really does feel good,\u201d Mr. Guo said, as Ms. Shen gently whacked his back with a massage clapper device.For some start-ups, having a programmer motivator on staff is one of the many perks to attract male coders, a job that is in high demand in China\u2019s booming tech scene.Feng Zhiyi, 31, who works in research and development at Chainfin.com, said he was envious when photos of female programmer motivators fanning male employees appeared on the internet.\u201cAnd now we have one, too,\u201d Mr. Feng said.Mr. Feng said Ms. Shen had improved the work environment by organizing birthday parties and getting the programmers active with games such as tug of war or sack races.He said he was open to the idea of male programmer motivators but somewhat skeptical. \u201cA man chatting with another man, it\u2019s like going out on a date with a guy,\u201d Mr. Feng said. \u201cA little awkward, isn\u2019t it?\u201dMs. Zhang, the human resources executive who was part of the panel that hired Ms. Shen, stressed that it is important for a programmer motivator to look good. She said the applicants needed to have \u201cfive facial features that must definitely be in their proper order\u201d and speak in a gentle way.They should also have a contagious laugh, be able to apply simple makeup and be taller than 5 feet 2 inches.\u201cHer position is at the front desk, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Ms. Zhang said. \u201cIt may be that people won\u2019t be able to see her if they walk in.\u201dMs. Shen said that she does not consider her job to be sexist.\u201cMany feminist ideas are too extreme now,\u201d she said. \u201cI think women should be independent, self-reliant and have self-respect. And that\u2019s enough.\u201dXu Jiaolong, one of Chainfin.com\u2019s few female programmers, who gets massages from Ms. Shen, did not see anything wrong with the job. The way she saw it, it was a mere \u201cdivision of labor.\u201d But, with a smile, she said the company could consider hiring a man to motivate female programmers, too.China\u2019s tech industry is beginning to question such practices. Wang Jie, 40, the chief executive of Shanbay.com, an app that helps people learn English, has been vocal about the \u201cobjectification\u201d of women by other start-ups.He was so disturbed that some tech companies were using \u201cbeautiful women\u201d to draw male programmers to their companies that he wrote a post last October on Zhihu, China\u2019s version of Quora, the question and answer site, saying that Western companies would be sued back home if they posted similar ads.But Mr. Wang has found that attitudes are difficult to change. Several people responded to his post, saying he was making a mountain out of a molehill.\u201cThe men said: \u2018If there are more beautiful women, I\u2019ll be happier in my job. What\u2019s the issue?\u2019\u201d Mr. Wang said. \u201cAnd some women said: \u2018As a woman, I don\u2019t think this is a problem at all.\u2019\u201dElsie Chen contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Big Reason Wall Street Is Flocking to Spotify: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Good Tuesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Spotify\u2019s shares opened at $165.90.\u2022 If the markets fall again, we have some possible explanations.\u2022 Should Facebook offer \u201cWhy Me?\u201d buttons?\u2022 Disney has offered to buy Sky News to help Fox\u2019s Sky bid.Spotify is a loss-making company that might not report a profit until next decade, but that didn\u2019t stop investors from valuing the company at $30 billion when it debuted Tuesday on the United States stock market.Spotify is an impressive company. Its loyal, paying customer base is enormous and is expected to keep growing. Also, Spotify has so far held its own in the face of competition from Apple, Amazon and Google, all of which want to win new subscribers to their music streaming services.But there is an important reason that Wall Street is flocking to Spotify: It is doing a great job at getting record companies to roll over.Spotify\u2019s main cost is what it pays record companies for the music it streams to its customers. As Spotify has grown, that expense has fallen as a share of its total revenue, which shows that Spotify is negotiating increasingly advantageous deals with record companies.That has bolstered Spotify\u2019s gross profit margin, which measures how much money a company keeps after paying out the costs directly related to generating its revenue. Last year, that margin was 21 percent of revenue at Spotify, well up from 14 percent in 2016.Crucially, though, Spotify has said it expects its gross margin to expand to as much as 35 percent over the longer term. In other words, as Spotify\u2019s spending on music grows, so will its leverage over record companies. And it may well achieve its gross margin target. After all, Netflix, which occupies a similar position in the market for streaming video, has a gross margin of 35 percent.But Spotify\u2019s main rivals could complicate things. What if Amazon offered record companies better terms than Spotify? That would reduce Spotify\u2019s bargaining power, making it harder to deliver wider gross margins investors are expecting. And Amazon, along with Apple and Google, has far deeper pockets to slog it out over the long term.\u2014 Peter EavisSpotify\u2019s unusual path to the public markets was a success.On its first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the music streaming service finished with a valuation of $26.5 billion.Spotify\u2019s shares opened at $165.90 before closing at $149.01.That\u2019s well above the high of $132.50 that its shares changed hands at in private transactions this year. It\u2019s also well above the $137.50 the WSJ reported its private shares were trading at during the past week.Spotify had eschewed a typical initial public offering in favor of a direct listing. That meant there was no \u201cdeal price\u201d for investors to reference on the first day of trading and no underwriters acting as stabilizing agents if the stock began to plunge.Despite all that, Spotify\u2019s valuation at the close on Tuesday ranks among the highest for a tech company debuting on an American exchange.Here\u2019s a look at the tech companies with the 10 biggest market capitalizations after their first day of trading, courtesy of Dealogic:Alibaba \u2014 $233.9 billionFacebook \u2014 $81.7 billionPalm \u2014 $53.3 billionInfineon Technologies \u2014 $47.9 billionJD.com \u2014 $28.9 billionSnap \u2014 $28.9 billionGoogle \u2014 $27.2 billionSpotify \u2014 $26.5 billionTwitter \u2014 $24.9 billionAgilent \u2014 $20.1 billionTesla said:\u2022 It built 2,020 Model 3s in the past seven days. That fell short of its goal of 2,500 by the end of the quarter.\u2022 Tesla produced 9,766 Model 3s during the quarter.\u2022 In total, Tesla produced 35,000 cars in the first quarter.\u2022 It has delivered 8,800 Model 3s during the first quarter, below the 8,800 analysts expected according to Bloomberg.\u2022 In all, Tesla delivered a record 29,980 vehicles during the quarter.\u2022 The company said it expects Model 3 weekly production to reach 5,000 by the end of the second quarter.\u2022 The combined deliveries of the Model X and Model S came to 21,800 cars, the lowest total in several quarters.ContextTesla\u2019s stock and bond prices have plunged amid concerns about how much cash the company is using as it struggles to speed up assembly and sales of the Model 3. With a starting price of $35,000, the car is supposed to be more affordable than Tesla\u2019s other cars. The company has been counting on a quick expansion of its Model 3 business to increase revenue.The president reiterated his claim that Amazon is \u201ccosting the United States Postal Service massive amounts of money\u201d in a post to Twitter on Tuesday morning.Shares are essentially flat on the day.\u201cPackage delivery has been a bright spot for a service that\u2019s lost money for 11 straight years. The losses are mostly due to pension and health care costs \u2014 not the business deal for the Postal Service to deliver packages for Amazon. Boosted by e-commerce, the Postal Service has enjoyed double-digit increases in revenue from delivering packages, but that hasn\u2019t been enough to offset declines in first-class letters and marketing mail, which together make up more than two-thirds of postal revenue.\u201cWhile the Postal Service\u2019s losses can\u2019t be attributed to its package business, Trump\u2019s claim that it could get more bang for its buck may not be entirely far-fetched. A 2017 analysis by Citigroup concluded that the Postal Service was charging below-market rates as a whole for parcels. The post office does not use taxpayer money for its operations.\u201dCould Mr. Tump\u2019s criticism lead to action against Amazon?\u201cNothing can be certain, except death and taxes \u2026 and more Trump tweets on Amazon. We believe sales tax collection changes would have limited impact on consumer use of Amazon and could actually help Amazon\u2019s relative competitive positioning in domestic e-commerce.\u201dMore from Andrew:The \u201cWhy Me?\u201d button might create all sorts of problems for Facebook, and its advertisers, too. It would allow users \u2014 and rivals \u2014 to reverse engineer much of the way the system works. And advertisers would probably object to the idea of making their targeting plans public. But that would be the cost of using such large public platforms with such exact targeting.The bottom line: Disney wants Fox to have full control of Sky to support its $52.4 billion deal to buy most of Fox, and it wants to get ahead of Comcast\u2019s rival effort to buy that 39 percent of the British broadcaster.An earlier version of this article misstated the status of a Department of Defense contract for cloud computing services.

{"Headline": "Trump Slump? Tech, Trade Drag Down Stocks: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Good Monday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching.\u2022 Elon Musk finally responded to last week\u2019s bad news about Tesla.\u2022 Trump continues to go after Amazon.\u2022 China retaliated to President Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs.\u2022 Tech leaders have been keeping mum on Facebook.For months, the stock market rally seemed to have the strength to plow through the obstacles that the Trump administration threw in its way.But now, the S.&P. 500 index is down more than 10 percent from its all-time high.Too much blame can be placed on the White House, however.Before investors began fretting about tech and trade, the underpinnings of the stock market\u2019s ascent were perhaps not as robust as they looked. Wall Street analysts expect earnings for the companies in the S.&P. 500 to increase 25 percent this year, according to data compiled by Standard & Poor\u2019s, an unusually large jump that was reflected in the stock market valuations. Much of that projected earnings increase is coming from tax cuts and some from expectations that companies\u2019 revenue would grow at a nice clip as global growth stayed strong.\u2014 Peter EavisA little humor has not cleared the clouds over Tesla.The accident renews questions about Autopilot, a signature feature of Tesla vehicles, and whether the company has gone far enough to ensure that it keeps drivers and passengers safe.Raj Rajkumar, who researches autonomous driving at Carnegie Mellon University, thinks those assumptions concern one of Tesla\u2019s key sensors. \u201cThe radars they use are apparently meant for detecting moving objects (as typically used in adaptive cruise control systems), and seem to be not very good in detecting stationary objects,\u201d he says.Doubts about the fundamental capabilities of Tesla\u2019s Autopilot could crimp demand for its cars among a customer base that is often seeking the best technology.Out of respect for the privacy of our customer and his family, we do not plan to share any additional details until we conclude the investigation.- Peter EavisTech companies are again dragging down stocks on Wall Street.The S.&P. 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite are off 3.1 percent and 3.5 percent Monday. The continued fall in the share prices of some of the biggest tech companies is weighing heavily on the indexes.Amazon is down 5.4 percent, Netflix is off 5.9 percent, Facebook fell 3 percent, Google-parent Alphabet slipped 3.6 percent and Apple dropped 5.9 percent.After leading the market higher for much of the past two years, tech stocks have hit some turbulence. Since March 16, Facebook, Alphabet, Netflix and Amazon are all down more than 12 percent, while Apple is down 7.3 percent.Over that period the business models of those companies have come under increased scrutiny. News that Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm hired by President Trump\u2019s 2016 election campaign, gained access to private information on more than 50 million Facebook users has weighed not only on the shares of Facebook but on Alphabet as well. Amazon, meanwhile, has come under attack from President Trump.President Trump attacked the e-commerce again on Monday morning.Monday\u2019s tweet is the latest over the past five days from Mr. Trump criticizing Amazon. Over that period, Mr. Trump has accused Amazon of not paying enough taxes, of putting thousands of local retailers out of business and of using the United States Postal Service as its \u201cDelivery Boy.\u201dAmazon\u2019s shares are down 4 percent and are off nearly 11 percent since Axios reported on Wednesday about Mr. Trump\u2019s anger toward the company.Context\u2022 Amazon has said that the Postal Regulatory Commission, which oversees the service, has consistently found that its contracts with Amazon are profitable.Critic\u2019s cornerDA Davidson analyst Tom Forte wrote in a note via Reuters:\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s comments are consistent with industry sources we have spoken to in the shipping industry, who often label Amazon\u2019s deal with the USPS as a sweetheart deal. An argument, however, could be made that the USPS was losing billions before it expanded its service offerings for Amazon and would, still, likely lose billions if Amazon discontinued its use of the USPS tomorrow.\u201dCiting anonymous sources, Bloomberg\u2019s Ian King and Matt Gurman report:\u201cThe initiative, code named Kalamata, is still in the early developmental stages, but comes as part of a larger strategy to make all of Apple\u2019s devices \u2014 including Macs, iPhones, and iPads \u2014 work more similarly and seamlessly together.\u201dApple provides Intel with about 5 percent of its annual revenue.Kenneth C. Griffin\u2019s Citadel has just hired Phil Villhauer, a former top trader at Steven A. Cohen\u2019s investment firm. Mr. Villhauer will become deputy head of global equities at Citadel, a newly created position. He will officially join the Chicago-based hedge fund in the middle of April and work out of Citadel\u2019s office in New York, a Citadel spokesman confirmed.\u201cWe see this as a big hire for us,\u201d said Zia Ahmed, a Citadel spokesman.In January, Mr. Cohen reconfigured Point72 as a hedge fund after establishing it as a family office in 2014 to manage $11 billion of his personal wealth. Point72 has said it has raised between $2 billion and $4 billion in outside money.Mr. Villhauer had been with Mr. Cohen through both the good days and bad days. He was there when SAC turned into a powerhouse hedge fund, and he was there when the fund pleaded guilty to insider trading charges in 2013. The guilty plea required the firm to stop managing money for outside investors.When Mr. Villhauer left Point72, Mr. Cohen, in a letter to employees, called the departure a \u201cretirement\u201d and said he was sad to see Mr. Villhauer go.Now Mr. Villhauer will start a new chapter in his career at another well-known hedge fund firm.____________________________Part of the silence, people in the industry say, comes from a desire to avoid the business equivalent of bad karma \u2014 knowing that they, too, may one day face the buzz saw of public censure.Critic\u2019s corner More on data and privacy The Chinese government said on Monday that it would place tariffs on the imports of 128 American-made products in retaliation for to President Trump\u2019s tariffs on steel and aluminum.The Washington flyaroundWhen the Justice Department allowed Live Nation to merge with Ticketmaster, it tried to assuage concerns that the deal would cripple competitors.But critics have reason to be skeptical. Here\u2019s how Beau Buffier, the chief of the New York Attorney General\u2019s Antitrust Bureau, described Live Nation:\u201cIt is now widely seen as the poster child for the problems that arise when enforcers adopt these temporary fixes to limit the anticompetitive effects of deeply problematic vertical mergers.\u201dThe inquiries come as the department is reviewing two more mergers, between AT&T and Time Warner, and Disney and Fox.The department\u2019s new antitrust chief has said that the Live Nation deal and several other deals posed problems because they relied too much on the federal government\u2019s ability to police corporate behavior.\u201cEven if we wanted to do that, we often don\u2019t have the skills or the tools to do so effectively,\u201d the antitrust chief, Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, said in a speech.More for your playlistThe deals flyaroundAdvertisement"}
