{"Headline": "What Is Causing This Woman\u2019s Severe Muscle Pain?", "Date": "2018-04-11", "News": "Help Dr. Lisa Sanders get to the bottom of unsolved medical mysteries.Editor\u2019s note: Diagnosis is a groundbreaking documentary series from The New York Times and Netflix which harnesses the power of you, our readers, to help find diagnoses for people suffering from mysterious medical conditions. In the story below, Dr. Lisa Sanders, the creator of the long-running column in the New York Times Magazine, shares details of unsolved patient cases for you to diagnose. Whether you\u2019re a doctor, a patient or an amateur medical sleuth, your ideas could potentially help save a life. Readers with the most promising suggestions may be included in an eight-part Netflix series that will air in 2019.This week The New York Times Magazine is reintroducing a version of \u201cThink Like a Doctor,\u201d the online column in which I told the story of a patient with mysterious symptoms \u2014 including posting some medical records and test results \u2014 and challenged readers to unravel the puzzle of that patient\u2019s illness and come up with a diagnosis. But this time, the stakes are higher. In that original column, which I wrote from 2011 to 2016, I already knew the final diagnosis, and I watched as readers commented and discussed the case on the site, finding their way to an answer, a suggested diagnosis. This time around, I will be presenting an unsolved case and asking our readers to do their best to actually help the patient.Again, I will provide test results and other relevant medical data and will challenge you to think like a doctor and come up with a solution to the patient\u2019s illness. In posting these unsolved cases, we hope to leverage the knowledge and wisdom of this particular crowd \u2014 the readers of The New York Times \u2014 to make a difference in the life and well-being of someone in search of an answer, in search of a diagnosis.Below you will find the case of a 23-year-old woman who has recurrent episodes of terrible pain in her muscles, along with urine the color of cola, often after exercising. Reader responses will be reviewed, and the most promising will be forwarded to the provider who is managing the patient\u2019s care. Updates on the patient\u2019s condition and diagnosis will be posted here as progress in the case is made, and each patient\u2019s story, along with input from readers, will be shared in the Diagnosis show on Netflix. O.K., let\u2019s get started.The pain started just as the young nursing student headed down the rocky hiking trail last December. Her thighs and calves suddenly began to burn and throb as if her muscles were exhausted, as if she\u2019d just run a marathon. And yet the 1.5-mile hike up to Mary Jane Falls in Las Vegas had been pretty easy. Angel and her best friend and their two dogs made it to the top in just under an hour. But when she started down the trail, her legs felt worn out and her knees were stiff, and each footfall sent a hot poker of pain from toe to hip. Simply bending her knee became increasingly difficult. After only a few steps, she knew she was in trouble. \u201cI can\u2019t go down,\u201d she said to her companion, her best friend since high school. It was clear she was having another \u201cepisode.\u201d That\u2019s what Angel called the terrible bursts of muscle pain that had landed her in the hospital many times before. Give me your backpack, the friend told Angel. Can you lean on me?The two young women hobbled a few feet down the hillside. The trail wasn\u2019t steep, but with each step, the muscles of her thighs and hips trembled, as if ready to give up completely and drop her to the ground. She tried walking on her tiptoes \u2014 sometimes that helped. Not that day. And resting made no difference. The young woman wept from the pain sharpened by the frustration that she should be made so helpless. She pulled out her phone and called her boyfriend. He, too, had been through this before. He\u2019d be there as soon as he could.It took him almost hour to reach them. By then Angel\u2019s legs were nearly useless. She could barely stand. He lifted her onto his shoulders and headed back down the trail. Although he walked carefully, every step sent daggers through her legs and up her back. The car seemed a million miles away.\u2193Angel had suffered these episodes of muscle pain her whole life. When she was a child, everyone told her they were just growing pains. But one night when she was 14, the pain in her legs was so severe that it woke her. Sobbing, she called out to her parents. It wasn\u2019t the first time she\u2019d complained about her legs, but she\u2019d never had such unbearable pain, and it had never occurred in the middle of the night. When it was clear the pain wasn\u2019t going away, Angel and her mother ended up at Summerlin Hospital Medical Center on the outskirts of Las Vegas.The week before Angel had been sick with what her pediatrician thought was an upper respiratory infection and sinusitis, and she was treated with antihistamines and an antibiotic. She was still taking those medications when she went to the emergency room. In the hospital, she didn\u2019t have a fever, but her urine was noted to be very dark \u2014 the color of tea \u2014 which meant that her muscles weren\u2019t just painful from the exertion but had somehow been damaged. When muscle is destroyed, the protein that makes the tissue red can turn urine brown as it is eliminated from the body. The more of this protein in the urine, the darker the brown discoloration.The E.R. doctors looked for evidence of muscle damage by measuring the blood levels of another tissue component, an enzyme called creatine kinase (CK). Because there is always some breaking down and rebuilding of muscle, there is always some CK in the blood stream as it makes its way to the kidney for elimination. Normal levels are usually between 96 and 140 units per liter. That afternoon, Angel\u2019s CK was over 24,000.The medical term for this kind of muscle breakdown is rhabdomyolysis, or rhabdo (from the Greek meaning the destruction of muscles). Rhabdo is generally not much of a mystery. It\u2019s typically seen after some type of muscle trauma, such as a car accident or fall, or after a medical procedure like surgery. In these cases, the cause of the muscle injury is obvious. Less obvious but more common causes of rhabdo include certain drugs, both prescription and recreational, and alcohol. Extreme exercise can cause rhabdo, although it is usually mild. Certain infections can cause it as well.Angel was admitted to Summerlin for intravenous fluids to help flush the muscle-breakdown products out of her system. And so that her doctors could try to figure out why she had rhabdomyolysis in the first place. None of the most common causes seemed to fit. She was tested for an infection with the bacterium streptococcus (the cause of strep throat), which can cause rhabdo, but the tests were negative. When the rest of the routine testing was normal, her doctors concluded that she probably had some kind of viral infection that injured her muscles and caused the rhabdomyolysis. After a few of days, when her CK levels had lowered to a safer range and the pain resolved, she was discharged and advised to continue to drink plenty of fluids. Angel says she was told that it was very unlikely that this would happen again.\u2193And yet two months later, Angel had a second episode of severe muscle pain. Again, it happened in the middle of the night. Again, her CK was elevated, this time to over 60,000. And once again, it resolved with days of intravenous fluids. This time, however, it wasn\u2019t clear what had caused her rhabdo.Although the \u201cgrowing pains\u201d persisted, she didn\u2019t have to go to the hospital for the next three years. But in March 2012, when Angel was 17 and a senior in high school, she developed a fever and a sore throat. Although a strep test was negative, her pediatrician started her on antibiotics. The next day her muscles started to ache. The day after that her urine turned dark brown \u2014 the color of cola. And when the pain persisted for another day, her parents took her back, once more, to Summerlin Hospital.She was treated for her rhabdo, and this time a nephrologist (a kidney specialist) was consulted to make sure her kidneys would not be injured by the muscle-breakdown product. Repeated tests for strep were negative. She was also tested for lupus (more formally called systemic lupus erythematous) and for thyroid disease \u2014 each can cause rhabdo. The tests were negative. Infections other than strep can cause rhabdo, but they are less common. And really, nothing explained why this young woman would have three episodes of rhabdo in three years.Angel was supposed to follow up as an outpatient, but she ended up in the hospital again before that happened. This time she was seen by a neurologist, and because some of the tests suggested that her liver might be involved, a gastroenterologist. An M.R.I. of her brain was normal, and extensive testing for autoimmune liver diseases were negative. An ultrasound of her abdomen showed a gallstone but nothing that might explain her repeated bouts of muscle destruction and rhabdo.Angel continued to have episodes of severe muscle pain sometimes accompanied by dark urine for the next several years. They became more frequent. She had some pain almost every day, depending on her level of exertion. When her muscles began to hurt, she\u2019d just take it easy, and the pain would fade away. But every three to four months, the pain would go wild. Sometimes it started after she exercised, but not always. It usually started in her legs, then spread upward to her back, her shoulders, her arms. She described it as the kind of ache you might get after working out too hard, only much worse. It would get to be overwhelming, as it had that afternoon at Mary Jane Falls, and her urine would again turn the color of cola, and she knew she had to go to the hospital.\u2193At the bottom of the hill, Angel\u2019s boyfriend helped his sweetheart of the past three years into her friend\u2019s car and drove to Summerlin Hospital. In the E.R., the faces of many of the doctors and nurses were familiar to the young woman after so many visits over the past eight years. She certainly knew the routine by now. Blood would be taken, intravenous fluids would be started and pain medicines would be provided. When the first blood tests came back, Angel said that the E.R. doctor told her that it looked like a mild attack; her CK was 18,000. They\u2019d give her some fluids to help flush the muscle-breakdown products through her kidneys, and maybe she\u2019d be able to go home later that night. But after a few hours of intravenous fluids, instead of the level going down, Angel\u2019s level rose to more than 33,000. She\u2019d have to be admitted so they could keep protecting her kidneys, she was told. By then it was late. She said goodbye to her boyfriend and was finally taken to a room where she could try to get some sleep.She was discharged after five days. By then her CK had dropped to near 1,000, and her urine was clear. She had kept up with her schoolwork \u2014 thanks to the help of some friends. But she knew that unless something changed, there was a very good chance she\u2019d be back in the hospital in a few months with the same problem.\u2193Over the past several years, Angel has been admitted to Summerlin hospital well over 20 times. Most of the time, the doctors providing her care have focused on protecting her kidneys and managing her rhabdo, although several specialists did try to identify a cause for the repeated episodes. A muscle biopsy, performed to see if the cause of the rhabdo is contained within the muscle fibers, was done between hospitalizations; it was normal. A second one done several years later was negative as well. Additional efforts to identify the cause have been frustrated by the frequent hospitalizations. And while she\u2019s been in the hospital, the doctors\u2019 focus has had to be on managing the manifestations of the disease that took her there. Complex or unusual disorders, like this, are best investigated outside the hospital. Angel and her primary care provider, Heather Harris, however, have had trouble finding a specialist to guide them in this complicated work up.Moreover Angel confesses that for the past few years she\u2019s been far too busy between full-time nursing school and part-time waiting tables to spend any more time thinking about her muscle problem than she absolutely has to. It takes time she just doesn\u2019t have to make the appointments, see the doctors and follow up on the tests. But now, she\u2019s worried about her kidneys. And she\u2019s worried because she feels as if she\u2019s getting weaker from all the muscle she\u2019s lost. A recent visit to a neurologist at U.C.L.A. gave her some hope, but Angel is awaiting results.What do you think is going on here? Do you recognize this condition? Where should this patient and Harris, her P.C.P., look next? Enter your comments below, and I\u2019ll let you know what happens in the case as it develops. Please briefly describe your thinking. How a diagnosis is made is often as revealing as the diagnosis itself. And let\u2019s see if we can figure this one out.First and last preferred, please.Thank you for your submission.Illustration by Andreas Samuelsson.

{"Headline": "There\u2019s No Smoking in Disney Films. What About When It Owns Fox?", "Date": "2018-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Add cigarettes to the list of things that the family-friendly Walt Disney Company has to figure out as it prepares to integrate the sharper-edged 20th Century Fox movie and television studio.The requests were made in a Feb. 20 letter to Mr. Iger that was signed by 46 activists and faith-based shareholders. Boiled down, the dispatch, which has not previously been disclosed, raises a broader question shared by some people in Hollywood: How accepting will the Magic Kingdom be of the button-pushing content offered by Fox, the home of the R-rated \u201cDeadpool\u201d superhero franchise, the violent \u201cPlanet of the Apes\u201d movies and \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d the show that once produced an episode featuring a nicotine-laced variety of tomato called \u201ctomacco.\u201dActivists are continuously pressuring studios over one cause or another, but Mr. Murdoch has frequently dismissed such efforts as political correctness run amok. Disney, on the other hand, pays extraordinary attention to its brand perception, which activists often try to use to their advantage.\u201cWe ask you now to follow your convictions, common sense and experience in keeping kids safe,\u201d the antismoking activists wrote in their letter, a copy of which was given to The New York Times by Jono Polansky, a policy consultant for Smoke Free Movies, an initiative at the University of California at San Francisco. \u201cAmid the myriad details involved in a corporate acquisition of this size and complexity, Disney cannot afford to leave young people\u2019s health and lives unprotected.\u201dDisney declined to comment.Fox\u2019s approach to smoking has been much more permissive over the same time span. Since 2015, Fox has released more than a dozen PG-13 movies with tobacco imagery, including \u201cX-Men: Apocalypse,\u201d \u201cMiss Peregrine\u2019s Home for Peculiar Children,\u201d \u201cMurder on the Orient Express\u201d and \u201cLove, Simon.\u201dIn December, when Disney unveiled its agreement with 21st Century Fox, Mr. Iger told reporters that he foresaw no challenges with Fox content because of Disney\u2019s history of \u201cmanaging brands in a compartmentalized way.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe\u2019re in the business of managing brands that are very different in nature. Marvel is certainly far afield from Disney.\u201dMr. Polansky, the Smoke Free Movies consultant, vowed to continue pressuring studios beyond Disney and Fox. \u201cTo quote the Hollywood clich\u00e9, \u2018We can do this the easy way or the hard way,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cBut it will happen.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Comic Performers Play It Dark in Netflix Movies", "Date": "2018-04-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cCargo,\u201d a Netflix Original movie that will have its premiere on May 18, has an exemplary slow-burn opening. On a quiet river in the middle of a beautiful Australian landscape, Andy, played by Martin Freeman, steers a houseboat. In its kitchen area, his wife, Kay, feeds their infant daughter. Things look idyllic. The boat eases toward the shoreline; some balloons in trees hint of a celebration. Andy looks across the water at a patriarchal figure, who stares back, deadeyed. The man raises his shirt to show a revolver tucked into his jeans.But \u201cCargo\u201d has more than a few terrifying, and provocative, tricks. In this movie\u2019s zombie pandemic, people who are bitten don\u2019t turn into flesh eaters immediately. When Andy is infected, he has 48 hours to find a nonzombie guardian for his daughter. As it happens, the indigenous people of this region seem to have a higher survival rate than others. They have gone back to the \u201cold ways,\u201d says Thoomi (Simone Landers, a newcomer who does excellent work), an indigenous teenage girl who befriends Andy. These ways include body and face paint to ward off the undead.One of these survivors is played by David Gulpilil, who made his screen debut in the 1971 film \u201cWalkabout\u201d and whose presence in Australian and Australia-set cinema (his CV includes classics like \u201cThe Last Wave, \u201d from 1979, and the 1986 hit \u201cCrocodile Dundee\u201d) has rendered him a genuine icon. Mr. Freeman, the adept comic actor, is always good playing an ordinary joe, and here he portrays one in an extraordinary jam. The movie depicts his character\u2019s heroism without creating a \u201cwhite savior\u201d tale; instead, it advocates community and communal action.Two other recent Netflix Original movies feature comedy actors honing their dramatic chops. In \u201c6 Balloons,\u201d which had its premiere on April 6, Abbi Jacobson of the Comedy Central series \u201cBroad City,\u201d plays opposite Dave Franco, whose recent comedic turns include a role in \u201cThe Disaster Artist\u201d and voice work on \u201cBoJack Horseman.\u201d Written and directed by Marja-Lewis Ryan (who is developing a reboot of the Showtime series \u201cThe L Word\u201d), the film tells a fraught brother-sister story. Ms. Jacobson plays Katie, a young Angeleno preparing a surprise Fourth of July birthday party for her boyfriend. Running her errands, she makes the mistake of picking up her brother Seth, portrayed by Mr. Franco. A heroin addict who\u2019s detoxed, rehabbed and relapsed more than once, he\u2019s high again, with a toddler in tow.Katie jettisons her celebration plans and tries to check Seth into a detox center, is turned away for insurance reasons, and seeks an alternative. As she tries to help her brother she reflexively lies to her friends and relatives. All the while she tolerates his petty insults. A recurring motif is a voice-over reading from a self-help book, \u201cLetting Go With Love,\u201d which compares the enabling relative\u2019s plight to a person who repeatedly boards a boat he knows is bound to sink.Ms. Ryan, the director, extends the metaphor by showing Katie\u2019s car filling with water as the words from the book play on the soundtrack. The effect does not quite work, but both lead actors acquit themselves well, Ms. Jacobson especially. Her portrayal of a put-upon, constantly heartbroken woman whose concern for her brother places her in a state of misery and danger is never showy and always credible. Mr. Franco is at his best when his character is at his most crassly infuriating.The closing of this real-life shop is the hook for a road trip in the film. Ed Harris plays Ben Ryder, a renowned photographer who\u2019s dying; Jason Sudeikis is Matt, Ben\u2019s son, long estranged from his father and struggling to keep his music industry job in New York. Summoned by Ben\u2019s personal assistant, Zoe (Elizabeth Olsen) to drive to the Midwest with his dad, Matt flat-out refuses and isn\u2019t shy about communicating how much of an affront he considers the proposal. But when Ben\u2019s lawyer, Larry (Dennis Haysbert), dangles a career opportunity, Matt relents. And so the journey begins.When Matt finally visits his father, the aging but still badass Ben is banging away at a drum kit, which, it turns out, once belonged to Matt. Ben chides Matt for giving up music. This is the kind of movie where you just know you\u2019ll see Matt behind that drum kit before the end.Mr. Sudeikis is a funny fellow but his default facial expression is that of a guy at a bar contriving his next wisecrack. He\u2019s resourceful, though. In this film, he makes his narrow range work for him; it suits the character\u2019s emotional estrangement, and by the time Matt is able to make a real connection, Mr. Sudeikis doesn\u2019t have to overplay to put it across. \u201cKodachrome\u201d is several times too slick for its own good; Mark Raso\u2019s direction is a major culprit here. But the writing, from Jonathan Tropper, is more tart and frank than is customary in such exercises, particularly in the exchanges between Mr. Sudeikis and Mr. Harris. If you\u2019ve enjoyed these performers before, you\u2019ll enjoy them here.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Waffle House Shooting Suspect Is in Custody, Nashville Police Say", "Date": "2018-04-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNASHVILLE \u2014 The police on Monday arrested the suspect in a rampage at a Waffle House restaurant that left four people dead in Nashville, after a tip from the public set them on the trail of the man who had evaded them for nearly 34 hours.The authorities announced the arrest of the suspect, Travis Reinking, just after 1 p.m., in a wooded area that was within sight of the apartment complex where he lived.After receiving a tip of a man matching Mr. Reinking\u2019s description in that area, several detectives entered the woods, and when one recognized the suspect, he drew his gun and ordered him to the ground.Lt. Carlos Lara of the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department said Mr. Reinking was wearing a backpack that contained a loaded handgun and ammunition, but surrendered without incident.\u201cYesterday was a horrible day for the city of Nashville,\u201d Mayor David Briley said. \u201cToday is a day where we can start to move on as a community, I hope.\u201dIn the minutes following Mr. Reinking\u2019s arrest, police cars, their blue lights flashing, lined the road running parallel to the tree line. Officers stood at ease beneath an overcast sky, with the capture of the suspect having eased the worries coursing through the heart of a metropolitan area of more than 1.8 million people.The authorities had cautioned that Mr. Reinking, who was accused of using an AR-15 in the assault early Sunday, should be considered \u201carmed and dangerous.\u201d On Monday morning the police said there were 160 law enforcement officers searching for Mr. Reinking, but there had been \u201cno credible sightings\u201d of him at that time.The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation had added Mr. Reinking to its Top Ten Most Wanted list, and some of Nashville\u2019s public schools imposed \u201clockout\u201d rules on Monday in a bid to protect students and staff members from a suspect who was at large into the workweek.By the time classes were dismissed on Monday, Mr. Reinking was in custody. But investigators said they were still working to piece together the attack that also left four others wounded.The carnage stirred fears of a hate crime because Mr. Reinking is white and three of the people who were killed were black.But in an interview on Monday, about an hour before Mr. Reinking\u2019s arrest, the mayor said he had no reason to believe that the shooting was provoked by racial animus.\u201cNobody has told me anything that would indicate that\u2019s the motivating factor,\u201d Mr. Briley said in his office.Instead, Mr. Briley said there was \u201cenough indication that there was some element of mental illness associated with it, as opposed to it being intentional or planned.\u201dMr. Reinking has had other encounters with law enforcement, including an arrest near the White House last July when he crossed a security barrier as he sought a meeting with President Trump. And just last week, police officers near Nashville pursued Mr. Reinking after he was accused of stealing a B.M.W. from a dealership in Brentwood, said Don Aaron, a spokesman for the Nashville police.After the car was reported stolen, officers spotted the vehicle, Mr. Aaron said, and began chasing it through rush-hour traffic. The police soon stopped the pursuit because of concerns for other motorists\u2019 safety and because the car had tracking technology.The police found the car later that evening at the apartment complex where Mr. Reinking lived, Mr. Aaron said, but \u201cthey had no idea who the man was.\u201dMr. Reinking is believed to have moved to Nashville last fall, and police reports show family members expressed concern for his welfare after he exhibited delusional behavior for an extended time, including expressing a belief that the entertainer Taylor Swift was stalking him and hacking his phone and Netflix account.After his arrest near the White House Mr. Reinking, who lived in Morton, Ill., was forced to surrender three rifles and a handgun to officials in August, just months before he moved to Nashville.In the wake of the rampage in Nashville on Sunday, officials could not fully explain how Mr. Reinking regained possession of his weapons. The Tazewell County Sheriff\u2019s Office in Illinois gave the weapons he owned \u2014 including the AR-15 he took to the Waffle House on Sunday \u2014 to his father, Jeffrey Reinking.\u201cHe was allowed to do that after he assured deputies that he would keep them secure and away from Travis,\u201d Sheriff Huston said. \u201cWe have no information about how Travis came back into possession of those firearms.\u201dThe police in Nashville indicated that Mr. Reinking\u2019s father returned the weapons to his son. He could not be reached for comment on Monday.On Monday, however, Special Agent Marcus Watson of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said Mr. Reinking\u2019s father could face a prosecution of his own for violating weapons laws.Trip Gabriel, Christopher Mele and Jacey Fortin contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

And most of the action happens in text. It\u2019s a story about interiority, anxiety and mental health. Trigger warning, because there are references to sexual assault, as well. So it\u2019s kind of just like a really heady conversation between two people who just imprint on each other. It\u2019s a very small and considered story. That is the type of storytelling that I wanted to examine and the way I friendship.You have said that \u201chigh-key nothing happens,\u201d and reading the book felt kind of like a similar experience as having a long-distance relationship, which is sometimes based on things that seem small to other people, like a text, but is huge in long-distance-relationship life. Was that intentional?Watching two people fall in love is so boring. It\u2019s like, Oh my God, they really are literally Netflix and chilling. Or here they are going to the supermarket. There are so many little pedestrian things that add up to become an intense thing. With texting too. It\u2019s like if you\u2019re super-busy that day and you\u2019re running around doing all this crazy stuff and haven\u2019t checked your phone for one reason or another because you\u2019re in class or you\u2019re at work and then you look at your phone and your person has left you a little treat, like a funny little anecdote almost like a gift-wrap parcel of affection that regardless of where this person is in a time-space that they\u2019re thinking of you. And that\u2019s really, really nice. And you\u2019ve talked about the diversity that exists in the Y.A. space. Tell me more about that. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s particular to the political climate, or just where the conversation is, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s new or it\u2019s been there for a while because I\u2019m so new to this space. But I really love that black women are dominating the Y.A. best-seller chart. It is really, really awesome. And with that it just does give me a little bit of hope, and it does really encourage me to take these small defiant steps that I am, where I will make my lead a woman of color. I will get truculent and really outraged if people try to cast white people in these roles that I\u2019m making up. I really do think that every little bit helps and every little bit counts. The difference between doing something and not doing something is immense, even though it feels small. So my therapist, because I\u2019ve struggled with eating disorders, was like, \u201cI really want you to find a dietitian. I\u2019m like, \u2018But why, I\u2019ve personally decided that I\u2019m in remission.\u2019 And he\u2019s like, sure, but it\u2019s about knowing who that person is that can help you out with this problem when you need them, because when you need them you\u2019re not going to have all your faculties about you and you\u2019re not going to be in a position to then start looking for this person. So just have that person in place and make sure you like them. And that\u2019s kind of my takeaway. It\u2019s almost like assigning yourself a godparent of your choosing, where if you really fall apart and things get really bad, and maybe your family can\u2019t help you for one reason or another \u2014 either their love is conditional or you\u2019re in a position where you\u2019re taking care of them or whatever. You should know who your emergency contact is preferably before you really need them. I mean, it seems counter to self-sufficiency to be like, \u201cI have a friend who I check in with every time I get on the plane and every time I get off a plane, or \u201cI have a friend who literally knows everywhere I\u2019m going. If I\u2019m going on a date with someone.\u201d These are all really important. They might seem small in the moment, but they make you feel better about a lot of things. I mean, we all know what, like, microaggressions are but there are things like micro-traumas too, and sometimes just leaning on someone who\u2019s so happy to be leaned on for you, it just alleviates something.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Time Warner C.E.O. Testifies That AT&T Merger Is Needed to Battle Silicon Valley", "Date": "2018-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Time Warner\u2019s chief executive, Jeffrey Bewkes, vigorously defended his company\u2019s $85.4 billion merger with AT&T on Wednesday, saying the deal was necessary to confront \u201ctectonic changes\u201d in entertainment caused by internet competitors like Netflix and Amazon.Before a packed courtroom on Wednesday, Mr. Bewkes portrayed Time Warner as an underdog against Silicon Valley giants that can reach hundreds of millions of users and are spending billions of dollars a year to produce original shows that compete with Time Warner\u2019s HBO and Turner Broadcasting.\u201cWe don\u2019t have the tech platform, don\u2019t have the engineers, don\u2019t have the infrastructure,\u201d Mr. Bewkes said in arguing for his company\u2019s need to combine with AT&T, a mobile wireless and satellite television giant with access to more than 150 million subscribers nationwide.In cross-examination, a lawyer for the Justice Department grilled Mr. Bewkes on the underdog narrative, and presented an internal document that Mr. Bewkes wrote in January 2017 to Time Warner\u2019s board that touted the company\u2019s revenue projections. The document also showed that Time Warner was planning to introduce digital products even without the potential merger.AT&T\u2019s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, is expected to testify as soon as Thursday. John Stankey, the AT&T executive who is poised to run Time Warner after the merger, also began testimony on Wednesday afternoon. Arguments are expected to close as early as April 30. Judge Richard J. Leon of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, who is presiding over the case, is expected to take about a month before giving his opinion.For Mr. Bewkes, 65, the courtroom appearance was a rare public pleading to salvage a career-defining deal. The media titan is a 39-year veteran of Time Warner and has been chief executive since 2008, overseeing the spinoff of Time Warner Cable a year later, the rise of HBO and the turbulent evolution of CNN and the Warner Bros. movie studio.Confident and congenial, Mr. Bewkes engaged directly with Judge Leon, leaning forward in his chair and making eye contact as he explained how the media industry is being challenged by Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google and Netflix. He described the Justice Department\u2019s theory that the merged company would threaten to withhold Time Warner content from rival cable operators as \u201cridiculous.\u201dAmong the biggest problems for Time Warner as a stand-alone television and movie producer is that it does not have access to viewer data to target advertising and other valuable customer information the same way that Amazon and Netflix do, Mr. Bewkes said.\u201cWe don\u2019t have emails, contact information, billing information \u2026 any of these things,\u201d he said.At the center of the antitrust trial are arguments over consumer and competitive harms, with attention focused on economic analyses presented by both sides last week. The Justice Department and several consumer groups said the deal would hurt consumers, who would have to pay bigger bills as a result of higher prices for Time Warner programs.The companies have argued that the Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit is at least a decade behind the times. Time Warner said companies like Google and Facebook have the most valuable data on users but they are not willing to share that information.Mr. Bewkes said he has also unsuccessfully tried to buy data on viewers from distributors like Comcast, which was only willing to sell limited sets.These trends prompted Mr. Stephenson and Mr. Bewkes in the summer of 2016 to meet to discuss business options, Mr. Bewkes said Wednesday. In late August 2016, over a three-hour lunch on the 10th-floor dining room of the Time Warner building in New York, they agreed a merger made the most sense. The companies\u2019 boards approved the plan soon after.Judge Leon, who has not commented much throughout the trial, has said the action was a \u201crare breed of horse\u201d but not a \u201cunicorn.\u201dMr. Bewkes and Mr. Stephenson have previously suggested that the Justice Department was influenced to block the deal by presidential politics. President Trump said during his election campaign that the deal should be denied. Mr. Trump has also repeatedly bashed CNN for its coverage of his administration.The Justice Department has denied any political interference in its suit to block the deal.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "MoviePass Says All Is Well. Even Some of Its Customers Are Skeptical.", "Date": "2018-04-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLAS VEGAS \u2014 MoviePass has had a hard few months.\u201cI\u2019m not worried about the viability of MoviePass at all,\u201d said Ted Farnsworth, chief executive of Helios and Matheson Analytics, which owns 92 percent of the service, with Verizon holding the balance. \u201cOur customer service has dramatically improved, we\u2019ve worked out the little bugs with the technology and we have plenty of money to get through the next year.\u201dMoviePass, which has been around since 2011, now has more than two million subscribers, up from 20,000 in August, when the company drastically cut prices. Suddenly you could see a movie a day in theaters, 365 days a year, for $10 a month. It\u2019s such an eye-popping deal that 32 percent of MoviePass\u2019s own subscribers believe the service won\u2019t last, according to data released this week by National Research Group, a movie industry consulting firm.\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve been saying,\u201d he said.Mr. Farnsworth spoke in a joint interview with Mitch Lowe, chief executive of MoviePass. They came across as giddy \u2014 something that Mr. Farnsworth chalked up to the thrill of owning a \u201chot company,\u201d and that Mr. Lowe, eating from a bag of Fritos, credited to \u201calcohol.\u201dUnder the MoviePass business model, theaters are paid full price for every admission. People who sign up receive a membership card that functions like a debit card. When members want to see a movie (no more than one a day), they use a MoviePass smartphone app to check in at the theater. The app instantly transfers the price of a ticket to the membership card. Members in turn use the card to pay for entry. And it all works independently of theaters.To a degree, the service depends on traditional subscription economics: more people pay than go. \u201cWe\u2019re profitable on 88 percent of our customers,\u201d Mr. Farnsworth said.It gets more complicated, however, when you consider heavy users and the price of movie tickets. According to the National Association of Theater Owners, the organization holding its annual gathering in Las Vegas, tickets cost an average of $8.97. But theaters in cities like New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco routinely charge $16.50 for a standard ticket.MoviePass believes it can make money by striking bulk ticket pricing partnerships with theaters; charging studios fees to promote new films to members; and perhaps even growing big enough (20 million subscribers is a goal) to demand a slice of concession revenue, although Mr. Lowe appears, for now at least, to have backed away from that particular aspiration.\u201cIt\u2019s really a mistake for people to think that we\u2019re after their concessions,\u201d he said.Mr. Lowe and Mr. Farnsworth said they already had some deals in place with studios, although they would not say which ones. \u201cWe\u2019re collecting significant revenue from partnerships,\u201d Mr. Lowe said. \u201cBut they say: \u2018Don\u2019t tell anyone that we\u2019re paying you. We don\u2019t want to make the theater owners mad.\u2019\u201dToo late. Companies like AMC Entertainment, the largest theater chain in North America, have dismissed MoviePass as a fly-by-night operation. \u201cAMC has absolutely no intention \u2014 I repeat, no intention \u2014 of sharing any \u2014 I repeat, any \u2014 of our admissions revenue or our concessions revenue,\u201d Adam Aron, AMC\u2019s chief executive, told analysts late last year.Mr. Aron remains a nonbeliever. Told by a reporter about the assertions made by Mr. Farnsworth and Mr. Lowe about financial viability and improved customer service (they have vastly expanded that department), Mr. Aron narrowed his eyes and said, \u201cOur view on MoviePass hasn\u2019t changed.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Shipping Costs Have Put Amazon in a Bind: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Good Friday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Does Amazon have its shipping costs under control?\u2022 What will come out of the Merkel-Trump meeting?\u2022 Why Deutsche Bank was so late to make necessary cuts.\u2022 More complaints have emerged about NBC News\u2019s response to harassment allegations.Amazon\u2019s shipping costs have suddenly become a hot subject, not just to President Trump, but also to the 100 million people who have Amazon Prime.Higher shipping costs are a reason Amazon is raising the cost of Prime membership to $119 a year from $99.But a 20 percent hike is a lot for even a popular service, and it could turn customers off. So why did Amazon do it? The e-commerce giant\u2019s results provide some clues.Members of Prime get free shipping, though their membership fees partially pay for that perk. As the Prime program covers more goods, it\u2019s getting more expensive for Amazon. \u201cOur two-day shipping, it\u2019s now available on over 100 million items, up from 20 million as recently as 2014,\u201d Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon\u2019s C.F.O., said on a conference call Thursday when announcing the increase in the Prime membership fee.The cost pressures from shipping are getting uncomfortable for Amazon. Worldwide shipping costs totaled $6.1 billion in the first quarter of this year, equivalent to 22.5 percent of Amazon\u2019s sales from its online stores during the period. That\u2019s up from 2017, when quarterly shipping costs averaged 19.9 percent of online sales. By bringing shipping costs back down to 20 percent of online sales, Amazon could, in theory, save over $2.5 billion a year (2.5 percent of annualized first-quarter sales comes to roughly $2.8 billion.)To save money, Amazon could offer free shipping on fewer goods, but that could undermine the company\u2019s efforts to bolster sales. And Amazon doesn\u2019t need to do that if it can increase its Prime fees, to help recoup the higher shipping costs. But the fee increase may not be enough. Charging 100 million Prime members an extra $20 per year, in theory, raises \u201conly\u201c $2 billion.- Peter EavisMore on her challenge, from the NYT:Few leaders seem less personally in sync with Mr. Trump than Ms. Merkel. Estranged by widely diverging temperaments and leadership styles, the two leaders have also clashed on substance \u2014 from climate change and military spending to Germany\u2019s chronic, yawning trade surplus with the United States, a particular bugbear of the president.Or as a former State Department official told the NYT, \u201cMerkel is going to Washington and it looks like the U.S. just doesn\u2019t care.\u201d But a foreign relations expert said, \u201cNever underestimate Merkel.\u201dA combination of the two companies would complete one of the telecommunications industry\u2019s most long-awaited transactions and would create the third-largest wireless carrier in the United States, with more than 127 million customers. Sprint and T-Mobile have tried to negotiate a merger twice before.Analysts have argued, and Sprint and T-Mobile themselves have acknowledged, that the companies need greater scale and more resources to better compete against the industry\u2019s leaders, Verizon and AT&T.Should the deal be completed, only three companies would dominate the market in the United States for cellphone service. It is unclear whether the transaction would get regulatory approval. A previous round of merger talks ended in 2014, having drawn strong opposition from the Obama administration.\u2014 Michael de la MercedWhat Mr. Ubben had to say: \u201cThe management and board of FOX has done a superb job of steering the company through a time of transition for the entertainment industry.\u201dWhat Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch had to say: \u201cJeff has been an important partner during a transformational period. Our board and, ultimately, our shareholders, have benefited enormously from his many contributions.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la Merced\u2022 Nonresidential fixed investment \u2014 what businesses spend on equipment, software, buildings and intellectual property \u2014 increased at a solid 6.1 percent.\u2022 Business spending on equipment climbed 4.7 percent, down from 11.6 percent in the fourth quarter.Bigger pictureEconomists on Wall Street and in Washington have repeatedly warned that the economy\u2019s upward streak is unlikely to extend beyond the next year or two.Over the longer term, the Fed expects real annual growth in the United States to fall to 1.8 percent. The Congressional Budget Office\u2019s 10-year outlook comes to the same disappointing conclusion.The nation\u2019s debt has topped $21 trillion and is growing, a level many view as unsustainable. And if the Federal Reserve follows through on its plan to raise interest rates, the cost of paying off that debt will grow larger.\u2022 Hubris: Unlike rivals, Deutsche Bank didn\u2019t raise capital after the financial crisis, ultimately leaving it significantly weaker. By the end of last year, its tangible equity capital ratio was still below JPMorgan Chase in 2011. (Perhaps Germany\u2019s banking regulator should have applied more pressure, as Switzerland\u2019s did.)\u2022 Fear: Did Deutsche Bank\u2019s leaders worry about scaling back the investment bank because of its huge importance for revenue? (Last year, it provided 54 percent.) And about the cost of unwinding some trades?The news organization asserted that the complaints that led to Matt Lauer being ousted from the \u201cToday\u201d show were the first of their kind. Others disagree:What NBC News has done: Brought in a consultant for in-person sexual harassment prevention seminars and pledged to share the results of an internal review.The online video giant has largely avoided the political heat that has burned Facebook, but it has still lurched from crisis to crisis, particularly over upsetting videos.The idea is that someday humans will be able to train the machines, in a similar manner, to sniff out misinformation, smut, and abuse.Sure, there\u2019s logic to it, in the face of the threat from Netflix and Amazon. But as the two companies continue to bicker over price and executive chairs, is there another reason Shari Redstone is pushing the idea so hard, when other CBS shareholders seem uninterested?What seems to be driving Shari Redstone is familial score-settling, a quest for victory over her father, who never wanted her to have a role in either Viacom or CBS. \u201cIt\u2019s the story of a person who was mistreated by her father,\u201d said the source who recently noted Sumner\u2019s physical condition, and has known the father and daughter for an extensive period of time.Advertisement"}

Stomachs were likely to churn at ABC\u2019s Burbank, Calif., headquarters only if the show lost more than 25 percent of its initial audience.The third episode was about a generational parenting conflict that pitted Roseanne\u2019s stricter, more traditional style against the looser, hands-off approach of her daughter Darlene.A wild card factor is how much of a ratings drop will come in the show\u2019s third week. Will \u201cRoseanne\u201d suffer mild, 5-to-10-percent declines as it moves closer to its ninth and final episode? Or will the falloff be steeper?To make matters more complicated, Ms. Barr has her Twitter feed back.The message, which was later deleted, raised questions about whether Ms. Barr might eventually cause a revolt among viewers or advertisers, a cause for some concern among ABC executives, who have publicly backed their reborn star.\u201cYou can\u2019t control Roseanne Barr,\u201d Ben Sherwood, the president of Disney and ABC\u2019s television group, said in an interview last week. \u201cMany who have tried have failed. She\u2019s the one and only.\u201dIf the show continues to deliver strong numbers, it could help take ABC out of last place among the four major broadcast networks.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Goldman\u2019s Gains in Trading Raise a Familiar Dilemma: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Tuesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 A \u2018Geneva Convention\u2019 for cyberwar?\u2022 Did Goldman\u2019s trading business perform too well?\u2022 The U.S.-China fight has pushed deeper into tech.Goldman Sachs\u2019s strong first-quarter earnings raise a familiar dilemma for the bank.The results got a significant fillip from trading, a business Goldman must do well in, but not so well that investors think the bank is too dependent on it. And a breakdown of first-quarter revenue shows the dominance of trading. Revenue from trading in stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities and derivatives totaled $4.39 billion during the first three months of the year. That works out at 44 percent of total revenue, well above the 37 percent share that trading had in 2017.Stock and bond markets are unpredictable, even in relatively good times, so the helpful trading conditions this quarter may not last. What can Goldman\u2019s senior executives do to persuade investors that the bank is a lot more than a trading shop? They can point to the fact that David M. Solomon is in line to succeed Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman\u2019s current C.E.O. Mr. Solomon ascent took place in the bank\u2019s powerful investment banking division, not its trading operations.Goldman\u2019s leaders can continue to talk about the steps the bank is taking to widen its client base and diversify into other businesses that might have more stable revenue, like its relatively new consumer lending operations. But such businesses are going to take time to make a meaningful contribution.And it\u2019s important to remember that other major businesses at Goldman are also volatile. Investing and lending, which mostly involves making longer-term investments in companies, and whose revenue can be unpredictable, made up 21 percent of total revenue in the first quarter, the second largest contribution.Despite the bumper results in trading along with investing and lending, Goldman\u2019s shares slid slightly on Tuesday, suggesting investors are waiting on longer-term trends than one quarter\u2019s results.But the volatility of revenue is not the only reason investors are often skeptical about Wall Street firms. The huge amounts that they pay out in compensation is also a concern. When revenue rises, so does pay. As a result, money that could have fallen to the bottom line at other types of companies instead gets paid out to traders and bankers. Compensation at Goldman Sachs made up 45 percent of non-interest revenue in the first quarter, up from 44 percent the first quarter of 2017.\u2014 Peter EavisHere are the numbers:The move comes amid an outcry prompted by the arrests of two African-American men at a Starbucks location in Philadelphia last week.The two men were arrested after asking to use the restroom in the shop. An employee refused their request, because the men had not bought anything, according to officials. The men sat down and were asked to leave, and an employee eventually called the police. The prosecutor\u2019s office in Philadelphia reviewed the case and declined to pursue charges against the men because of \u201ca lack of evidence that a crime was committed,\u201d according to a spokesman.Some may be optimistic that the $1.5 trillion tax cut will extend the business cycle.The strategists at Morgan Stanley are not among them.\u201cWhile there\u2019s a fair amount of debate about how much this fiscal expansion extended the economic cycle, for markets our analysis suggests we\u2019re closer to the end of the day than the beginning. Hence, there\u2019s less reason to behave like it\u2019s \u2018morning in America\u2019 than \u2018happy hour in America.\u2019\u201dKey points\u2022 Morgan Stanley argues that while the tax cuts will help lift growth in the near term, its benefits are already priced into the markets.\u2022 The new tax law creates economic cliffs, as many key provisions in the law are not permanent and end in just a few years.\u2022 The tax cuts may make it more difficult for the government to turn to fiscal stimulus to fight the next downturn.In conclusion\u201cWhile this policy supports growth in the near term, it may worsen the next downturn while limiting the fiscal reaction to it. Even if those concerns are unfounded, we think much of fiscal stimulus\u2019 \u2018good news\u2019 is already in the price of key markets.\u201dThe streaming video company added 7.41 million subscribers during the first quarter. Its profit jumped 62 percent, and sales grew 40 percent.Netflix also said it plans to spend $10 billion on content and marketing this year.Shares are up 8.6 percent Tuesday and 75 percent this year. That easily beats the S.&P. 500, which has gained just 0.2 percent this year. It also tops the performance of its fellow FANG stocks. Facebook is off 4.5 percent this year, Google-parent Alphabet is up about 3 percent, and Amazon has risen 28 percent.Stephen Ju, an analyst over at Credit Suisse, writes in a note titled \u201cGetting Closer and Closer to Achieving Escape Velocity\u201d:\u201cNetflix continues to reap the benefits of its programming win streak, as it wields its large content acquisition budget as a weapon to put greater distance between itself and its competitors (especially as Disney prepares to exit the platform). And we find it hard to argue with the accelerated pace of subscriber additions as the conceptual proof of its capital allocation decision, and we also expect the Street to continue to underwrite the investments.\u201dTwitter is having an even better day.The stock is up 87 percent over that period.The NYT\u2019s David Sanger says the impetus came largely from Microsoft\u2019s president, Brad Smith, \u201cwho has been arguing for several years that the world needs a \u2018digital Geneva Convention\u2019 that sets norms of behavior for cyberspace just as the Geneva Conventions set rules for the conduct of war in the physical world.\u201dAlso striking: Who hasn\u2019t yet signed, including Google, Apple and Amazon.More from Michael:Ms. Massenet and Mr. Brown are counting on Ms. Massenet\u2019s Net-a-Porter experience and contacts to help Imaginary Ventures stand out. The firm has already invested in companies like Glossier and Everlane, an upstart clothing brand.Mr. Ballmer said of the latest report, \u201cPublic companies owe this level of transparency to shareholders; I think citizens, as America\u2019s shareholders, deserve the same.\u201dAs more financial firms move to pressure gun makers and sellers into self-regulation, the advocacy group (backed by Mike Bloomberg) plans to ask them to press for more policy positions and operational changes.Among them: Requiring background checks for all gun sales; more funding for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; having gun makers require sellers to adopt a code of conduct; and adopting smart-gun tech.Advertisement"}

Ms. Conway sat expressionlessly. Ms. Sanders, granted a seat of honor on the dais, limited her reaction to an arched eyebrow and pursed lips.It was an earthy performance by Correspondents\u2019 dinner standards, if nothing out of place in an average comedy club. But feedback from the political left and right quickly leapt to extremes.\u201cIt was personally offensive,\u201d Brian Kilmeade, a co-host of \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d said in the ballroom, minutes after Ms. Wolf ended her set.\u201cTo me, that was an attack to impress Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert,\u201d Mr. Kilmeade added, previewing a line of criticism that would be dominant on Fox News by Sunday morning. \u201cCongratulations, when the three of you go out to dinner, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be laughing a lot. But in terms of the people here and the people at home \u2014 totally offensive, horrible choice. In fact, it\u2019s the reason why the president didn\u2019t want to go.\u201dCritics of President Trump \u2014 who is no stranger to lobbing insult-comic punch lines at his opponents and is the first president to outright skip the Correspondents\u2019 gala since Jimmy Carter \u2014 wondered what the fuss was about.\u201cBefore we criticize Michelle Wolf, let\u2019s remember that Donald Trump has done and said some of the crudest things that any president in history has ever done,\u201d said Howard Fineman, an analyst at NBC News and MSNBC. \u201cJust have a little perspective.\u201dBy Sunday, Ms. Wolf, a contributor to \u201cThe Daily Show With Trevor Noah\u201d whose Netflix talk show starts in May, had seemingly scandalized Washington\u2019s intersecting political and media tribes.\u201cThank you!\u201d Ms. Wolf replied.Prominent Washington journalists, meanwhile, took pains to defend Ms. Sanders \u2014 earning their own opprobrium from some liberals who asked why reporters were sticking up for an administration that routinely impugns their work.Andrea Mitchell, the NBC News correspondent, tweeted that an \u201capology is owed\u201d to the press secretary. Her network colleague Mika Brzezinski wrote that \u201cwatching a wife and mother be humiliated on national television for her looks is deplorable.\u201dSeveral reporters who cover the White House approached Ms. Sanders in the Hilton ballroom to express sympathy in the immediate aftermath of Ms. Wolf\u2019s monologue. Later, at a windswept after party hosted by NBC News, Ms. Sanders appeared in good spirits as reporters swarmed her. (She even took time to chastise one journalist for asking a question at a news conference that she disliked.)Late on Sunday, Margaret Talev, president of the Correspondents\u2019 Association, issued a statement acknowledging \u201cdismay\u201d from members about Ms. Wolf\u2019s performance.\u201cLast night\u2019s program was meant to offer a unifying message about our common commitment to a vigorous and free press,\u201d Ms. Talev wrote. \u201cUnfortunately, the entertainer\u2019s monologue was not in the spirit of that mission.\u201dMs. Talev said her organization would consider new ideas about the future format of the dinner \u2014 a sentiment echoed by Mr. Trump in a tweet about a half-hour later.\u201cThe White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner was a failure last year, but this year was an embarrassment to everyone associated with it,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, adding: \u201cPut Dinner to rest, or start over!\u201dGoing back to Stephen Colbert\u2019s blistering monologue in 2006 \u2014 delivered as President George W. Bush sat unsmiling a few feet away \u2014 the comic portion of the Correspondents\u2019 dinner has courted controversy. Roast-style humor is an odd fit for protocol-oriented Washington, and some comedians praised Ms. Wolf for discomfiting the audience of elite journalists and administration officials.\u201cIf you want to focus on the journalism do a boring award show,\u201d tweeted Kathy Griffin, the comedian whose own brush with crude presidential humor \u2014 posting a photo of herself holding what appeared to be Mr. Trump\u2019s decapitated head \u2014 led to her losing a CNN job. \u201cJournalism is all about the 1st amendment. If you don\u2019t see the import of what @michelleisawolf did tonight then you don\u2019t get it.\u201dThe doyens of Washington did not agree. Mike Allen, a prime voice of the city\u2019s establishment, declared in his newsletter on Sunday: \u201cMedia hands Trump embarrassing win.\u201d There were even whispers about a revolt against the Correspondents\u2019 Association by news organizations displeased by the night\u2019s events. (The New York Times stopped attending the dinner in 2008.)Ms. Talev, speaking on CNN on Sunday, noted that the dinner had praised Mr. Trump for meeting with aspiring journalists at the White House and featured the story of an Egyptian social activist who was freed from prison with the help of the Trump administration.She said she regretted that Ms. Wolf\u2019s monologue had overshadowed the rest of the evening, but added: \u201cWhen the entertainer is a comedian \u2014 as has been the case for the last 30 years or so \u2014 they are often controversial, they are often to some extent polarizing, or provocative, and it\u2019s a night about free speech.\u201dMs. Wolf\u2019s 19-minute set also took on Democrats and the news media itself. She quipped that \u201cit\u2019s kind of crazy that the Trump campaign was in contact with Russia when the Hillary campaign wasn\u2019t even in contact with Michigan,\u201d and joked about CNN\u2019s hyperactive approach to coverage.\u201cYou guys love breaking news, and you did it, you broke it!\u201d Ms. Wolf said. \u201cGood work! The most useful information on CNN is when Anthony Bourdain tells me where to eat noodles.\u201dHer most cutting joke came at the end, when the 32-year-old comic took direct aim at the journalists in the room. Mr. Trump, she said, \u201chas helped you sell your papers and your books and your TV. You helped create this monster and now you are profiting from him.\u201dKyle Pope, the editor of the Columbia Journalism Review, posted a message on Twitter suggesting that even journalists had had enough of the annual ritual. \u201cThe #WHCD debacle was inevitable, destined to be either sycophantic, on one extreme, or mean spirited, on the other. Neither is a good look at a time when trust in media is tenuous. Can we finally all agree to put an end to this thing?\u201dSpeaking with The Times in February, after her selection as the evening\u2019s entertainer was announced, Ms. Wolf said that comedians at the Correspondents\u2019 dinner \u201care not necessarily performing for the room.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re performing for everyone that\u2019s watching it,\u201d Ms. Wolf said, adding: \u201cIf you\u2019re willing to say something when someone\u2019s not there, you should definitely be willing to say it to their face.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "This Is the Beirut We Wish You Could See", "Date": "2018-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe film, which comes out Wednesday, is set in 1982, a critical point in the war, and was primarily shot thousands of miles away in Morocco. None of the top-billed actors are Lebanese, and the trailer is rife with menacing accents, none of which are Lebanese.Luckily, nuanced depictions of Lebanon, its people and the realities of its civil war have for years existed in movies, on television and in books.For us and our families, the war is deeply personal: Maya, born in 1980, spent her earliest years in Beirut before her family left for the United States, and Joumana\u2019s parents and family lived in Lebanon off and on throughout the conflict.Here are nine ways to help you connect with the real Beirut.Ziad Doueiri\u2019s most recent film \u2014 the first Lebanese movie to be nominated for an Oscar \u2014 centers on what at first seems to be a small dispute between an apartment\u2019s Lebanese tenant and a Palestinian foreman overseeing work near the building. The conflict turns out to be anything but minor, escalating into a trial that captivates the whole country, and leading to a nationwide reckoning with lingering wounds from the civil war.Mr. Doueiri\u2019s first film captures the early days of the civil war in 1975 through the eyes of a mischievous teen, Tarek, played by Mr. Doueiri\u2019s brother, Rami.Tarek\u2019s city is being torn in half, East Beirut for Christians and West Beirut for Muslims. But for him, war feels like freedom: freedom to walk the streets and do as he pleases.Mr. Doueiri, who began his career working as a cameraman for Quentin Tarantino, manages to evoke wide-ranging emotions in this film, from humor to hopelessness, by showing the daily trials of war endured by a typical family.How to watch: The film can be seen free on YouTube, though the quality is low.While the story touches on postwar tensions, it doesn\u2019t dwell on them. It is instead focused on the struggles that these women, who converge at a beauty salon, grapple with in society: premarital sex, aging, infidelity, repression and same-sex attraction.How to watch: \u201cCaramel\u201d is available to rent or buy on Amazon Prime.The writer and chef Anthony Bourdain loves Beirut. He loves it so much, he even considered naming his daughter after it. His passion for the city, its people and its food (the pulse of Lebanese culture) has been evident over the years in his television series \u201cNo Reservations\u201d and \u201cParts Unknown.\u201dIn his first of two Beirut visits for \u201cNo Reservations,\u201d he and his crew were filming when rockets began to drop on Beirut\u2019s airport. The Israeli airstrike accelerated what is known as the 2006 Lebanon War, a monthlong conflict that killed about 1,200 people. Mr. Bourdain and his crew, trapped in the city for more than a week, documented the experience.\u201cLike South Beach,\u201d he said in the episode, \u201cthere were people drinking vodka and Red Bull, even while Israeli jets flew overhead.\u201dThe installment earned an Emmy nomination for outstanding informational programming.A 2015 episode of his current show \u201cParts Unknown\u201d upends some Arab stereotypes. \u201cThere\u2019s no place else even remotely like it,\u201d he says in the episode. \u201cEverything great \u2014 and all the world\u2019s ills \u2014 all in one glorious, messed-up, magical, maddening, magnificent city.\u201dHow to watch: Episodes of \u201cNo Reservations\u201d are available for purchase on Amazon Prime. \u201cParts Unknown\u201d airs on CNN and streams on Netflix.Written in the early years of the conflict, this novel is told from the perspectives of three characters: a militia fighter, a civil servant and an intellectual. The title refers to Ashrafieh, a Christian enclave of Beirut, and the author Elias Khoury describes the conflict in luminous, staccato prose.Mr. Khoury, a Lebanese novelist, journalist and critic, often draws on his background in his writing: After growing up in Beirut in the 1960s, he became involved with the Palestinian cause during the war, and has remained vocal on the subject of Lebanese politics.Etel Adnan, the celebrated Lebanese writer and artist, wrote what many consider to be a defining novel of the war with \u201cSitt Marie Rose.\u201d First published in France, the book, based on a true story, details the fate of a Christian woman kidnapped and tortured for her support of Palestinians. Narrated by a rotating cast of characters, the story offers a number of perspectives on the conflict; the novel has been praised for its frank discussions of gender, power and sectarian violence.In contemporary Beirut, 72-year-old Aaliya lives alone in an apartment stuffed with books. Literature is her main window to the outside world, and was her solace during years of war: She writes of reading Italo Calvino by candlelight \u201cwhile people killed each other outside my window.\u201dThe interweaving of Lebanon\u2019s history and Aaliya\u2019s life adds up to a complex portrait of Beirut in the hands of Rabih Alameddine, a Lebanese-American writer.Rebuilding Beirut after the war ended was a long, costly and contentious affair, and parts of the city remained ravaged for years.Uncovering a trove of old photographs from around Lebanon, the journalist Zaven Kouyoumdjian spent two years tracking down the people and places from the images. Mr. Kouyoumdjian, working with the photographer Hayat Karanouh, sought to capture the same people and places; the collection shows in stark terms the devastation of war.Advertisement"}

President", "Date": "2018-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York TodayGood morning on this cold and rainy Thursday.Long Island Rail Road riders, meet your new president: Phillip Eng.\u201cI know that our riders are expecting, and they deserve, that we turn this around,\u201d said Mr. Eng, 56, who had previously served as the chief operating officer of the M.T.A. and the acting president of New York City Transit. \u201cWe will do that.\u201dWe sat down yesterday with Mr. Eng, a Long Island native, in his new office in Jamaica Station, where trains creaked outside the window and wall-mounted screens played surveillance footage from Pennsylvania Station. We spoke with him about his priorities in the coming months, and then asked him questions posed by our readers. His responses have been condensed and lightly edited.NYT: What\u2019s the first issue you\u2019ll focus on?ENG: The big thing is really communication. Riders feel like they haven\u2019t been heard. They also want real-time communication from us, not only with our daily service but also on incidents, the status of the incident and the actual cause of the incident. We also need to make sure we have people in our key hubs who can talk to our customers and give them the answers that they need.NYT: You commute to Queens from Smithtown on the L.I.R.R. What are other problems you\u2019ve personally experienced that you\u2019d like to fix?ENG: Cleanliness. That means doing better with the appearance of our stations, with the cleanliness of the trains and the bathrooms. Also, crowded cars. That might mean schedule adjustments, and it might be taking a look at how many trains can run and how many cars we can put on the train.John Sadocha of East Norwich asks: I commute five days per week, and the L.I.R.R. is the worst part of my day. How will you stop the weekly breakdowns, cancellations and never-on-time schedules?Amy Singh of Valley Stream asks: A monthly pass used to cost me $178 in 2007. Today it is $261, but the service is far worse. Is there a plan to reduce rates in any way?ENG: That\u2019s something our board members handle. But I think there\u2019s an opportunity for me to examine internally the services we provide, and see if there\u2019s a way we can give customers more service, and with the existing fares that they pay.Susan Wasilewski of Shelter Island asks: Do you have plans for express trains to cut down on the grueling commute times?ENG: If there\u2019s an opportunity to speed up someone\u2019s travel by bypassing certain stations, but also make sure those stations also have other service, then I think we would take a look at that.John Fitzsimons of the Upper East Side asks: Would you consider banning alcohol on trains?ENG: That hasn\u2019t been something I\u2019ve thought about, but I realize that sometimes our riders want to unwind on the train. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m prepared to make a decision at this point.Here\u2019s what else is happening:We\u2019re getting railroaded by the weather this week.Rain. Again. And it\u2019s still way too cold for mid-April.But chin up, we guess. The drizzle should disappear by this evening.(Pro tip from Ms. Goodman: The film screens on Netflix starting April 27.)Advertisement"}

Rivkin began his Hollywood career in 1988, when Jim Henson hired him to plot a business future for Kermit the Frog.Depending on your perspective \u2014 and whether or not you see opportunity in upheaval \u2014 Mr. Rivkin\u2019s timing either is perfect or couldn\u2019t be worse.But Hollywood has changed immensely in the time he has been away.Attendance at theaters in the United States and Canada dropped 6 percent in 2017, to a 22-year low. Yet studios are more reliant than ever on the box office. Squeezed by the rise of subscription streaming services like Netflix, the six major studios reported an 18 percent drop in home-video rental and sales revenue, including video-on-demand purchases, in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with the 2016 period.Digital TV Research, a British media consultancy, estimated in October that piracy would cost the global movie and television business $37.4 billion in lost revenue this year, an 18 percent increase from 2017. Losses in 2022 were projected to reach $51.6 billion.Mergers could lead to budget cuts for the nonprofit Motion Picture Association. Under the current setup, the six member studios chip in more than $16 million apiece annually to fund the association\u2019s global operations, according to tax filings.\u201cI do not think we have punched our weight in terms of influence \u2014 the power that we should have, given the jobs we support,\u201d said Jeff Shell, chairman of the Universal Filmed Entertainment Group, which includes Universal Pictures, DreamWorks Animation and Focus Features. Mr. Shell added that the M.P.A.A. is \u201ca big, complicated organization and needs an executive to go in and rethink every part as a business \u2014 what should be invested in and grown, what should be scaled back.\u201dMr. Rivkin acknowledged that the organization faces challenges big and small, including questions about its identity and its structure. Netflix plans to release 80 original movies this year but is not a member. Should it be? But he spoke about solutions with a confidence that felt genuine, calling the association \u201ca dust-covered diamond that can easily shine again.\u201d\u201cReinvigorated at every level,\u201d he said of the association.At the same time, Mr. Rivkin aggressively disputed the notion that Mr. Trump and Hollywood are on opposite sides.\u201cPresident Trump probably knows this industry better than any president since Reagan,\u201d he said. \u201cI think he understands that entertainment is important both as an economic force \u2014 jobs in every single state \u2014 and as a projection of American values. It\u2019s our soft power. It\u2019s showing the world what America is capable of.\u201dHerding studio chiefs is harder than it used to be. In Mr. Valenti\u2019s era, the film factories were stand-alone entities whose interests were in lock step. Today, the studios are owned by sprawling conglomerates, which employ their own lobbyists and often have competing interests.One of Mr. Rivkin\u2019s cousins, the Democratic fund-raiser and education advocate Jamie Alter Lynton, is married to Mr. Lynton, the former Sony chief.Brian Henson, chairman of the Henson Company and Jim Henson\u2019s son, agreed \u2014 with a twist.\u201cI think that putting his ego aside actually is part of his ego,\u201d he said. \u201cCharlie wants to be the guy who makes things happen for others.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Waffle House Shooting Suspect Once Had His Guns Taken Away. He Got Them Back.", "Date": "2018-04-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNASHVILLE \u2014 He was once reported to the police in Illinois for stashing an AR-15 in the trunk of his car and then diving into a public pool wearing a women\u2019s pink housecoat. There was the time he complained to an officer that the singer Taylor Swift had demanded a rendezvous. And then last July he was grabbed by the Secret Service when he tried to force his way on to the White House grounds.Travis Reinking, 29, was on the radar of law enforcement well before he was taken into custody on Monday and accused of barging into a Nashville Waffle House over the weekend and opening fire, killing four and injuring four more.Yet even after the Illinois police revoked his firearms license and ordered that his guns be transferred to his father, Mr. Reinking got them back, including the AR-15 used in the Tennessee shooting, the police said. His case raises questions over how such a troubled individual could have legally carried weapons for so long and could have continued to carry them even after he was ordered to give them up.\u201cWe have a man who has exhibited significant instability,\u201d acknowledged Don Aaron, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department.The police say that Mr. Reinking\u2019s father, Jeffrey, the owner of a crane business near the town of Morton, Ill., returned the guns to his son, enabling Travis Reinking to carry out the killings over the weekend.Jeffrey Reinking\u2019s act of returning the guns to his son is \u201cpotentially a violation of federal law,\u201d Marcus Watson, a special agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said at a news conference.Jeffrey Reinking could not be reached for comment on Monday. After Travis Reinking\u2019s arrest in Washington last year, the F.B.I. passed on information about him to local authorities in Illinois, where he was ordered to complete 32 hours of community service at a Baptist church near Morton. The F.B.I. closed its investigation of Mr. Reinking in October.About 160 law enforcement officials were involved in the search for Mr. Reinking, who officials said began his rampage at the restaurant southeast of downtown Nashville just before 3:30 a.m. on Sunday. The episode unnerved one of the largest cities in the South, focusing attention yet again on the ease with which so many people, including those with mental health issues, can access guns.Mr. Reinking was seized on Monday afternoon in a wooded area less than a mile from the Waffle House. He was wearing a backpack containing a loaded handgun, but Nashville police said he surrendered without incident. The authorities said he was refusing to speak to detectives.The police also said on Monday that Mr. Reinking had stolen a BMW last week after posing as a customer at a local dealership, and eluded officers in a chase.Mr. Reinking is white, and the four victims were either African-American or Hispanic, but Mayor David Briley of Nashville said he had no reason to believe that these were racially motivated killings. Instead, Mr. Briley said, there was \u201cenough indication that there was some element of mental illness associated with it.\u201dMr. Reinking lived in Illinois for most of his life and only recently moved to the Nashville area to work in construction.In reports, the sheriff\u2019s department in Tazewell County, Ill., had described Mr. Reinking as a man who was hostile to the police, had threatened suicide and believed his family was harassing him.His father, mother and grandmother were all worried enough about his behavior that they called for help. They told the police that Mr. Reinking had been having delusions since August 2014.In May 2016, police officers responded to a CVS parking lot in Morton after Mr. Reinking\u2019s family reported that he had talked of committing suicide, and owned firearms. Mr. Reinking told officers that Ms. Swift had stalked him and hacked into his Netflix account.A few weeks earlier, he told officers, he had chased Ms. Swift in an attempt to get her to stop harassing him. \u201cTravis stated he was telling the truth and he had proof on his phone since it was hacked,\u201d the report said. \u201cHowever, Travis would not show us his phone.\u201dMr. Reinking was transported to a hospital to be evaluated. In June 2017, the police were called to a public pool in Tremont, Ill., where he had dived into a pool wearing a housecoat, then had shed the coat, wearing only underwear.According to the report, Mr. Reinking began yelling at lifeguards and then \u201cshowed his genitals, saying he was a man.\u201dStill, he was not arrested.\u201cThis is an informational report showing the state of mind of Travis Reinking,\u201d the report noted. When the police contacted Mr. Reinking\u2019s father, he said that he had taken three rifles and a handgun away from his son \u201cwhen Travis was having problems,\u201d then gave them back to him.The officers advised Jeffrey Reinking that \u201che might want to lock the guns back up until Travis gets mental help, which he stated he would.\u201dIn August 2017, Travis Reinking, driving a blue Mitsubishi, pulled up alongside a police car and said he wanted to file a report. About 20 to 30 people were hacking into his phone and computer, he told the police. He could hear people outside his home barking like dogs, but didn\u2019t know who they were. At a Walmart recently, he felt that a man in a black shirt was watching him, and no one else.\u201cTravis said he is tired of people messing with him,\u201d the report said. The officer advised Mr. Reinking to call the police if he heard people barking like dogs again. \u201cNo further action is being taken,\u201d the report said.Later that month, after the White House incident, the police approached Mr. Reinking and his father to deliver a copy of the paper revoking his license. He handed over the card and helped the police retrieve all of his weapons and ammunition, which were handed over to Jeffrey Reinking.\u201cJeffrey was advised that he needed to keep the weapons secure and away from Travis,\u201d the police report said. \u201cJeffrey stated he would comply.\u201dAccording to Illinois gun law, a person must be granted a Firearm Owners Identification card, or FOID, to possess a firearm. About 2.1 million people in Illinois have the cards.But under the law, the process to keep firearms out of the hands of a person whose card has been revoked is weak, allowing many people to keep access to the weapons with little threat of enforcement or penalty.The Illinois State Police revoked more than 11,000 cards in 2016, said a spokesman, Lt. Matthew Boerwinkle. People whose cards have been revoked are required to surrender the card and any weapons to a local law enforcement agency. But there is a provision that allows people whose license has been revoked to transfer their weapons to another person with a valid card, as Mr. Reinking\u2019s father had.Those local police departments are then required to document that the person has turned over the card and weapons.But local law enforcement agencies frequently fail to take action. In 2016, only about 4,000 of the 11,000 people whose cards were revoked submitted the mandatory reports explaining what they did with their guns, The Chicago Tribune reported in 2017.\u201cThey\u2019re required to do it, but there\u2019s essentially no teeth in the law that holds the law enforcement agencies accountable to do it,\u201d Lieutenant Boerwinkle said on Monday.There is nothing in the law requiring that the person holding the weapons must lock them up, or even live in a different house than the person whose FOID card was revoked, Lieutenant Boerwinkle said.Transferring firearms to another Illinois resident who does not have a valid card is a crime in Illinois. Jeffrey Reinking has indicated to the police that he gave his son\u2019s guns back to him, but it is not clear how and when he did so, said Mr. Aaron, the spokesman for the Nashville police.Alan Blinder reported from Nashville, Simon Romero from Albuquerque and Julie Bosman from Chicago. Mitch Smith contributed reporting from Morton, Ill., Ali Watkins from Washington and Trip Gabriel from New York.Advertisement"}

White roses bloomed along a path leading to the cottage where Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh changed into their \u201cGone With the Wind\u201d costumes. You half expected Cecil B. DeMille to come bounding out of the nearby studio administration building, a mansion modeled after Mount Vernon, to bawl out an underling.Yet a gathering here last week was not about Hollywood\u2019s past as much as its future. The official purpose was to commemorate the $12 million restoration of four studio buildings. But the visitors may as well have come to cut the ribbon on a new era in the entertainment industry \u2014 one marked by the ascent of streaming giants like Amazon Studios, the compound\u2019s new tenant.\u201cSo exciting!\u201d Ms. Salke said, shaking Mr. Cooper\u2019s hand.

You can no longer separate one from the other.\u201cThis is mixing old media and new media in a completely harmonious way,\u201d Michael Hackman, chief executive of Hackman Capital Partners, said by phone on Wednesday.\u201cI like the sense of history because it holds us to a standard,\u201d Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder and chief executive, said when a reporter asked him about the Culver Studios move at an Oscar-season cocktail party.Culver Studios may have a grand past \u2014 \u201cRaging Bull\u201d and \u201cE.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\u201d were made here, along with the pilot for the original \u201cStar Trek\u201d television series \u2014 but the complex also epitomizes the troubles the movie business has encountered over the decades.By 2004, when a struggling Sony sold the property, years of underinvestment had taken a toll. The old star bungalows were in poor repair. Soundstages were outdated. The mansion smelled like Grandma\u2019s house. \u201cIt needed a lot of work, to say the least,\u201d Mr. Hackman said. (Contrary to popular belief, the mansion was not Tara in \u201cGone With the Wind.\u201d)Amazon, which has roughly 700 entertainment employees, began moving staff here late last year. More will follow as buildings are completed.\u201cIt\u2019s about recognizing the traditions and legacy of Hollywood, while also recognizing that we have the ability to reshape it,\u201d Mr. Cheng, chief operating officer of Amazon Studios, said of the decision to make Culver Studios the unit\u2019s headquarters.But nothing quite matches the restoration of Culver Studios, in part because Hackman Capital has paid lavish attention to detail.\u201cThey even took pains to recreate the same texture and color of the cement,\u201d said Margarita Jerabek, director of historic resources at ESA, a planning firm involved in the project. She pointed to steps leading into the bungalow once used by Gable and Leigh as a dressing room.\u201cI personally have not seen him yet,\u201d Mr. Cheng said. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure he\u2019s happy.

There\u2019s a snappy one-liner amid rubble and urban destruction. Then government officials swoop in with solemn gratitude or veiled warnings to obey the law.Those officials are probably not from the federal government, because rarely do these blockbusters of superhuman heroism take place in the nation\u2019s capital.How is it that the heart of American democracy is often sidelined in the movies that dominate the box office? The reasons range from our perceptions of the city to the nature of comic books.A representative for Marvel Entertainment said that no one was available to discuss the question for this article, and DC Comics did not return a request for comment. But some film experts see an identity crisis. Outside of the government and the monuments, it\u2019s hard for Hollywood to imagine what Washington looks like. And worse (at least for D.C. enthusiasts): Whatever it looks like may not be exciting enough for these movies.\u201cWashington is an idea as much as anything else,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWashington is about history and abstract notions.\u201d\u201cThat was the center of both the Marvel and DC universe,\u201d Ms. DeConnick said. \u201cPeople were telling stories of their lives, of their families, and what was important to them.\u201d\u201cOnly Washington, D.C.,\u201d she added, \u201cthinks Washington, D.C., is the center of the universe.\u201dIt\u2019s also not an ideal place for dynamic visuals, said Corey Creekmur, a film professor and comics scholar at the University of Iowa.\u201cNew York is famously vertical, and Washington isn\u2019t,\u201d he said, pointing to scenes of Superman flying over Metropolis, the fictional version of New York City, and the Avengers plummeting into Midtown. \u201cIt\u2019s not the space associated with superheroes in that regard.\u201dThere are also logistics to consider. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to build tall buildings in the swamp, things for Spider-Man to swing off of,\u201d Mr. Fraction said. Tom Holland, the current Spider-Man, had to bounce off a helicopter to swing into the Washington Monument for a dramatic rescue in last year\u2019s \u201cSpider-Man: Homecoming.\u201d (Perhaps that\u2019s why he returned to New York City for the film\u2019s final confrontation.)\u201cThere\u2019s the power of looking up on Fifth Avenue and seeing something streak over your head,\u201d he said, \u201cbeing enclosed on all sides by urban reality, and seeing what we\u2019re capable of streak by in the sky.\u201d\u201cA lot of it has to do with the scope of special effects, pyrotechnics, big explosions \u2014 anything like that is going to be really sensitive to our federal core,\u201d said Herbert Niles, who heads the film division of the district\u2019s Office of Cable Television, Film, Music and Entertainment. He pointed to \u201cCaptain America: The Winter Soldier,\u201d for which more filming took place in Ohio than in Washington.\u201cOhio was able to give them a freeway and close it down for like three days,\u201d he said, adding that the district is working to make logistics easier for filming. \u201cThat\u2019s just not practical here.\u201dThe government, and by default Washington, has also increasingly played an antagonistic role in superhero movies, Mr. Creekmur said, as some writers contemplated how individuals with extraordinary abilities would be regulated in a country increasingly focused on maintaining borders and security. Like Batman clashing with the police in Gotham City, there\u2019s often an inherent conflict between the superheroes\u2019 vision of justice and the government\u2019s.\u201cDo we play along with the government, or do we work outside the government?\u201d he said of the plotlines that drove the splintering factions in \u201cCaptain America: Civil War\u201d (2016). \u201cAnd I think of that as a post-9/11 narrative.\u201dWith the relentless cycle of political news and clashes between Hollywood and the current administration, Washington probably won\u2019t get the spotlight in superhero films anytime soon.Besides, fictional realms based in reality like Black Panther\u2019s Wakanda have become much more intriguing to moviegoers.\u201cHollywood is picking up on a widespread alienation from Washington and a widespread disengagement,\u201d Mr. Prelinger, the U.C. Santa Cruz professor, said. \u201cIn a canny way, it tries to present an opposing view.\u201dBesides, the city\u2019s reputation for political intrigue and elaborate bureaucratic dealings is best saved for acclaimed television shows like \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d on Netflix and \u201cScandal\u201d on ABC, Mr. Fraction said, where the dark hallways and complex dialogue are integral to the plot. Such political reality isn\u2019t suited for superhero stories.\u201cWhat people respond to is story and character, and politics are for politics,\u201d he said. \u201cIt feels like wearing football padding to a baseball game.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Gothic or Helvetica? For Brands, Fonts Help Tell a Story", "Date": "2018-04-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdvertisingWhen ads for the Netflix show \u201cStranger Things\u201d first appeared in 2016, the glowing, blood-red, unevenly shaded font that spelled out the title told viewers exactly what they could expect. The retro typeface \u2014 and a haunting, one-minute title video \u2014 became synonymous with the supernatural thriller series and, as the show gained in popularity, memes centered largely on its instantly recognizable title have become plentiful.\u201cYou\u2019re dealing with text and how people respond to the font,\u201d said Peter Frankfurt, executive creative director on the \u201cStranger Things\u201d project and founding partner of Imaginary Forces, a visual storytelling and brand strategy company. \u201cNone of us ever conceived this would ever be the phenomena that it is.\u201dHollywood has long known this marketing trick, with movie studios strategically choosing fonts, colors and lighting for a film title that will reflect its tone and genre.And in a crowded marketplace, many mainstream consumer brands \u2014 like Southwest Airlines, Remax and Domino\u2019s Pizza \u2014 have placed more focus on fonts as a crucial part of their marketing.\u201cIt\u2019s becoming more and more important,\u201d added Steve Matteson, creative type director at Monotype, a company that creates, licenses and designs fonts for brands.When Southwest Airlines revamped its brand in 2014, it overhauled its font and logo as part of the upgrade. It wanted to create the image of an airline that cared about customer loyalty \u2014 one that had heart.So, Southwest changed its all-caps Helvetica font to a thicker, custom-made Southwest Sans font that included lowercase letters \u2014 changes meant to convey a softer, friendlier tone. It also added a tricolor heart to the logo, along with the tagline \u201cwithout a heart, it\u2019s just a machine.\u201d\u201cNow we have a unique font that really embodies our personality as a brand,\u201d said Helen Limpitlaw, director of brand communications at Southwest Airlines. \u201cWe\u2019re in a very competitive category and we\u2019re trying to avoid that sameness.\u201dThe new typeface now appears on Southwest\u2019s planes, ads, airport signage, uniforms, website and in-flight items.Before, the colors and fonts used by the airline varied from platform to platform. \u201cThe voice felt very fractured, it was a disconnected experience,\u201d said Rodney Abbot, senior partner at Lippincott, a brand strategy and design firm that worked with Southwest.A survey of Southwest customers showed that 95 percent found the new identity appealing, according to the National Brand Monitor in 2014. \u201cWe\u2019ve definitely seen an increase in revenue, an increase in bookings and brand momentum,\u201d Ms. Limpitlaw said.Font style, size, shape, thickness, color, and depth all tell a story.\u201cThe typeface is an expression of the tone of voice,\u201d Mr. Abbot said.Experts say the right fonts can help brands stand out in a competitive market. But they need to know whom they\u2019re targeting and what they want to say.\u201cSpeaking to a mom is different from speaking to a teenager or a 65-year-old retiree,\u201d said Frank Liu, chief creative officer at Siegelvision, a branding and communications firm.Monster Beverage is a good example of a company knowing who it wanted to speak to. In 2002, it rolled out its Monster Energy drink logo, which featured three neon-green claw-marks in the shape of an \u201cM\u201d on a black background, with \u201cMonster\u201d in white Gothic-like lettering under it. The eye-catching logo and colors exuded energy and youth and connected with fans of sports like snowboarding and Formula One racing, who were its target customers.\u201cThe graphics absolutely nailed it for that demographic,\u201d said Paul Friederichsen, a partner at the Blake Project, a brand marketing and consulting firm. Now, 16 years later, Monster\u2019s logo remains valuable and recognizable.Legacy companies are sometimes nervous about making changes, but they risk stagnating if they don\u2019t.\u201cPeople are afraid to rebrand these days because of the haters out there on the internet who can tear things apart,\u201d Mr. Matteson said.When the retailer Gap changed its iconic Spire-like font to Helvetica as part of a 2010 rebrand, customers pushed back hard. \u201cThe new logo lost all the personality the original mark had acquired over the years and was rolled out without explanation or rationale,\u201d said Matt See, senior art director at Siegelvision. \u201cIt felt like no thought was put into it.\u201d The company ultimately switched back to its original logo.Experts recommended that companies retain font experts and conduct plenty of surveys before making a change.When the real estate giant Remax decided to overhaul and update its logo and font for the first time in 44 years, the company spent two years and surveyed 20,000 people in the United States and Canada before pushing ahead with the changes.\u201cAt the end of the day, all of these images were going to be on yard signs throughout the world, so we wanted to be sure that it resonated with the consumer,\u201d said Abby Lee, vice president of marketing and media strategies at Remax. \u201cTrying to change a brand after 45 years with 115,000-plus agents out there is quite a task.\u201dThe company needed the font upgrade because its typefaces didn\u2019t translate well in the digital world: The firm\u2019s recognizable hot-air balloon logo and aging fonts became blurred on mobile devices. This posed a significant problem because 34 percent of current home buyers are millennials \u2014 a group that relies heavily on digital devices.Done right, fonts allow brands to showcase their human side and personality, which can then connect with consumers emotionally.\u201cIt\u2019s about understanding the power of typography,\u201d said Mr. Frankfurt. \u201cThere are so many different ways that type communicates to us and acts in a voice and takes on a personality and it\u2019s more prevalent than ever.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I\u2019m a practicing psychic and I want to see if you can read my mind.\u201dFor Ms. Posey, playing Dr. Smith is an opportunity to cavort among the stars on a big-budget series and to put her unique stamp on a beloved cult-TV character.But it\u2019s also an acknowledgment of how challenging it has become, even for an actor of Ms. Posey\u2019s stature, to make a living solely from small prestigious films in today\u2019s industry.\u201cI was so happy to find a place within the show at this time,\u201d she said. \u201cI was absolutely, wholeheartedly relieved. Because I really had not felt that I had a place. I know it doesn\u2019t look like that from the outside.\u201dMatt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, the producers who developed the Netflix reboot, which began streaming last Friday, said that they did not want to copy or caricature what Mr. Harris did with the role.Mr. Sazama and Mr. Sharpless reconceived the character, changing Dr. Smith\u2019s gender and making her a low-level criminal on Earth, who steals her own sister\u2019s identity \u2014 and later a doctor\u2019s title and uniform \u2014 so she can reinvent her life in another star system.Imagining their Dr. Smith as a 21st-century upgrade of the nefarious title character from \u201cThe Talented Mr. Ripley,\u201d Mr. Sharpless said this approach was possible only because of Ms. Posey\u2019s blend of comedic and dramatic talents.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like we had the Dr. Smith you see on screen and then just went out and got Parker,\u201d Mr. Sharpless said. \u201cParker allowed the Dr. Smith that you\u2019re seeing to exist. She expanded the genre of the show.\u201dMs. Posey has been a fan of \u201cLost in Space\u201d since watching reruns during her childhood in Louisiana, \u201cgetting up at 5:30 in the morning to watch the static turn to color when the show came on at 6.\u201dShe described her Dr. Smith as \u201ca chameleon\u201d who \u201csurvives by her wits,\u201d which is not too different from how she has come to see herself.During the last decade, Ms. Posey said, she has experienced a steep decline in the kinds of acting opportunities that best suit her. \u201cI was like, I need to do something else \u2014 I need to express myself in a different way,\u201d she said.\u201cWhen reality TV showed up, it was like, O.K., that\u2019s it \u2014 game over, character actors, bye,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are so many big chunks that are gone from the culture. It wouldn\u2019t be that much of a turn to say, you know what? I\u2019m going to become a landscaper.\u201dYet each time she\u2019d speak to a friend or peer who was happily thriving in a genre TV role, she remained hopeful that an appropriate role would come her way.Much to her satisfaction, \u201cLost in Space\u201d has allowed Ms. Posey to perform her own Shakespearean pastiches, like a soliloquy addressed to the decapitated head of a robot. And it has let her share scenes with actors like Selma Blair (\u201cCruel Intentions,\u201d \u201cLegally Blonde\u201d), a guest star who plays Dr. Smith\u2019s wealthy, disapproving sister.Describing a scene that required her to pass out (under the influence of drugs that Ms. Posey\u2019s character had surreptitiously slipped her), Ms. Blair said: \u201cI decided I was really going to milk it. And Parker was laughing, like, \u2018I feel like you\u2019re on an episode of \u2018Columbo.\u2019 You really love acting, don\u2019t you?\u2019 Coming from Parker, it wasn\u2019t an insult.\u201dMs. Blair said it was a positive development that Ms. Posey had finally made the crossover to serialized television.\u201cShe should be a big-deal, household name,\u201d Ms. Blair said. If TV hadn\u2019t snapped Ms. Posey up already, she said it was because past series \u201cmight not be the best fit for people who have a real gravity and an eccentricity.\u201d But now, Ms. Blair said, \u201cThey\u2019re making such great shows for people like her, and hopefully one day for people like me.\u201dEven with a busier acting schedule, Ms. Posey is continuing to expand into other forms of media. She is finishing her first book, called \u201cYou\u2019re on an Airplane: A Self-Mythologizing Memoir,\u201d that will be published in July. (The title, she explained, was intended to evoke a conversation she might have with a fellow passenger on a plane \u201cthat is a little bit tell-all and a little bit, I\u2019ll never see you again.\u201d)She said the thought of sharing herself with an audience this way was intimidating. \u201cNo one likes an actress who writes books,\u201d she said, half joking and half sincere. \u201cIt\u2019s true. I\u2019ve lost friends, I know.\u201dMs. Posey said she was trying to leave herself open to whatever future possibilities might await her after \u201cLost in Space.\u201d \u201cI will feel the reverberations for a while, I imagine, and then hopefully I\u2019ll be able to relax,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then, Season 2 will begin.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Which will give Mr. Harris, 44 \u2014 a multiple Emmy nominee as the womanizing Barney in CBS\u2019s \u201cHow I Met Your Mother\u201d and a Tony winner as the transgender East German rocker in \u201cHedwig and the Angry Inch\u201d \u2014 more time to spend with his own family: his husband, David Burtka, and their 7-year-olds, Gideon (his thing is chess) and Harper (hers is belting out songbook standards), who live in New York while he shoots in Vancouver.And yes, the twins are allowed to watch their father at work. \u201cOf course, it\u2019s probably not the perfect content because it\u2019s pretty dark \u2014 a lot of slapping children and smoking cigarettes and trying to murder 14-year-olds,\u201d he said with a vaguely maniacal chuckle after pouring himself a glass of Scotch at a New York photo studio. \u201cI don\u2019t know that that\u2019s a conversation to have at the dinner table, but for us it\u2019s a little bit different.\u201dHere are edited excerpts from the conversation.So what is that, two fingers of Scotch?Why don\u2019t you take a sip and tell me where we are we in the Baudelaire tribulations?The kids are still trying to evade Count Olaf, and the only difference is they\u2019ve both grown about three inches, so we quickly reference how remarkably tall they\u2019ve gotten. And there\u2019s more action. The Baudelaires for the first few books are shuffled from location to location from protector to protector, and at this point realize that they\u2019re on their own and have to take some personal action in order to get away from Olaf and stick together as a family. And that is a good fuel for the engine.And Olaf?He\u2019s losing it as the series goes on. He\u2019s Wile E. Coyote, frustrated that the Road Runner keeps getting out of his reach. So he\u2019s tired and swinging roundhouse knockout punches, even though that\u2019s not the best way to box. And that\u2019s fun to play.You\u2019re unrecognizable as Olaf. And Olaf himself plays different characters. How much time do you spend in the makeup chair? About two and a half hours. I start in the special-effects makeup trailer and do all the prosthetics. I have a big forehead piece that covers my eyebrows and a nose that goes on, and then they paint it to match my skin tone, airbrush the whole thing with wrinkles and spots and hand-paint bags under the eyes and capillaries. After that I get a three-piece unibrow, two muttonchops, a goatee and a two-piece wig. And then I get dressed, and I\u2019m ready to go.Whew. As much time as I spend in the process of looking like Olaf, it pales in comparison to the workload that Louis and Malina have. They\u2019re on set doing their scene, blocking and learning lines, and then they\u2019re rushed to school to think only about honors biology. Then there\u2019s a knock at the door, and they stop where they are and go recite dialogue and act stressed and emotional. Rinse and repeat all day long until they\u2019re pumpkined, which is the term for when they\u2019re wrapped.It was a movie that I think is profound, about a gay high school student who is afraid to come out and falls in love, and I was really moved by just how pure it was. But that purity doesn\u2019t have to be pretentious. It\u2019s not \u201cBrokeback Mountain\u201d; it\u2019s more \u201cSixteen Candles,\u201d handled in such a confident, casual, easy way. So I got 111 people to see it, and hopefully they were moved by it and will tell their friends and pay it forward.It\u2019s these remarkable kids that do the most amazing feats, who can spell \u201comnidirectional\u201d backward as fast as you can say it and remember a shuffled deck of cards and know the Greyhound bus map. These are achievable goals that kids can accomplish.

{"Headline": "AT&T Chief Attacks Lawsuit to Block Time Warner Merger", "Date": "2018-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHe called the blockbuster merger a \u201cvision deal\u201d that would allow AT&T to better match up against Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google, which he referred to as \u201cF.A.A.N.G.\u201d\u201cThe F.A.A.N.G. are all focused on premium video,\u201d Mr. Stephenson said, comparing the proposed merger to the businesses of tech giants. \u201cAll of them are vertically integrated.\u201dThe trial is expected to wrap up in coming days after rebuttal arguments by the Justice Department and closing statements by both sides. Judge Richard J. Leon of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, who is presiding over the case, is expected to make a decision on the suit as early as the end of May.In cross-examination of Mr. Stephenson, the Justice Department\u2019s lead litigator, Craig Conrath, picked apart the portrayal of AT&T as under siege by Silicon Valley. Mr. Conrath said the key difference between AT&T and tech companies is that AT&T is in a powerful position as the company that provides broadband access to the internet \u2014 a service that Netflix and Amazon don\u2019t offer.Mr. Conrath also presented a friendly email from June 2017 between Mr. Stephenson and Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, in which Mr. Zuckerberg offered to help build AT&T\u2019s ad platform. Mr. Conrath questioned the offer of \u201ccooperation,\u201d suggesting there was less of a rivalry between the companies than Mr. Stephenson had said.Mr. Stephenson dismissed the significance of the email with Mr. Zuckerberg. Mr. Zuckerberg was following up on a casual meeting the executives had during an annual media industry gathering of executives in Sun Valley, Idaho, he said.The key disadvantage that AT&T and Time Warner face is their slow start in behavioral advertising and marketing, Mr. Stephenson said. Both companies do not collect or analyze the habits of television and web users in the same way that Comcast does with cable subscribers and that Google and Facebook do on their platforms.Mr. Stephenson said Netflix, Amazon, Google and Facebook are all investing in premium video content to collect increasing amounts of data on users who would spend longer times on their sites and visit more often.The AT&T chief spent much of his time talking about the history of the company. He spoke directly to Judge Leon to explain the company\u2019s evolution from a phone company to one that seeks to make money from advertising and subscriptions for consumers who will watch much of their videos on mobile devices.Mr. Stephenson attacked the Justice Department\u2019s underlying theory that the company would threaten to withhold Time Warner content to raise prices on other cable and satellite distributors. He said that argument \u201cdefies logic.\u201d\u201cThe value of a content company is how many people watch the content. Period,\u201d Mr. Stephenson said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "8 Decades of British Royal Corgis Reportedly at an End", "Date": "2018-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor decades, the image of Queen Elizabeth II surrounded by corgis has been a beloved symbol of the British monarchy.But with much of the internet mourning the apparent end of the royal corgi lineage, now feels like a good time to explain the enduring appeal of the royal pets.The House of Windsor came by its first corgi in 1933, when King George VI, then the Duke of York, acquired a puppy known as Dookie for his family.He was joined shortly thereafter by Jane, who was with the royal family until 1944, when she was fatally struck by a car.Still, while Buckingham Palace may have lost its corgis, the so-called \u201cdorgis\u201d remain.The queen has two such dogs, Vulcan and Candy, who are part of a crossbreed created when a dachshund belonging to the queen\u2019s sister, Princess Margaret, mated with one of the queen\u2019s corgis.Queen Elizabeth has also had other dogs over the years, including hunting dogs like the ones bred at Sandringham, her royal estate in Norfolk, England, just over 100 miles north of Buckingham Palace. At one point, she also adopted a Sealyham terrier from her sister.Despite the constant presence of animals, the corgis\u2019 time with the royal family has not been without incident.She wasn\u2019t the only victim; her mother\u2019s chauffeur at the time was also bitten and had to receive a tetanus shot.\u201cThey\u2019re barking all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how she copes with it.\u201dOne person who did receive the dogs\u2019 approval? Prince Harry\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, Meghan Markle.In the BBC interview, the prince commented that the dogs \u201ctook to [Markle] straight away.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Ms. Markle replied.It wasn\u2019t the dogs\u2019 only moment in the spotlight.The corgis are featured in close-ups as they greet Bond, follow him and the queen down the stairs of the palace and stay still as a helicopter takes off for London Stadium.Willow and Holly, along with their dorgi cousins, were also featured prominently in a Vanity Fair cover that celebrated the queen\u2019s 90th birthday. In a photograph taken by Annie Leibovitz, Holly sits next to queen in Windsor Castle while Willow, Vulcan and Candy roam at her feet.Over the nearly 80 years that the queen has owned the corgis, they have become so closely associated with her that the dogs have even made their way into pop culture depictions of the monarchy.Advertisement"}

He described the female passenger as having brown hair and a scarf.Law enforcement alerted Amtrak, disrupting service, but by the time the train was stopped and searched, it was already in Westport, Conn. Passengers were ordered to evacuate while bomb squads searched the train and found no evidence of any explosive materials.The officer who spoke to Mr. Miller said he was slurring his words, according to the release.

Not only the attention he brings, but the quality of story he tells.\u201d\u201cComics readers \u2014 the ones buying the monthly comics \u2014 are the focus group,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cThey are the ones with the early access fee to get into what\u2019s going to be hot, what\u2019s going to be in theaters, in video games, in Netflix shows.\u201d\u201cThat has never has happened,\u201d Mr. Bendis said, referring to the bump effect of a popular film. \u201cSince the Christopher Reeve Superman movie, there\u2019s just people who will never read anything \u2014 comics, magazines, books; they love their television and film.\u201cAnd that\u2019s the way they want to experience these characters,\u201d Mr. Bendis added. \u201cBut inside that mix is a group of people, usually young people like myself when I was a kid, that finds a character that captivates you, and someone says you should read the comic, and all of a sudden you\u2019re reading the comic and are a die-hard fan of comics. You become a die-hard fan of the medium.\u201dMr. Bendis, who lives in Portland, Ore., with his wife, Alisa, and their four children, was born in Cleveland, the older of two brothers, and raised by their mother. At age 6, when he discovered that writing and drawing comic books was an actual profession, he declared that someday he would be the artist on Spider-Man. By 19, he managed, after a rejection, to get accepted by the Cleveland Institute of Art. While still in the city, he began drawing cartoons for The Plain Dealer while also working on independent comics that brought him critical if not financial success. In order to stay afloat, Mr. Bendis worked as a caricature artist, even at bar mitzvahs and weddings.Then came Marvel. Mr. Bendis, who began writing for the publisher in 1999, can remember vividly the moribund offices in New York as the company crawled out of its 1996 bankruptcy. This was not the raucous center of counterculture that Stan Lee had romanticized in the 1960s. This was a broken company, one where even the filing cabinets were being put up for sale. At the time, he wondered if he was going to be the person to write the final Marvel comic.Instead, he had a front-row seat to what he described as the \u201cgreat business comeback story of our time.\u201d At Marvel, he was part of a select group of writers and editors who advised those assembling and reviving the company\u2019s movie franchises. He consulted on the development of every Marvel movie from \u201cIron Man\u201d to \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.\u201d He wrote video games and worked on animated Spider-Man television shows. (Warner Bros. executives, responsible for bringing DC characters to the screen, have already expressed interest in Mr. Bendis\u2019s participation in their endeavors.)In August, as Mr. Bendis\u2019s contract with Marvel was coming to an end, he sat down with the DC co-publisher, Dan DiDio, in Los Angeles for coffee. The two had never met, but they soon found common ground, talking about what characters they liked growing up, their visions for the industry and what Mr. Bendis could do in new environs.\u201cEven if Superman is not our best seller,\u201d Mr. DiDio said, \u201cthe success and the positioning of the company works because of Superman. If Superman is working well, the entire line seems to be working well. If it\u2019s not working well, then it seems like something\u2019s out of whack. It\u2019s intensely important for us to make sure that the Superman franchise is in good hands.\u201d\u201cO.K., God,\u201d Mr. Bendis said to himself. \u201cI get it. Do Superman.\u201d\u201cI told Marvel that I don\u2019t see this as going over to the competition,\u201d Mr. Bendis said. \u201cI told them I was going to the other side of the place that\u2019s in charge of curating this beautiful medium I love so much and keeping these characters alive and vital and relevant.\u201dThat said, Mr. Bendis came perilously close to losing this chance to reboot his own career. Last December, he nearly died of a MRSA infection, admitted to intensive care at a Portland hospital three times. For most of the month, he said, he could not see. Drifting in and out of consciousness, he would wake, often to find a member of Portland\u2019s comic book community sitting by his bedside. That led him to rewrite his final Spider-Man story for Marvel, one in which Mr. Bendis\u2019s version of the character \u2014 the half-black, half-Latino Miles Morales \u2014 has a similar experience, finding different heroes of the Marvel universe there for him when he needed them most.Now he will be leaving them, for Superman.Mr. Bendis knows how other people have struggled with the character. Over the years, Superman has been stripped of his powers, split in half into red and blue versions, even killed. In the 1990s, he was \u201creborn\u201d with what can best be described as a mullet. Now, Mr. Bendis \u2014 beginning with a 12-page story in Action Comics No. 1000 \u2014 will take on the task that many have tried and failed at: Invigorating a character that many see as, frankly, boring, without betraying the core of who Superman is.\u201cWhen you strip everything away on Superman you\u2019re basically stripping away all the ridiculous stuff and getting to the real truths,\u201d Mr. Bendis said. \u201cIt\u2019s about making your own family versus the family you\u2019re born with, about finding out who you are versus where you were put.\u201cThese are big, big issues that we deal with,\u201d he continued. \u201cTruth, justice and the American way. These things are under siege. This is the world we live in. These are not absolute things anymore. These are things worth fighting for.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Turning Points: Three Movies Centering on Young Women", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreamingIn the next scene the viewer learns that the accusations are true. The girl, Monique, is romantically involved with her foster mother\u2019s partner. Boyfriends are not all she steals. We also see Monique filching jewelry.\u201cFirst Match\u201d is the first feature film from the writer-director Olivia Newman, and it\u2019s noteworthy in several respects \u2014 the first being that it does not do much from the outset to make its central character, played with vivid ferocity by Elvire Emanuelle, conventionally likable. The viewer grows to understand and root for her, but it takes some time.Monique, or \u201cMo,\u201d has an absent father whom she idolizes. Back in the day he was a school wrestling star, and a composition book containing his clippings and journal entries seems to be the only thing in the world that Monique cherishes.The wrestling coach at her high school suggests the sport as an outlet for her anger, and the team members, all boys, offer few objections. But Mo only begins to take the notion seriously when she encounters her father on a street in her Brooklyn neighborhood (the movie is set in and was shot in Brownsville).She doesn\u2019t dwell much on the fact that he hadn\u2019t even let her know he was out of prison; instead she starts inviting him to wrestling matches. They renew their bond, and Mo begins to excel. Her dad, Darrel, at first relating to his daughter from a befuddled remove, begins to show interest and helps her with training. But his intentions take an ugly turn.Ms. Emanuelle\u2019s performance as Mo is certainly spectacular, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen better screen acting in 2018 than Yahya Abdul-Mateen II\u2019s work as Darrel. When he first encounters Mo he\u2019s in a woozy daze, carrying out the trash from a takeout place where he\u2019s minimally employed, a near-hopeless figure, eyes darting this way and that. As the character begins to pull himself together, he faces forward and displays charisma and strength. It\u2019s heartbreaking and infuriating when Darrel takes his new confidence and uses it in the service of selfish, seductive deceit. You can\u2019t stop watching Mr. Abdul-Mateen, even when his character is at its most repellent.The first impression the character gives is one of healthy feistiness, but Layla is, as it happens, profoundly alienated. That alienation leads her into a more serious immersion in Islam, and some political awareness. Chastised by her father, who brought the family from Morocco to the Netherlands, for participating in an online protest, Layla shoots back with a reference to Geert Wilders, the right-wing, anti-Islam politician. \u201cIt starts with a burqa ban, it ends with Wilders as prime minister,\u201d she says.Adopting a strict mode of dress in her home, she\u2019s mocked (\u201cTake off that potato sack\u201d). She joins a new group of friends she considers activists for freedom of religion, calling them \u201cthe brothers and sisters I feel safe and happy with.\u201d She takes up romantically with Abdel, a soft-spoken scholarly type who marries her and whisks her off to Amman, Jordan, where she finds herself unwittingly oppressed by the patriarchy she had hoped she was escaping.Not exactly. Directed by Uraaz Bahl and produced by his wife, Shaana Levy-Bahl, \u201cLadies First\u201d tells a tale that is indeed incredible and inspiring. Ms. Kumari, as it happens, is living a dream that she did not even know she had. Born in one of the poorest provinces of her country, she had an early enthusiasm for hitting targets, often with handmade equipment, but was more concerned with trying to help her family eat than pursuing a sports career. Once she realized she could help her family by chasing this ambition, she soared from student to champion with dazzling speed.But \u201cLadies First\u201d becomes a chronicle of how Ms. Kumari suffered because of a lack of institutional support for her talents. The movie notes that across a range of developing countries (including India) with a total population of 3.1 billion, none has produced a female Olympic gold medalist.Ms. Kumari is a terrifically appealing heroine for this story, and \u201cLadies First\u201d ends on a hopeful note, with this athlete training for the 2020 Olympics with the help of a help of a newly formed institute that will give her more structured training and coaching.Advertisement"}

Also getting its world premiere at Cannes, though outside the official competition, is \u201cSolo: A Star Wars Story,\u201d a spinoff from the franchise, directed by Ron Howard. The festival runs May 8-19, and the Australian actress Cate Blanchett is the chairwoman of the main jury.Last year, two Netflix movies were in the running for the top prize. But a rule now requires all competition titles to be released in French movie theaters. France protects its film industry through a system of subsidies and regulations, and one regulation forbids cinema releases from being streamed in the country on services such as Netflix for three years.\u201cWe want our films to be on fair ground with every other filmmaker,\u201d Mr. Sarandos said. While Cannes would have allowed Netflix movies to be screened out of competition, accepting that offer would amount to \u201chaving our films and filmmakers treated disrespectfully at the festival,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be good for us to be there.\u201dMichel Abouchahla, publisher of the French movie trade magazine Ecran Total, said, \u201cI think it\u2019s a shame that a streaming service like Netflix, which makes good movies, should be absent in Cannes.\u201d\u201cChildren spend their time watching movies on their smartphones and computers, and only exceptionally go to movie theaters,\u201d he said, adding that the French government was looking into shortening the delays, which he described as \u201ca step in the right direction.\u201dIn other signs of resistance to the internet age, Cannes has banned premiere attendees from taking selfies on the red carpet, and eliminated morning press screenings that allowed journalists to see movies hours before the official red-carpet gala \u2014 and potentially pan them on social media.At the news conference, Mr. Fr\u00e9maux defended the selfie ban, saying the picture takers caused \u201ca big mess\u201d by holding up proceedings and even causing some tripping and falling on the steps.Two other films in the competition are by directors who are banned from leaving their country: Iran\u2019s Jafar Panahi presents \u201cThree Faces,\u201d which Mr. Fr\u00e9maux described as \u201ca road movie in present-day Iran,\u201d and Russia\u2019s Kirill Serebrennikov has \u201cLeto.\u201dMr. Fr\u00e9maux said a formal letter was being addressed to the Iranian government requesting that Mr. Panahi be allowed to attend the premiere of his film at the festival and return home.Cannes has also come under fire in recent years for the absence of female filmmakers in the running for the Palme d\u2019Or, and there were only three women in the official competition announced on Thursday: Eva Husson, with \u201cGirls of the Sun;\u201d Alice Rohrwacher, with \u201cLazzaro Felice;\u201d and the Lebanese director Nadine Labaki, whose \u201cCapharna\u00fcm\u201d depicts the everyday life of street children and migrants in the Beirut of today.\u201cThe films in the selection were chosen for their quality, and there will never be a selection based on positive discrimination,\u201d said Mr. Fr\u00e9maux. \u201cLike everyone else, we regret the fact that there has only ever been one female Palme d\u2019Or winner,\u201d he added.St\u00e9phane Delorme, editor in chief of the French film publication Les Cahiers du Cinema, welcomed the selection overall.\u201cWe were worried that the competition this year would look like previous competitions, with more or less the same names,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good sign to see a freshening up of the selection.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The former teen idol and telenovela actor is ready to make like Tom Cruise.Supported byWell, he was trying to. Every 100 feet or so, a female fan \u2014 some were in their teens, others in their 50s \u2014 would cut in, diffidently asking for a selfie with this former teen idol from Mexico City.\u201cDiego, me regalas una foto?\u201dEach time, the stubble-faced singer and actor, looking Los Angeles casual in a rust-colored Ermenegildo Zegna sweater, jeans and Tom Ford sneakers, would amiably toss his arm around their shoulders, strike a cover-boy smile and punctuate the encounter with a gentle hug, looking every bit the conquering hero in his hometown.After a decade in Hollywood, Mr. Boneta, a former telenovela star and Mexican pop singer, has ridden his hazel-eyed looks and star-spangled accent to a new status: an all-American heartthrob to watch.The 13-episode show, an authorized biography of the Mexican superstar Luis Miguel (Latin America\u2019s latter-day equivalent to Frank Sinatra), is an unflinching tell-all that serves up a series of bombshells from the tangled past of the fiercely private singer known as \u201cEl Sol de M\u00e9xico.\u201dSo is Mr. Boneta a Hollywood star in Mexico, or a Mexican star in Hollywood? And how does it still even matter?\u201cI don\u2019t consider myself 50-50,\u201d Mr. Boneta said. \u201cI\u2019m 100 percent Mexican and 100 percent American.\u201dOn this balmy spring afternoon when the city was a sea of purple jacaranda blossoms, Mr. Boneta was still trying to decompress after an exhausting shoot in which, among other things, he was tasked with performing Luis Miguel\u2019s famous vocal pyrotechnics himself. (\u201cHe\u2019s belting high Cs in almost every single song,\u201d Mr. Boneta said. \u201cHigh Cs are what Pavarotti used to do.\u201d)To reacquaint himself with a city he moved away from at 16, Mr. Boneta decided to spend the day as a tourist, checking out the famous murals festooning the grand buildings of the Centro Hist\u00f3rico.\u201cI love, love, love, love history, and art,\u201d Mr. Boneta said, pausing at top of the main staircase of the Palacio Nacional, the seat of Mexico\u2019s federal executive branch, to ruminate on the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs in the 16th century, as depicted in the massive Diego Rivera mural \u201cThe History of Mexico,\u201d which soared above him.\u201cWhen the Spaniards came to conquer Mexico, there were only 550 Spaniards,\u201d Mr. Boneta said. \u201cThe Aztec city was the most populated city in the world back then, almost a million people. Five hundred fifty Spaniards did not conquer Mexico. It was because they allied with the other tribes that hated the Aztecs.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s how they conquered Mexico,\u201d he said. \u201cMexicans conquered Mexico.\u201dIn his own way, Mr. Boneta is hoping to do the same with \u201cLuis Miguel.\u201dHe\u2019s mindful of how Mexico has been portrayed abroad. \u201cRight now in the papers, you just read the negative stuff about Mexico,\u201d Mr. Boneta said, of the country\u2019s drug violence. \u201cIt really upsets me, because that\u2019s not everything Mexico is.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s actually one of my favorite things about the show,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the first big Latin show that doesn\u2019t have anything to do with narcos. It\u2019s a success story of the biggest Latin singer of all time.\u201dTaking a moment to reflect, Mr. Boneta said that it seemed vaguely cosmic to be talking about Luis Miguel at the palace. A short stroll away, Mr. Boneta said, he had first tasted fame at age 12, performing Luis Miguel\u2019s \u201cLa Chica Del Bikini Azul\u201d in front of 140,000 people in the vast public square known as El Z\u00f3calo for a Mexican equivalent of \u201cStar Search.\u201dThe actor smiled as he scooped a generous spoonful over guacamole to form a taco. \u201cMexican caviar,\u201d he said. \u201cVery buttery.\u201dThe music gene, it seems, skipped generations. Mr. Boneta\u2019s parents, Lauro Gonz\u00e1lez and Astrid Boneta, are engineers. (His younger siblings, Natalia and Santiago, are studying at Duke University.)\u201cI\u2019m the black sheep,\u201d he said.\u201cThere are no child labor laws here,\u201d he said. \u201cI was working Monday through Sunday, probably 17 to 18 hours a day sometimes. Christmas was a half-day off.\u201dWhen Mr. Boneta was 16, the family moved to Los Angeles, in part to be closer to Hollywood. While he found no shortage of work, he learned that there was not much of a pipeline for Mexican actors.But Latino actors, he said, also lack a support network. \u201cIn Hollywood, I have a lot of Australian friends, and they\u2019ll have their Aussie friends sleep on their couch,\u201d he said. \u201cI was in a movie with Sam Worthington, and he was telling me stories about how he had helped the Hemsworth brothers, and before that, Russell Crowe helped him. Same thing with the Brits \u2014 \u2018the wider the door, the more we fit through.\u2019 It\u2019s a different mentality.\u201dOn the positive side, three Mexican directors have won four out of five of the most recent Academy Awards for Best Picture: Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n in 2013, Guillermo del Toro this year, and Alejandro G. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu two years in a row.\u201cThe Mexican directors are killing it right now,\u201d he said. \u201cMexican actors should be, too.\u201dIt is an open question whether \u201cLuis Miguel\u201d will enhance Mr. Boneta\u2019s Hollywood clout to the point that he brings along other Latino hopefuls in his wake.Luis Miguel himself has global appeal in Spain, Italy and even China, Mr. Boneta said, in addition to the sizable market in the United States. And the story is familiar turf to fans of no-holds-barred music biopics like \u201cWalk the Line\u201d and \u201cRay.\u201d\u201cOn the one side, you\u2019ve got the \u2018Wolf of Wall Street\u2019 party scenes,\u201d Mr. Boneta said. \u201cThe fame, sex and the excess, the drugs, mixed with a really dark family drama.\u201dIf nothing else, the meaty role promises to vault Mr. Boneta far beyond the teen-idol trap.Looking ahead in his own career, Mr. Boneta said, he looks to Tom Cruise, who remains a mentor, as an inspiration.\u201cOne of the best pieces of advice he gave me is, \u2018Set your goal and work backward,\u2019\u201d Mr. Boneta said. \u201cIf you want to be a big action star, you have to learn how to ride motorcycles, fly planes and learn to do your own stunts.\u201dCome to think of it, \u201cDiego Boneta, action star\u201d has a nice ring to it. \u201cA short-term goal that I have, and I know this may sound cheesy, is being the first Latin Marvel superhero, whose character isn\u2019t necessarily Latin,\u201d he said.\u201cBlack Panther,\u201d after all, already proved that a nonwhite superhero movie can attain blockbuster status.\u201cHow about \u2018Pantera Negra\u2019?\u201d he said with a smile.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Latest Uproar in Brazil\u2019s Raw Political Debate: A Netflix Series", "Date": "2018-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe series, \u201cThe Mechanism,\u201d has drawn heat since it was released on March 23. Critics say its inaccuracies are unfair to a former president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who is the leading candidate in the polls for the election this fall. Others see in the show a more or less fair, if depressing, depiction of an intricate investigation that has so far seen more than 100 people convicted, including senior political figures like Mr. da Silva.The debate has been fierce.Paulo Roberto Pires, a left-leaning columnist at the newsmagazine \u00c9poca, called the series misleading, adding that it reduced complex political, historical and social issues to the fight against corruption.Antonia Pellegrino, a feminist activist who has a blog at the newspaper Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo, said the series amounted to a \u201ccondemnation of representative democracy.\u201dMr. da Silva, known universally as Lula, has not directly commented on the series, but his ally and successor as president, Dilma Rousseff, wrote a post on Facebook listing inaccuracies. \u201cNetflix\u2019s board doesn\u2019t know what they got into,\u201d she said last Monday, a comment that some commentators interpreted as an implicit threat. \u201cI think this is very serious for them.\u201dThe show\u2019s creator, Jos\u00e9 Padilha, a Brazilian based in Los Angeles, said the furor had only benefited the series. \u201cI think Lula and Dilma are helping us a lot with the marketing of the series,\u201d he said with a laugh.A main source of the controversy is a scene in the fifth episode of the series, in which a character based on Mr. da Silva talks about efforts to block the investigation and speaks of a need to \u201cstop this bleeding.\u201dIn reality, the quotation was uttered in a notorious 2016 secret recording of Senator Romero Juc\u00e1, a onetime ally of Mr. da Silva\u2019s who by then had become a political opponent and later backed the impeachment of Ms. Rousseff.Ms. Rousseff pointed to other liberties the series took with the facts.One money-laundering scandal referred to in the series occurred when an opposition party \u2014 not Mr. da Silva\u2019s Workers\u2019 Party \u2014 was in charge.Ms. Rousseff also complained that the main money launderer, Alberto Youssef, is depicted in a scene inside her campaign committee during the 2014 elections, when in reality he was already in jail by then.The series takes a largely dim view of Mr. da Silva. Prosecutors have portrayed him as an embodiment of corruption, while Mr. da Silva says that the investigations were driven by rivals who resented his redistributive economic policies.Mr. da Silva wants to stand as a candidate in the October election, although he was convicted last year of corruption and still faces charges in six other corruption cases. He has appealed. On Wednesday, the Supreme Court is expected to rule on whether he should be jailed imminently.The title of the Netflix series comes from Mr. Padilha\u2019s theory, expounded in columns, that only the corrupt can get ahead in Brazilian politics.Some critics have called him a reactionary, a charge he denies; he has made donations to a smaller left-wing party that has not been embroiled in the corruption investigation.On the left, the response to Mr. Padilha\u2019s show has been outrage. Pablo Villa\u00e7a, a left-leaning film critic, called the release of the series \u201cextremely irresponsible.\u201d After watching two episodes, he announced on his Twitter account that he was canceling his subscription to Netflix.More conservative voters saw it differently. \u201cI think Padilha wanted to give a general overview of corruption in Brazil,\u201d said Adelaide Oliveira, a spokeswoman for Vem Pra Rua, or Take to the Streets, an activist movement that opposes corruption and big government. \u201cI think he did it well, though reality is richer.\u201dIn a speech during a rally last Wednesday, Mr. da Silva said he might sue Netflix. \u201cIf we need to, we will sue him in Brazil, in the United States, in Europe, anywhere,\u201d he said. His lawyers told Netflix last year about his concerns with distortions in the series; the company did not respond to requests for comment about this article. Nearly half of Brazilians lack home internet access, limiting the reach of the series here.In an interview, Mr. Padilha played down the significance of the misquote attributed to Mr. da Silva, saying the phrase \u201cdoesn\u2019t belong to anybody.\u201dHe added, \u201cWe have a show where we show that those politicians stole billions of dollars, and the problem they have is with a line?\u201dF\u00e1bio Vasconcellos, a political scientist at the State University of Rio de Janeiro, said he did not think \u201cThe Mechanism\u201d would have much electoral impact. \u201cThe series fuels already existent points of view,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of what is in there is very well known to Brazilians.\u201dBut the series has found some fans among Brazilians. \u201cPeople are criticizing it, but those people were the leaders of the government, of course they were involved,\u201d said Gabriel Coelho, a 29-year-old cook in Rio de Janeiro. \u201cWe only need to find out to what extent.\u201dOthers refused to give it an audience. \u201cIt\u2019s bad for Brazil, because it\u2019s a series that arrives in people\u2019s homes with just with one side of the story,\u201d said Paula Abreu, a 31-year-old teacher, also from Rio de Janeiro. \u201cIt\u2019s concerning because it intensifies hate.\u201dIt is likely that this will not be the last time Netflix wades into politically treacherous waters in Latin America.In neighboring Argentina, expectations are high for a mini-series that Netflix has reportedly begun producing about the mysterious death of a prosecutor, Alberto Nisman, who was investigating the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center.The death, which a recent forensic report concluded was a murder, has divided Argentina and continues to be enveloped in mystery.Daniel Politi contributed reporting from Buenos Aires.Advertisement"}

A decent plot twist in the 10th episode sets up the second season that will likely follow, unless Netflix decides to stop underwriting the passably good special effects.The new \u201cLost in Space,\u201d set in 2048, keeps the old show\u2019s central dynamic: The Robinsons, mother, father and three children, have adventures in space with the flyboy Don West, the eccentric Dr. Smith and a large robot that likes to say \u201cdanger.\u201d But turning a square-jawed, morally uncomplicated adventure into something more contemporary \u2014 culturally sensitive domestic melodrama \u2014 requires a lot of tweaks.So the Robinson marriage is now troubled, and John Robinson (Toby Stephens) is an absent father who\u2019s returned for the voyage to Alpha Centauri. Maureen Robinson (Molly Parker) is a brilliant scientist and the family alpha \u2014 no more doing the interstellar laundry \u2014 though it\u2019s not a total feminist victory, because the father now gets to be both the action hero and the more empathetic parent.Young Will Robinson (Maxwell Jenkins) is still a pint-size savior, coming up with last-minute solutions to deadly problems, but he\u2019s gone emo, without the breezy self-assurance of the original Will. That confidence has been transferred to his older sisters, Penny (Mina Sundwall) and Judy (Taylor Russell). Diversity is served by the biracial Judy, now a half sister. (It\u2019s startling, for a 2018 ensemble drama, that the show has no demonstrably gay character.)These returning characters aren\u2019t the Robinsons\u2019 only company \u2014 the formerly solo family is now part of a large mission, and a number of other travelers are stranded with it, giving rise to conflicts and attractions that can be seen coming from a parsec away.The adult actors acquit themselves well, though Ms. Posey\u2019s character isn\u2019t quite playable \u2014 Dr. Smith is so reprehensible that when she\u2019s occasionally, obligatorily allowed to be sympathetic, it makes no sense. The real pleasure of \u201cLost in Space,\u201d beyond some competently handled action, are the appealing performances of Ms. Russell, Ms. Sundvall and Mr. Jenkins as the Robinson children.

{"Headline": "Would AT&T\u2019s Time Warner Deal Help or Hurt Consumers? Judge Will Now Decide", "Date": "2018-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Lawyers faced off over the future of AT&T\u2019s $85.4 billion blockbuster merger with Time Warner for a final time in a courtroom on Monday, sparring over what the deal would mean to consumers.The Justice Department, which sued to block the deal, argued that the merger would cost people millions of dollars a year by limiting competition. If the judge does approve the deal, the government said, the court should force the companies to sell off certain business lines to protect consumers.But the companies countered that the government had failed to make its case. They said consumers would benefit from the merger because it would allow Time Warner and AT&T to compete more effectively against Silicon Valley companies like Google and Netflix.\u201cThe only lessening of competition that would occur is if this merger is blocked,\u201d said Daniel Petrocelli, the lead lawyer for AT&T and Time Warner.The judge, Richard J. Leon of United States District Court for the District of Columbia, is expected to rule on the case on June 12. He has given little indication of his thinking throughout the trial, and he gave no sign of his leanings on Monday, either.The six-week courtroom battle, featuring top executives and glimpses of trade secrets, has been one of the most closely watched antitrust cases in years. It has the potential to reshape the fast-changing telecom and entertainment landscape, which is facing new competition from tech companies.The judge\u2019s opinion could also help set the course for antitrust regulation in the years ahead. A victory for the companies could embolden executives to pursue new deals. A government win could slow future deal-making. On Sunday, T-Mobile and Sprint announced a merger to better compete against AT&T, in a deal that is also expected to face close antitrust scrutiny.The case has centered on the question of harm to consumers and whether the merger would lead to price increases. The Justice Department presented several theories for why prices could go up hundreds of millions of dollars a year over all for cable subscribers. The core idea is that AT&T could threaten to withhold Time Warner content, like N.B.A. games and CNN, to extract more money from rival cable and satellite operators that wanted to run that \u201cmust-have\u201d programming.The call for selling off business lines showed how little the two sides have changed their strategy throughout the trial. The Justice Department, which had made the same demand before it sued in November, says only the divestitures would solve antitrust concerns because restrictions on business practices are rarely well enforced.The government called witnesses from Dish\u2019s Sling TV and from Cox, Charter and RCN, which provide cable and broadband service, to discuss their fears that AT&T, one of the nation\u2019s largest satellite television providers, would use Time Warner\u2019s programming as its weapon to hurt them. The Justice Department also relied heavily on an economic analysis by Carl Shapiro, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, that estimated monthly cable bills could go up at least 27 cents.\u201cThese witnesses came across the country to share their concerns,\u201d said Craig Conrath, the Justice Department\u2019s lead lawyer. He said the potential antitrust violations from the deal were not \u201ctheoretical.\u201d\u201cThere are hundreds of millions of dollars in harms to consumers,\u201d Mr. Conrath said.AT&T and Time Warner fiercely attacked those economic arguments during the trial and in the closing argument on Monday. Rivals are always motivated to argue against the activities of competitors, Mr. Petrocelli said.The companies assailed the economic analysis of Mr. Shapiro, saying the data sets used were not complete and cherry-picked points.\u201cIt is the centerpiece of this case,\u201d Mr. Petrocelli said. But he said Mr. Shapiro\u2019s arguments were \u201ca complete failure of proof.\u201dThe companies\u2019 ability to raise doubts about the Justice Department\u2019s case put the government in a challenging position, analysts said.\u201cThe burden of proof is on the government, and the consensus view is that it would be an uphill battle for the government,\u201d said Paul Glenchur, a senior telecommunications and cable analyst for Hedgeye Potomac Research.For a merger focused on the future of technology, the trial felt stuck in time. A clock on the wall was frozen at 5:05. Cellphones and other device were forced off. Lawyers relied on boxes of files and binders wheeled in on library carts. Judge Leon, with bow ties and cuff links, was a stickler for order and schedules. He took careful notes by pencil.Political questions have hovered over the trial, but have not been allowed in the courtroom. President Trump, a vocal critic of Time Warner\u2019s CNN, said during the election campaign that the merger should be blocked. Makan Delrahim, the Justice Department\u2019s head of antitrust, told the court in filings that the White House had not influenced his decision. Judge Leon, however, said he wanted to keep the trial focused on the merits of the deal.The outcome of the trial may not be a simple yes or no on the merger. Judge Leon may push the parties to work out a settlement that would let the merger proceed with the promise of assigning a third-party arbitrator to resolve business disputes over Time Warner content. He could also, as the government suggested, demand that some parts of the merged company be sold before the deal is approved.Whichever side loses is expected to appeal.Advertisement"}

He\u2019s a gifted wordsmith (\u201cI do like to slip in precise turns of phrase,\u201d he said, slipping in a precise turn of phrase), excels at playing characters in his routines and has become physically adept enough to make full use of Radio City\u2019s massive stage. \u201cIt\u2019s such a beautiful venue that it\u2019s strangely intimate,\u201d he said, exuding thoughtful affability while eating a late-morning bowl of oatmeal at a TriBeCa hotel restaurant last week. \u201cI thought, \u2018This is doable.\u2019\u201dOf course, he embarked on his 2014 sitcom, in which he played a comedy writer named John Mulaney, with equal confidence, only to be brought down by anemic ratings and withering reviews. \u201cThink it\u2019s easy to clone \u2018Seinfeld\u2019?\u201d Matt Roush asked in TV Guide Magazine. \u201cFox\u2019s dreadful, embarrassing misfire \u2018Mulaney\u2019 proves otherwise.\u201dStill, he admitted, there were creative changes made when the show moved to Fox from its original home, NBC, that made it less personal, and in the process, less fulfilling. For example, in NBC\u2019s version, Mr. Mulaney\u2019s character had gotten sober at a young age, just as the comedian did in real life, but that got lost in the transition to Fox.\u201cI did not have self-discipline \u2014 one was not enough,\u201d he said of his own wild-child days. \u201cOne day when I was 23, I thought, \u2018If this were a movie, I would not be rooting for this guy anymore.\u2019 It sounds weird, but that flipped me.\u201dThe sitcom\u2019s cancellation after just two episodes made it to air had an equally profound impact. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to be Frank Capra, but you truly learn so much from failure,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter that, I just wanted to follow my instincts. I\u2019d stopped doing that a bit.\u201dMr. Kroll said, \u201cGeorge is an outlet for John to express some of the stuff that doesn\u2019t fit nicely into his polite young man persona.\u201dMr. Mulaney agreed: \u201cIt was cathartic to play a Robert Durst-ian, angry white male who\u2019s furious about losing his place in the world.\u201dHe comes by this fixation on social standing honestly. Growing up the son of lawyers in Chicago, \u201cmy family was very formal and dignified \u2014 you had to sit up straight and you couldn\u2019t have your elbows on the dinner table,\u201d he said. \u201cMy friends would say, \u2018This is like the 1950s.\u2019\u201dYet Mr. Mulaney didn\u2019t obediently go into the family business; he felt a deep desire to perform from a young age. \u201cI saw \u2018Les Mis\u00e9rables\u2019 on tour, and there was a little kid playing Gavroche, and I was so envious,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to Jeff Gillooly the hell out of him and take his spot.\u201d This explains \u201cDiner Lobster,\u201d an elaborate, seafood-themed \u201cLes Miz\u201d parody Mr. Mulaney co-wrote with Colin Jost in 2010 that didn\u2019t make it to air until Mr. Mulaney\u2019s hosting gig.Serving as an altar boy at his local Roman Catholic church, Mr. Mulaney got his first taste of stage time \u2014 and stage fright. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, man, I forgot to eat breakfast. This is warm. Everyone\u2019s looking at me. Boy, this could be bad if I collapse,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now, in some theaters, it\u2019s like, \u2018Ooh, it\u2019s warm up here. Why did I wear a wool suit?\u2019\u201dHe started doing improv with a children\u2019s troupe in Chicago but his parents wouldn\u2019t allow him to audition for the lead when the 1990 film \u201cHome Alone\u201d was shot in the city. \u201cI was mad \u2014 I always had grand anger as a kid about how status and stardom were out of my grasp, like most 7-year-olds,\u201d he deadpanned. \u201cBut I do think about how great Macaulay Culkin was in that role and how it would\u2019ve been a crime if I had gotten it.\u201dAfter graduating from Georgetown with a degree in English and a theology minor, Mr. Mulaney moved to New York and quickly established himself in stand-up circles. At 25, he was brought on as a writer at \u201cS.N.L.\u201dHe got the news while having dinner with his mother. \u201cShe was excited, then this relief I never knew she needed washed over her,\u201d he remembered. \u201cThe unsaid thing was, \u2018O.K., now we can tell our friends what you do.\u2019\u201d(When Mr. Mulaney told his parents he wanted to be a comedian, \u201cmy dad said, \u2018What do you mean \u2014 like Steve Martin?\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cHe said it like, \u2018You mean like Buzz Aldrin? You want to go to the moon?\u2019\u201d)It\u2019s this kind of pointed humor that could make Mr. Mulaney a household name. \u201cI don\u2019t know what that would be like, but I\u2019m not going to pretend it\u2019s not a goal \u2014 that would be insane,\u201d he said. \u201cAt this point, it\u2019s like asking a vacuum-cleaner salesman, \u2018What if you get as big as Apple?\u2019 I\u2019m not going to, but things are going well in the vacuum business.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Will Bank Earnings Flash Any Warnings?: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Good Thursday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 The big banks are getting ready to report first-quarter results.\u2022 Larry Fink believes robust global growth and earnings will support stocks.\u2022 There\u2019s a consensus that Facebook must be regulated. The question is, how?\u2022 What Paul Ryan\u2019s exit means for business.\u2022 Jack Ma argues that a trade war would hurt the U.S.Headwinds and tailwinds are blowing through the financial markets and the global economy.The strength of these crosscurrents can be gauged, in part, by examining the results of the big banks, three of which report their first-quarter earnings on Friday. They are JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, which have large operations around the world and big Wall Street businesses, as well as Wells Fargo, which is more of a traditional lender focused on the United States.At the start of the year, the big banks had the wind in their backs. The global economy seemed to be on a clear growth path, the United States had just enacted large tax cuts and the Trump administration was expected to loosen bank regulations. But the threat of a trade war between the United States and China helped plunge the stock markets into correction during the first quarter. The banks\u2019 results, as well as comments from their senior executives, could signal whether the tumult is seeping into the real economy. Here are some things to watch out for:\u2014 Peter EavisAmid the steep drop in its stock price, perhaps it was only a matter of time before Micro Focus drew an activist investor. Elliott Management was a logical candidate. Now, as the $34 billion activist investor has taken a stake in the software maker, here\u2019s what it could push for:\u2022 Potentially go private altogether\u2022 Potentially sell off Suse Linux, a popular maker of the Linux operating system that Micro Focus acquired as part of its takeover of AttachmateOne possibility is that Elliott will push to be involved in a sale of some or all of the business through its private equity team, Evergreen Coast Capital.A spokesman for Elliott declined to comment, while a spokeswoman for Micro Focus declined to comment.Despite one of more volatile quarters in recent years, the chief executive of BlackRock believes that robust global growth and stellar earnings results will be enough to keep the stock market from spiraling downward.But he concedes that worries over trade wars and increased political uncertainty \u2014 at home and abroad \u2014 has made for a riskier investing environment.\u201cMy optimism has abated somewhat,\u201d Mr. Fink said in an interview on Thursday. \u201cBut economically the world is in good shape.\u201dBut for all the turmoil and noise, the market is about flat for the year, he pointed out.The investment giant reported first-quarter earnings Thursday. Helped by continuing inflows into the firm's passive funds, better performance by its actively managed funds and a more favorable tax rate, earnings per share grew 28 percent compared with a year ago.\u201cThis quarter validates us institutionally,\u201d Mr. Fink said, making the point that BlackRock could attract money even when investors are in a jittery mood.Even though many investors yanked money out of the market over the past two months, BlackRock had $55 billion of net inflows for the quarter, with its fast-growing exchange-traded funds comprising $34 billion of that figure.Assets under management grew by 17 percent annually and now stand at a record high of $6.3 trillion.Critics\u2019 cornerIt would seem pretty serious.\u201cWillow initially not only hated the idea but put her foot down because she thought it would be highly destructive to our family and to our lives.\u201dThe idea kept nagging at him and his wife gave her reluctant permission.\u201cThe thought I had was coming from the patriot in me, growing up at a time when we respected our politicians not only for what they stood for but because of what they accomplished. I am horrified at the state of politics in America today, and I will throw stones in multiple directions. Dialogue has given way to disdain. I, maybe a bit naively, believed that there was a need for someone in high elected office to be more open-minded and willing to not only govern from the middle but to try to shame everyone else into going to the middle.\u201dAlso from the piece, Oprah Winfrey thought he would have been the ideal candidate.\u201cBob is one of the people I respect most in the world. That\u2019s a very short list. He is infinitely capable of multiple categories of expertise, and he has created an environment where you can disagree with him\u2014and that\u2019s not just because I\u2019m Oprah. I really, really pushed him to run for president, so much so that I said to him, \u2018Gee, if you ever decide to run for office, I will go door to door carrying leaflets. I will go sit and have tea with people.\u2019\u201d\u201cBerkshire\u2019s present intention is to vote against the four directors proposed by management,\u201d Mr. Buffett\u2019s assistant, Debbie Bosanek, said in an email.Two weeks ago USG rejected Knauf\u2019s $5.9 billion, or $42-a-share, offer. The rejection came despite Berkshire, which controls more than 30 percent of USG, saying it would take Knauf\u2019s offer if the German company agreed to buy the rest of USG for at least $42 a share.Knauf had called on USG shareholders to withhold support for USG\u2019s board nominees in an effort to bring USG to the table.Shares of USG rose 2.8 percent on the news.\u201cIt is therefore ironic that the U.S. administration is waging a trade war at a time when the largest potential consumer market in the world is open for business.\u201dShe seems to be trying to dial back that threat: National Amusements, the Redstone family holding company that controls CBS and Viacom, said in a statement that it has \u201ctremendous respect\u201d for Mr. Moonves, \u201cand it has always been our intention that he run a combined company.\u201dBut in a deal process that is playing out unusually publicly, consider the gantlet thrown.Through its $100 billion Vision Fund, SoftBank has pushed into businesses as wide-ranging as augmented reality, online commerce and dog walking. But the rationale for an investment like this one appears more elusive, other than being a play for lucrative sports content.\u201cIt is safe to say it is one of the largest tax bills on earned income in history.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Olivia Pope\u2019s Pantsuit Nation", "Date": "2018-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionMs. Mzezewa is a staff editor in the Times Opinion section.Years before Hillary Clinton accepted the Democratic nomination for president in a suffragette-inspired white pantsuit, Olivia Pope had been running Washington in her tailored armor. And I, like millions of American women, have been a proud member of her Gladiator Nation since \u201cScandal\u201d premiered on ABC in 2012.The show, which ends Thursday night after seven seasons, made history. Shonda Rhimes, its creator, became one of the most successful black women in television history, joining Oprah Winfrey and Diahann Carroll as the third black woman in the Television Hall of Fame. Ms. Rhimes came to own Thursday nights on ABC: \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d at 8 p.m., followed by \u201cScandal\u201d at 9. Then, beginning in 2014, \u201cHow to Get Away With Murder\u201d at 10.When \u201cScandal\u201d premiered, Kerry Washington\u2019s Olivia Pope was the first African-American female lead in a network drama in almost 40 years \u2014 the first in my lifetime. (Teresa Graves was the first ever as an undercover cop in \u201cGet Christie Love!,\u201d which debuted in 1974.)But \u201cScandal\u201d wasn\u2019t groundbreaking only for Ms. Rhimes. Today, popular shows with black women in prominent roles are increasingly common: Tracee Ellis Ross in \u201cBlackish,\u201d Gabrielle Union in \u201cBeing Mary Jane,\u201d Taraji P. Henson in \u201cEmpire,\u201d Issa Rae in \u201cInsecure.\u201d Olivia Pope was the trailblazer.The plot often veered into the absurd. In the second season, for example, the president was shot by an automated sniper rifle on the orders of a Supreme Court justice. After surviving the assassination attempt, the president killed the justice, who was dying of cancer. Really. The end of the fourth season felt so over the top that I temporarily stopped watching.But I couldn\u2019t stay away; I ended up catching it on Netflix.I am not embarrassed to admit that I\u2019ve watched all 123 episodes of \u201cScandal,\u201d some several times. I\u2019ve live-tweeted about the show on Thursday nights with thousands of others, including the cast, and I once skipped a Friday morning class during college in Italy to watch the previous night\u2019s episode.Nearly every character has been captivating in some way, but Olivia was the reason I tuned in every week. My friends and I slipped her signature phrase \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s handled\u201d \u2014 into our vernacular. Writing a paper for class at the last minute? It\u2019s handled. Learning a song for rehearsal? It\u2019s handled. Applying to a job? It\u2019s handled.In a friend\u2019s phone, my number appears not under my own name but under Olivia Pope. I once spent weeks searching for a white gown in her style. When I finally posted a photo of me in the dress, I captioned it: \u201cChanneling Olivia Pope.\u201dTo say I was obsessed with the character is an understatement. Was I ridiculous? Absolutely. But I didn\u2019t care.Olivia was motivated by the selfless higher purpose of protecting the republic \u2014 \u201cgladiators in white hats,\u201d she and her team called themselves. But she wasn\u2019t perfect.She went to great lengths to get a Republican elected to the Oval Office, had a yearslong affair with him and worked to keep him in power, even when he no longer deserved it. She was responsible for deaths and the destruction of people\u2019s lives. All of these flaws made me like her even more.For decades, black female characters were strictly stereotypical \u2014 sassy or hypersexual or mammies \u2014 who often existed solely to serve the white people around them. It\u2019s not just that Olivia was complex; it\u2019s that \u201cScandal\u201d didn\u2019t situate her blackness at the center of the narrative. Even her affair with the president was seen as scandalous not because she was black but because the president was cheating on his wife. By refusing to treat blackness as a determining characteristic when it\u2019s not, Ms. Rhimes burst the door wide open for black women on television.\u201cScandal\u201d is what the world looks like when a black woman is a respected leader. Olivia doesn\u2019t need anyone\u2019s permission, she just needs respect and trust. From there, it\u2019s handled.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Robots Ride to the Rescue Where Workers Can\u2019t Be Found", "Date": "2018-04-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFast-growing economies in Eastern Europe have led to severe labor shortages, so companies are calling in the machines.Raising wages didn\u2019t help. Nor did offers to subsidize housing.So he turned to the robots.Such talk usually conjures visions of a future where employees are no longer needed. In many major economies, companies are experimenting with replacing factory workers, truck drivers and even lawyers with artificial intelligence, raising the specter of a mass displacement of jobs.Few are riding higher than the Czech Republic, where plants roll out cars for the likes of Toyota and consumer electronics for Dell, while smaller companies produce specialty goods to sell around the world. A roaring economy has slashed the jobless rate to just 2.4 percent, the lowest in the European Union.\u201cIt\u2019s becoming a brake on growth,\u201d said Jaroslav Hanak, the organization\u2019s president. \u201cIf businesses don\u2019t increase robotization and artificial intelligence, they\u2019ll disappear.\u201d\u201cIf we didn\u2019t invest early in automation, we\u2019d be dead by now,\u201d he said.For the Czech Republic and its neighbors, the calculus is one of survival. A new generation of robots is needed not just to confront the labor squeeze, but also to increase flexibility and output as consumers demand a wider range of products.\u201cCompanies aren\u2019t able to produce more, so their competitiveness is falling,\u201d said Jaromir Zeleny, Rittal\u2019s managing director. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be so dependent on people.\u201dBusinesses say letting in more foreign workers would help. But the conservative government has pledged to limit immigration, and recently set strict caps on foreign work visas.\u201cA labor shortage will continue for years,\u201d said Bohdan Dovhanic, a Prague-based business director at Schneider Electric, a French industrial company. \u201cWe must be prepared to find more human employees, or find a way to substitute for them.\u201dThe risk, critics say, is that when future recessions hit, workers will suffer. \u201cYou won\u2019t switch off the robots and bring back people,\u201d said Michal Pechoucek, head of the Artificial Intelligence Center at the Czech Technical University in Prague.Czech unions echo those warnings. \u201cUnless business leaders, politicians and trade unions react well in advance and responsibly to the upcoming industrial revolution,\u201d said Josef Stredula, president of the Czech-Moravian Confederation of Trade Unions, \u201ceven more jobs may be under threat.\u201dFor now, companies here insist that robotization will create new work.At Linet, the hospital bed manufacturer, most welding, cutting, painting and molding functions were automated a decade ago. Thirty industrial robots do the work of up to 200 people. But that doesn\u2019t offset the need for humans, who program machines and perform complex custom work on the assembly line that robots can\u2019t do.Like other employers, Mr. Frolik was caught off guard when joblessness fell swiftly. Virtually every part of the Czech economy has been affected. In the industrial countryside north of the capital where his factories are, unemployment is below 2 percent. And in Prague, even the trams have run less frequently this year for want of drivers.To keep up with a surge in orders driven by the global recovery, he needs more people. He raised wages 12 percent last year and tried to poach employees from other factories, but it wasn\u2019t enough, and he didn\u2019t have the production capacity to bid on major government contracts. \u201cWe could be growing much more,\u201d Mr. Frolik said.So he put in an \u20ac8 million order last month for superfast robotic lasers and plastic molding machines to replace older models. The new devices will let him move six workers to the custom assembly line. But with other Czech companies also scrambling to upgrade, he\u2019ll have to wait for delivery of the machines.Mr. Frolik stopped before a hulking industrial laser that would eventually be replaced by a faster, smarter machine. The two employees operating it would be educated for other work at the factory inside the old cow barn, which has been converted into a training center.\u201cWe\u2019ll still need people,\u201d Mr. Frolik said. \u201cBut robots are more reliable.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oh for the Days of the Making-Of Featurette \u2014 Seriously", "Date": "2018-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhile I was lazing on my couch, it turns out that a generation of young filmmakers were scrutinizing DVD extras to learn their craft.Matt and Ross Duffer, the creators of the Netflix sci-fi series \u201cStranger Things,\u201d grew up in North Carolina, far from Hollywood studios, and, as they wrote in an email, \u201cbonus features were really the only way for us to experience a film set \u2014 to see how movie magic was made.\u201dBehind-the-scenes videos, explained the brothers, gave them an inside look at the filmmaking process. They mentioned the shorts on the extended DVD edition of \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d that follow Peter Jackson through every stage of the trilogy, from pre- to postproduction.This left me wondering how a kid from North Carolina would lift the curtain today. With DVDs steadily joining VHS cassettes as extinct technology, what has become of the fun, insightful mixed bag that movie fans came to know as bonus features \u2014 the audio commentaries, behind-the-scenes featurettes, bloopers, deleted scenes and alternate endings? Some of these extras have shifted to digital stores and streaming platforms. But can cinephiles access them as easily as they could when video rental stores prospered in every neighborhood?I recently came across Rafael Perez, the former owner of Mister Video III, a now-closed Brooklyn store where I had spent many an hour. He argued that fans would eventually grow weary of scouring the internet for film analysis and start seeking out old-school hard copies, as with the vinyl revival for music.\u201cThere\u2019re so many different things you\u2019re able to get on this one little disk,\u201d said Mr. Perez, who\u2019s kept more than 1,000 DVDs from his old inventory in what he calls his man cave unceremoniously piled on shelves and in boxes.\u201cSometimes,\u201d he added, \u201cthings have to go away for people to kind of miss them.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a chicken soup for aspiring filmmakers,\u201d she said.But Netflix, which bought \u201cThe Kindergarten Teacher,\u201d appears unlikely to include extras from her shoot when it releases Ms. Colangelo\u2019s film. Like most subscription-based streaming services, Netflix produces little added content. So young filmmakers today might not have the chance to learn from the trials and tribulations Ms. Colangelo experienced on her production.It wasn\u2019t until DVDs took over the home-video market in the late 1990s that studios started seeing extras as an opportunity to help sales.Patrick Brereton, the author of \u201cSmart Cinema, DVD Add-Ons and New Audience Pleasures,\u201d said studios began using DVD extras as a selling point when they reissued old movies. \u201cSome DVDs of old John Wayne westerns had adverts for cigarettes from the 1950s,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were just sticking in anything.\u201dQuickly enough, studios started producing bonus features to sell new films as well, spending money on voice-over commentary, behind-the-scene shorts and interviews with the cast. Extras, Mr. Brereton said, became increasingly standardized and driven by a marketing agenda.\u201cThe fans love this because they are feeling at one with a director who is making a film that they love: There is triangulation of pleasure,\u201d said Mr. Brereton.Easter eggs, or hidden extras, even required fans to actively unlock them. By typing \u201c1138\u201d on the DVD option menu for \u201cStar Wars: Episode III \u2014 Revenge of the Sith,\u201d for instance, viewers gained access to a short scene of Yoda rapping.Since DVD sales plummeted in the late 2000s, however, some in the industry believe major studios have scaled back on spending money to produce extras. Several studios, including Warner Bros., declined to give numbers or discuss the evolution of extras and their budgets.\u201cBudgets were definitely more significant across the board when DVDs were a dominant player,\u201d said Julie Dansker, vice president of sales and marketing at the Orchard, an independent distributor.Now that most video stores are gone, this content is also unavailable to rent \u2014 in the physical or digital realms.But some distributors design extras expressly for the iTunes version to increase digital sales: \u201cDior and I,\u201d a documentary about the Christian Dior design company, for example, made its 2015 debut on Apple\u2019s website with an exclusive photo gallery from a fashion show featured in the film.But even cinephiles may take some convincing.Greg Oxenberg, 28, a film student at New York University, said he loved Criterion titles, but was not drawn to streaming.\u201cI use the New York Public Library a lot because they have tons of different locations and you can order the DVDs you\u2019re looking for online,\u201d said the self-described film nerd, who likes dissecting director commentaries to hone his screenwriting skills.\u201cBut it\u2019s not quite as convenient as having it all on that disk and popping it in,\u201d he admitted.Mr. Foster\u2019s wistful comment made me melancholic about my time spent at Mister Video III. Maybe, I thought, the DVDs stored in Mr. Perez\u2019s man cave will pay off after all.But for now, like Mr. Perez\u2019s store \u2014 and my idle 20s \u2014 it appears as though access to hours of geeky, director-narrated analysis at a low cost is gone.Advertisement"}

It was seeing Angela Bassett that turned the dream into something attainable. \u201cFor me, it was saying, \u2018If she can do, I can do it,\u2019\u201d Ms. Wiley said.She was two years out of college \u2014 she went to Temple University then transferred to Juilliard \u2014 when she landed her role on \u201cOrange,\u201d though she kept her bartending job just to be safe.But fame has been tough, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a journey for me of whether I\u2019m going buck against that, which is what I did in the beginning,\u201d she said, or embrace it. \u201cWhat I needed to do was accept it and know that I am big enough for it.\u201dHer advice to those finding their path is advice she got from her father, who like her mother was a Baptist pastor: \u201cDo what makes your heart sing.\u201dWhen asked what feminism means to her, Ms. Wiley said that, to put it simply, a feminist is \u201csomeone who believes in the social and economic equality of the sexes.\u201d\u201cI want to be seen as a full human being,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just want to be equal, we want the same rights, we want the same things, we want to be able to reach our full potential, we want the same opportunities. It\u2019s not that hard, it\u2019s very simple.\u201d\u201cMy prayer life is a really big one for me,\u201d Ms. Wiley said when asked how she practices self-care amid her advocacy work and her sometimes grueling work schedule.

Who Owns the Hit Record?", "Date": "2018-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 When Joe Penhall wrote \u201cMood Music,\u201d he had no idea it would be so topical.The Olivier Award-winning playwright wanted to consider the emotional wrangle over intellectual property in art. But in the wake of the #MeToo movement, a long-overdue examination of systemic sexism and male power in the entertainment industries has come to the fore, and it\u2019s made the drama \u2014 about an acrimonious case of artistic differences in the music business \u2014 timelier than anyone expected.\u201cYou\u2019re exploiting your own vulnerability to make the work,\u201d he said recently. And since artists mine their own lives for material, working relationships are necessarily personal. \u201cIf that\u2019s betrayed, it\u2019s a shockingly intimate form of betrayal,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a marriage breaking down.\u201dMatthew Warchus, the Old Vic\u2019s artistic director, programmed \u201cMood Music\u201d on that basis alone.\u201cIt\u2019s a really volatile subject: the paradox of two people fighting violently and emotionally over something that should be beautiful and life-enhancing,\u201d he explained.Mr. Penhall has a few close collaborations of his own \u2014 though none that have soured as starkly as those of his protagonists. This is, for instance, the fourth time he has worked with Roger Michell, who directed his breakthrough play, the psychiatric-hospital-set \u201cBlue/Orange\u201d in 2000. \u201cThere\u2019s one collaborator who really gets you and you get them, and there\u2019s something about that chemistry,\u201d he said of Mr. Michell. \u201cYou have to trust them implicitly.\u201d\u201cMood Music\u201d is not a #MeToo play \u2014 not directly. Written and programmed before allegations were made against Harvey Weinstein, there\u2019s nothing sexually untoward between Mr. Penhall\u2019s protagonists, played by Ben Chaplin and Se\u00e1na Kerslake. Their relationship is as platonic as it is vitriolic, but in picking at the power dynamics of a creative industry, it feels entirely on point.Despite that, Mr. Penhall, who started his career as a cub music reporter (\u201cI know what it\u2019s like to be in a room with a rock star,\u201d he said), doesn\u2019t believe the music industry is \u201cinherently patriarchal.\u201d Rather, he blames commercialism: \u201cYou\u2019re selling to a mass audience, and a mass audience isn\u2019t necessarily forward thinking. The market is domineering and brutal and coercive.\u201dThe effect is to turn people into products \u2014 particularly female artists, whose personal lives become part of the package. \u201cIt\u2019s not just monetizing talent, it\u2019s monetizing trauma,\u201d Mr. Penhall said. \u201cThat\u2019s true of every artist, whether you\u2019re Picasso or Miley Cyrus, but I think it\u2019s more acute with songs because it\u2019s more naked. The whole industry has exploited heartbreak and sex.\u201dThough Mr. Warchus stressed that the issue in this instance was about \u201ca person rather than an institution,\u201d he believes \u201cMood Music\u201d cuts to the issue\u2019s core. \u201cThe sexual side of things is the sensational side, the headline, but it\u2019s not really the interesting side of any of this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe really do need to have a hard think about how we deal with power, because people are always going to have power over others.\u201dPlenty of creative industries feed on hierarchical distinctions. \u201cIt happens in our world all the time,\u201d Ms. Kerslake said. Actors end up kowtowing to producers and directors. \u201cThe funny part of our job is that you actually have to give over control sometimes.\u201dPlaying such a toxic relationship onstage is a challenge of its own. Mr. Chaplin, who took on the producer part when Rhys Ifans dropped out for \u201cfamily reasons,\u201d recognizes the responsibility that comes with representing an abuse of power. \u201cI don\u2019t want it to appear easy,\u201d Mr. Chaplin insisted. At the same time, acting such a part can take its toll: \u201cDoing it night after night, you inevitably start feeling battered.\u201dWidely regarded as one of the sharpest script-polishers in Hollywood, Mr. Penhall has had his share of unsatisfying artistic encounters in an industry he likened to \u201ca sausage factory.\u201d He said he\u2019s walked away from several sizable projects uncredited, including the Oscar-winning film \u201cThe Last King of Scotland.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t want a credit because I didn\u2019t think it was worth a credit,\u201d he said.It\u2019s his way of retaining creative control. \u201cIf it stinks, it stinks,\u201d he said bluntly. \u201cLife\u2019s too short, and I don\u2019t need the dough. Nobody needs money that much to traduce themselves.\u201dWith \u201cMindhunter,\u201d Mr. Penhall knew exactly what he was getting into: a big-budget setup with a collaborative writing process \u2014 \u201cbut I wanted to do that.\u201d He submitted to its rigmarole, partly to work with the director David Fincher, but mostly for the chance to write something expansive. (And, as in many of his plays, the series, about the early days of the FBI\u2019s criminal psychology unit, allows him to explore a favorite subject of his: abnormality.)At it turned out, \u201cMindhunter\u201d afforded Mr. Penhall more creative control than expected. \u201cI was free,\u201d he said. \u201cI could write what I wanted to write. The budget was enormous. The subject was as dark as you could possibly get.\u201d\u201cThis is what\u2019s glorious about how the industry\u2019s evolved in the last couple of years,\u201d he said of the advent of streaming services. \u201cIt\u2019s now incumbent upon you to be as distinctive and original and challenging as possible.

Sapna Maheshwari, a reporter who covers advertising for The Times, discussed the tech she\u2019s using.What tech tools do you use to monitor what advertisers are doing with our data on websites, apps and gadgets?More than anything, though, I do lots of phone interviews \u2014 despite what they say about millennials and phones \u2014 and meet with brand marketers and people at ad agencies and ad technology companies to hear what they\u2019re thinking about and working on.What do you like about these tools, and what could be better?The online ad tracking services are helpful for the desktop and mobile web, but I haven\u2019t yet found an effective way to sort through the many, many ads that flow through Facebook and Instagram or across various mobile apps.How has tech changed advertising, and how much is the advertising industry looking to tech these days? Tech has transformed advertising \u2014 there are so many more ways to target and reach people now than when the industry was dominated by TV, print, radio and event sponsorships.There\u2019s also so much more data being collected about our habits by an array of companies, from big tech platforms to agencies to the advertisers themselves. Huge portions of advertising dollars in the last few years have gone to the big tech giants that we read about all the time \u2014 specifically Google and Facebook and, to a lesser extent, companies like Snap. Lately, advertisers have said they\u2019re spending more money on Amazon. So there are still more major changes afoot.Advertisers are also grappling with how to measure their ads in this new world. That\u2019s a challenge throughout the industry. Think of all the ways that people watch TV shows now. I recently watched \u2014 or, more accurately, binged \u2014 NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Good Place.\u201d I watched the first season on Netflix, where there were no ads, then saw the first eight episodes of the second season through NBC\u2019s Apple TV app, where there were lots of commercials. I watched the final few on Hulu, which might have had different ads. That type of behavior \u2014 especially since I was using my parents\u2019 cable login for the NBC app \u2014 is a new kind of challenge for the people buying, selling and measuring ads.What do you think of Google\u2019s and Facebook\u2019s power in the online ad industry?It\u2019s an enormous topic within the advertising industry, which generally refers to Google and Facebook as the \u201cduopoly.\u201d It\u2019s pretty remarkable that two of the world\u2019s most valuable companies make virtually all of their money from selling online ads and dominate more than half of the American digital ad market.Their size and influence make it essential for people to really understand how the companies\u2019 business models work and the types of information they\u2019re sharing with them every day \u2014 and what makes them such powerful advertising machines.Outside work, what tech product do you love using? And I love the Bose wireless speaker that my boyfriend gave me for Diwali. I use it to listen to podcasts and talk on the phone while cooking or cleaning. I love that the speaker gets me away from my phone, which can charge in the meantime, and that I can use it throughout my apartment. It would be nice if it just did the cooking for me, though.What\u2019s your advice for those who want to prevent their data from being tracked by advertisers?It\u2019s hard to prevent, but you can take some steps to limit it. Explore the privacy settings on your smartphone, including which apps have access to your location and microphone and whether you allow ad tracking. Delete apps that you don\u2019t use anymore.Advertisement"}

Settings and situations change instantly and continually, moving from one mental landscape to another without the need for actual movement.The early episodes of Season 2 (four of 10 were available) jump among various childhoods, a fortune teller\u2019s stand sitting on an empty prairie, a monastery in Tibet-ish mountains and an assortment of more abstract, generally frightening scenarios set against white screens or shadowy blackness.\u201cLegion\u201d isn\u2019t that hard to follow \u2014 the attentive viewer will generally be able to tell when the action is taking place in real life and when it\u2019s in the ether, except when Mr. Hawley is intentionally coy. He indulges the opportunity to dip in and out of unreliable narration, but he doesn\u2019t abuse the privilege. He\u2019s good about dropping in shots of people lying unconscious or standing frozen to let us know when we\u2019re watching their minds wander.What can be distracting in \u201cLegion,\u201d though, is Mr. Hawley\u2019s seeming determination to continually top himself \u2014 to give each new setting, each new idea, its own distinct visual and conceptual identity.It makes sense: a show set inside the mind reflects the infinite variety of the mind. In practice the constant embellishment and novelty can be wearying, especially at series length. Does a comic-book scenario in which crowds of people are being rendered catatonic require a parable about the nature of delusion that includes an animated Chinese fable, gigantic eggs and a man hacking off his leg in the shower?The formal inventiveness deployed by Mr. Hawley and his crew of directors, who include the noted cinematographer Ellen Kuras (\u201cEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\u201d) and the indie filmmaker Ana Lily Amirpour (\u201cA Girl Walks Home Alone at Night\u201d), is consistently impressive. It also consistently outstrips the storytelling. It\u2019s easy, if maybe unfair, to think that all the filmmaking razzle-dazzle comes at the expense of the drama, which, when stripped down, consists of the usual series of battles and superhero clich\u00e9s about friendship, honor and the toughness of the outsider.The cast is virtually the same, with the welcome addition of Navid Negahban (the terrorist Abu Nazir from the early seasons of \u201cHomeland\u201d) as the Shadow King. Lily Rabe, excellent as usual, makes a guest appearance as Syd\u2019s mother in a \u201cRashomon\u201d-style episode that may be an indication that the show\u2019s finally starting to run out of ideas. When every episode and scene of a show seems to be an answer to \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be cool if we did \u2026,\u201d eventually you\u2019re going to run out of answers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Convict History Matters in Australia. But What Else?", "Date": "2018-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter 55______Our guides gave us clues more than conclusions. They pointed to the garden for guards\u2019 families, set up to resemble an English country estate. They told us about punishment. They shared tales of individual prisoners and the British commandants who ran the place.But it was the cemetery just off the coast that lingered in my mind.Port Arthur\u2019s upper-class overseers called it Isle of the Dead or Isle de Mort, and they were buried with headstones on the island\u2019s highest point.The convicts just called it Dead Island. Their remains landed in unmarked graves near the water so their watchmen, our guide told us, \u201ccould look down on them in death as in life.\u201dSome of the convicts probably deserved it. But walking among Port Arthur\u2019s dead, it was hard to escape the sanctimonious rigidity of the English class system, made even more extreme by the culture of 19th-century incarceration.I found myself imagining a prisoner who had arrived young, grinding out a 10-year sentence under the harsh condescension of British soldiers. He\u2019d depart with a skill \u2014 Port Arthur was basically an industrial labor camp \u2014 but how could he not also leave with a deep disgust for class distinctions and authority?Here, I thought, lie the roots of Australia\u2019s egalitarian ethos, traced back to a visceral rejection of the hierarchy that defined prison settlements like Port Arthur.This, after all, was the place for castoffs. Delinquent boys as young as 9 and troubled men with wives and children (not to mention a few meddlesome Irish and American activists) were all shipped off in former slave ships and put to work here in a country that was not easy to tame.The challenges of the land required camaraderie. The British system enforced divisions, putting a small elite above a mass of rebels and rogues. No wonder that those who stayed in Australia preferred to see themselves as \u201cmates\u201d more than gentlemen.Nick Dyrenfurth, a historian who wrote \u201cMateship: A Very Australian History,\u201d has argued that convicts were the first to embrace the concept.American culture bears a similar imprint. We like to see ourselves as revolutionaries who defeated British pomp and monarchy with guerrilla war tactics and demands for equality.But, of course, history is a forever struggle. What we choose to promote and overlook often changes, and reveals more than we may intend.Tasmania\u2019s convict past was also sidestepped for decades, with Port Arthur left in ruins before becoming what it is today: an impressive apparatus for remembering, complete with a ferry, interactive exhibit for children and well-trained guides.But seeing Port Arthur transformed raises additional questions. (The mass shooting that happened here in 1996 is a subject for another day.)His critique was not with remembering the Great War\u2019s heroes, but rather with the lack of investment in other elements of the country\u2019s past \u2014 one glaring blind spot in particular.\u201cWe could ask why \u2014 if we were actually genuine about remembering patriots who have died for this country \u2014 why would we not first spend $100 million on a museum honoring the at least 65,000 estimated Indigenous dead who so tragically lost their lives defending their country here in Australia in the frontier wars of the 1800s?\u201d he said. \u201cWhy is there nowhere in Australia telling the stories of the massacres, the dispossession and the courageous resistance of these patriots?\u201dHis full argument goes beyond questions and critique (though there are plenty of both). He also offers a path forward and a measure of hope even for those who disagree with him.And it\u2019s rooted in what I observed on Dead Island, in the way that the rigidity of one era had given birth to something more fluid, more equal and new.\u201cWe pretend that our national identity is a fixed, frozen thing,\u201d Richard said. \u201cBut Australia is a molten idea.\u201dIn other words, history matters not just because it never disappears, but also because it does not dictate. It can prompt change.The question is: How?I\u2019d love to hear about your views on that \u2014 and about your experiences with Australian history.When did you connect with the past in a way that felt real and revealing? Or when have you thought the process of remembering needed to evolve?Now for some of my favorite stories this week, and a recommendation we know you\u2019ll love.______Does the past hold too much sway for all of us, or just those who romanticize a rugged cruel occupation?__________________Time to mix it up: Here are a few things I\u2019ve been reading beyond The New York Times \u2026______\u201cA Quiet Place\u201d seems to be a local and international favorite.Advertisement"}

It Just Seems That Way.", "Date": "2018-04-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookOn Saturday, Netflix introduces \u201cThe Letdown,\u201d a comedy in which Mr. Brammall has a choice guest role as a loudly impatient drug dealer. Netflix is already home to the two seasons of \u201cGlitch,\u201d a paranormal tale that won Australia\u2019s top drama-series awards and stars Mr. Brammall as a small-town cop trying to manage the sudden return of a number of the local dead.On Hulu, you can see both seasons of the original \u201cNo Activity,\u201d a cop comedy he created (with Trent O\u2019Donnell) and starred in, winning an Australian Academy award for best actor. He then brought \u201cNo Activity\u201d to the United States, starring in a remake for the CBS All Access streaming site that\u2019s been renewed for a second season. All this multinational creativity has taken place in the last three years. (Six-episode seasons help.)Mr. Brammall is blandly handsome and on the comfy side of fit, with a knack for playing exasperation in both comic and dramatic situations. His characters are harried, generally well-meaning upholders of the establishment, whether a policeman or a dealer outraged over an intrusion on his assigned turf. His American equivalents might include Chris Pratt and Ryan Reynolds, but he hasn\u2019t played superheroes, and any swagger his characters possess is unearned.In \u201cThe Letdown,\u201d his function is to help convey the degradation that motherhood has brought to the life of the heroine, Audrey, played by Alison Bell. (It\u2019s like a middle-class version of Showtime\u2019s \u201cSMILF.\u201d) When she parks on a quiet stretch of street hoping her baby will take a nap, Mr. Brammall\u2019s Scott descends on her in a cloud of righteous indignation, demanding that she move. Rather than risk waking up the child, Audrey of course agrees to buy some drugs.\u201cGlitch\u201d is an entirely different kind of series, a large-ensemble drama predicated on big fuzzy ideas about life, death and destiny in which the separate back stories of multiple characters are rationed out in frequent flashbacks. Mr. Brammall plays the uncalm center of the storm, the police constable James, who is called to the cemetery in the first episode because people are clawing out of their graves. One of them is James\u2019s ex-wife, who died four years before (and was the best friend of his new wife).James spends his time running in desperate circles to preserve the anonymity of the returnees and to protect them from threats that include a curious pharmaceutical corporation, mysterious assassins and an invisible, deadly barrier surrounding the town. The show\u2019s ideas outpace its execution (not unusual in Australian TV), especially in the second season. But it\u2019s not bad as cultish science-fiction curiosities go, with the intellectual suspense balancing the soap-opera mechanics of the returnees tracking down the loose ends of their previous lives.As the title implies, there\u2019s virtually no action \u2014 the show consists of the meandering, generally pointless, often smutty conversations that take place while the characters wait for something to happen. (Perhaps reflecting the enclosed spaces and immobility, there\u2019s a lot of talk about masturbation.) The primary talkers are Mr. Brammall and Darren Gilshenan as Hendy and Stokes, marginally competent detectives on an endless stakeout, constantly promised by unseen handlers that \u201csomeone big\u201d is about to show up.Mr. Brammall is, per usual, the straight man, offering futile protests in response to Stokes\u2019s winsomely idiotic and offensive riffs. The tables turn in one episode, though, when Stokes is replaced in the car by a taciturn American (played by Jake Johnson of \u201cNew Girl\u201d). Trying for sophisticated small talk, Hendy stumbles onto race as a topic, and Mr. Brammall, with crack timing, stutters out the thoughts of the Australian everyman: \u201cI know you have to be very sensitive about that thing in your country because you shoot the black \u2014 you shoot the people \u2014 you shoot people of various ethnic \u2014 all sorts.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Michelle Wolf\u2019s Next Gig Is Hard Work: Making Washington Laugh", "Date": "2018-04-25", "News": "Ms. Wolf, a comedian from the world of late-night TV, is honing her set for the White House Correspondents\u2019 dinner and preparing a new Netflix series.Supported byA high jumper, Ms. Wolf recently explained, must leap over a bar raised to increasingly greater heights until she inevitably fails to clear it.\u201cYou could have the best jump of your career, and then you still end on a failure,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018Yeah, that was your best \u2014 but you could do better.\u2019\u201dThat nagging insecurity has gone hand in hand with the rapid accomplishments of Ms. Wolf, a 32-year-old stand-up who has contributed to \u201cLate Night With Seth Meyers\u201d and \u201cThe Daily Show With Trevor Noah.\u201dThen on May 27, her new topical comedy series, \u201cThe Break With Michelle Wolf,\u201d will make its debut on Netflix.These are opportunities that Ms. Wolf sees as sources of both prestige and anxiety \u2014 the fruits of her hard work and obligations to make herself work even harder, while she waits for the bottom to drop out.\u201cI think I\u2019m a good joke writer,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m also very scared that the last joke I wrote is the last joke I\u2019ll ever write.\u201dOn a Friday afternoon earlier this month, Ms. Wolf was in her office at the Midtown Manhattan studio where \u201cThe Break\u201d is being produced. Stretched out on a velvet couch, she was explaining the sensibility that she is shooting for at the dinner and in her Netflix show.Ms. Wolf is no fan of President Trump\u2019s, and was relieved when it was announced that for the second year, he would not be attending the dinner.\u201cI thought, oh, thank God, I don\u2019t have to hear him eat,\u201d she said.Still, she said there was limited value in standing in front of a crowd and cracking a bunch of knee-jerk jokes about Mr. Trump.\u201cThe audience cheers, but that isn\u2019t comedy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a rally.\u201dMs. Wolf said she was not interested in what she called \u201ccool-teacher comedy \u2014 we\u2019re going to learn and have fun at the same time.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t want to say what people want you to say,\u201d she added. \u201cYou want to say what people didn\u2019t know they wanted you to say.\u201dMs. Wolf, who grew up in Hershey, Pa., has been following her own muse since she quit her career in finance (where she\u2019d worked at banks like Bear Stearns and JPMorgan Chase) to take improv classes at Upright Citizens Brigade Theater and the Pit in New York.\u201cEventually people in improv were like, \u2018You\u2019re more of a stand-up,\u2019\u201d Ms. Wolf said. \u201cI think they were gently trying to tell me I was selfish.\u201dIn performance, Ms. Wolf can be her own harshest critic, then suddenly turn that scathing sensibility on her audience and its unexplored assumptions.But Ms. Wolf also laments the expectation that women must surrender their likability to attain power. \u201cIf you\u2019re in charge of things and you think you\u2019re a nice lady, no one else does,\u201d she says in the set. \u201cThere are whole email chains about how much you\u2019re not a nice lady.\u201dHer stand-up shows attracted the attention of producers at \u201cLate Night,\u201d where Mr. Meyers hired her when he became its host in 2014.\u201cShe\u2019s self-deprecating, yes, but very good at deprecating others,\u201d Mr. Meyers said. \u201cShe\u2019s either the meanest nice person I know or the nicest mean person I know.\u201dThough she was hired primarily to write comedy sketches and jokes for Mr. Meyers\u2019s monologue, Ms. Wolf often appeared on camera, performing her own stand-up and playing characters like a grown-up version of Little Orphan Annie.When \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d hired her away in 2016, Mr. Meyers said he did not begrudge her departure.\u201cHer whip-crack of a cackle was a fun thing to hear when my jokes were bombing,\u201d he said. \u201cI wish she\u2019d take more pleasure in my successes, but she really seems to enjoy when I fail.\u201dShe also worked relentlessly on her stand-up outside the show, performing as many as 15 or 20 sets a week, by her estimate, at clubs like the Comedy Cellar and Village Underground.Neal Brennan, the \u201cChappelle\u2019s Show\u201d co-creator who directed Ms. Wolf in \u201cNice Lady,\u201d invoked her history as an athlete to describe her work ethic.\u201cShe is competitive, without being competitive against specific people,\u201d Mr. Brennan said. \u201cShe is competitive against the track and the time. And she really pushes herself. I know some very hard-working people, and you\u2019re not going to outwork her.\u201dThe White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner has previously been hosted by late-night stars like Mr. Meyers, Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Kimmel, but its M.C.s can expect to come under intense scrutiny and have their monologues picked apart on a joke-by-joke basis.When Ms. Wolf was approached about the gig, she said she was ambivalent.\u201cIt\u2019s a weird time, if you\u2019ve noticed,\u201d she said with a laugh. That same day she sat herself down and wrote \u201ca ton of jokes,\u201d just to prove to herself that she could do it. The Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner, she said, is \u201creally a homework assignment.\u201dHaving to prepare her set at the same time she is readying her Netflix show was \u201cnot the dream timeline,\u201d Ms. Wolf said, but the side-by-side assignments were helping her to focus.Ms. Wolf is just one of many \u201cDaily Show\u201d alums who are stepping out with new comedy programs. In addition to the many late-night shows already on broadcast and cable TV, HBO recently introduced \u201cWyatt Cenac\u2019s Problem Areas,\u201d and Netflix is preparing a weekly talk show starring Hasan Minhaj for later this year.Still, Ms. Wolf\u2019s peers and admirers feel that her voice is distinctive enough to break through.Watching Ms. Wolf perform, he said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re eating your vegetables. It never feels like you\u2019re patiently sitting through her ideology to get to the joke.\u201dHaving seen and appeared on every late-night show of the modern era, Mr. Rogen said, \u201cI\u2019m much more inclined to watch things that are not traditional talk shows, rather than a person on a super-glitzy stage in some theater that\u2019s been used for the last 250 years.\u201dAt her Manhattan office \u2014 whose previous occupants have included Jon Stewart, Mr. Colbert and Larry Wilmore \u2014 Ms. Wolf was getting ready to tape her first episodes of \u201cThe Break,\u201d which she said would mix stand-up monologues with comedy sketches.She was also trying to figure out how to strike the right balance between breaking the mold of late-night TV and carrying on its familiar traditions.A few days earlier, she had taken her first look at the set she will use on \u201cThe Break.\u201d Initially, Ms. Wolf had told her set designer that she did not want it to have the familiar element of a city skyline in the background. Nonetheless, the designer showed her two options: one with a skyline, and one without.Advertisement"}

The series has increasingly embraced hot-button story lines centered on race.

In addition, Mr. Barris is the creator of a spinoff, \u201cgrown-ish,\u201d for Freeform, a cable network that, like ABC, is owned by the Walt Disney Company.Representatives for Mr. Barris, ABC and Netflix declined to comment.Ever since Netflix poached Ms. Rhimes and Mr. Murphy, many star producers in Hollywood have been expressing some resentment that they do not have similar deals.\u201cBlack-ish,\u201d which is in its fourth season, has been a standout comedy for ABC, praised for its nuanced approach to race relations. It has earned a Golden Globe Award for one of its cast members, Tracee Ellis Ross, as well as a Peabody Award.In the shelved episode, Dre, an advertising executive played by Anthony Anderson, raised socially fraught issues while telling a bedtime story to his baby son, Devante.\u201cDre is on baby duty for the night during a storm, and the household is wide-awake,\u201d ABC declared in a news release before the show was pulled. \u201cHe decides to read a crying Devante a bedtime story, but when that doesn\u2019t do the trick, Dre tosses it aside and begins to tell a story of his own about the current state of the country in a way Devante will understand.\u201dIt is rare for an episode to be pulled, especially in a series as important to a network as \u201cblack-ish.\u201d At the time, ABC and Mr. Barris papered over their tensions with bland pronouncements.\u201cGiven our creative differences, neither ABC nor I were happy with the direction of the episode and mutually agreed not to air it,\u201d Mr. Barris said in a statement last month. \u201c\u2018Black-ish\u2019 is a show that has spoken to all different types of people and brought them closer as a community and I\u2019m so proud of the series.\u201dMaking matters more complicated at ABC, the most recent episode of \u201cRoseanne,\u201d which more than 15 million people watched on Tuesday, included a glib exchange about \u201cblack-ish\u201d and another ABC sitcom, \u201cFresh Off the Boat,\u201d which is about an Asian-American family.In the middle of the episode, Roseanne Conner (played by Roseanne Barr, the show\u2019s star and co-creator) and her husband, Dan (John Goodman), fall asleep on a couch with the TV on.

{"Headline": "Man Sought in Waffle House Shooting Had Been Arrested Near White House", "Date": "2018-04-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThat, at least, is what he told officials when they charged him with unlawful entry after he crossed an exterior security barrier near the White House complex in July, records show.That arrest was only the latest of Mr. Reinking\u2019s several run-ins with the authorities. Police reports show family members expressed concern for his welfare after an extended time exhibiting delusional behavior, including his belief that the entertainer Taylor Swift was stalking him and hacking his phone and Netflix account.After his arrest for the White House episode, Mr. Reinking, 29, who lived in Morton, Ill., was forced to surrender three rifles and a handgun to officials in August. Somehow he got them back \u2014 the authorities in Illinois said on Sunday that the circumstances were unclear \u2014 and in the fall, he moved to Nashville.On Sunday, he pulled up to a Waffle House in the Antioch neighborhood of Nashville around 3:19 a.m., sat in his pickup truck for about four minutes and then opened fire, the police said.The police credited a customer with averting further bloodshed. The customer, James Shaw Jr., 29, seized the moment when he saw Mr. Reinking apparently trying to reload his rifle. Mr. Shaw burst out from behind a swinging door where he had been hiding, wrested the weapon away and threw it over a countertop.\u201cI kind of made up my mind, because there was no way to lock that door, that if it was going to come down to it, he was going to have to work to kill me,\u201d Mr. Shaw said at the news conference.Mr. Reinking fled on foot, and apparently returned to his apartment nearby to put on pants. He was last seen shirtless and shoeless, Police Chief Steve Anderson said. Investigators had yet to determine a motive for the killings.Officials could not fully explain how Mr. Reinking regained possession of his weapons after they were taken away following his episode near the White House last year, which prompted federal authorities to work with county officials in Illinois to investigate Mr. Reinking. The Tazewell County Sheriff\u2019s Office in Illinois gave the weapons he owned \u2014 including the AR-15 he took to the Waffle House on Sunday \u2014 to his father.\u201cHe was allowed to do that after he assured deputies that he would keep them secure and away from Travis,\u201d Sheriff Huston said. \u201cWe have no information about how Travis came back into possession of those firearms.\u201dThe police in Nashville indicated that Mr. Reinking\u2019s father returned the weapons to his son. The father, Jeffrey Reinking, could not be reached for comment on Sunday.Even before he went to Washington, Mr. Reinking had a history of encounters with law enforcement in Illinois.According to one sheriff\u2019s report from May 27, 2016, he \u201cwas delusional and believed the famous entertainer, Taylor Swift, was harassing him via stalking and hacking his phone.\u201d It added that he said he found Ms. Swift at a Dairy Queen in Morton and chased her before she disappeared.Mr. Reinking\u2019s family members said he had had these delusions since August 2014. The report noted that \u201cTravis is hostile towards police and does not recognize police authority.\u201dIn another episode on June 16, 2017, in Tremont, Ill., the police responded to a complaint that Mr. Reinking, wearing a woman\u2019s pink housecoat, jumped into a pool and began arguing with lifeguards to get them to fight with him. No one at the pool wanted to press charges, the report said.Mr. Reinking\u2019s attempt to meet with the president came one month later.Mr. Aaron said Mr. Reinking was believed to have moved to Nashville in the fall and worked in the crane and construction industries. Mr. Reinking was fired from a job about three weeks ago and found a new job, Mr. Aaron said, but had not been seen at work since Monday.The authorities said Mr. Reinking could still be in possession of a handgun and a rifle, which Chief Anderson described as \u201cmore of a hunting-type rifle than an assault rifle.\u201dThe Nashville police identified the four people who died as one Waffle House employee, Taurean C. Sanderlin, 29, of Goodlettsville; and three customers: Joe R. Perez, 20, of Nashville; DeEbony Groves, 21, of Gallatin; and Akilah Dasilva, 23, of Antioch.Jennifer Wetzel, a spokeswoman for Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said one wounded victim was in critical condition and another was in critical but stable condition. Two other victims were treated for minor injuries and discharged from TriStar Southern Hills Medical Center in Nashville, said Katie Radel, a spokeswoman there.Waffle House restaurants are open 24 hours and speckled throughout the South, especially along the interstates.The gunfire on Sunday was the latest burst of violence at one of the chain\u2019s outposts. In January, an altercation at a Waffle House in Missouri turned fatal when a security guard opened fire. And a deadly shooting outside a location in Florida that same month recently led to a lawsuit.Still, Sunday\u2019s attack was especially jarring in its method and magnitude.Walt Ehmer, the company\u2019s chief executive, said it was a \u201cvery sad day\u201d and thanked Mr. Shaw. \u201cYou are a hero,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re my hero.\u201dBut Mr. Shaw demurred. \u201cI\u2019m not a hero,\u201d he said, adding that he acted out of self-preservation.Hollie Deese and Alan Blinder contributed reporting.

That\u2019s the idea animating \u201cCobra Kai,\u201d and it gives this latest TV revival more baked-in tension than the average nostalgia-fest.Created by Josh Heald (\u201cHot Tub Time Machine\u201d), Jonathan Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg (the \u201cHarold and Kumar\u201d films, \u201cBlockers\u201d), longtime friends and \u201cKarate Kid\u201d obsessives, the half-hour comedy flips the story to focus on Johnny. \u201cCobra Kai\u201d offers the young tough-turned-old deadbeat a chance at redemption while illuminating the reasons behind his behavior all those years ago. (They involve a stepfather played by Ed Asner.)\u201cIt\u2019s a karate opera,\u201d Mr. Schlossberg said. \u201cThere\u2019s a fun sort of Hatfields and McCoys vibe.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nice to be a big fish in a small pond,\u201d Mr. Hurwitz said, \u201cwhen the small pond is Google.\u201d\u201cThat kick to the head sent them on two different trajectories,\u201d Mr. Hurwitz said. \u201cDaniel on the upswing, and Johnny in the downward spiral that\u2019s been going for the last 30 years.\u201d\u201cThe good news is now I\u2019m sitting on the sidelines \u2014 I\u2019m not getting my ass kicked,\u201d Mr. Macchio said. \u201cAt 56, no matter how much hair and makeup help me, everything hurts more in the morning.\u201dEven off camera, both he and Mr. Zabka, 52, are remarkably well-preserved. This is key to maintaining the possibility that the story\u2019s old guys might actually fight, too \u2014 the will-they-or-won\u2019t-they of this particular sitcom. (\u201cMy kicks are still high,\u201d Mr. Zabka warned, grinning. \u201cNo mercy.\u201d)But neither was interested putting on a karate gi for a broad, nostalgic spoof. In separate interviews, the actors struck similar notes of protectiveness about the \u201cKarate Kid\u201d legacy, about how important it was for \u201cCobra Kai\u201d to spin the story forward and include some of the film\u2019s heart along with the clever callbacks, fan Easter eggs and \u201chumor that comes from the fact that these two guys have not moved past it,\u201d Mr. Macchio said.The actors long ago made peace with the fact that as far as the rest of the world is concerned, they\u2019ll never entirely move past \u201cThe Karate Kid.\u201dMr. Macchio had other indelible roles in movies like \u201cThe Outsiders,\u201d \u201cCrossroads\u201d and \u201cMy Cousin Vinny,\u201d and he has starred on Broadway. But he knows that any time he attends a sporting event, the arena will put him on the Jumbotron and play \u201cYou\u2019re the Best\u201d at some point.\u201cFor so long, I still felt that kick,\u201d he said.Kept mostly apart during filming, Mr. Macchio and Mr. Zabka never really became friends until later, on the fan convention circuit. But while it\u2019s an odd thing, being randomly but inextricably linked to another person for your entire adult life, there\u2019s something transporting about it, too.Mr. Macchio, for one, was stunned at how quickly the old fire came back once the actors finally faced off for the first time during filming for \u201cCobra Kai.\u201d\u201cIt just had all that tension \u2014 you look into his eyes, and he\u2019s looking at mine,\u201d he said. \u201cThe eyelids had a couple more wrinkles, but it felt like yesterday.\u201dAdvertisement"}

For the week of April 15, seven events in New York and elsewhere not to be missed:In \u201cThe Seafarer,\u201d though, the menace is somewhat pickled. \u201cWell, to tell you the truth,\u201d Mr. Lockhart says, growing woozy from poteen, \u201cI never drink this much.\u201dIn the 1990s, Bishop Carlton Pearson drew more than 5,000 worshipers to his Sunday services at Higher Dimensions Family, a Pentecostal church in Tulsa, Okla. Since casting out his first demon at the age of 16, he has advised former Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton; Oral Roberts, the evangelist whose namesake university Mr. Pearson attended, called him a son.Then, while watching a program about the Rwandan genocide, Mr. Pearson had a revelation that slammed hard up against his church\u2019s doctrine, which maintained that non-Christians were destined for hell unless they professed their belief in Jesus. What if hell was a human construct and everyone was already the recipient of God\u2019s mercy? Mr. Pearson confessed his change of heart in the pulpit and endured a fall from grace as meteoric as his rise, with even Mr. Roberts pleading with him to take back his heretical words.The photographs in the Indian artist Gauri Gill\u2019s \u201cActs of Appearance\u201d series are halfway between ethnographic intervention and community art project. Asking members of a Maharashtra community known for its papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 masks to depict everyday characters and animals instead of the usual lions, gods and heroes, Ms. Gill then photographed them, in the masks, in their own familiar surroundings.A teacher in a blank-eyed mask in front of a classroom\u2019s wall covered in signs and posters brings out the weirdly arbitrary way almost any cultural practice looks when seen from the outside. And a shopkeeper with the head of a cobra is a reminder that everyday life is the material from which gods and heroes evolve in the first place.For anyone curious about classical Indian dance, the annual Dancing the Gods festival warrants a visit. Presented by the World Music Institute at Symphony Space, the two-day (and too-short) event illuminates some of Indian dance\u2019s many complex lineages. Lecture-demonstrations by Rajika Puri, the festival\u2019s organizer, provide helpful context before each performance.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Video Music Awards Return to New York, Following Grammys\u2019 Lead", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJulie Menin, the commissioner of the Mayor\u2019s Office of Media and Entertainment, said that such awards shows bring millions of dollars in economic benefits and, in the case of both the Grammys and the MTV awards, the agreements to bring the groups to New York included no layout of city money or subsidies.\u201cTo be very clear, the city does not in any way write a check or put in dollars into attracting these awards shows,\u201d Ms. Menin said. \u201cWe believe that New York is such an attractive city for people to want to bring these shows to\u201d that taxpayer-funded incentives are not necessary.The Video Music Awards has regularly bounced back and forth between New York and Los Angeles (with stops in Miami and Las Vegas), and it has been held in New York City 16 times in the 34 years since it started. That includes the first two shows, in 1984 and 1985. The last time the show was staged in New York was in 2016.The show will be held at Radio City Music Hall on Aug. 20. The Grammys, a much larger event, was held at Madison Square Garden in January, returning to the city for the first time in 15 years.\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled because it\u2019s sort of a back-to-back win for the city,\u201d Ms. Menin said. \u201cIt certainly sends a signal that New York City is a place to have these signature awards shows and it\u2019s really the epicenter of music.\u201dWhile the Grammy Awards has deep roots in Los Angeles, including a multiyear deal with the Staples Center there, Ms. Menin said that she was hopeful that MTV may be persuaded to agree to a long-term deal to hold the show in New York City.\u201cNow that the \u2018TRL\u2019 studio is back up and running and we have a steady drumbeat,\u201d said Bruce Gillmer, an MTV executive, \u201cthe addition of the V.M.A.s gives us some kind of scale.\u201d\u201cWe are feeling a deeper connection to the city again, and while we don\u2019t have any firm plans to be in any one place with the V.M.A.s,\u201d he continued, \u201cthere are some conversations on, \u2018Is there some consistency here, can we build on this?\u2019\u201dThe V.M.A.s have also seen declining relevance over the last few years: Viewership for the award show fell to a little more than 5 million viewers last year, an all-time low \u2014 though the Facebook stream now brings in many more viewers.Ms. Menin said that she is in talks to with the organizers of other award shows to bring them to New York, but she declined to name them so as not to jeopardize the negotiations.She said that the city works with the organizers of programs like the Grammys and the V.M.A.s to streamline permits and arrange for street closings and other things to help facilitate staging events and the loading and unloading of equipment. She said the city would also help to promote the V.M.A.s by placing ads in buses and subway cars, which she said do not involve a cost to the city.John Koblin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Joan of Arc, Superstar? Not to the Woman Playing Her", "Date": "2018-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCondola Rashad on the set of \u201cSaint Joan\u201d at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater.The role beckons any actress with a line in zeal and glow; Uta Hagen, Diana Sands and Lynn Redgrave are among those who\u2019ve snagged it. And 2018 seems like an especially good time for an active, unapologetic heroine who is neither condescended to nor sexualized.Ms. Rashad, a graceful and electric performer, is the ninth actress to step into Joan\u2019s battle dress on Broadway. The director Daniel Sullivan cast her, in part, because \u201cJoan is angry for much of the play,\u201d he said, and he counted on Ms. Rashad\u2019s ease, enthusiasm and nobility to keep that anger from turning \u201crather strident.\u201dWould a strident Joan be so bad? We won\u2019t know this season. Because Ms. Rashad, 31, doesn\u2019t see Joan as strident. Or even angry. \u201cShe\u2019s not angry,\u201d she said, \u201cShe\u2019s honest.\u201d She could recognize Joan\u2019s hurt and frustration and passion and clarity and force, but not her anger. \u201cI don\u2019t know that it\u2019s anger,\u201d she said. She said it more than once.As for \u201cSaint Joan\u201d as a #MeToo play, she wanted it noted that for every man who burned Joan, there were many more who fought with her. \u201cWe can\u2019t just look at one side because it feels better,\u201d she said.Ms. Rashad led Penny, her bitty, swaggering cockapoo, around the statue, noticing Joan\u2019s feet straining against the stirrups, Joan\u2019s hand clutching the sword she never used, her eyes and face upturned toward her God. \u201cVery appropriate,\u201d Ms. Rashad said approvingly.She doesn\u2019t mind being practically the only woman in the rehearsal room, if that\u2019s what it takes to tell Joan\u2019s story, she said. (Her cast mates in the Manhattan Theater Club production include Adam Chanler-Berat, Patrick Page and Jack Davenport.) She doesn\u2019t mind being one of the few people who are not white. \u201cOf course I want there to be more people of color in the room, but there\u2019s also the thing of \u2018Well, I\u2019m here. Let\u2019s make the most of it,\u2019 \u201d she said.When her casting was announced, a few French ultranationalist Twitter users and some bullying Reddit posters accused her of cultural appropriation. She read a few of the comments and then she stopped. The abuse didn\u2019t make her mad. Actually, she mostly felt sorry for the complainers, she said. \u201cYou guys are missing out.\u201dIt is tempting to want to poke at Ms. Rashad\u2019s extraordinary poise, to wonder if it\u2019s innate or a necessary adaptation to a business and a culture that doesn\u2019t always applaud female truth-telling. Where does serenity stop and really solid media training begin?Well, a potential manager once told Ms. Rashad that she was too elegant to play prostitutes, which is an icky way of suggesting that she carries herself with a certain reserve. But she isn\u2019t cold, and she isn\u2019t snooty. I spoke to five directors who worked with her and they threw around nouns like maturity and intelligence and strength and dignity and humanity and authenticity and, in Mr. Sullivan\u2019s words, \u201ca wonderful simplicity.\u201dSo I don\u2019t think the equanimity is an act. Or if it is, she has everyone fooled. Even her mother. The elder Ms. Rashad, speaking by telephone on a break from shooting \u201cCreed II,\u201d said that her daughter had always spoken her mind and that \u201cshe has always been given to kindness\u201d and to empathy. She told a childhood story of watching Condola standing in the driveway, waiting for a butterfly to alight on her fingers. The butterfly did.Still, the denial of Joan\u2019s anger nagged at me. Could Ms. Rashad be great in a great part if she refused to play the full range of it?This season, Kate Sacker, the assistant United States attorney she plays on \u201cBillions,\u201d makes some less-than-aboveboard moves, and she found the filming hard. I\u2019d watched her rehearse the first scene of \u201cSaint Joan,\u201d and her Joan had been determined, girlish, joyful. Would she be more?I worried about it all the way home, from the Upper West Side back to Brooklyn, and then I read the play again. Now I\u2019m pretty sure Ms. Rashad is right about the anger and the character and probably some other things. Joan is good at converting doubters to her cause. Ms. Rashad is, too.Joan is her first Broadway lead since Juliet. In the fall, when her casting was confirmed, she cleared her schedule and read book after book about Joan of Arc, becoming so fluent in medieval history that she now serves as the play\u2019s unofficial dramaturge. On the day I visited rehearsal, I saw a hand-drawn map of the siege of Orl\u00e9ans. She had sketched it from memory the day before.Despite her research and her training, Ms. Rashad is not an analytical actor. She believes that every character exerts a particular energy and that it\u2019s her job to \u201cmerge with that energy and trust that whatever that energy field tells you, you need to be told,\u201d she said. (She said it while wearing a hunk of black tourmaline that was supposed to connect her to her root chakra.)So yes, the woo-woo runs deep and it extends to how she sees Joan. \u201cI think she\u2019s someone who had a very high energy quotient,\u201d she said. \u201cShe was someone open to her intentions.\u201d Maybe that all sounds pretty New Age-y, but it\u2019s rare to receive three Tony nominations by the time you turn 30, so the woo-woo seems to be working.To merge with Joan, she has connected not to any righteous anger or Time\u2019s Up timeliness, but to the idea of being called, of aligning herself with a larger purpose. \u201cThere is a divine energy and we are all connected to it and we are all made of it,\u201d she said.Obviously, Ms. Rashad and her character have different to-do lists. Joan was turning around the Hundred Years\u2019 War. Ms. Rashad is trying to prove herself as a Broadway leading lady. No one is going to burn her. Not literally anyway. But she believes that she has been called to this task just as Joan was called to hers.\u201cI\u2019m also someone doing what I think I\u2019m supposed to do,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I do it with intense joy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chipping Away at the Huge Block of Netflix Originals", "Date": "2018-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNetflix put up more than 50 original programs on its streaming service in March, including series, specials and movies. Thus truly began a long-promised deluge of what the kids call \u201ccontent,\u201d and just how much original content Netflix will put up before the year is over is something not even Netflix can say.It\u2019s not this column\u2019s job to provide definitive answers to the questions these debates raise. I like going to the movies as much as the next fellow, but I\u2019ve seen plenty of pictures in theaters that made me think afterward, \u201cThat wasn\u2019t even a movie.\u201d For the rest of April I\u2019m going to post my responses to original pictures I watched on Netflix. For starters, I went to my spiritual cinephile home and considered sci-fi and horror fare and was gratified to find that the titles I chose were, it turned out, movies, even.\u201cMute,\u201d a passion project that Mr. Jones says is set in the universe of \u201cMoon,\u201d is a kind of future-noir in which Leo, a mute bartender of Amish origins (Alexander Skarsgard) searches for a lost love in Berlin, some unspecified years from now. It\u2019s a peculiar grab bag of ideas and visual modes, and Mr. Jones has said it was influenced by his impressions of Berlin during his childhood, when he spent time there with his father, David Bowie, in the \u201970s. The movie is dedicated to Bowie and to Marion Skene, Mr. Jones\u2019s childhood nanny. Leo\u2019s drawings of dolphins in an early scene recall a lyric from Bowie\u2019s \u201cHeroes,\u201d while the subterranean lair of two characters brought to mind a line from \u201cFuntime,\u201d a song by Iggy Pop that he wrote with Bowie.Recently I discussed the movie with a friend, who said he found no persuasive reason that the story, a grim one involving underground criminals, illegal medical practices and pedophilia, needed to be set in a sci-fi world. That is, I think, the biggest point against the movie. The most compelling point for it is the audacity of not only casting Paul Rudd as a villain, but also as one whose look and mode echo that of Elliott Gould in \u201cM*A*S*H.\u201d \u201cMute\u201d is an oddly messy and occasionally alienating movie, but a real movie nonetheless.The survivor is Luke (Rafe Spall), and several months later he and three friends are on a hike through Sweden, a sort of spiritual quest they agreed on after the incident. One twists his ankle, making hiking painful, and a bright idea is arrived at by the group: cut through a forest rather than hew to a trail. At this point the movie, directed by David Bruckner (the screenwriter, Joe Barton, adapted a novel by Adam Nevill), has accrued enough mojo to get by strictly as a psychological thriller. But supernatural menaces also lurk, and they are doozies.The film\u2019s writer/director, Robin Aubert, strews crafty visual allusions to the likes of Jean Rollin\u2019s \u201cThe Grapes of Death\u201d and the quasi-apocalyptic TV series \u201cThe Leftovers,\u201d and shows solid scare flair throughout. The zombie situation can\u2019t help but yield repetitive confrontations, though: Heroine is pinned down by zombie, almost certain to get the zombieness-inducing bite; there is painful struggle, but wait, then an awful sound, and voil\u00e0, friend of heroine has put a fork, or something, in zombie\u2019s neck. So this movie is most optimally consumed by zombie addicts.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Big Reason Wall Street Is Flocking to Spotify: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Good Tuesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Spotify\u2019s shares opened at $165.90.\u2022 If the markets fall again, we have some possible explanations.\u2022 Should Facebook offer \u201cWhy Me?\u201d buttons?\u2022 Disney has offered to buy Sky News to help Fox\u2019s Sky bid.Spotify is a loss-making company that might not report a profit until next decade, but that didn\u2019t stop investors from valuing the company at $30 billion when it debuted Tuesday on the United States stock market.Spotify is an impressive company. Its loyal, paying customer base is enormous and is expected to keep growing. Also, Spotify has so far held its own in the face of competition from Apple, Amazon and Google, all of which want to win new subscribers to their music streaming services.But there is an important reason that Wall Street is flocking to Spotify: It is doing a great job at getting record companies to roll over.Spotify\u2019s main cost is what it pays record companies for the music it streams to its customers. As Spotify has grown, that expense has fallen as a share of its total revenue, which shows that Spotify is negotiating increasingly advantageous deals with record companies.That has bolstered Spotify\u2019s gross profit margin, which measures how much money a company keeps after paying out the costs directly related to generating its revenue. Last year, that margin was 21 percent of revenue at Spotify, well up from 14 percent in 2016.Crucially, though, Spotify has said it expects its gross margin to expand to as much as 35 percent over the longer term. In other words, as Spotify\u2019s spending on music grows, so will its leverage over record companies. And it may well achieve its gross margin target. After all, Netflix, which occupies a similar position in the market for streaming video, has a gross margin of 35 percent.But Spotify\u2019s main rivals could complicate things. What if Amazon offered record companies better terms than Spotify? That would reduce Spotify\u2019s bargaining power, making it harder to deliver wider gross margins investors are expecting. And Amazon, along with Apple and Google, has far deeper pockets to slog it out over the long term.\u2014 Peter EavisSpotify\u2019s unusual path to the public markets was a success.On its first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the music streaming service finished with a valuation of $26.5 billion.Spotify\u2019s shares opened at $165.90 before closing at $149.01.That\u2019s well above the high of $132.50 that its shares changed hands at in private transactions this year. It\u2019s also well above the $137.50 the WSJ reported its private shares were trading at during the past week.Spotify had eschewed a typical initial public offering in favor of a direct listing. That meant there was no \u201cdeal price\u201d for investors to reference on the first day of trading and no underwriters acting as stabilizing agents if the stock began to plunge.Despite all that, Spotify\u2019s valuation at the close on Tuesday ranks among the highest for a tech company debuting on an American exchange.Here\u2019s a look at the tech companies with the 10 biggest market capitalizations after their first day of trading, courtesy of Dealogic:Alibaba \u2014 $233.9 billionFacebook \u2014 $81.7 billionPalm \u2014 $53.3 billionInfineon Technologies \u2014 $47.9 billionJD.com \u2014 $28.9 billionSnap \u2014 $28.9 billionGoogle \u2014 $27.2 billionSpotify \u2014 $26.5 billionTwitter \u2014 $24.9 billionAgilent \u2014 $20.1 billionTesla said:\u2022 It built 2,020 Model 3s in the past seven days. That fell short of its goal of 2,500 by the end of the quarter.\u2022 Tesla produced 9,766 Model 3s during the quarter.\u2022 In total, Tesla produced 35,000 cars in the first quarter.\u2022 It has delivered 8,800 Model 3s during the first quarter, below the 8,800 analysts expected according to Bloomberg.\u2022 In all, Tesla delivered a record 29,980 vehicles during the quarter.\u2022 The company said it expects Model 3 weekly production to reach 5,000 by the end of the second quarter.\u2022 The combined deliveries of the Model X and Model S came to 21,800 cars, the lowest total in several quarters.ContextTesla\u2019s stock and bond prices have plunged amid concerns about how much cash the company is using as it struggles to speed up assembly and sales of the Model 3. With a starting price of $35,000, the car is supposed to be more affordable than Tesla\u2019s other cars. The company has been counting on a quick expansion of its Model 3 business to increase revenue.The president reiterated his claim that Amazon is \u201ccosting the United States Postal Service massive amounts of money\u201d in a post to Twitter on Tuesday morning.Shares are essentially flat on the day.\u201cPackage delivery has been a bright spot for a service that\u2019s lost money for 11 straight years. The losses are mostly due to pension and health care costs \u2014 not the business deal for the Postal Service to deliver packages for Amazon. Boosted by e-commerce, the Postal Service has enjoyed double-digit increases in revenue from delivering packages, but that hasn\u2019t been enough to offset declines in first-class letters and marketing mail, which together make up more than two-thirds of postal revenue.\u201cWhile the Postal Service\u2019s losses can\u2019t be attributed to its package business, Trump\u2019s claim that it could get more bang for its buck may not be entirely far-fetched. A 2017 analysis by Citigroup concluded that the Postal Service was charging below-market rates as a whole for parcels. The post office does not use taxpayer money for its operations.\u201dCould Mr. Tump\u2019s criticism lead to action against Amazon?\u201cNothing can be certain, except death and taxes \u2026 and more Trump tweets on Amazon. We believe sales tax collection changes would have limited impact on consumer use of Amazon and could actually help Amazon\u2019s relative competitive positioning in domestic e-commerce.\u201dMore from Andrew:The \u201cWhy Me?\u201d button might create all sorts of problems for Facebook, and its advertisers, too. It would allow users \u2014 and rivals \u2014 to reverse engineer much of the way the system works. And advertisers would probably object to the idea of making their targeting plans public. But that would be the cost of using such large public platforms with such exact targeting.The bottom line: Disney wants Fox to have full control of Sky to support its $52.4 billion deal to buy most of Fox, and it wants to get ahead of Comcast\u2019s rival effort to buy that 39 percent of the British broadcaster.An earlier version of this article misstated the status of a Department of Defense contract for cloud computing services.

The journalists here don\u2019t cover politicians as aggressively as they do in the U.S. Exhibit A (and B and C and D): Barnaby Joyce!\u201d\u201cAnd the press! The press! There are so few publications we identify with! Most young people just turn away and shrug.\u201d\u201cAnd the defamation laws! It\u2019s almost impossible for the press to cover sexual harassment. Meanwhile, sexual harassment is rife in universities, at workplaces and on and on!\u201dAnd yet.The Sydney Opera House was hosting a day all about women called \u201cAll About Women.\u201d Attendees who were mostly women (and a few odd men out) turned out in the thousands. The festival aired around the country on local TV stations. People tuned in.And yet.The ABC devoted episodes to International Women\u2019s Day and two ABC national radio stations (Fran Kelly and Richard Glover) invited me on to talk Harvey Weinstein and, you guessed it, women.And yet.Gay marriage had been recently legalized. And the city of Sydney would pay homage to the passing of the law at its 40th Anniversary Mardi Gras celebrations. And yet.Barnaby Joyce, the former deputy prime minister, a champion of family values, who had fathered a child with a staff member who was not his wife, and accepted a rent-free townhouse from a millionaire politician, had stepped down from his post. On the surface it looked like progress but underneath, was it? It got me thinking: What should women (and others) in Australia realistically expect from a gender movement? Are hopes pinned too high? Or do expectations not go far enough? So here are my questions for you, Australia: How do you think the movement in Australia compares with the wave of accountability sweeping the rest of the world?And what does gender progress in a macho country like Australia look like, anyway? Now let\u2019s catch up with news of the week, and what to watch on Netflix on April.______\u201cI never expected anything like this, just as a poor man never dreams of striking it rich overnight,\u201d Mr. Lam said.______Sometimes the most memorable stories are those of a single individual who hit a fork in the road, and took off in a surprising direction.______News and FeaturesSports____________My personal pick: \u201cThe Lobster.\u201d If I even tried to explain it, I would fail miserably \u2014 but it\u2019s definitely a memorable film.

And with this, I wasn\u2019t as sure of myself because it\u2019s a different beast.\u201dMs. Jacobson, 34, now splits her time between Los Angeles, where she\u2019s voicing Princess Bean in Matt Groening\u2019s new animated series, \u201cDisenchantment,\u201d out this summer on Netflix, and New York, where \u201cBroad City\u201d is headquartered. During a call from the show\u2019s writers\u2019 room, in the midst of conjuring up Season 5 (the premiere date has yet to be announced), she talked about her walk on the dark side and being a woman in the comedy boys\u2019 club. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.\u201c6 Balloons\u201d is your first dramatic role. Yes, besides, you know, the day-to-day of living and breathing.How did you find the confidence to take on such dark material?I really trusted Marja and her vision of the film and the characters and the fact that she did go with Dave and me, both actors that are known for comedy. And the story is based on the real life of one of the producers, [Samantha] Housman. Sam was always on set with me, and I could check in with her: \u201cWhat are you feeling now?\u201d Because it was such a mix of balancing all these emotions \u2014 of being so disappointed and angry while trying to also present that everything was under control.The movie reminds us that the opioid epidemic impacts every class. I\u2019m from the Philadelphia suburbs, a middle- or upper-middle-class area, and unfortunately, I can count a lot of people I have known from high school that have died from overdoses. It\u2019s devastating. It\u2019s also why I really wanted to get this part \u2014 because I don\u2019t know another movie that\u2019s talking about this specific thing.What can we expect from Season 5 of \u201cBroad City\u201d?We\u2019re going to go back to summer months, which feels more appropriate for the show. Last season we shot in the winter, and it got darker in many ways. And now in Season 5, even more than in 4, it\u2019s very much more serialized and intense, while still obviously maintaining comedy first. It goes deeper than we ever have in the friendship.It just didn\u2019t feel right to have his name on a show that represents the exact opposite of what was going on with Louis.Do you have your own #MeToo moment?I don\u2019t have a major story particularly to tell, but there are so many stories within my story. The world of comedy is definitely a boys\u2019 club. And looking back, Ilana and I were so caught up in making this show that we had blinders on \u2014 that along the way there were things constantly happening. Reasons why the show wouldn\u2019t work here, wouldn\u2019t work there. People taking us seriously or not. Being the bosses in the workplace and treated differently than if we were men. For me it\u2019s these many, many, many things accumulating to, like, an \u201cOh!\u201d It\u2019s bringing to light so much where I used to think, \u201cThat\u2019s the norm, that\u2019s how things work here.\u201d And now it\u2019s like, \u201cNo, they don\u2019t, and they\u2019re not going to \u2014 at least on projects that I\u2019m involved in on a higher level.\u201dEarly on, you and Ilana described your characters as being 15 percent more exaggerated than your real selves.

{"Headline": "Hit After Hit", "Date": "2018-04-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWordplayFRIDAY PUZZLE \u2014 Would it be fair to say that most solvers merely read their puzzle clues and fill in their best guess at an answer without giving much thought as to how those clues get there?Constructors and editors spend a lot of time writing and tweaking these snippets so that they will be as fair \u2014 and sometimes as devious \u2014 as possible to a majority of solvers. It\u2019s not as easy as it looks. To prove that point in a manner that is conclusive, if not a bit underhanded, we\u2019ve secretly planted a recording device in Will Shortz\u2019s office as a way of listening in on his and the digital puzzles editor Joel Fagliano\u2019s conversations.After editing out the lunch orders and petty arguments, we were left with a very interesting conversation, transcribed below, about how to make a clue in David Steinberg\u2019s crossword both tricky and fair.Before you even get there, however, you might have noticed that Mr. Steinberg does something you don\u2019t see every day in a crossword: He deliberately puts in two entries \u2014 1A\u2019s SEETHING and 1D\u2019s SEE THINGS \u2014 that could be seen as duplicates because they look so similar in the grid, but they\u2019re really not. Not only that, but he connects them. Pretty daring as crossword entries go, but since the two entries are not etymologically related, it\u2019s a perfectly cromulent idea.Nice work on Mr. Steinberg\u2019s part for debuting I CAN TAKE A HINT, LOSE SLEEP OVER, ETHICAL DILEMMAS and BEER MONEY.16A: No one would blame you at all if you were thinking of finance with the clue \u201cDo high-level banking?\u201d Today, however, the answer is AVIATE because to bank is to roll the plane and its spoilers so it turns. You\u2019re \u201chigh-level\u201d because you are up in the sky.31A: I had to look this one up because I don\u2019t follow hockey, but there is an N.H.L. team called the Minnesota Wild. Hence \u201cWild grp.\u201d12D: As you\u2019ll discover below in Mr. Shortz\u2019s and Mr. Fagliano\u2019s discussion, fewer people are likely subscribing to CABLE TELEVISION because they are cutting the cord.47D: A \u201chit\u201d in this case would be a puff of some substance that gets you stoned, hence the answer STONER for \u201cOne getting hit after hit?\u201dAs you probably guessed, this puzzle started with SEETHING and SEE THINGS. Really looking forward to seeing how everyone reacts to such a long \u201cdupe\u201d \u2014 at 1-Across/1-Down, no less!Working with stacked 8s crossing stacked 9s was brutal, though, especially since two of the long entries were already locked in. Not thrilled with the resulting crosswordese, though I do really like BEER MONEY, EYE CANDY, LOSE SLEEP OVER, ETHICAL DILEMMAS and especially I CAN TAKE A HINT.All in all, I appreciate that Will let me bring some variety to the Friday themeless slot, and I\u2019m pleased with how this puzzle turned out, given the constraints. Hope you enjoy!JOEL FAGLIANO: All right, 12-Down, CABLE TELEVISION \u2026 His clue is \u201cNetflix ancestor,\u201d which we have crossed out. I mean, that\u2019s not even really true.WILL SHORTZ: That makes it sound like it\u2019s not around anymore. Also, it\u2019s a little odd to spell out \u201ccable television\u201d in this sense. Normally, you\u2019d just say \u201ccable TV\u201d or \u201ccable.\u201dSHORTZ: \u201c1970s media innovation\u201d? That kind of gives it an old-timey feel. Think \u201970s is right?FAGLIANO: I don\u2019t know. I was trying to think of some cable channel names that are misleading.FAGLIANO: \u201cBravo,\u201d or whatever. I couldn\u2019t think of any good ones. O.K., let me look yours up. When did you first get cable?FAGLIANO: Well, it\u2019s sort of unclear. Because it says it first became available in 1948, but I don\u2019t think most people had it until much later.SHORTZ: So \u201cinnovation\u201d wouldn\u2019t be the right word. I thought CNN started in \u201979 or \u201981, so that\u2019s why I said 1970s.FAGLIANO: CNN started in 1980.SHORTZ: \u201cSubject of the Springsteen lyric \u2018500 channels and nothing on\u2019.\u201d Do you know what I\u2019m talking about?FAGLIANO: Yeah, somehow I do. What\u2019s that song?SHORTZ: Hmm, I can\u2019t remember. \u201cBroadcaster\u2019s competition\u201d?SHORTZ: Honestly, they call it the History Channel.FAGLIANO: True. \u201cExpensive package\u201d?SHORTZ: \u201cMonthly bill\u201d?FAGLIANO: I wonder if that\u2019s just CABLE as opposed to CABLE TELEVISION. I don\u2019t know.SHORTZ: I think it\u2019s both, although that does sound quaint.FAGLIANO: \u201cDish alternative\u201d?SHORTZ: Aha. But you\u2019re getting the same channels with dish, so is that not really cable, or is it just a different way of getting it?FAGLIANO: It just comes through waves instead of through a wire. Maybe it isn\u2019t an alternative.SHORTZ: \u201cContents of a dish\u201d? \u201cWhat a dish supplies\u201d?FAGLIANO: \u201cHigher-up channels?\u201dFAGLIANO: Yeah, they\u2019re all bad, but we have a lot of them!SHORTZ: \u201cAlternative to an antenna\u201d? But that would be simply for CABLE.SHORTZ: Yeah, I don\u2019t think you were harmed by that. When I started watching too much TV as a kid, my mom limited me to an hour a day. Of course, that felt like a basic loss of freedom.SHORTZ: In retrospect, I think her rule was all right. The one exception \u2014 one show I liked was \u201cThe Virginian,\u201d which went 90 minutes. She made an exception for that.FAGLIANO: Maybe this is too vague, but we could find the stat \u201cWhat 60 percent of U.S. households have.\u201d Sort of makes you think.SHORTZ: Huh! That\u2019s not bad. I would bet 75 percent, 80 percent. I wouldn\u2019t even be shocked by 90 percent.[Both look for the exact number: Will reaching for the 2018 World Almanac, Joel checking for an internet source.] SHORTZ: O.K., I\u2019ve got the figure, the exact figure, and interestingly, it\u2019s going down! It got as high as 90 percent. It peaked at 90.6 percent. Now it\u2019s down to 81 percent, and still falling. Wow, I\u2019d hate to say 80 percent, because next year it might be under 80 percent, and the clue would be out of date. In 2013, the figure was 90 percent, \u201914 it was 89 percent, \u201915 it was 86 percent, \u201916 it was 84 percent and \u201917 it was 81 percent. What\u2019s happening?FAGLIANO: People are cutting the cord. They\u2019re just doing without cable. I mean, I don\u2019t have cable. I just watch stuff over my computer, and then I project that onto my TV. But I also don\u2019t watch that much TV. Anyway, can we save this? Can we put a year? Like, \u201cWhat 80 percent of American households had in 2017.\u201dSHORTZ: That\u2019d still date the puzzle eventually. How about: \u201cWhat 90% of American households had in 2010 \u2014 but fewer have today.\u201d That\u2019s likely to stay true.FAGLIANO: Nice! That\u2019s an intriguing clue.SHORTZ: That\u2019s great for a 15-letter answer. Makes you go \u201cHmm \u2026\u201dYour thoughts?Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching.\u2022 Elon Musk finally responded to last week\u2019s bad news about Tesla.\u2022 Trump continues to go after Amazon.\u2022 China retaliated to President Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs.\u2022 Tech leaders have been keeping mum on Facebook.For months, the stock market rally seemed to have the strength to plow through the obstacles that the Trump administration threw in its way.But now, the S.&P. 500 index is down more than 10 percent from its all-time high.Too much blame can be placed on the White House, however.Before investors began fretting about tech and trade, the underpinnings of the stock market\u2019s ascent were perhaps not as robust as they looked. Wall Street analysts expect earnings for the companies in the S.&P. 500 to increase 25 percent this year, according to data compiled by Standard & Poor\u2019s, an unusually large jump that was reflected in the stock market valuations. Much of that projected earnings increase is coming from tax cuts and some from expectations that companies\u2019 revenue would grow at a nice clip as global growth stayed strong.\u2014 Peter EavisA little humor has not cleared the clouds over Tesla.The accident renews questions about Autopilot, a signature feature of Tesla vehicles, and whether the company has gone far enough to ensure that it keeps drivers and passengers safe.Raj Rajkumar, who researches autonomous driving at Carnegie Mellon University, thinks those assumptions concern one of Tesla\u2019s key sensors. \u201cThe radars they use are apparently meant for detecting moving objects (as typically used in adaptive cruise control systems), and seem to be not very good in detecting stationary objects,\u201d he says.Doubts about the fundamental capabilities of Tesla\u2019s Autopilot could crimp demand for its cars among a customer base that is often seeking the best technology.Out of respect for the privacy of our customer and his family, we do not plan to share any additional details until we conclude the investigation.- Peter EavisTech companies are again dragging down stocks on Wall Street.The S.&P. 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite are off 3.1 percent and 3.5 percent Monday. The continued fall in the share prices of some of the biggest tech companies is weighing heavily on the indexes.Amazon is down 5.4 percent, Netflix is off 5.9 percent, Facebook fell 3 percent, Google-parent Alphabet slipped 3.6 percent and Apple dropped 5.9 percent.After leading the market higher for much of the past two years, tech stocks have hit some turbulence. Since March 16, Facebook, Alphabet, Netflix and Amazon are all down more than 12 percent, while Apple is down 7.3 percent.Over that period the business models of those companies have come under increased scrutiny. News that Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm hired by President Trump\u2019s 2016 election campaign, gained access to private information on more than 50 million Facebook users has weighed not only on the shares of Facebook but on Alphabet as well. Amazon, meanwhile, has come under attack from President Trump.President Trump attacked the e-commerce again on Monday morning.Monday\u2019s tweet is the latest over the past five days from Mr. Trump criticizing Amazon. Over that period, Mr. Trump has accused Amazon of not paying enough taxes, of putting thousands of local retailers out of business and of using the United States Postal Service as its \u201cDelivery Boy.\u201dAmazon\u2019s shares are down 4 percent and are off nearly 11 percent since Axios reported on Wednesday about Mr. Trump\u2019s anger toward the company.Context\u2022 Amazon has said that the Postal Regulatory Commission, which oversees the service, has consistently found that its contracts with Amazon are profitable.Critic\u2019s cornerDA Davidson analyst Tom Forte wrote in a note via Reuters:\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s comments are consistent with industry sources we have spoken to in the shipping industry, who often label Amazon\u2019s deal with the USPS as a sweetheart deal. An argument, however, could be made that the USPS was losing billions before it expanded its service offerings for Amazon and would, still, likely lose billions if Amazon discontinued its use of the USPS tomorrow.\u201dCiting anonymous sources, Bloomberg\u2019s Ian King and Matt Gurman report:\u201cThe initiative, code named Kalamata, is still in the early developmental stages, but comes as part of a larger strategy to make all of Apple\u2019s devices \u2014 including Macs, iPhones, and iPads \u2014 work more similarly and seamlessly together.\u201dApple provides Intel with about 5 percent of its annual revenue.Kenneth C. Griffin\u2019s Citadel has just hired Phil Villhauer, a former top trader at Steven A. Cohen\u2019s investment firm. Mr. Villhauer will become deputy head of global equities at Citadel, a newly created position. He will officially join the Chicago-based hedge fund in the middle of April and work out of Citadel\u2019s office in New York, a Citadel spokesman confirmed.\u201cWe see this as a big hire for us,\u201d said Zia Ahmed, a Citadel spokesman.In January, Mr. Cohen reconfigured Point72 as a hedge fund after establishing it as a family office in 2014 to manage $11 billion of his personal wealth. Point72 has said it has raised between $2 billion and $4 billion in outside money.Mr. Villhauer had been with Mr. Cohen through both the good days and bad days. He was there when SAC turned into a powerhouse hedge fund, and he was there when the fund pleaded guilty to insider trading charges in 2013. The guilty plea required the firm to stop managing money for outside investors.When Mr. Villhauer left Point72, Mr. Cohen, in a letter to employees, called the departure a \u201cretirement\u201d and said he was sad to see Mr. Villhauer go.Now Mr. Villhauer will start a new chapter in his career at another well-known hedge fund firm.____________________________Part of the silence, people in the industry say, comes from a desire to avoid the business equivalent of bad karma \u2014 knowing that they, too, may one day face the buzz saw of public censure.Critic\u2019s corner More on data and privacy The Chinese government said on Monday that it would place tariffs on the imports of 128 American-made products in retaliation for to President Trump\u2019s tariffs on steel and aluminum.The Washington flyaroundWhen the Justice Department allowed Live Nation to merge with Ticketmaster, it tried to assuage concerns that the deal would cripple competitors.But critics have reason to be skeptical. Here\u2019s how Beau Buffier, the chief of the New York Attorney General\u2019s Antitrust Bureau, described Live Nation:\u201cIt is now widely seen as the poster child for the problems that arise when enforcers adopt these temporary fixes to limit the anticompetitive effects of deeply problematic vertical mergers.\u201dThe inquiries come as the department is reviewing two more mergers, between AT&T and Time Warner, and Disney and Fox.The department\u2019s new antitrust chief has said that the Live Nation deal and several other deals posed problems because they relied too much on the federal government\u2019s ability to police corporate behavior.\u201cEven if we wanted to do that, we often don\u2019t have the skills or the tools to do so effectively,\u201d the antitrust chief, Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, said in a speech.More for your playlistThe deals flyaroundAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Parkland Survivors Get a Broadway Master Class in Healing", "Date": "2018-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBOCA RATON, Fla. \u2014 On a Tuesday evening in a small theater in the back of a shopping center here, the teenage cast of the rock musical \u201cSpring Awakening\u201d pogoed around the stage, shouting the unprintable lyrics from one of its most ferocious songs.And they haven\u2019t had the chance to take a break from all that by singing the score with most of the show\u2019s original Broadway cast belting and bouncing right beside them.They began rehearsals five weeks before the shooting and they insisted on continuing after. The show opens May 2.As Broadway musicals go, \u201cSpring Awakening,\u201d with music by Duncan Sheik and book and lyrics by Steven Sater, is arguably the worst show that a town in South Florida could stage right now. Or if you believe in catharsis, in theater\u2019s ability to transmute painful feelings into something constructive and cleansing, maybe it\u2019s the best.Based on Frank Wedekind\u2019s 1891 play, it\u2019s a story of adolescents failed by an older generation, with tragic results. The character of Melchior, which vaulted Mr. Groff to stardom and is played here by the 17-year-old Never Again activist Cameron Kasky, sings a second-act number flanked by the ghosts of a dead friend and a dead lover.But for many of the students, rehearsal has been a reprieve, a temporary escape from real-life dramas.As Sawyer Garrity, 16, who plays Melchior\u2019s lover Wendla (Ms. Michele\u2019s role), said before rehearsal began: \u201cNothing has been normal. This isn\u2019t even fully normal.\u201d (Because of death threats some of the students have received, a police cruiser waits in the parking lot during every rehearsal.) \u201cBut this is the one place where I\u2019m centered,\u201d she said.But even generosity can breed exhaustion and complicate grieving. After the Sandy Hook school shooting in 2012, there were so many fund-raisers and celebrity stop-ins that Newtown\u2019s first selectman requested an end to outside events in town.Ms. Barclay wanted that, too. But she also hoped that the professional actors could counsel the students on taking a character to a dark place without staying there yourself, on making it \u201cnot so personal and raw,\u201d she said a few days before the Broadway actors arrived.In the theater, after the breathless warm-up, the rehearsal began in earnest, with the original cast watching from three and four rows back. \u201cThey\u2019re here to support your rehearsal. They\u2019re not here to cast you in the next Broadway show,\u201d Ms. Barclay said.\u201cI wish someone would cast me in the next Broadway show,\u201d Skylar Astin, who played Georg onstage, murmured jokingly.The Broadway actors praised the vulnerability and even the discomfort of some of the student actors. \u201cI can see in your faces and on your bodies what we felt as well when we were first doing the show,\u201d Phoebe Strole said during a break. \u201cIt\u2019s like taking your heart out of your chest and shoving it at us.\u201d\u201cBut you also have to be loud, guys,\u201d Mr. Glick said, adding an apologetic, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be like a Jewish mother here.\u201d\u201cPlease Jewish mother them,\u201d Ms. Barclay said. (A new mother herself, she\u2019d brought her 2-month-old baby to the rehearsal.)Eventually a prop gun required by the script would be used, but Ms. Barclay hadn\u2019t introduced it yet. No one wanted to mention the shooting head-on, though there were some oblique references to Valentine\u2019s Day.When a question for the Broadway actors seemed to veer that way, Mr. Kasky, who had spent most of the rehearsal threatening to break into \u201cUnder the Sea\u201d from \u201cThe Little Mermaid,\u201d tensed up. \u201cWe want to talk less about the shooting,\u201d he said. His character cried during a funeral scene in a way that seemed to bypass technique.The professional actors had advice on handling the hard stuff.\u201cYou choose when you want to use what you went through to cry or to laugh or do whatever, and if you don\u2019t, if you just want to go into the song, you can do that, too,\u201d Ms. Michele said.The younger actors studied their counterparts as though searching for clues about what their own lives would be 12 years from now. But mostly they wanted to be near the people who had sung the same songs and mumbled the same speeches and known what it is to show up for rehearsal with a face full of pimples or perform a love scene when your own body is still a mystery.\u201cI felt like, \u2018Am I going to have to pretend I have any clue what I\u2019m doing?\u2019\u201d Mr. Groff confessed.The Broadway actors, meanwhile, were confronted with visions of their teenage selves, and clutched each other while the students sang. At times they sang along quietly, unable to help themselves, lifting the cast up with the harmonies they still remembered.\u201cIt was really cool,\u201d Ethan Kaufman, a 15-year-old Stoneman Douglas student, said. \u201cI am awe-struck.\u201dThe feeling was mutual. An hour after rehearsal ended, the 2006 Ilse huddled with the 2018 one. A group of boys circled Mr. Astin as he took them through the Latin chants that the characters in the show recite.

That morning, though, I decided to use it differently. I guess I was looking for a place to unpack my tangled discomfort with the subtle yet loaded implications of the joke I had heard the night before.\u201cIt\u2019s an endorsement of dismissiveness and disregard,\u201d I wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s a familiarity and comfort with the culture of objectifying and demeaning people of color.\u201dWithin minutes of tweeting, I began to receive an unholy influx of feedback. A few hours later the thread was picked up by established news outlets, and once that happened \u2026 well, it was off to the races.Many of the comments I received were supportive \u2014 retweets, likes and the always flattering fist emoji. However, I have to admit that the loudest voices to me were the ones that were vitriolic and shockingly mean. Among the hundreds of replies I got, some included words like \u201ccrybaby\u201d and \u201cbitch.\u201d One comment was simply three short words: \u201cSlant eye ____.\u201d For some reason, when that one appeared, I stared at it for a good 60 seconds (probably because my eyes are so slanted) trying to wrap my head around what had just happened.In putting my thoughts to tweet, I was attempting to do a few things: question the creative motivation behind the joke, point out glaring industry double standards and shed some light on the systemic complacency that allows these things to happen.Kind of.I am watching \u201cRoseanne.\u201d I have it on my DVR and will probably finish the season. Like so many of us, I was a huge fan of the show\u2019s original iteration in the \u201990s and the opening harmonica alone sends endorphins cascading down my spinal cord. The set, the tone, the music and the actors (including the national treasures Laurie Metcalf and John Goodman) all conspire to instantly bring me back to a simpler, more comforting time.I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a zero sum game. I refuse to believe that just because one group gets attention, another group gets dismissed. I don\u2019t understand how telling one kind of story requires a blas\u00e9 disregard for another. In fact, I think different stories can serve different purposes. I can watch one TV show as an uplifting reflection of my own experience, while watching another as a deep dive into \u201cOthersville.\u201dBut that requires effort and patience and curiosity and attention. As comfy and cozy as it might be, we can\u2019t fall asleep in front of our television sets like Roseanne and Dan. We have to somehow resist the safety of our heavy eyelids and the security of our warm couches. If we want others to respect our stories, we have to respect theirs.An earlier version of this article misstated the title of a network drama.

But much about Stanley Kubrick\u2019s \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey,\u201d which was released 50 years ago this week, has proved prophetic. In our era of Siri and Alexa, that particularly applies to the film\u2019s forecast that we would speak with computers powered by some form of artificial intelligence. (In the movie, Pan Am provided shuttle service to a space station stop on the way to the moon.)Here\u2019s a condensed and edited version of a conversation we had this week:Do you remember watching \u201c2001\u201d at the time of its release?I was 11 when I saw it at the Glendale Theatre in Toronto in Cinerama and it just completely blew my mind. And that\u2019s what got me interested in filmmaking. It almost seemed like a documentary to me. It was such a realistic depiction of the future.Did the film have a similar effect on Mr. Rain?It was just a job for him. It doesn\u2019t really mean anything to him and he\u2019s never seen the film.He was hired to do the narration for what was going to be an elaborate prologue to \u201c2001.\u201d They filmed interviews with all these amazing scientists and thinkers to set up the premise for the film and explain the context. But Kubrick stripped it away and didn\u2019t use the narration he\u2019d hired Rain to do.I think if Kubrick had kept all of the explanatory things it wouldn\u2019t it wouldn\u2019t be the classic that it is.So how did Mr. Rain move from there to becoming HAL?It was going to be Martin Balsam\u2019s voice. And even before that it was going to be a female voice. HAL was going to be an Athena.So the voice was probably just a combination of circumstance and a gut choice by Kubrick. He literally said to Rain, \u2018I\u2019m not happy what I have in the can,\u2019 meaning the Martin Balsam recording that had been done a year before. \u2018Would you like to play the computer?\u2019 And then, in a day and a half, it was done.Why is Mr. Rain indifferent toward the film?But I\u2019m sure if I were Rain I wouldn\u2019t want it to define my career. It would be like Alec Guinness being known just for Obi-Wan Kenobi and nothing else.A large number of you send thoughtful replies to my questions last week about how the misuse, which was initially revealed by Canadian whistle-blower Christopher Wylie, has changed the way you use Facebook. Here are a few of the highlights:I was pretty confident that an organization such as Facebook, with so much success and resources, would act smart and responsible. That is not the case we learned \u2014 not at all! I am shocked and I will surely do something.If there\u2019s a lesson to be learned from this, it is that on the long run, free stuff is fishy!\u2014Guy Pierre Poulin, St. Sauveur, QuebecI was a relatively early adopter to Facebook back in early-2005 as an undergraduate student at the University of Alberta. Since 2012 I have deleted as much data associated with my profile as possible and have not logged on or messaged anybody through Facebook.I had privacy concerns and it was a source of distraction and agitation. But I was also perceiving others in my peer group as moving swiftly ahead with their lives, in all aspects, whereas I had felt inadequate.Quitting Facebook about six years ago has been very positive decision. It\u2019s allowed for more focused \u201cdeep work\u201d and to be more engaged fully with people.\u2014Ravendra Naidoo, OttawaThe last few weeks of angst about Facebook has not changed my mind about continuing to use social media. It is the way I stay in touch with others with like interests around the globe. I do not put anything on my FB page that is not for public consumption. I limit those who can view my information and posts to friends. I unfriend anyone who posts disgusting things and stop following people who post too much. My social media account is my enjoyment and pleasure. Why would I give that up?\u2014Louann Hansen, AlbertaI suspended my Facebook account a few months ago and never looked back. I really felt it was designed to be addictive and my brain couldn\u2019t resist. I still think about friends who I may have known a bit more about if I had stayed. But those thoughts also prompt me to reconnect with them in a more active way, like email, phone or in person. I can no longer vent about politics by posting. So I now realize that any anger I feel should either be ignored or focused on something more active than pressing \u201cpost.\u201dSuspending Facebook made me much happier right away, an instant gratification that no social media activity ever gave me!\u2014Tim Wilbur, TorontoAlthough the weather doesn\u2019t seem much like it in many regions, it is April, and time for the latest post from Watching, The Times\u2019s guide to viewing, tailored for Netflix users in Canada.

{"Headline": "James Comey Still Looks the Part", "Date": "2018-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnbuttonedThe former F.B.I. director has made the rounds this week, offering his take on what \u201cethical leadership\u201d means. If we\u2019re going by appearances, it\u2019s a lot like the movies.And he is only going to get more omnipresent, thanks to a media blitz that includes appearances on \u201cToday,\u201d \u201cThe View,\u201d \u201cThe Rachel Maddow Show\u201d and CNN, and a book tour that lasts until May 25, with stops in New York; Chicago; Portland, Ore.; Washington; and Los Angeles (among other cities). Demand for some of those events is so high that tickets are being resold on sites like StubHub for hundreds of dollars. Mr. Comey stares out from small screens and promotional pictures everywhere \u2014 trailers, social media and reviews. He is steely eyed, often glancing upward, as to a higher goal, or resolutely ahead; dark, brush-cut hair just beginning to be smudged with gray; the squareness of his jawline matched only by the squareness of his shoulders, his 6-foot-8 frame often draped in layers of true blue. Even in interviews, he rarely smiles (though there were a few grins with Mr. Colbert). His under-eye pouches speak of sleepless nights worrying about the soul of the executive branch and the burdens of doing the right thing. Warner Bros. couldn\u2019t have cast him better if it had tried. The look is in many ways the culmination of a cinematic romance with bureaucratic iconography that began in 1935 with James Cagney\u2019s film \u201c\u2018G\u2019 Men,\u201d and continued through Kevin Costner as Eliot Ness in Brian De Palma\u2019s \u201cThe Untouchables.\u201d Mr. Comey fits neatly within this predetermined, easily read lens. It\u2019s both comforting and slightly unnerving to see how closely he resembles the fictive embodiments of his role. Life imitating art imitating life.The names may be different, but these men represent a common character, whose seriousness of purpose and consistent moral code are conveyed through seriousness of mien and consistent dress code. In many ways, these men have formed our fantasy of the ultimate upstanding lawman: who subjugates his persona to his ideals and his institution by assuming the uniform of lore. At a time when casual Friday and the rights of the individual to self-expression through clothes are on the rise, it\u2019s a clear pledge of allegiance to a different convention. It\u2019s a character Mr. Comey has been honing for years, since he took the oath of office as F.B.I. director in 2013, and immortalized in his testimony before Congress last June, when he appeared in a dark suit, pristine white shirt and dark red tie, caught forever in multiple cameras and the watching imagination. Even when he takes off his tie, as he has for his recent TV appearances, or swaps the jacket for a collared shirt in a dark shade, as he did for his Twitter page and his author photograph, as if to acknowledge his role as a private citizen, his clothes still convey sincerity and sobriety. There\u2019s nothing really casual about them. On Mr. Colbert\u2019s show, he wore a black shirt and matching trousers with a gray jacket finished in black buttons: Johnny Cash, the lawyer version. You can take the G-man out of the suit (and the job), but not the suit out of the former G-man.In the drama of opposition, where Mr. Comey is increasingly casting himself, and being cast by others, as the mission-driven antipode to the president, his appearance acts as a kind of supporting argument. On the one hand is Mr. Trump, whose hair is an elaborate construction to hide a bald spot, whose skin is shaded to disguise whatever its true pallor may be, whose clothes billow around his body as if to conceal the girth beneath. On the other is Mr. Comey, whose optics imply discipline, self-control and lack of guile. In case you missed it, he drew attention to the point himself, noting to Mr. Stephanopoulos and in his book that when he met Mr. Trump he was struck by his \u201cimpressively\u201d coifed hair that \u201clooked to be\u201d all his own (but maybe it wasn\u2019t), his too-long tie and the white pouches under his eyes, perhaps from goggles worn while fake tanning. (Former President Barack Obama, he writes, looked \u201cthinner\u201d in person.)Then there\u2019s that now-famous story about Mr. Comey\u2019s attempt to use his blue suit to blend into the Blue Room\u2019s blue curtains to avoid an awkward encounter with President Trump, of whom he was already suspicious. It didn\u2019t work, of course. But it did prove he understands the value of clothing as camouflage \u2014 and, indeed, communication. In the book he also acknowledges that he chose a gold tie for his news conference about the Clinton emails precisely because, as neither red nor blue, it wasn\u2019t \u201cdisplaying either of the normal political gang colors.\u201d And that when he first took office at the F.B.I. he wore a blue shirt to distinguish himself from the previous director, Robert S. Mueller III, a devotee of white shirts, and signal a new era. (Mr. Comey said as well that he tried to encourage a more casual dress code, but \u2014 well, everything is relative.)The question now is whether, in becoming the avatar of the ultimate G-man, Mr. Comey will herald its renaissance or, by the time his tour is finished and the final page has been turned, its last gasp? Depends, I suppose, on whether the Netflix adaptation is far behind.Advertisement"}

Outside of the third hour, which covers the 1968 presidential campaign, he\u2019s a supporting player in the dramas of other people: his brother John, Joseph McCarthy, George Wallace, Martin Luther King Jr., Lyndon Johnson. The series often looks like a general social and political history of the 1960s that\u2019s only loosely tied to Kennedy.The Kennedy of \u201cBobby Kennedy for President\u201d is a smart, ambitious politician, perhaps more principled than most \u2014 it\u2019s hard to judge the depth of his convictions \u2014 who managed to capture the imaginations of young Americans and the loyalty of minority voters. He did it despite the contradictions in his own record, including service with McCarthy\u2019s Senate Subcommittee on Investigations and the approval, when he was attorney general, of the wiretapping of King and other civil rights leaders.Ms. Porter fills in this historical record, but the man at the center remains elusive. No family members or, it seems, close personal friends are interviewed. The copious footage \u2014 including scenes from pioneering documentaries by Robert Drew like \u201cCrisis\u201d and \u201cPrimary\u201d \u2014 conveys Kennedy\u2019s seriousness, intelligence and, in the wake of John\u2019s 1963 assassination, overriding sense of melancholy. But the main quality it captures is reserve \u2014 the shields are always up, and the filmmakers and broadcasters of the time don\u2019t try very hard to get around them.There are a lot of images in \u201cBobby Kennedy for President\u201d that we\u2019ve seen before, of riots, marches, demonstrations, the Cuban missile crisis, the steps of the University of Alabama. Less familiar, and more compelling, are scenes of the fervor surrounding Kennedy\u2019s presidential campaign in 1968. In California an aide holds him around the waist to keep him from falling out of his car as waves of people run up to grab his hand. What the series shows us, finally, is how he mirrored people\u2019s hopes for peaceful change \u2014 then, and now.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Extra Help Hurting My Friend With Autism?", "Date": "2018-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySocial Q\u2019sA reader expresses empathy for \u2014 but mostly envy of \u2014 a peer who receives special testing accommodations.I am a student at a small liberal arts college. My friend takes a required psychology class with me. But she has acute autism, so when we take exams, she goes into another room, by herself, to take them. She recently told me that when she takes these tests, she uses her notes to do better. This hardly seems fair to everyone who actually studied. I also don\u2019t understand how this situation is supposed to help her issues. Should I tell the professor?ANONYMOUSWrongdoing generally requires two elements: a guilty act, actus reus, and a guilty mind, mens rea. (Thanks for letting me strut my legal stuff \u2014 and my Latin!) But based on your story, I\u2019m skeptical about your friend\u2019s intent. If she knew she were cheating by using her notes, why would she tell you? You seem a bit competitive and not a natural ally of someone who would bend the grading curve to your detriment. Also, why do you imply that she\u2019s not studying?Still, I have never encountered the term \u201cacute autism,\u201d so I don\u2019t know the nature of your friend\u2019s deficits or what accommodations the school makes for her. Why not ask her about her use of notes if you\u2019re concerned? But here\u2019s my real advice: Speak to her like someone who wants to help a pal \u2014 one who is probably walking a tougher road than you are \u2014 and not as someone who\u2019s livid at being cheated out of a good grade. Like sunshine (and Netflix original series), opportunities abound.My sister-in-law is likely having a baby boy the week before we leave for a prepaid vacation with my entire family that\u2019s been planned for over a year. This would place the bris in the middle of our vacation. I think it would be more meaningful to visit a few weeks later, post-recovery, when we can spend time with mother and baby. But my husband\u2019s family insists we come to the bris. My husband says he will be disowned if we don\u2019t go. We already make many concessions to his family. Must we attend?ANONYMOUSYour husband is the dark horse here. We don\u2019t know whether he would prefer vacationing with your entire clan or attending his nephew\u2019s bris. So, ask him (without stacking the deck or becoming furious if he doesn\u2019t answer like a ventriloquist\u2019s dummy).He will probably not be disowned if he says: \u201cI\u2019m sorry we can\u2019t make the bris. This trip has been planned forever.\u201d Nor will the world stop turning if he takes a 36-hour hiatus from your prepaid holiday.My niece recently came out to my sister as a lesbian. My sister is grappling with the news and the \u201chard life\u201d she thinks my niece will lead. I totally support my niece and told my sister as much. Still, she swore me to secrecy. When I was alone with my niece, I tried to open the door to her telling me. But she didn\u2019t, and I didn\u2019t push. I simply told her I love her. But I want to offer support and advice. May I?AUNTNo. This is your niece\u2019s story to share without prompting. You\u2019ve already proven yourself a first-rate aunt by trying to allay your sister\u2019s old-fashioned fears. And I predict you will be terrific in responding to your niece when she decides to tell you. But don\u2019t hint or push. Let her open up to you in her own good time.A few years ago, my father was in financial straits and about to lose his home. I have children and a mortgage, and couldn\u2019t be of much help. But a wealthy cousin, hearing of his problem, offered to assist. He proposed that my father stay in his home (while paying rent), but upon his death, all my father\u2019s assets would go to this cousin. He said he needed to see a return on his investment. We were saddened by this. My father refused and managed to get by. But now, the daughter of this cousin is getting married and has invited me to her destination wedding. I am not going. Must I give a gift?ANONYMOUSWhat a monstrous disappointment that such a fascinating yarn should end in a banal question about wedding gifts. Who cares? You are under no obligation to attend the wedding or send a gift. But isn\u2019t it ironic that while you expected your cousin to be charitable where your father was concerned, like him, you have reduced his daughter\u2019s wedding to a question of financial terms?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bill Cosby Shares a Few Words With the Prosecutor in Court", "Date": "2018-04-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBill Cosby has not said much about the sexual assault accusations that have dogged him for years, but when he was convicted on Thursday of drugging and assaulting Andrea Constand he decided to say a few words in the Norristown, Pa., courtroom. Including a crass one aimed at the prosecutor.The 80-year-old actor, a fixture in American family entertainment for decades, erupted in response to a suggestion by the Montgomery County district attorney, Kevin R. Steele, that his bail should be revoked because he was a potential flight risk and owned a plane.Judge Steven T. O\u2019Neill told Mr. Cosby to pipe down \u2014 \u201cEnough of that!\u201dBut he disagreed with the notion that the actor seemed likely to skip town. He said Mr. Cosby could be released on $1 million bail but should surrender his passport and stay in his home nearby.The court outburst drew a lot of attention because \u2014 beside the vulgarity \u2014 it was one of the rare times Mr. Cosby has said anything in public in connection with the case or the dozens of sexual assault allegations made against him.Though he has denied all of the accusations made against him, he did not testify in his own defense during the trial that ended on Thursday.Here are a few other times he has spoken out.Mr. Cosby refused to answer questions about sexual assault during a taped interview with The Associated Press in 2014. After the interview was over, he told the reporter that he did not want anyone to see the tape.Instead, The A.P. released the tape, shining new light on the decades-old allegations and helping to ignite a firestorm that caused NBC and Netflix to cancel two of Mr. Cosby\u2019s television projects.\u201cThere is no comment about that and I\u2019ll tell you why,\u201d Mr. Cosby said, when asked about the allegations. \u201cI think you were told, I don\u2019t want to compromise your integrity, but I don\u2019t talk about it.\u201dAfter the interview ended, while the camera was running and Mr. Cosby was still wearing a microphone, he said he wanted the tape to be disposed of.\u201cI would appreciate it if it was scuttled,\u201d he said. \u201cI think if you want to consider yourself to be serious, that it will not appear anywhere.\u201dWhen the reporter said he would have to ask his boss what to do with the tape, Mr. Cosby said to one of his handlers, standing slightly off camera, \u201cI think you need to get on the phone with his person. Immediately.\u201dMr. Cosby did not explicitly deny the allegations but said he thought the media was treating him unfairly because he was famous. He was especially upset by a report that he had hired a lawyer to defend him from Ms. Green\u2019s accusation.\u201cI guess that a celebrity trying to protect him or herself is not supposed to use every ounce of protection?\u201d he said. \u201cBut this is all about celebrity, period!\u201dMr. Cosby also bemoaned the potential impact of the allegations on his loved ones.\u201cWho really wants to put his or her family in a position of information coming out publicly that will cause great emotional stress, challenge?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe choices that the family, friends have made in looking at him or her as a good person, a wonderful person, a person to be trusted?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s interesting. When I talk to people they will say, \u2018This is a situation that\u2019s unprecedented.\u2019 I, my family, my friends, I have been in this business 52 years,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this. And reality is the situation. And I can\u2019t speak.\u201dThe interviewer, Linsey Davis, said during the segment that she did not think Mr. Cosby understood the \u201cmedia furor\u201d produced by the dozens of women who, by that point, had accused him of sexual assault.\u201cI can\u2019t speak on that,\u201d he said, when asked about the charges. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to argue. I don\u2019t talk about it.\u201dGraham Bowley contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Wells Fargo Is About to be Hit With $1 Billion Fine: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Good Thursday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Regulators are about to hit Wells Fargo with a $1 billion penalty.\u2022 The European Union is prepared to offer some trade concessions.\u2022 Two big drug makers have shown interest in bidding for Shire.\u2022 How the Time Warner C.E.O. did on the stand yesterday.\u2022 Dates to watch in the U.S.-China trade fight.The basics:\u2022 It would be the most stringent action taken against a bank by the Trump administration.\u2022 The action is said to punish Wells Fargo for forcing customers to buy auto insurance they didn\u2019t need, improperly charging mortgage customers and for having inadequate compliance practices.The misdeeds at Wells Fargo showed that the bank\u2019s sales culture had degraded. Bank employees, eager to meet sales goals, had been opening accounts for customers without their consent. Other misdeeds were revealed as well.The scandals were particularly surprising because Wells Fargo, with its focus on traditional lending, was widely viewed as a worthy alternative to the Wall Street-focused institutions at the center of the financial crisis of 2008. Wells Fargo\u2019s steady revenue growth and its habit of invariably beating earnings forecasts lulled investors into a false sense of confidence and led them to pile into Wells Fargo\u2019s stock.\u2014 Peter EavisCritics\u2019 cornerNow would not seem like the ideal to start a venture capital firm that aims to help U.S. start-ups break into the Russian market, given the political tensions between the two countries.The firm said on Thursday that it has opened for business in the U.S. with a $200 million fund, its second, for investing in a variety of industries, from A.I. to fintech. And it has hired a veteran of Silicon Valley, Anurag Chandra, to help in that mission.Victor Orlovski, Fort Ross\u2019s founder and managing partner, said in an interview that the current state of U.S.-Russian political relations should not affect his firm\u2019s ability to operate. Declining to comment on politics broadly, he said that Russia \u2014 which remains one of the biggest markets for apps worldwide \u2014 will remain a compelling destination for start-ups.\u201cThe nature of start-ups is all about risk,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a political tension, but not when you\u2019re talking to start-ups.\u201dFort Ross\u2019s team is betting its contacts in Russia and knowledge of the market will help attract U.S. start-ups. Mr. Orlovski was previously the chief digital officer at Sberbank, Russia\u2019s biggest bank, and maintains connections in that region, including through his former employer.For one of Fort Ross\u2019s existing investments, the social trading start-up eToro, the investment firm introduced the portfolio company to a local player in Russia to help it crack that market.Fort Ross began raising its latest fund in the fall, drawing investors from Russia and the Middle East. (Mr. Orlovski said that the investors are primarily family offices and wealthy individuals, though he does eventually want to branch out into traditional money sources like U.S. pension funds.) But the goal, he added, was to make the firm better-known in Silicon Valley, a task he argued would not be hampered by his background or focus.\u201cI don\u2019t feel like we are a second- or third-tier venture firm just because I\u2019m personally from Russia or because we have connections to Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cOne year, or a couple of years ahead, we want to be a bigger player in the community of V.C.s here.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la MercedThe European Union, with its $16 trillion economy and its reputation for toughness in trade negotiations, could be the immovable object that stymies President Trump\u2019s combative trade agenda.But that outcome is looking less likely.According to the Journal, the European Union is prepared to reduce tariffs on United States cars and industrial machinery, among other goods. The newspaper also reported that the bloc might offer to join the United States in pressuring China to relax its trade and investment rules. (In return, the European Union is reportedly asking for European companies to be given access to United States government procurement contracts.)The Trump administration apparently proposed the punitive tariffs as a way to secure compromises from trading partners, and bring them into an alliance against China. If the European Union bends to this strategy, rather than rejecting it outright, it would be a notable gain for Mr. Trump.\u2014 Peter EavisTakeda Pharmaceutical disclosed on Thursday that it has bid for more than $60 billion for the Irish drug maker Shire, though the offer was rejected. But it may have competition in the form of Allergan, which said on Thursday it was considering an offer for Shire.Still the disclosures, following weeks of speculation, again raises the prospect of consolidation within the pharmaceutical industry. Drug makers have long looked to big takeovers to broaden their product portfolios.For Takeda, which is based in Osaka and whose products include treatments for acid reflux and for cancer, a big takeover would give it both more scale \u2014 the combined company would have some $30 billion in annual sales \u2014 and a bigger international footprint.But Shire, which is headquartered in Dublin and is best known for producing Adderall, would be its biggest takeover by far. (Its next-biggest acquisition was the $13.7 billion purchase of Nycomed seven years ago.)Takeda\u2019s main competitor may be Allergan, the maker of Botox, is a veteran acquirer, having been built up through numerous mergers over the years.Under the terms of that offer, Shire shareholders would own just over half of the combined company.Takeda and Shire said that they are in discussions, which could lead to yet another revised bid.Yet for both Takeda and Allergan, a deal for Shire could prove financially risky, since each company would need to borrow significant amounts of debt to finance a transaction.Under British takeover rules, Takeda has until April 25 to decide whether to continue pursuing Shire. Allergan has until May 17 to do the same.Advising Takeda are Evercore Partners, JPMorgan Chase and Nomura. Advising Shire are Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.\u2014 Michael de la MercedFrom Mr. Lohr:The rethinking of GE Digital, with its future still under review by Mr. Flannery, points to the difficulty of producing modern software for industrial businesses as they adopt digital technology.No one disputes the overarching vision of the so-called industrial internet of things \u2014 which includes low-cost sensors and a flood of data and clever software that should deliver insights to cut costs, conserve fuel and design better products, faster. But the company greatly underestimated the challenges of creating all the software needed to achieve that grand vision, said analysts and former G.E. managers.Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Thursday that the statue known as \u201cFearless Girl\u201d will soon be moved from its spot at the southern tip of Broadway to a spot facing the New York Stock Exchange.And if the city has its way, the bull will eventually go with her.\u201cSo after deciding to allow the sculpture \u2014 placed temporarily at the spot \u2014 to remain for a year, city officials came to the conclusion that the number of pedestrians spilling into the streets created a safety hazard.\u201dDuring his court testimony in Washington yesterday, the Time Warner C.E.O. argued that his company\u2019s proposed $85.4 billion sale to AT&T was necessary, given the \u201ctectonic changes\u201d in the media world wrought by Netflix and Amazon.Among the biggest problems for Time Warner as a stand-alone television and movie producer is that it does not have access to viewer data to target advertising and other valuable customer information the same way that Amazon and Netflix do, Mr. Bewkes said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have emails, contact information, billing information \u2026 any of these things,\u201d he said.Lawyers for the Justice Department, which has sued to block the deal, grilled him about an internal document from last year showing plans to create digital products even without AT&T.Randall Stephenson of AT&T could take the stand today.On May 1, exemptions to the tariffs on imported steel and aluminum expire.On May 22, the public comment period ends for another $50 billion worth of tariffs, and the Trump administration can announce a final list of targets.And Aug. 18 is potentially the deadline for the administration to act on an investigation into Chinese trade practices. But there\u2019s a provision for a 180-day delay after that.Key caveats: President Trump has the power to pursue trade policy almost at whim. And a W.T.O. proceeding against China could take years.The politically minded bank already adopted principles for limiting firearm sales laid out by the advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety. Now it\u2019s using its position as a (small) shareholder in Sturm, Ruger to urge the gun maker to adopt six Everytown principles.Among them: Supporting mandatory background checks for all sales; binding sellers to a code of conduct; and adopting smart-gun tech. If Ruger doesn\u2019t support those principles, Amalgamated would withhold votes for Sandra Froman, a Ruger director who\u2019s also on the N.R.A.\u2019s board.The tech flyaroundAs the firm moves more into consumer businesses \u2014 pushing its Marcus online lending platform, buying Adam Dell\u2019s budget-planning app \u2014 it is looking less like a traditional investment bank and trading house and more like a one-stop shop. Like the universal banks JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup.Advertisement"}
