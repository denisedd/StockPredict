{"Headline": "Is Trump Serious About Trade War? China\u2019s Leaders Hunt for Answers", "Date": "2018-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 In an elegantly furnished back room at a conference in eastern China in December, a member of the Chinese leadership asked American tech executives for help.He has not been alone.In these meetings, the Americans have warned that Mr. Trump\u2019s complaints should be taken seriously because of widespread frustration in Washington with Chinese policies, especially a $300 billion program to dominate critical high-tech industries, known as Made in China 2025, that has alarmed the United States national security establishment.It is unclear whether that message is making it through to Mr. Xi \u2014 or whether he has chosen to ignore it after concluding that Mr. Trump is bluffing and that the United States will back off, as it has in the past.\u201cWhen you have this kind of regime, you want to report the good story,\u201d said Tao Jingzhou, a managing partner at the global law firm Dechert who deals with senior Chinese officials. \u201cI have the impression the leadership is not fully briefed about the seriousness of the atmosphere against China in the U.S. establishment.\u201dDespite this deep bench of expertise, the Chinese leadership appears at a loss, grasping for interlocutors in an American political landscape that has been scrambled by Mr. Trump. For more than two decades, Beijing has watched corporate America make the case for trade with China and one American president after another embrace that agenda. But Mr. Trump has defied that pattern.\u201cChinese experts do not understand the current state of the United States,\u201d said Jie Zhao, a professor at the China Executive Leadership Academy Pudong, which trains senior civil servants in Shanghai. \u201cThey do not understand Trump, do not understand his team and do not understand the source of his policies.\u201dPart of the problem is that the leadership\u2019s usual contacts in the United States \u2014 often establishment figures with backgrounds in international finance and diplomacy \u2014 have been largely sidelined by Mr. Trump.\u201cThe people with whom Chinese officials are familiar in Washington are mainly the enemies of Trump,\u201d said Shi Yinhong, professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. \u201cTrump hates those people.\u201dLooking for answers, Vice President Wang has met instead in recent weeks with three former Treasury secretaries \u2014 Timothy Geithner, Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Lawrence H. Summers \u2014 as well as Robert B. Zoellick, the former United States trade representative, and William S. Cohen, the former defense secretary.Business leaders who have met with Chinese leaders in the same period include Timothy D. Cook of Apple, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, Chuck Robbins of Cisco, Stephen A. Schwarzman of the Blackstone Group and David M. Solomon of Goldman Sachs.\u201cThey ask, \u2018Who can we talk to?\u2019\u201d said David M. Lampton, the scholar who has recently hosted five Chinese officials. \u201cThey don\u2019t see a stable structure.\u201dBut Professor Lampton, of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, added that despite their frustration, the Chinese seemed satisfied that they can \u201coutlast a U.S. administration that alienates its allies, erodes its own political base and has a public with a low threshold for pain.\u201dThere are vague hints of disagreement in Beijing over how to respond to Mr. Trump\u2019s trade threats. Some in the elite have emphasized the potential impact of a trade war on the Chinese economy and urged negotiations, while others have argued that the dispute is part of a broader effort to thwart China\u2019s rise \u2014 and that Beijing must respond accordingly.\u201cOn the trade war issue, the hawkish atmosphere in China is quite strong right now,\u201d said Chen Jieren, a political commentator in Beijing.Although the tariffs that Mr. Trump has enacted thus far hit only a small segment of China\u2019s steel and aluminum sector, the pain of a proposed additional set would be spread across manufacturers of more than 1,300 goods.Given the party\u2019s tight control of the media, there has been no outcry against Mr. Xi\u2019s policies like that by some American business leaders against Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs. It helps that no single sector or region in China stands out as especially vulnerable, though the aerospace industry could be stung and Chinese automakers eyeing exports to the United States would be disrupted.But speaking at the conference, Fan Gang, the director of China\u2019s National Economic Research Institute, warned of \u201csystematic risk\u201d to manufacturing supply chains. And Jack Ma, the founder of the e-commerce giant Alibaba, suggested that a trade war could destroy 10 million jobs.One sensitive question in Beijing is the fate of the Made in China 2025 plan, which has been the focus of the Trump administration\u2019s complaints. The program would provide subsidies and loans to help Chinese firms acquire foreign competitors, develop advanced technologies and dominate key sectors such as alternative energy, robotics, telecom and artificial intelligence.The military and security apparatus, and the industries close to them, regard the program as essential to China\u2019s strategic ambitions. But discerning the attitude of China\u2019s economic policymakers is more difficult, and not simply because it would be politically taboo to back away from a plan that Mr. Xi has blessed.Premier Li Keqiang, for example, has tended to take more conciliatory positions in trade disputes than colleagues in the leadership who favor asserting China\u2019s clout as a global power. But Mr. Li also leads a cluster of government ministers who are the main architects and advocates of the Made in China 2025 program.They include Miao Wei, the minister of industry and information technology, and Wang Zhigang, the minister of science and technology. Like Mr. Li, both grew up in central China\u2019s impoverished Anhui Province and favor an extensive role for the state in upgrading Chinese industries, acquaintances said.On the other hand, the policymakers closest to Mr. Xi \u2014 men with finance backgrounds including Mr. Liu and Vice President Wang \u2014 are more interested in seeking geopolitical parity with the United States and less enthusiastic about industrial policy in general.They worry that state intervention may distort markets and exacerbate the problems of China\u2019s already debt-laden financial system, people who know them said.Yet such concerns have not translated into a willingness to retreat on the Made in China 2025 program in the face of Mr. Trump\u2019s threats. \u201cI don\u2019t think China is willing to compromise Made in China 2025,\u201d said Da Wei, a professor at the University of International Relations in Beijing. \u201cThis is the core of the competition.\u201dMr. Xi has charted a moderate course so far, retaliating in equal measure when the Trump administration has imposed tariffs, while urging that the dispute be resolved through negotiation.But talks have stalled since Chinese officials rejected American demands that Made in China 2025 be rolled back. A Chinese spokesman said on Thursday that no actual trade negotiations were underway.Reporting was contributed by Jonathan Ansfield, Javier C.

Your industry is under siege. Whether you work at an established giant like Facebook or Google, a private company like Uber or Palantir, or a lesser-known start-up, it feels like you\u2019re being attacked from a thousand directions. People are comparing your companies to Big Tobacco, and Congress is accusing your executives of undermining democracy, poisoning users\u2019 brains and censoring content.All of a sudden, Silicon Valley \u2014 once the golden child of American industry \u2014 has become a villain.Some of the backlash probably feels excessive. After all, the tech industry still creates useful things and employs lots of decent and ethical people. But I\u2019ve talked to a number of tech workers recently, and I\u2019ve seen you wrestling with your consciences. Some of you have stopped wearing your company T-shirts around town, fearing dirty looks from strangers. Others have taken extended vacations after a particularly shameful scandal, or asked for a transfer within a company. More than a few of you have had awkward conversations with your parents.Here\u2019s the thing, though. You don\u2019t have to keep your concerns bottled up.You are your employers\u2019 most valuable assets, and your bosses are desperate to keep you happy. As tech companies take on increasingly vital roles in global commerce and culture, you have the power to shape the way they operate and the ethical standards they uphold.If you want change, all you have to do is organize and speak up.In most industries, rank-and-file workers don\u2019t have much say. The power of organized labor in America has been shrinking since the 1980s, and other than a few notable teachers\u2019 strikes this year, large-scale collective action is rare these days.\u201cTech workers are the only point of leverage on these big companies,\u201d said Maciej Ceg\u0142owski, the founder of the social bookmarking service Pinboard.Mr. Ceg\u0142owski, who has started an advocacy organization called Tech Solidarity, said that the typical instruments used to rein in corporate misbehavior \u2014 customer boycotts, shareholder activism and outside regulation \u2014 aren\u2019t likely to work on the largest Silicon Valley companies.Instead, change at these companies will need to come from the inside.\u201cEven a couple hundred employees working in concert could bring a site like Google to its knees,\u201d Mr. Ceg\u0142owski said.But these are just warm-up skirmishes. For maximum impact, tech workers will need to scrutinize not just their employers\u2019 government ties, but their products, business models, and basic standards. And they\u2019ll need to do it in public.Without Ms. Fowler\u2019s brave disclosure \u2014 and her colleagues\u2019 willingness to back her up after she went public \u2014 it\u2019s entirely possible that Mr. Kalanick would still be Uber\u2019s chief executive and the company would still be run by boorish bros.Typically, when workers speak out or organize, it\u2019s because they want higher wages, better working conditions or stronger job security. Those aren\u2019t your problems. You probably work manageable hours in tastefully decorated buildings with free food, ergonomic desk furniture and plentiful amenities. Your compensation is generous. And you\u2019re in little danger of being fired or retaliated against, especially if you\u2019re part of a large group.And that\u2019s before we even get to the thorny ethical debates surrounding technologies like artificial intelligence, in which companies\u2019 goals \u2014 amass huge amounts of data to help train increasingly sophisticated machine learning models \u2014 may be at odds with what\u2019s good for society.That leaves an opening for you.\u201cIt\u2019s not clear where the pressure\u2019s going to come from otherwise,\u201d said Leslie Berlin, a Stanford historian who has studied Silicon Valley\u2019s labor culture.These groups are still small, and none has produced concrete results yet. But they are early signs that greater political consciousness is stirring in the industry.In a tech-dominated world, when the decisions made by a handful of Silicon Valley executives have the ability to reshape nations and transform billions of lives, there\u2019s no better time to stand up. Together, you can encourage your employers to behave in ethical and humane ways, and blow the whistle publicly when they fall short.Organizing yourselves to push for change isn\u2019t just a viable option \u2014 it might be the only way out of this mess.Godspeed,KevinAn earlier version of this column misstated when Tech Action began meeting in New York.

{"Headline": "Qualcomm May Be Collateral Damage in a U.S.-China Trade War", "Date": "2018-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A looming trade war between the United States and China has put Qualcomm, one of America\u2019s largest technology companies, squarely in the middle of the battlefield.A major supplier in both China and the United States, the San Diego-based chip maker has long managed to play the trading relationship between the world\u2019s two largest economies to its advantage. But an escalating trade battle over which country will dominate the technologies of the future is now threatening Qualcomm\u2019s business and its growth.In China, Qualcomm\u2019s plan to acquire NXP Semiconductors, a critical part of its growth strategy, has been stalled by a prolonged antitrust review, a move critics see as Chinese retaliation for President Trump\u2019s aggressive trade moves. On Thursday, Chinese officials said that Qualcomm will have to make more concessions to compensate for the market power it would enjoy after completing the deal, without providing details.Qualcomm\u2019s situation illustrates the perils of trying to punish a major trading partner that has become a crucial link in supply chains stretching across the globe. By targeting foreign players with ties to their own markets, the United States and China are putting their own economic futures at risk. The question is whether the Trump administration will balk at paying that price \u2014 or see its goal of punishing China for unfair trade practices as more important than any collateral damage that could ensue.\u201cThey\u2019re obviously really caught in the middle,\u201d Andrew Gilholm, the director of analysis for greater China at Control Risks, said of Qualcomm. \u201cThe demands the Chinese government has on them, and the demands coming from the U.S. side, at some point might become irreconcilable.\u201dThe cold war that is emerging between the United States and China is increasingly centered on the kind of advanced computer chips that Qualcomm produces. The company\u2019s chips are now common in smartphones, but they also serve as the basis of next-generation 5G systems, vast networks of sensors that may soon govern the function of everything from autonomous vehicles to smart power grids and manufacturing systems. Qualcomm is locked in competition with China\u2019s Huawei for dominance of this new industry.The emergence of this technology means that, for the Trump administration, national security is no longer confined to airplanes, tanks and weapons systems. Since these chips allow companies to collect vast amounts of information, control critical infrastructure and know the location of people and objects in real time, foreign ownership could pose an unprecedented security threat.The administration\u2019s focus on Qualcomm\u2019s technology may be partially of the company\u2019s own making. Earlier this year, the company asked the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which evaluates foreign acquisitions for national security threats, to intervene as it faced a hostile takeover attempt by Singapore-based Broadcom.Daniel H. Rosen, a partner at the research firm Rhodium Group, said policymakers worldwide are just now discovering that using foreign technology creates vulnerabilities that have outpaced governments\u2019 ability to manage them.\u201cThis is not just a China-U.S. phenomenon, but a matter of things which just a few years ago we thought were relatively benign now being weaponized in ways that we haven\u2019t anticipated,\u201d he said.But trying to clamp down on Chinese products and investment flowing into the United States could be more painful for American companies that depend on access to partners and markets around the world than for their Chinese counterparts.While China has already threatened tariffs of its own on United States products, it has other ways to retaliate \u2014 most notably, making life difficult for the many American businesses that depend on the country to source products or sell to China\u2019s growing middle class.For Qualcomm, that may already be happening. Its plan to expand its business into technology-connected vehicles depends in large part on acquiring a Dutch firm, NXP Semiconductors, for $44 billion. The deal has been approved by every government except for China, whose regulators have asked for more time to assess any antitrust violations.On Thursday, Gao Feng, a spokesman for China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce, said that the acquisition could have a \u201cprofound\u201d impact on the technology industry but that the plan Qualcomm submitted to the regulator on how it would mitigate market competition issues would not be enough.Many observers believe that China is using the review as leverage to exert pressure on the United States, which sees Qualcomm\u2019s success as critical to American dominance in 5G.\u201cAt a time when there is so much trade friction, Chinese regulators don\u2019t necessarily need to stall the deal. They just need to continue postponing the review,\u201d said Guan Zhisheng, an associate professor of economics at Sun Yat-sen University.If trade tensions between the United States and China continue, American companies \u2014 especially those that use China as a platform to export to the United States \u2014 could see themselves embroiled in more time-consuming regulatory reviews revolving around pricing, monopoly power, food and drug safety, or bribery, Mr. Gilholm of Control Risks said. \u201cThat is another potentially very powerful front in this that China has not really used yet,\u201d he said.Qualcomm\u2019s bottom line is also likely to be hurt by American efforts to target the Chinese. On Monday, the United States government said it was placing a seven-year ban on exports of American products to Chinese telecom firm ZTE, after the company made false statements to the government as part of an investigation into possible violations of American sanctions.Jeff Fieldhack, research director at Counterpoint Technology Market Research, said this will be a considerable blow to the company, which provided chips for more than half of the roughly 45 million smartphones that ZTE sold globally last year. Qualcomm declined to comment.Qualcomm has found itself under an increasingly uncomfortable spotlight in China in recent years. By 2013, the company was deriving more revenue from China than any other market, just as the Chinese government began expressing concern that its companies were forced to depend on the network infrastructure of American technology giants like Qualcomm and Cisco.In late 2013, Chinese government investigators raided the Beijing and Shanghai offices of Qualcomm. After a 15-month investigation, regulators handed the company a record $975 million fine and declared Qualcomm a monopoly. The firm was forced to slash prices and pledge to move more of its sophisticated manufacturing to China and help boost the technological abilities of Chinese companies. Today, a growing chorus of American companies have complained that China has pressured them into sharing their technology in similar ways.If China wanted to retaliate, Mr. Fang said, the simplest option would be to emulate American actions toward Huawei. \u201cThey could ban products from Qualcomm, Intel and Cisco in government, infrastructure and other areas of the market, based on security concerns,\u201d he added.In targeting Qualcomm, China could be seeking to influence the Trump administration by putting pressure on a company that has been politically connected in the United States, often serving as an unofficial liaison between the countries.Over the years, Qualcomm has lobbied the United States government to further its interests in China, at one point helping to pave the way for China to join the World Trade Organization. In the late 1990s, Clinton administration officials pushed China to adopt American standards for mobile phones on behalf of Qualcomm.But Qualcomm\u2019s ability to influence the White House is unclear: The Trump administration has focused on recruiting American companies to build up their businesses domestically, not encouraging them to go abroad.\u201cYes, the Chinese have a way to squeeze Qualcomm to really hurt their China revenue, and yes, Qualcomm has fought a lot of battles in the U.S. government arena,\u201d said Derek Scissors, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cThe one weakness in the Chinese approach is it\u2019s not clear the Trump administration cares about how much U.S. firms make in China.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the title of Guan Zhisheng. He is an associate professor at Sun Yat-sen University, not an assistant professor. It also misstated the location of NXP Semiconductors.

{"Headline": "G.E. Makes a Sharp \u2018Pivot\u2019 on Digital", "Date": "2018-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLast November, Mr. Flannery told investors that expenses at GE Digital would be cut this year by more than 25 percent, or about $400 million. While he insisted the digital initiatives at G.E. are \u201cvery key\u201d to the company, he added, \u201cwe want a much more focused strategy.\u201dBut the rethinking of GE Digital, with its future still under review by Mr. Flannery, points to the difficulty of producing modern software for industrial businesses as they adopt digital technology.No one disputes the overarching vision of the so-called industrial internet of things \u2014 which includes low-cost sensors and a flood of data and clever software that should deliver insights to cut costs, conserve fuel and design better products, faster. But the company greatly underestimated the challenges of creating all the software needed to achieve that grand vision, said analysts and former G.E. managers.G.E.\u2019s technical prowess, they said, lies in designing and manufacturing big machines like power-plant turbines, jet engines and medical-imaging equipment. Its traditional software skills have been in the specialized programs that control the machines and factory operations. GE Digital was a striking departure into cloud-based internet software, data analytics and artificial intelligence tools like machine learning.\u201cG.E. reached too far outside its expertise and too fast,\u201d said Steven Winoker, an analyst at UBS. \u201cAnd it became a financial black hole.\u201dG.E.\u2019s digital effort dates to 2011, when Mr. Immelt recruited William Ruh, an executive at Cisco Systems. Later that year, the company set up a center in San Ramon, Calif., east of San Francisco. At the time, Mr. Ruh announced big plans to hire as many as 400 software engineers to write code for the industrial internet.The San Ramon work force swelled sharply to 1,400 in the summer of 2016, and to a peak of 2,000 last summer \u2014 before coming down to about 1,800, after a round of cuts earlier this year.During the buildup, G.E. recruited veteran software managers who had worked at leading tech companies, including Google, Microsoft and Apple. With the cuts at GE Digital and its narrowed focus, some of them have departed.The product plan later broadened to include a cloud-based software platform for handling all kinds of sensor and machine data, and secure communications from the factory floor to data centers. G.E. even built its own data centers.The software platform under development was often referred to as an operating system for the industrial internet. When the product concept expanded, so did the Predix brand.Today, according to former G.E. engineers, Predix has been pared back to mainly a set of software tools to help write applications rather than being connected to layers of code for automating data analysis.The priority at GE Digital is now on selling products for specific industrial applications, sold as offerings in the \u201cPredix portfolio,\u201d and tailored for G.E.\u2019s roster of existing industrial customers. Less emphasis is being put on all-purpose software for the wider industrial world.In an interview, Mr. Ruh described the change at GE Digital as \u201ca pivot\u201d rather than a retreat. \u201cWe\u2019re still 1,000 percent behind our Predix portfolio,\u201d he said.The current strategy, Mr. Ruh said, \u201cis about industrial apps\u201d like those. It is a measured, step-by-step approach but one, Mr. Ruh said, that capitalizes on G.E.\u2019s strengths \u2014 its industry knowledge and deep customer relationships \u2014 and is lifting sales.GE Digital remains a large player in an increasingly crowded field of companies offering industrial internet software of various kinds, in different market niches. The entrants include the big cloud suppliers like Amazon, Microsoft and Google; major business software companies like Oracle, SAP, IBM and SAS Institute; G.E.\u2019s industrial peers such as Siemens, Honeywell and ABB; and start-ups like C3 IoT, Uptake and FogHorn Systems.The opportunity for G.E., analysts said, centers on its longstanding relationships with customers and selling to them. And so far, only 8 percent of its industrial customers are using Predix portfolio products, the company said.The New York Power Authority, the nation\u2019s largest state-owned utility, is one of them. The utility is working with GE Digital to build apps that improve the efficiency of its power generation and distribution network. In pilot projects, the partnership has saved or avoided $3 million in costs, said Gil Quiniones, chief executive of the state power authority. The goal is $500 million in savings over the next decade.But for a technology project to help its customers reduce energy consumption, the state authority went with a start-up, C3 IoT.Brian Hurst, chief analytics officer at Exelon Utilities, a large electric utility corporation based in Chicago, is also working on early-stage projects with GE Digital. Mr. Hurst said the progress was encouraging and he saw no evidence that the cuts at GE Digital had affected their joint work.But it is something he is watching closely. \u201cThe technology is moving so fast,\u201d Mr. Hurst said. \u201cToday\u2019s players may not be tomorrow\u2019s players.\u201dGE Digital, Mr. Ruh insisted, is building a business for the long term. Revenue from the Predix portfolio products reached $550 million last year, he said, and sales are growing rapidly. GE Digital\u2019s total revenue of $4 billion also includes all of G.E.\u2019s traditional industrial software, and the unit\u2019s global work force is more than 4,000.\u201cOur approach is heads-down,\u201d Mr. Ruh said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to show you success.\u201dFor his part, Mr. Flannery has consistently declared his support for G.E.\u2019s digital-industrial vision \u2014 but that does not guarantee the future for GE Digital. Mr. Flannery is selling off businesses to streamline the company. The lighting and railway locomotive divisions are up for sale, and others could follow.A smaller G.E. might not need a stand-alone digital unit. Some analysts recommend putting all the software in the industrial divisions, like power and aviation, closer to customers.\u201cSan Ramon shouldn\u2019t exist,\u201d said Scott Davis, chief executive of Melius Research, an independent financial analysis firm.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Firms Sign \u2018Digital Geneva Accord\u2019 Not to Aid Governments in Cyberwar", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe principles, which have been circulating among senior executives in the tech industry for weeks, also commit the companies to come to the aid of any nation on the receiving end of such attacks, whether the motive for the attack is \u201ccriminal or geopolitical.\u201d Although the list of firms agreeing to the accord is lengthy, several companies have declined to sign on at least for now, including Google, Apple and Amazon.Perhaps as important, none of the signers come from the countries viewed as most responsible for what Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president, called in an interview \u201cthe devastating attacks of the past year.\u201d Those came chiefly from Russia, North Korea, Iran and, to a lesser degree, China.The impetus for the effort came largely from Mr. Smith, who has been arguing for several years that the world needs a \u201cdigital Geneva Convention\u201d that sets norms of behavior for cyberspace just as the Geneva Conventions set rules for the conduct of war in the physical world. Although there was some progress in setting basic norms of behavior in cyberspace through a United Nations-organized group of experts several years ago, the movement has since faltered.Mr. Smith said over the weekend that the first move needed to come from the American companies that often find themselves acting as the \u201cfirst responders\u201d when cyberattacks hit their customers. \u201cThis has become a much bigger problem, and I think what we have learned in the past few years is that we need to work together in much bigger ways,\u201d Mr. Smith said in an interview. \u201cWe need to approach this in a principled way, and if we expect to get governments to do that, we have to start with some principles ourselves.\u201dYet not all governments are likely to embrace the \u201cCybersecurity Tech Accord\u201d in part because the principles it espouses can run headlong into their own, usually secret efforts to develop cyberweapons.Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor who leaked documents about surveillance programs, revealed pictures suggesting that American officials intercepted some hardware that came out of Cisco Systems, a major manufacturer of the routers and switches that make up the spine of the internet, apparently so the equipment directed traffic back to American intelligence agencies. There is no evidence that Cisco cooperated, but the publication of the photos led some foreign customers to believe that American equipment had been broadly compromised by the N.S.A.Cisco is one of the firms that has signed the accord. Mark Chandler, Cisco\u2019s general counsel, said the company believed that \u201cwe need to say we will not be part of any effort that will undermine the security of the web, or undermine those who depend on it \u2014 our customers.\u201d Among the other signatories were Dell, Juniper Networks, the two parts of the recently-split Hewlett-Packard, Symantec and FireEye. Two foreign firms, Telephonica of Spain and Nokia of Finland, also signed. There are no Chinese or Russian companies on the list of initial signatories.The new technology accord vows that the 31 signers \u201cwill protect against tampering with and exploitation of technology products and services during their development, design, distribution and use.\u201d Among the companies that signed are Oracle, Symantec, FireEye and HP, along with the Finnish company Nokia and the Spanish company Telef\u00f3nica.The cybersecurity coordinator at the White House, Rob Joyce, is widely rumored to be considering leaving his post and returning to the National Security Agency, where he ran the most elite of the cyberforces that attack foreign networks. If Mr. Joyce departs, the White House will have lost its two most senior, and most knowledgeable, cybersecurity policymakers in the span of a few weeks.An earlier version of this story incorrectly referred to the name of one of the signatories on the technology accord. It is Juniper Networks, not Juniper Systems.Advertisement"}
