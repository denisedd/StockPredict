{"Headline": "Rhodesia\u2019s Dead \u2014 but White Supremacists Have Given It New Life Online", "Date": "2018-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt WarIn the sepia-toned photo, two white soldiers patrol on foot over brush and rocky ground. Lean and bearded, they carry what appear to be Belgian rifles, and they wear an unusual uniform \u2014 cloth jungle hats, short shorts and tennis shoes \u2014 associated with a military unit that was disbanded nearly 40 years ago.That unit was called the Selous Scouts, a special-forces regiment from the Rhodesian Army, which fought black insurgent armies in the Bush War of the 1960s and \u201970s to maintain white-minority rule over territory that is now Zimbabwe.Not long after Rhodesia ceased to exist, it became morally untenable to mourn its disappearance. As the rest of the world woke up to the injustices of Western colonialism and its system of white-minority governments, the Selous Scouts and their cause became taboo.But late last year, the image of two Scouts began to circulate on Instagram, part of a social-media resurgence of Rhodesia as a source of inspiration. Photos of soldiers marching through grassland and rivers, special-forces units jumping out of helicopters and civilians posing in front of their homes with rifles collected hundreds, sometimes thousands, of likes on posts seeming to offer tribute to a hardened and forgotten cadre of Cold War-era bush fighters. The online movement also caught the attention of opportunistic apparel marketers who started selling Rhodesian-themed T-shirts, posters and patches, among other collectibles.Nostalgia for Rhodesia has since grown into a subtle and profitable form of racist messaging, with its own line of terminology, hashtags and merchandise, peddled to military-history fans and firearms enthusiasts by a stew of far-right provocateurs.In conversations and email exchanges with The New York Times, some prominent social-media figures and companies selling Rhodesia-themed merchandise denied trafficking in white-power messages, or said they had done so unwittingly. A few said their affinity for Rhodesia derived from the government\u2019s supposed anticommunist stance.Demand for Rhodesian-themed apparel has since increased. Today one retailer, the Commissar Clothing Company, offers \u201cMake Zimbabwe Rhodesia Again\u201d hoodies and T-shirts and others that read \u201cBe a Man Among Men,\u201d a Rhodesian Army recruiting slogan now used by hate groups. The online store was taken down in March, but its merchandise is still available on the company\u2019s eBay storefront.Commissar goes further, offering shirts that say \u201cSlot Floppies,\u201d a phrase that is sometimes used as a hashtag on Instagram and other social media platforms to promote Rhodesian-themed posts and messaging. \u201cFloppy,\u201d in 1970s Rhodesia, was the equivalent of an unprintable racist epithet in the United States, while \u201cslot\u201d was Rhodesian military slang for \u201cshoot.\u201dWhen The Times asked Instagram whether #MakeZimbabweRhodesiaAgain and other hashtags violated community standards, the social-media company issued this statement: \u201cWe have blocked these hashtags for violating our hate-speech policies,\u201d it said, \u201cand they will no longer be searchable on Instagram.\u201dIf such symbols and slogans, for a North American audience, lack the instant shock effect of a Confederate or Nazi flag, that is part of the point. Commissar Clothing\u2019s website, now shuttered, explained its products\u2019 wink-and-nod appeal: \u201cWe think you should be able to tell the world about you without saying a word,\u201d it read. \u201cThe great thing about most of our designs is that they are essentially inside jokes and references that the general public will not understand.\u201dWhen reached by email, Commissar Clothing\u2019s owner, Alexander Smyth, said, \u201cI do not support or condone racism of any sort.\u201dThe online apparel company FireForce Ventures, whose website is registered to the Canadian Army reservist Henry Lung, offers reproduction Rhodesian flags, recruiting posters and various patches of the Rhodesian security forces. Lung, who is of Chinese descent, told The Times, \u201cI see the veteran community, the Rhodesian community, as one to be honored,\u201d but insisted that he was not a white supremacist, and that he was \u201cjust trying to make a little bit of extra cash.\u201dHeidi Beirich, head of the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s Intelligence Project, said the uptick of pro-Rhodesian messaging is a purposeful amplification of the ideology and practice of \u201cracist colonial regimes\u201d \u2014 and possibly even an exhortation to war.\u201cAll the talk right now among people in the alt-right and the broader white supremacist movement is about the need for a white ethno-state,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd when you praise Rhodesia, in this context, what you\u2019re praising is violence to that end.\u201d\u201cThere were no defenses for apartheid regimes and colonialism 20 years ago,\u201d Beirich added. \u201cAnd now all of a sudden we\u2019re seeing this stuff pop up.\u201dThe colonial government refused. In 1965 it renamed itself Rhodesia and broke from the United Kingdom with the express purpose of maintaining white rule. The new government was led by Ian Smith, who declared that \u201cthe white man is master of Rhodesia. He has built it, and he intends to keep it.\u201dSmith\u2019s government soon found itself at war with a black insurgency, fighting for representative government and self-rule. Many of the fighters received weapons from China or the Soviet Union. Rhodesia\u2019s government labeled them \u201ccommunists\u201d and \u201cterrorists.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a complicated story,\u201d said Gerald Horne, author of \u201cFrom the Barrel of a Gun\u201d and a professor of history and African-American studies at the University of Houston. \u201cBut of course the apartheid side knew what sold in Washington, so they portrayed it as a battle against communism because it got pulses racing in the United States.\u201dThe battle for perception is playing out again now on social media, which pro-Rhodesia accounts or commenters are using to rewrite Rhodesian history in gentle tones. On Jan. 27, the Instagram page @historicalwarfareinc posted the photo below, claiming it depicted an army officer deciding the fate of a prisoner.The photograph is well known. It was taken in September 1977 by an Associated Press photographer, J. Ross Baughman, who was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for capturing the brutality of the Rhodesian Army.It added: \u201cNcube reportedly later died after three days of brutal, nonstop torture.\u201dAs of April 6, the photo with the more anodyne caption had nearly 1,850 likes.Some pro-Rhodesia voices on social media are not so subtle.Last December Joseph Smith, a 22-year-old resident of Rexburg, Idaho, who told The Times he had not heard of Rhodesia until 18 months ago, posted a YouTube video that he said offered \u201ca quick rundown\u201d of Rhodesian history. The video has received more than 180,000 views.Comments on it included calls for Rhodesia to return, claims that the West betrayed Rhodesia and outright hostility to the idea of black-majority rule. With more than 1,700 comments in just the last three months, the discussion quickly devolved into a stream of racial and ethnic slurs against African-Americans and Jews, calling for them to be shoved into gas chambers and ovens.In an email to The Times, Smith wrote that he felt persecuted and that he has found Rhodesian themes compelling. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware these days being a conservative heterosexual white male is rather unpopular in the eyes of many,\u201d and that \u201cthis is the demographic that caused Rhodesia to thrive as well as it did for as long as it did.\u201dHe insisted, however, that his attraction to Rhodesian nostalgia was not racist. \u201cI do not think that it\u2019s a race issue though,\u201d he wrote. \u201cPartly I just feel like white people like having a team to root for these days.\u201dThe Selous Armory, a Massachusetts apparel company run by Sean Lucht, a Boston firefighter and Marine veteran, sold a red-and-white \u201cMake Zimbabwe Rhodesia Again\u201d patch online until recently. The site also sold T-shirts with sayings like \u201cRhodesians Never Die\u201d and \u201cApply Violence\u201d with the Rhodesian Foreign Legion logo, in addition to \u201cBe a Man Among Men\u201d posters. When The Times reached out to Lucht for comment about the business in March, all the merchandise was stripped from the website and an announcement was published on its home page saying, \u201cThe Selous Armory was always a place for military history/humor and never a place for hate.\u201d The announcement added that the Selous Armory had ceased all operations. Lucht did not respond to numerous requests for comment.The Instagram account of retired Delta Force master sergeant Larry Vickers also displays an affinity for Rhodesia.With roughly 900,000 followers on YouTube, Facebook and Instagram, Vickers \u2014 a marksmanship instructor who says he trains special-operations forces, law enforcement and civilians \u2014 attracts a social-media audience with an interest in military history and firearms.On Instagram, Vickers first publicly professed his fondness for Rhodesian history in September 2014, posting a photo of Rhodesian soldiers returning from a raid. Since 2017, he has shared many photos of Belgian FAL rifles painted in the splotchy yellow-and-green camouflage favored by Rhodesian troops in the Bush War of the 1970s.The caption on one photo from last year expressed reverence: \u201cRespect and remember,\u201d it read. In a telephone interview, Vickers told The Times that his attraction to the Rhodesian security forces stems from their having carried out \u201csome of the most daring special operations missions in history on a shoestring.\u201d He has repeatedly referred to the fall of Rhodesia as \u201cthe greatest tragedy of the post-World War II era.\u201d His own YouTube videos on the Rhodesian rifle have nearly 300,000 page views. Racist comments and calls for racist violence cluttered the comments sections \u2014 until he was asked about them by The Times.The owner of the company, David Selvaggio, said in a telephone interview that he did not know what had been driving recent online interest in Rhodesia. \u201cI\u2019ve been told that yes, there\u2019s young guys getting into it and they\u2019re showing an interest in it. I\u2019m not sure why.\u201dWhen told that the Rhodesian rifle had become a totem for American white supremacists, Selvaggio pleaded ignorance. \u201cWhat I remember of it is seeing pictures of the FALs on the guys over there fighting. I don\u2019t even know what they were fighting, except against communism, from what I was told. Maybe I need to do some studying on my history here.\u201dHe added that he hoped the next Dylann Roof wouldn\u2019t carry one of his company\u2019s rifles. \u201cThat does concern me,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want anybody saying, \u2018Hey, this is a call to arms, and we have to use a FAL, and we\u2019re for this crazy wacko group.\u2019 That\u2019s not us.\u201dFor Beirich, it\u2019s impossible to pay tribute to the Rhodesian security forces and their equipment without also glorifying the ideology the country was built on.\u201cIn the same way you don\u2019t have people glorifying Nazi soldiers without understanding what the regime fought for,\u201d Beirich said. \u201cYou can\u2019t separate fighting for the Confederacy from the ultimate goal of the Confederacy.\u201dJohn Ismay covers armed conflict for The New York Times Magazine out of Washington.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Letter of Recommendation: AliExpress", "Date": "2018-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter of RecommendationShopping online can make you feel like little more than a data set with a bank account. That\u2019s partly because we do it in private, behind screens \u2014 immune to texture and smell, no friends to keep binges in check \u2014 but also because the interactions it facilitates say everything and nothing about us. \u201cLast Chance!\u201d warns the vitamin-subscription ad I once clicked on accidentally. \u201cA romantic getaway?\u201d asks the hotel newsletter, one week post-breakup.But there\u2019s one place on the internet where I feel less like Alice the Bodiless Cursor and more like Alice in Wonderland: AliExpress, the Chinese e-commerce site. Sixty million people spent $10 billion there in 2017, bewildering figures that only begin to make sense once you\u2019ve clicked through 17 pages of direct-from-Guangdong cocktail shakers. AliExpress has just about every product you could imagine, and plenty you probably couldn\u2019t, presented in no particular order. You\u2019ll discover everything from rain galoshes that fit over high heels to motion-activated toilet-seat lights. Shopping there feels like playing croquet with a flamingo or swimming in a pool filled with tears \u2014 bizarre but special, and if you find the right thing, you might feel special, too.AliExpress is not a destination so much as a hobby. While some people watch TV, count their pores or call their grandparents, I spend evenings savoring bot-translated product copy. (\u201cCan lay a beanbag chair ... Makeup nail beauty.\u201d Or perhaps you\u2019d prefer a \u201cFunny Pet High Temperature Wire Wig Hair Cat Exploding Hair Fancy Dog Wig.\u201d) I once uploaded a selfie into the app\u2019s reverse-image search and found that one of my face\u2019s nearest matches was a chaise longue. The chair was made by a company called DAMEDAI Fascinating Store, in Zhejiang Province. DAMEDAI\u2019s products were popular around the world: Its reviews featured praise from Russia, New Zealand, India, the United Arab Emirates and Iceland. Reading them, I wondered how many others were looking at this chair simultaneously, and whether any of their dimples happened to match its beige synthetic-suede folds as precisely as mine.While many websites generate the illusion of intimacy with personalized recommendation lists and curated feeds of familiar brands, AliExpress taps you directly into manufacturing hubs and supply chains \u2014 the sweep of global capitalism itself. Jack Ma, who co-founded the Alibaba Group, AliExpress\u2019s parent company, named it after the character in \u201cOne Thousand and One Nights.\u201d Today its sales are more than six times as large as eBay\u2019s. In addition to AliExpress, it encompasses Alibaba.com, which sells to businesses worldwide; Taobao Marketplace and Tmall, which primarily do business domestically; a film studio; an e-payment app; a grocery chain; Hong Kong\u2019s newspaper of record; and, with Ford, a vending machine that sells cars. Tmall can deliver groceries within hours in Beijing, but if you order something from AliExpress to New York City, it could take months. When it does arrive, the box will be collaged with port stamps, and when you open it, it will emit a chemically smell.In recent years, as Western awareness about AliExpress has grown, websites trying to organize its chaos have emerged. One, Thieve, offers AliExpress listings \u201ccurated by creatives.\u201d Its logo is clean, and its selection of products is blandly chic: velvet throw pillows, geometric planters, leather MacBook accessory pouches. In essence, Thieve is a skin layered atop AliExpress. Of course, all brands are myths, and to shop is to swallow them, trading knowledge for convenience. I\u2019d rather hunt for treasure and make up my own stories about what it means.One night, hours into a Taobao binge, I found a dress on sale for $16, hidden among thousands. It was simple black spandex, with a rough-edged denim belt, sold by a vaguely trend-aware store whose models posed in graffitied streetscapes. The dress in question was worn by a 20-something in maroon lipstick. I scrolled through the photos until I found one of her holding a poster stenciled with the phrase \u201cCapitalism Will Collapse From Within.\u201d I laughed until I cried, then sat quietly for a long time.Later, I spotted the phrase in an artwork by Elmgreen & Dragset, the duo behind Prada Marfa. Perhaps this was simple copy-and-paste luck, refracted through the prisms of international trade and e-commerce until it exposed a sinister truth. AliExpress does portend capitalism\u2019s collapse: Dresses that cost $16 degrade wages and the environment, for the sake of an obscene, always-accelerating demand for cheap stuff. Perusing fidget spinners and flat screens that sell for less than an IUD, you feel as if you\u2019ve been drawn directly into the global churn of goods. It\u2019s thrilling to behold, but a little terrifying too \u2014 like looking at the night sky, into the expanse of the universe.I think of \u201cOne Thousand and One Nights\u201d sometimes while I click through the site. In it, Ali Baba discovers a cave of treasure, but he takes home only a few bags of gold. His brother, Kasim, shows up later with donkeys for an epic raid and is chopped to death by 40 thieves. Ali Baba was able to escape the initial danger because he skimmed just a little off the top of the pile, in awe of its vastness.Alice Hines is a writer in New York City.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "F.D.A. Cracks Down on \u2018Juuling\u2019 Among Teenagers", "Date": "2018-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRecognizing what it called \u201cthe troubling reality\u201d that electronic cigarettes have become \u201cwildly popular with kids,\u201d the Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday announced a major crackdown on the vaping industry, particularly on the trendy Juul devices, aimed at curbing sales to young people.The agency said it had started an undercover sting operation this month targeting retailers of Juuls, including gas stations, convenience stores and online retailers like eBay. So far, the F.D.A. has issued warning letters to 40 that it says violated the law preventing sales of vaping devices to anyone under 21.The agency also demanded that Juul Labs turn over company documents about the marketing and research behind its products, including reports on focus groups and toxicology, to determine whether Juul is intentionally appealing to the youth market despite its statements to the contrary and despite knowing its addictive potential. It said it planned to issue similar letters to other manufacturers of popular vaping products as well.\u201cWe don\u2019t yet fully understand why these products are so popular among youth,\u201d the agency\u2019s commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, said in a statement. \u201cBut it\u2019s imperative that we figure it out, and fast. These documents may help us get there.\u201dIn an emailed statement, Juul Labs said it agreed with the F.D.A. \u201cthat illegal sales of our product to minors is unacceptable.\u201d\u201cWe already have in place programs to identify and act upon these violations at retail and online marketplaces, and we will have more aggressive plans to announce in the coming days,\u201d the company\u2019s statement said. \u201cWe are working with the F.D.A., lawmakers, parents and community leaders to combat underage use, and we will continue working with all interested parties to keep our product away from youth.\u201dDr. Gottlieb said Tuesday\u2019s announcement was the first of several steps the agency would be taking as part of a new Youth Tobacco Prevention Plan to get manufacturers to stop marketing e-cigarettes to young people. It has already convinced eBay to stop listing the products. It also asked Juul to turn over documents related to promotional games and contests, as well as anything related to product design and the appeal or addictive potential for youth.But while the moves pleased some public health advocates and school administrators concerned about the popularity of \u201cJuuling\u201d among adolescents, other groups say they do not make up for the tremendous break Dr. Gottlieb cut the e-cigarette industry last July, when he allowed manufacturers a five-year extension on a rule that would have required them to prove that their products are a safe alternative to traditional cigarettes.The vaping industry had lobbied hard against the rule, arguing that the cost of complying with such regulations would have deterred manufacturers from introducing new products that help adults to quit smoking.Schools and public health advocates contend that the vaping industry is the latest incarnation of Big Tobacco, developing and promoting its products to create new markets for a younger generation. Juul comes in kid-friendly flavors like mango and cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. The labels on other e-cigarette flavorings resemble popular candy brands like Jolly Rancher and Blow Pops.The e-cigarette industry\u2019s political clout has grown as the tobacco giants have taken over the business, which was once limited to small shops and manufacturers. Altria, British American Tobacco, Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris International and Reynolds American all produce e-cigarettes now. In 2017, according to The Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks federal disclosure reports, the tobacco industry spent nearly $22 million on lobbying.Juul Labs told CNBC in October that while it was producing 20 million devices and flavored pods, it could not keep up with demand. Late last year, it raised more than $110 million in private funding, and hired a new chief executive officer from Chobani, manufacturer of the popular Greek yogurt.Juul has come under increasing pressure over the last several weeks as parents and schools have become alarmed over how prevalent the devices are.On Tuesday, the health advocacy groups and lawmakers commended the F.D.A.\u2019s moves, but said the agency must go further and require e-cigarette companies to eliminate flavorings that clearly appeal to youth. They also pushed the F.D.A. again to reverse its July decision.According to the Juul website, the devices create an aerosol rather than using a flame to activate the ingredients. The company says the product produces a level of nicotine similar to a traditional cigarette in order to satisfy cigarette smokers who switch to vaping.Medical researchers say this makes the Juul more addictive for youth.\u201cThis is the definition of a double-edged sword,\u201d said Michael Siegel of Boston University, who studies tobacco use.Because Juul delivers nicotine in a more effective manner, it is appealing for adult smokers who are trying to give up tobacco cigarettes, he said. \u201cThe first time they use it, they feel the nicotine, they\u2019re more likely to stick with it.\u201d But for teenagers, \u201cit\u2019s a bad thing because it really does create the addiction potential that you don\u2019t have with normal electronic cigarettes.\u201d\u201cWhat we used to see is kids would vape together in social settings, it was showing off who could blow the biggest rings,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we\u2019re starting to see kids who literally are showing signs of addiction: They\u2019re using it alone, we\u2019re seeing kids who have to sneak off to the bathroom during the day.\u201d\u201cThey think of it as being just not that big a deal,\u201d said Timothy Hayes, the assistant superintendent for student services at New Trier, the large public high school in the Chicago suburbs. \u201cIt\u2019s not smoke, I\u2019m not inhaling, it\u2019s just water vapor, that\u2019s their thinking.\u201dThe F.D.A. crackdown, he said, could help make the risks clearer. \u201cIt makes public, and makes Juul be public, about the health consequences.\u201dSheila Kaplan contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}

By the time he reaches Page 487 and the last two words of \u201cThe Group\u201d \u2014 \u201cNew York\u201d \u2014 the page will be an inky, illegible mess.\u201cI\u2019m coming at this from the perspective of the visual artist who\u2019s interested in how text and literature manifest themselves in a visual way,\u201d he said.He is a two-finger typist \u2014 \u201cme and Raymond Chandler,\u201d he said with a chuckle \u2014 but said he did not know how many words per minute he could bang out. \u201cI\u2019m more like a pages-per-hour guy,\u201d he said. \u201cI generally have to get 25 pages done in a day.\u201d Five pages an hour is a good pace, he said.He does not work in a writer\u2019s garret. On good days last week, he set himself up under a London plane tree that was already a campus landmark in McCarthy\u2019s day. His desk was a folding table that he hauled around the campus on a hand truck.Mr. Youd is not like a pianist who tosses off a few scales first thing in the morning: He does not bother with warm-up exercises before he sits down at the typewriter. Practice sentences about crazy brown foxes jumping over lazy dogs are not for him. \u201cI just dive right into it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I\u2019ve just ingested the coffee for the morning and I\u2019m not firing on all cylinders, I\u2019m prone to a few extra typos.\u201dThe typewriter this day was a Remington portable from the late 1920s or early 1930s that he said was just like the machine McCarthy owned when she wrote \u201cThe Group.\u201d He bought it on eBay.\u201cIt\u2019s very primitive,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty unsubstantial machine, compared to where typewriters got to.\u201dHe said he had read \u201cThe Group\u201d before he typed the first word \u2014 which, for the record, was \u201cIt,\u201d with a capital I \u2014 and he admitted to making mistakes as he went along. \u201cYeah, probably one a line,\u201d he said. \u201cI just keep chugging along. I\u2019m earnestly attempting to retype every word, but it\u2019s an exercise in good reading, not good typing.\u201d\u201cThe Group\u201d is not easy going for a typist. The characters\u2019 names are tricky: There are Lakey, Pokey and Dottie, to name only three. There are typo-prone words like \u201cFujiyama\u201d on Page 29, \u201cquerulous grackle\u201d on Page 34 and \u201csteatopygy\u201d on Page 24, which, two lines later, McCarthy explains is \u201cexcessive development of the rump.\u201dMr. Youd has typed on authors\u2019 actual typewriters. In London to retype John Kingsley Orton\u2019s plays, he did a page on Orton\u2019s own machine. But he said he would not do a whole novel on a machine that had belonged to an author.\u201cI\u2019m jamming a beat-up page through there,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it gets all gunked up, I make a mess out of the typewriter.\u201dThis is why he has backup typewriters. \u201cI always have two of the same make and model,\u201d he said, adding that when nothing is available on eBay, \u201cI have a couple of guys out there in the typewriter-collecting world, and I turn to them.\u201dThe first novel he retyped was \u201cFear and Loathing in Las Vegas\u201d by Hunter S. Thompson. \u201cThe reason why I chose him was he typed out \u2018The Sun Also Rises\u2019 and \u2018The Great Gatsby\u2019 to learn how to write fiction early in his writing career,\u201d he said.Mr. Youd smiled as he typed along. Undergraduates passed by. Some seemed to think the museum piece was the typist, not the typewriter. \u201cThis is weird and random, even for Vassar,\u201d said Natalie Silverman, a sophomore from Atherton, Calif. \u201cThey have art installations, but usually it\u2019s statues or pictures to look at \u2014 never a human being sitting there.\u201dJennifer Novak, a junior from Sunnyside, Queens, said she had seen manual typewriters in a museum, \u201cbut never out like this.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s kind of mesmerizing,\u201d she said.Neither of them had read \u201cThe Group.\u201d But Colby Byrne, a senior from Ridgewood, N.J., said he had and had appreciated the references to \u201cplaces I knew.\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t life-changing,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it was fun.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rue St. Denis, Longtime Outfitter to TV and Chic People, Is Closing", "Date": "2018-04-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor 25 years, a time capsule of perfectly preserved clothing in Alphabet City.Once, a man\u2019s suit stood for something \u2014 and stood for it practically upright. \u201cThe structure of a suit back in the \u201980s, the \u201970s, the \u201960s, the \u201950s, is amazing,\u201d said Jean-Paul Buthier, a founder of Rue St. Denis, a vintage store that has been a destination on Avenue B in East Village of Manhattan for 25 years. \u201cThe fabrics, the weight of them, you can\u2019t compare it. Today, there\u2019s a sense of clothing being more comfortable. We don\u2019t want to suffer for fashion as much as we used to. But we are giving up so much for that comfort.\u201d\u201cRight on the corner, by the lamppost,\u201d Mr. Bonechi said. \u201cThey\u2019d sell and then they\u2019d come in the shop. Anything that glittered, they\u2019d say, \u2018I want that! I want that!\u2019\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s good, I like it, and if it\u2019s not good, I don\u2019t like it,\u201d Ms. de Cabrol said, inspecting her reflection in a puffed-out black dress she initially had slipped into backward. \u201cI don\u2019t care about a label.\u201d The dress turned out to be by Claude Montana.Nearby was Tom Broecker, a costume designer for \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d arms full. \u201cI\u2019m stockpiling for any possible idea that could ever come my way,\u201d he said.They had both been charmed by vintage and shopping at thrift stores as kids \u2014 \u201cAgainst my mother\u2019s wishes,\u201d Mr. Bonechi said \u2014 and eventually set up a stand at the Columbus Avenue flea market in 1988. That stand became an Amsterdam Avenue store and, eventually, the Avenue B shop: a present-proofed, seven-day-a-week refuge from the current moment.Mr. Buthier oversaw the collection, going on buying trips across America and France and ferrying goods back and forth to a warehouse in Philadelphia where he keeps and catalogs (mostly by memory) 40,000 pieces. Mr. Bonechi ruled the store, sizing up customers with a glance. Rue St. Denis traffics in the everyday goods of an earlier era, purchased mostly from retired store owners and wholesalers, whose shingles have been taken down but whose stock often sits in attics and shuttered storefronts. (The children of these retired shopkeepers, Mr. Buthier finds, are easier to negotiate with than their parents, who are parting with their legacy.)There are those who still dress like the swans and swains time forgot, but some of Rue St. Denis\u2019s most devoted customers are professionals. Fashion designers and their teams are regulars, searching for inspiration. Kris Van Assche, the artistic director of Berluti (and formerly Dior Homme), came for the men\u2019s suits, Mr. Bonechi said; a team of designers from Lacoste recently took over the shop for a private appointment. Even more devoted are the costume designers of the film and television industry, where period pieces require period clothes, in pristine condition and often in multiples. \u201cIf someone gets killed, you need a double or a triple,\u201d said Anna Terrazas, a costume designer who has worked on gritty period dramas like \u201cThe Deuce,\u201d where fake-blood spatter is not unheard-of.\u201cEvery store that closes is one less we can go to,\u201d he said. \u201cAs designers, we want to build these relationships. The interactions in the store are so important.\u201dBut on Thursday, it was a night for celebration, not sadness. Mr. Bonechi, in an Italian suit from 1972, was showing off a brown suede pair of Gucci boots in their original box, searching for a slim-ankled princess who could fit into them.\u201cEverything\u2019s Cinderella in here,\u201d Mr. Bonechi said with a laugh. \u201cWhen it fits, it\u2019s a Cinderella story.\u201dAdvertisement"}
