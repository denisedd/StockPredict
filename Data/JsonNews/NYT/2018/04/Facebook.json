But by then he had already absorbed many hits to the head during eight years of Pop Warner football and one year playing as a high school freshman.By 2014, Ms. Archie\u2019s son, Paul Bright Jr., was 24, and had done something out of character, his mother said: He bought a motorcycle off Craigslist, despite having no riding experience. He fixed it up, and rode it fast without a license or insurance. On Labor Day that year he T-boned another vehicle and died.An examination of her son\u2019s brain revealed previous damage to its frontal lobe, and he was found to have chronic traumatic encephalopathy, more commonly known as C.T.E.Now, California state lawmakers are being asked to bar children under 12 from playing organized tackle football \u2014 a requirement supporters say will protect their brains from unnecessary injury and trauma. Ms. Archie, who had been working to make sports safer long before her son\u2019s death, supports the bill, but thinks the age limit should be pushed even higher.\u201cIf I\u2019m wrong there is going to be less brain-injury exposure,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they\u2019re wrong, kids can die.\u201d\u201cOver my son\u2019s dead body,\u201d Ms. Archie said, \u201cwill it not pass.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Officials at the Los Angeles Tourism & Convention Board have done the focus groups, and they\u2019ve come up with a controversial conclusion.\u201cThe younger generations living in New York love Los Angeles,\u201d Don Skeoch, the board\u2019s chief marketing office said in an email. \u201cThis is not fake news, we promise.\u201dThe New York-specific ads will run through the end of May, officials say.

{"Headline": "Hope in Arizona", "Date": "2018-04-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistPhoenix \u2014 On Tuesday, there\u2019s a special election in Arizona\u2019s Eighth Congressional District, which Donald Trump won by 21 percentage points. It\u2019s to replace Trent Franks, the abortion opponent who resigned amid reports that he tried to create his own personal version of \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d by pressuring female employees to serve as gestational surrogates.On Thursday, public schoolteachers in Arizona, among the lowest paid in the country, are planning to walk out, following the lead of teachers in West Virginia, Oklahoma and Kentucky. For 15 years, \u201cwe\u2019ve continued to get cut and cut and cut,\u201d Theresa Ratti, who teaches high school in Mesa, told me. \u201cMy A.P. government textbook that I teach from, the new president is George W. Bush.\u201dThese two events \u2014 an unexpectedly competitive Eighth District election and a rare labor action by teachers \u2014 are connected. Partly this is because Lesko is a villain to many local champions of public education. I met Ratti as she prepared to go canvassing for Tipirneni; she told me, \u201cLesko has been an advocate of vouchers and privatization and pretty much anything she can do to destroy the public school system.\u201dBut there\u2019s a deeper link. Both the walkout and the surprising viability of Tipirneni\u2019s campaign are manifestations of the explosive activist energy, particularly among women, set off by the catastrophe of Trump\u2019s election. Since Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat, \u201ccollege-educated women have ramped up their political participation en masse,\u201d the historian Lara Putnam and the political scientist Theda Skocpol wrote in a recent article, \u201cMiddle America Reboots Democracy.\u201d It\u2019s this civic renewal that is transforming politics in Arizona.Save Our Schools, a prominent grass-roots organization supporting the walkout, is an outgrowth of an Arizona group called Stronger Together, which itself is a spinoff of the pro-Hillary Clinton Facebook group Pantsuit Nation. Dawn Penich-Thacker, one of the founders of Save Our Schools, once served as a public affairs officer for the Army, and compared the relationships among the state\u2019s newly minted activists to the bonding she experienced in the military. \u201cIt\u2019s the deepest friendship,\u201d she said.She introduced me to Jaclyn Boyes, whom she met when Boyes started a petition demanding that Arizona\u2019s Republican senator Jeff Flake hold a town hall. After Trump\u2019s election, Boyes told me, she had the desolate sense that \u201chalf of my country doesn\u2019t like me because I\u2019m black.\u201dShe joined a chapter of Indivisible, a nationwide resistance organization, which has focused on recruiting and training Democratic precinct committeemen, the people who link their neighborhoods to the party. Steven Slugocki, chairman of the Democratic Party in Maricopa County, which includes the Eighth District, told me that before the election, Republicans had more than 3,000 precinct committeemen in the county, and Democrats only 600. Since 2016, he said, the Democrats\u2019 total has grown to 1,700.Even with this new infrastructure, local activists realize that winning on Tuesday is a long shot. Unlike the pro-Trump district that the Democrat Conor Lamb won in Pennsylvania, Arizona\u2019s Eighth has no Democratic roots. It\u2019s both very white and, because of a high concentration of retirees, very old.Nor is it clear how long progressive enthusiasm can sustain the teachers\u2019 walkout. Arizona has little tradition of union activism, and teachers I spoke to are worried about public support.But whatever happens this week, politics in Arizona, which Trump won by a mere 3.5 percentage points and which is key to the Democratic dream of retaking the Senate, is changing fast. Though our national politics remains a horror show, here, among so many indefatigable women, it\u2019s easy to be hopeful.Tipirneni \u2014 also inspired to enter the political fray by the shock of Trump\u2019s election \u2014 insisted that she\u2019s optimistic about Tuesday. \u201cSomething is happening here,\u201d she told me.Even if she comes up short, the work she\u2019s done to build up the Democratic Party in her district will have a lasting impact, she said: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be incredible to see what Arizona looks like after November.\u201dDavid Brooks is off today.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018You Are the Product\u2019: Targeted by Cambridge Analytica on Facebook", "Date": "2018-04-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChristopher Deason stumbled upon the psychological questionnaire on June 9, 2014. He was taking a lot of online surveys back then, each one earning him a few dollars to help pay the bills. Nothing about this one, which he saw on an online job platform, struck him as \u201ccreepy or weird,\u201d he said later.So at 6:37 that evening, Mr. Deason completed the first step of the survey: He granted access to his Facebook account.Less than a second later, a Facebook app had harvested not only Mr. Deason\u2019s profile data, but also data from the profiles of 205 of his Facebook friends. Their names, birth dates and location data, as well as lists of every Facebook page they had ever liked, were downloaded \u2014 without their knowledge or express consent \u2014 before Mr. Deason could even begin reading the first survey question.The information was added to a huge database being compiled for Cambridge Analytica, the political data firm with links to Donald J. Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. None of the people whose data was collected knew it had happened, not even Mr. Deason. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would have gone forward with it if I had,\u201d Mr. Deason, 27, said in a recent interview.But The Times, which has viewed a set of raw data from the profiles that Cambridge Analytica paid an academic researcher to obtain, contacted nearly two dozen affected Facebook users in recent weeks. Some were angry \u2014 one woman compared it to being robbed \u2014 while others were annoyed but unsurprised, having grown cynical about tech giants\u2019 use of the data they collect. They are some of the first known affected Facebook users to be publicly identified. And nearly all said the misuse of their data had given them second thoughts about staying on Facebook.\u201cI\u2019ve come to grips with the fact that you are the product on the internet,\u201d said Mark Snyder, 32, who lives in Pompano Beach, Fla., and was among Mr. Deason\u2019s friends whose data was collected.\u201cIf you sign up for anything and it isn\u2019t immediately obvious how they\u2019re making money, they\u2019re making money off of you,\u201d said Mr. Snyder, who maintains computer networks for a living.Until April 2015, Facebook allowed some app developers to collect some private information from the profiles of users who downloaded apps, and from those of their friends. Facebook has said it allowed this kind of data collection to help developers improve the \u201cin-app\u201d experience for users. But Facebook appears to have done little to verify how developers were using the data or whether they were providing any kind of experience on Facebook at all.The questionnaire used to collect data for Cambridge Analytica was not actually on Facebook. It was hosted by a company called Qualtrics, which provides a platform for online surveys. It consisted of dozens of questions often used by psychology researchers to assess personality, such as whether the respondent prefers to be alone, tries to lead others and loves large parties (the answer choices range from \u201cdisagree strongly\u201d to \u201cagree strongly\u201d). The questionnaire took about 10 to 20 minutes to complete.Facebook has said that people who took the quiz were told that their data would be used only for academic purposes, claiming that it and its users were misled by Cambridge Analytica and the researcher it hired, Aleksandr Kogan, a 28-year-old Russian-American academic. But the fine print that accompanied the questionnaire may have told users that their data could be used for commercial purposes, according to a draft of the survey\u2019s terms of service that was reviewed by The Times.Selling users\u2019 Facebook data would have been an outright violation of the company\u2019s rules at the time. Yet the company does not appear to have regularly checked to make sure that apps complied with its rules. And the final wording of the survey\u2019s terms of service is now most likely unknowable: Facebook executives said they deleted the app in December 2015 when they found out about the data harvesting.The uproar over Cambridge Analytica\u2019s misuse of the data has added to questions Facebook was already confronting over the use of its platform by those seeking to spread Russian propaganda and fake news.\u201cCambridge Analytica is the big story on the topic, but there have been numerous stories about Facebook either selling user data or giving third parties access and using it to help advertising,\u201d Mr. Deason said.He was especially irked by the ways Facebook and other social media directed advertisements based on what users posted or viewed online.If he recommends, say, a Dell laptop to a friend, he said, \u201cI go to the next page on Facebook and there\u2019s a Dell ad.\u201d\u201cThat bothers me,\u201d he said.Mr. Deason, who runs a computer business in Roanoke, Va., is probably among Facebook\u2019s more tech-savvy users. He is keeping his account open for now because his business has its own page and he moderates Facebook groups dedicated to computers.\u201cBut if I were just working my 9-to-5 at the local bank or whatever, and coming home and getting on Facebook to check on my friends and whatnot, yeah, I would delete Facebook,\u201d he said.Many people who took the survey do not have a background in technology, including Jim Symbouras, 56, a municipal worker in New York City.His data was collected dozens of times after 52 of his Facebook friends were directed to the psychological questionnaire, many by a site called Swagbucks. The site lets people earn gift cards to Amazon and other retailers in exchange for taking surveys or watching video advertisements.Mr. Symbouras does not personally know any of the Facebook friends who granted the app access to his data. He met them in Facebook groups where Swagbucks users traded tips for finding good deals.Amy Risner, 52, of Collinwood, Tenn., was one of those Facebook friends. Ms. Risner, who does not work full time, vaguely recalled the questionnaire \u2014 \u201cIt was real long, that\u2019s what I remember\u201d \u2014 but was certain she never saw any notice that her data or that of her friends would be collected.\u201cIf it would have said anything like that about taking my information \u2014 my personal information \u2014 I would have backed out of it and not done it,\u201d Ms. Risner said.Facebook, though, is a tough habit to kick. Asked if she was thinking about deleting her account, Ms. Risner said, \u201cI\u2019m just too nosy to stay off it.\u201dMalachy Browne contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Faces Tough Questions in Britain That It Avoided in the U.S.", "Date": "2018-04-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe dueling experiences highlight the different approaches taken on both sides of the Atlantic toward oversight of personal data and the social media giants who hold it. While the United States has largely eschewed regulating companies like Facebook, Britain and other countries in Europe have taken more aggressive stances, seeking to make tighter rules to better protect consumer privacy.In London, Facebook\u2019s chief technology officer, Mike Schroepfer, faced more than four hours of questions from a British parliamentary committee over the company\u2019s data-collection techniques, oversight of app developers, fake accounts, political advertising and links to the voter-targeting firm Cambridge Analytica.If American politicians have been lampooned for being Luddites, the British Parliament\u2019s Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee has built a reputation for thoroughness and detailed questioning. Damian Collins, the committee\u2019s chairman, had more than 11 pages of questions for Mr. Schroepfer, including how facial recognition technology is used and the methods Facebook uses to track people even when they are not on the site.\u201cThis is the pipe through which the fake news comes, and there doesn\u2019t seem to be much you can do to control it,\u201d Mr. Collins said.\u201cThe Europeans are far more alert about this problem and far more willing to tackle it than the U.S.,\u201d Stephan Lewandowsky, a cognitive scientist at the University of Bristol who studies how people process misinformation, said in an interview.The parliamentary committee is attempting to punch above its weight. Working out of small hearing room near Big Ben and Westminster Abbey, the panel is composed of 11 members who are mostly rank-and-file members of parliament. It has a staff of about 10 clerks, and little authority beyond being able to summon witnesses \u2014 it can\u2019t write new laws or enforce penalties if it discovers wrongdoing.So far, there has been little of the rancor and political speechifying that takes over high-profile American hearings. The stereotype of British manners was mostly maintained, even during the tensest moments \u2014 lots of \u201cplease,\u201d \u201cthank you,\u201d and sarcasm.\u201cI\u2019m delighted to hear you have a head of integrity,\u201d one member noted dryly when Mr. Schroepfer referred to a colleague in charge of ethics. In criticizing the number of fake accounts on Facebook, another lawmaker wondered why he, an overweight middle-aged man, was getting Facebook invitations from attractive young women.\u201cIt is obvious that this is a serious inquiry and that the committee is doing its homework and asking very detailed questions trying to get to the heart of some complicated problems,\u201d said Justin Hendrix, executive director of NYC Media Lab, a New York-based research group that met with members of the panel this year.The panel has been led by Mr. Collins, a member of the governing Conservative party. The inquiry started as a broad investigation into fake news and how misinformation spreads, and whether those capabilities influenced the 2016 referendum when Britain voted to leave the European Union.As the panel heard from more witnesses, it became more focused on how easily user data from Facebook could be accessed and used for political gain.In a separate interview this week, Mr. Collins talked about his education on the social platform. \u201cI\u2019ve been genuinely surprised by how much data Facebook gathers,\u201d he said, pulling out books he had been reading, including \u201cThe People Vs. Tech,\u201d a critical examination of how social media is influencing society, and \u201cChaos Monkeys,\u201d a memoir by a former Facebook executive.Between television interviews this week, Mr. Collins sat with staff watching a small set as a Canadian parliamentary committee questioned an executive from an online advertising company, Aggregate IQ, that had been involved in the Brexit referendum. When Mr. Collins heard a discrepancy in the testimony, he messaged a member of the Canadian panel. \u201cHe read out my text during the hearing,\u201d Mr. Collins laughed.Aware that he doesn\u2019t have the same financial resources as Facebook and other global tech firms, or even as much as his counterparts across the Atlantic, Mr. Collins has been coordinating his investigation with others around the world. He has been in touch with regulators in France, Germany and Ireland, and even as far afield as Singapore.Mr. Collins plans to publish a report with policy recommendations by this summer.\u201cMany people would look at what\u2019s happened over the past couple of months and say the case for greater regulatory scrutiny of the way the tech companies work would be appropriate,\u201d Mr. Collins said in the interview. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can put that genie back in the bottle now.\u201dOn Thursday, he exited the hearing frustrated, saying Mr. Schroepfer hadn\u2019t fully answered at least 40 questions. He plans to use a \u201cformal summons\u201d to require Mr. Zuckerberg to attend, a rarely deployed legal step.He could be in the area soon. The European Parliament has invited Mr. Zuckerberg to testify as early as next month, though a parliament spokesman said it hasn\u2019t been finalized.An earlier version of this article misstated who was hit by a pie to the face at a hearing before the British Parliament\u2019s Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee. It was Rupert Murdoch, not his son James.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 The will-he-or-won\u2019t-he Trump trade policy\u2022 Will Google become the next target of privacy inquiries?The world needs a way to tell whether President Trump wants to pursue his combative trade policies.The Trump administration has in recent weeks announced a barrage of trade actions. First, Mr. Trump said he was imposing tariffs against steel and aluminum imports from a range of countries. Then came announcements of actions against China that included tariffs on a large number of products.Very few restrictions have come into effect, though. President Trump has allowed temporary exemptions to the steel and aluminum tariffs. The moves against China have to go through a public comment process before they can take place.Investors, executives and farmers who have concerns about the economic impact of the trade actions may like that little has so far happened. And they may hope that Mr. Trump uses the leeway he has under trade law to step back from his threats. But supporters of tougher trade policies will be watching closely to see if Mr. Trump actually carries them out.In the coming months, there are a number of important dates at which the Trump administration has to decide whether it wants to retreat, delay, negotiate, fight on or escalate. To help assess the stance of the United State in this trade standoff, DealBook has compiled these dates.Before looking ahead, it\u2019s important to note that the Trump administration has imposed new restrictions on some countries.Much remains up in the air, though.\u2014 Peter EavisOne of Wall Street\u2019s biggest (and nerdiest) contests is between Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. With each quarter\u2019s earnings, the banks disclose their return on equity, a number that shows the profitability of the equity capital they have deployed in their businesses.Goldman usually wins. From 2010 until 2017, Morgan Stanley\u2019s annual return on equity was stronger in only two of those eight years, and those two years were not good ones for Wall Street overall.A big test was going to be how these banks fared in unambiguously good conditions, like those that existed in the first quarter of this year, when trading activity was strong and the economic outlook bullish. Goldman\u2019s return on equity in the first quarter was 15.4 percent, compared to 14.9 percent for Morgan Stanley.In other words, Goldman clinched the bragging rights. But with some rounding, they both achieved a 15 percent return.\u2014 Peter EavisThe Wall Street firm reported record revenue and profit for the first quarter driven by a jump in trading and the new tax law.\u2022 Morgan Stanley reported profits of $2.58 billion, up 40 percent from a year ago. That also topped analysts\u2019 expectations of $2.2 billion in earnings, according to Thomson Reuters.\u2022 Earnings per share came in at $1.45, beating the $1.25 analysts had expected.\u2022 Revenues increased 13.7 percent to $11.08 billion. Analysts expected revenue of $10.36 billion.\u2022 Total trading revenue rose 26 percent to $4.40 billion.\u2022 Equity trading revenue increased to $2.6 billion, up 30 percent from a year ago\u2022 Fixed-income trading revenue rose 9 percent to $1.8 billion.\u2022 Fees from investment banking rose 7 percent to $1.51 billion.\u2022 Fees from advising on mergers and acquisitions gained 16 percent to $574 million.\u2022 Underwriting revenues rose 2 percent.\u2022 Wealth management revenues increased 8 percent to $2.37 billion.The I.M.F. numbers are just the latest highlighting the negative impact the $1.5 trillion in tax cuts could have on the fiscal outlook of the United States.Fact-check: Despite Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet, South Korea isn\u2019t in the TPP.Facebook has born the brunt of fury over the tech industry\u2019s practices, particularly after the Cambridge Analytica scandal shed light on how user data is shared. But another behemoth\u2019s practices could come under scrutiny, particularly if Democrats take back Congress in the midterm elections.Two years ago, Google altered its offerings in a way that makes it more vulnerable to data-sharing scrutiny. Advertisers using its DoubleClick system to target and measure ads could start anonymously combining web-tracking data (from \u201ccookies\u201d that follow users online) with potent Google information including search queries, location history, phone numbers and credit card information. Until then, Google had steadfastly kept that data separate.Justice Sonia Sotomayor said that Congress, rather than the Supreme Court, should settle the matter. But Chief Justice John Roberts said \u201cit would be very strange for us to tell Congress it ought to do something in any particular area.\u201dThe stakes: The case in question, South Dakota v. Wayfair, could upend a decades-old status quo in online retail \u2014 and bring states some much-needed revenue.More from Nathaniel Popper and Nicholas Confessore of the NYT:The goal of Cambridge Analytica\u2019s own coin offering? Raise money that would pay for the creation of a system to help people store and sell their online personal data to advertisers, Brittany Kaiser, a former Cambridge Analytica employee, said in an interview. The idea was to protect information from more or less what the firm did when it obtained the personal data of up to 87 million Facebook users.The tech flyaroundStock and bond markets are unpredictable, even in good times, so the helpful trading conditions this quarter may not last. What can Goldman\u2019s senior executives offer to persuade investors that the bank far more than a trading house? More explanations, perhaps \u2014 and time.\u201cI\u2019m proud of what we achieved at Yahoo. That said, we had a quickly decaying legacy business.

No. But it certainly isn\u2019t hurting anything. Both actions are positive goods; one has a more personal, immediate impact and the other has a potential to change national policy. Whether you choose to walk out or up doesn\u2019t make you a better or worse person, and who knows? If everyone felt included, maybe school violence will decrease. It is certainly worth trying, especially when large-scale activism, although widely visible, doesn\u2019t seem to be directly resulting in any hard legislation. (Note: You can \u201cwalk up\u201d any day, preferably every day. It isn\u2019t necessarily revolutionary, it\u2019s just a decent thing to do. Why not walk out on the 14th, and walk up on the 15th, 16th\u2026).A student cannot \u201cstop\u201d a school shooter. Psychopaths do not feel empathy for other people, they are callous, cruel, and do not care what others think. They can never be cured of their disorder but can manage it through professional help, which is part of the reason I agree with Ms. Robinson\u2019s views on the situation. Students are not professional counselors and therapists and should not be tasked with the responsibility of being them to unstable kids. Furthermore, Mr. Petty\u2019s #WalkUpNotOut tweet sounds like more of a stand against bullies/a stand for eliminating exclusion than it does against school shooters; kids who fully intend to seriously injure or kill their fellow students. Dealing with a psychopath is different than dealing with a normal bully, for one is solved through anti-bullying campaigns and counseling, while the other requires psychotherapy and (in some extremely serious cases) institutionalization to be contained. The schools we attend have so far failed to identify and give proper treatment to individuals who display psychopathic tendencies and are mentally disturbed.If the government really wants to stop school shootings, they need to provide funding to the necessary departments and programs to carry out these actions AND make it harder for a mentally unstable teenager to get their hands on a gun in America. Until then, I would rather speak up and let my voice be heard, than shut up and quietly hope not to be gunned down in a high school hallway.Treat others the way you want to be treated. That\u2019s the Golden Rule, right? The #WalkUpNotOut movement suggests that being kinder to your classmates can prevent them from becoming violent shooters in the future. I don\u2019t completely believe in the effectiveness of this movement. Of course, we should all be kind and accepting of each other. We shouldn\u2019t leave individuals out and we should never be rude or hostile. But I am taking Ms. Robinson\u2019s side: victims of school shooters should not be blamed for that person\u2019s actions. How can you justify the deaths of thousands of children by accusing staff and students of being \u201cmean\u201d to the shooter in his/her youth?Ryan Petty tweeted that walk outs are nothing more than exercise. These same walk outs are catching the eyes of the media, public officials, global citizens. They consist of students making their voices heard, talking to their national leaders. To me, that is more than just getting \u201cexercise\u201d. So yes, you should \u201cwalk up\u201d to the student eating alone in the cafeteria, but you shouldn\u2019t be held accountable for a mass tragedy just because you didn\u2019t.I struggle to understand how the father of one of the victims of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School would create the hashtag #WalkUpNotOut that, despite with good intentions, essentially blames students, like his daughter, for the massacre that occurred in February.The hashtag dismisses the cry of thousands of terrified students calling for action from their leaders to restrict the access to weapons in this country. I don\u2019t promote bullying or exclusion, but they shouldn\u2019t be used as the form of justification for the motivation for tragedies like this. The advocacy of kindness should be continuous, and not highlighted when fourteen students have lost their lives to an armed fellow student. Students should be kind because they are simply kind people, being taught and mentored by adults who exemplify kindness often.As a student, I never want to express kindness because I\u2019m trying to prevent being shot one day in class. This is why we are choosing to walk out. We cannot be sure that walking up will cure the serious issues that lie within the hearts and minds of certain students. We can be sure that walking out will make it harder for those students to obtain deadly weapons will prevent the creation of hashtags in the first place. While inclusion and kindness are positive things, the most effective action, the action that students want to witness the most, is the urgency and concern of our lawmakers to keep weapons out of dangerous hands.I think the #WalkUpNotOut movement started with good intentions, but the idea that this could have been prevented by students at the school being nicer to the shooter, is victim blaming, and utterly disproved by Isabelle Robinson\u2019s story. She takes issue with it for the same reason I do. \u201cThe idea that we are to blame for the murders of our friends and teachers is a slap in the face to all Stoneman Douglas victims and survivors,\u201d she says, and I agree. Saying that this horrible, traumatizing event is because of the victims\u2019 failure to \u2018be nicer\u2019 is just another way for people to ignore the fact that there is something deeply wrong with our country right now.\u2026 Should we be nicer to people and stand up for others? Yes! But can kind words stop a bullet? No, they can\u2019t. The issue of school shootings is so complex it probably won\u2019t have one solution. We need to support the victims in this troubling time, not tell them the trauma is their fault.#walkupnotout seems to me a means of shaming and silencing protesters trying to see change in policy. Those behind it say that if we were just a little nicer to others, maybe they wouldn\u2019t kill us. This tag puts the blame on victims of gun violence and shames them.Do we tell victims of domestic violence they should have been nicer to their partner? Or victims of child abuse that they should have been more respectful towards their parents? From Isabelle Robinson\u2019s account, we know Nikolas Cruz was a violent, cruel, and unkind person, who despite his disposition, had friends, and despite having friends, attacked those at his school, before and during the shooting. There are billions of people on Earth who have experienced isolation, trauma, depression, anger, rejection, and any other negative experience imaginable. Only very few of us become as violent as the perpetrator of the Stoneman Douglas shooting. If we want to prevent these violent people from harming others, we should invest more into school counselors and students\u2019 mental health. These situations should never be placed on the backs of victims.Ryan Petty is right. A march will without a doubt show support and spread awareness of a vital issue- but will it really help? I don\u2019t think so. That said, I think that a \u201cwalkup\u201d won\u2019t help much either.As Isabelle Robins says, \u201cthe idea that we are to blame, even implicitly, for the murders of our friends and teachers is a slap in the face to all Stoneman Douglas victims and survivors.\u201d If someone could have managed to befriend Nikolas Cruz, it wouldn\u2019t have done a thing. The fault lies within the legal system, and with our schools. No 19 year old, especially one who has received treatment for an existing mental illness, should ever be able to legally purchase a semi-automatic rifle \u2014 I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s used for hunting, because it shouldn\u2019t be. That\u2019s where our legal system failed Stoneman Douglas.\u2026 The #WalkUpNotOut movement is just another useless cause taking away from the real issue at hand. Something needs to be done, and it\u2019s much greater than a march or a change in attitude towards your peers.I do not agree with the #WalkUpNotOut Movement, because I don\u2019t think students should be blamed in any capacity for such horrific displays of violence. Students cannot change the mental health of their peers. Not even a therapist can 100% fix a student\u2019s mental health. The only way to truly prevent mass shootings is to take away guns. Nicholas Cruz showed signs of uncontrollable anger and other mental illnesses from a young age. When he threw the apple at Isabelle Robinson, he did not do it because he hurt by her or her friends, she did nothing to provoke him. He enjoyed watching her cry. She said, \u201cHis eyes were lit up with a sick, twisted joy.\u201d Despite this, she still helped him do his homework and organize his binder, while he terrorized her by cursing at her and staring at her breasts. Isabelle showed him kindness and compassion despite his violence and crude nature towards her. Nicolas Cruz was not a victim. He victimized his classmates long before he brought an AR-15 to school. Students should not be expected to prevent shootings, our law enforcement should._________I have stated on multiple occasions that I prefer dogs to humans. A person could die in a movie, and I\u2019ll be fine, but as soon as the dog gets hurt \u2014 instant tears. I believe most people feel more sympathetic towards animals because we see them as helpless and without a voice. Who\u2019s going to stand up for them if we don\u2019t? And this isn\u2019t a pick-and-choose matter, we need to advocate for human suffering just as much as the mistreatment of animals.I see my pets as much of a part of my family as I am, so shouldn\u2019t the wildlife be just as much a part of our global community as humans are? In the article Dieudonn\u00e9 Kemb\u00e9 said that what\u2019s good for the animals is good for the people. They add just as much to culture and society as humans do. They provide food, labor, and love. The point of charity and volunteer work is to help those less fortunate, no matter the species, so it doesn\u2019t matter if you write your check out to the animal conservatory or the children\u2019s orphanage, just make sure you pick one of them.Animals are great. Having a pet is like having a best friend that always has your back. I love all three of my pets, but if it came to it, I would always choose to save a human from danger over my pet. A human\u2019s life is much more valuable than an animal\u2019s life.\u2026 The author asked an interesting question, \u201cIs it wrongheaded to fight for elephants and rhinos (or farm animals at home) while five million children still die each year before the age of 5?\u201d yes, but only for the most part. If animals are something you care deeply about you can help them alongside helping the humans in the area. The world would be so much better if everyone who cared so deeply about saving the rhinos put half of their effort into building a new school, establishing a new source of water, or even buying the $5 mosquito net the author wrote about. I agree with the author\u2019s point of view, but I would always prioritize human needs over the needs of animals, endangered or not. With humans suffering around the world it\u2019s our duty to help them before we turn to the elephants and rhinos.Focusing more on animal welfare more than focusing on sick humans is something that is absolutely okay. If you think about it most animals are suffering & dying because of us and the changes we\u2019ve made to this world. Maybe that\u2019s also why were more empathetic towards the suffering of animals. We have some blame in their suffering. Also, animals do nothing to purposely hurt us and have malice in them.When comparing humans and other animals, one thing becomes apparent: humans are especially vile. Never has an animal so deliberately devastated an environment for personal gain nor exterminated entire populations (even some of its own) based on superstition such as racism or sexuality. This is important in finding why humans care more for animals than their own kind as humans have other interests, mainly profit, that will trample over others of their own species. Humanity\u2019s role as the \u201cdominant life form\u201d also gives it a \u201ccalling\u201d to defend \u201clesser beings\u201d, we can see this in politics; the U.S. defends weaker nations like Israel and South Korea (some would even say it does this while neglecting its own people) despite the very few unique benefits they would bring. Animal welfare opens the door for human welfare; it\u2019s not uncommon for breakthroughs in animal treatment to make its way into the treatment of people (the Animal Welfare act of 1966 gave ethical guidelines for the testing of subjects and in the \u201870s push for ethical treatment of human subjects became common).I am more dedicated to helping humans than animals, but do feel a large amount of sympathy for animals. I feel guilty about animals, because they were doing just fine before humans came and interfered. The reason animals need protection and help is because of humans.Despite this, I would still help humans because there are innocent people all around the world who are suffering, and children who are starving. People are more empathetic towards animals because they are cute, furry, and entirely innocent. It isn\u2019t their actions that put the animals in danger, but ours. I don\u2019t believe it is wrong to help animals, many animals would be extinct by now if it weren\u2019t for human intervention, and many ecosystems would be off-balance, which would affect human-life as well. It is wrong, however, to focus primarily on animals. There are people all around the world who are starving, and in constant danger, but many people prefer to look at the cute puppies. That is wrong, and I agree with Mr. Kristoff.For me, I am definitely more dedicated to helping humans, but I try to help animals in every way I can. I believe that if you help our fellow humans, there will be more people that can go out to help even more people and animals. People tend to be more empathetic toward animals because we see them as being \u201chelpless\u201d and \u201cinnocent,\u201d while when we see people suffer, we tend to have that the attitude that \u201cthey did something to deserve it\u201d or \u201cthey will get over it.\u201d I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s wrong to focus on animal welfare. Animals have lives just like humans, and they have real emotions and pain. Not looking out for animals is just humanely wrong. People in general should devote their time to try to help both parties without harming the other.I don\u2019t understand how anyone can think there is a one or the other in this debate. Why must one species be denied of their rights for the other to have it?In the article, it states that there were more signature on a petition for the shooting of Cecil the lion than the shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice. It\u2019s not that people care more about animals lives than they do humans. Many people view animals as small, and without a voice, so who else to speak up for them but us? The problem with this is that we tend to forget our fellow humans. The people we interact with and see everyday.Although we shouldn\u2019t forget about animals, we need to also keep humans in our mind. Just because each person has their own voice, does not mean they don\u2019t need others to speak up for them. Just because animals don\u2019t have the same size brain or opposable thumbs, does not mean their lives are any less precious than ours. There should be absolutely no debate for one or the other._________I have always had a sensitive scene of smell but I realized it after my grandpa died. I went to his house two weeks later and smelled his shirt and it reminded me of days when we used to go out to eat and he used to help play ball in his back yard. Every time I smell sawdust I think of my dad because he is a carpenter and every time he came home from work I smelled sawdust. Another smell that reminds of something is the black ice air freshener that is used for cars. I smelled the fragrance the first time when I got in the work truck when I started my first job it was filled with the unique smell black ice fragrance. One of the last smells that get to me the most is the smell of a smoldering smoky fire. The smell of the smoke is a constant reminder of all the late nights out side in my back yard with my friends and my family laughing and having a good time. That\u2019s all the smell that get to me emotionally and in a way sentimental that makes me go back down memory lane.Fresh, soft, clean, and salty air. The smell of clean bedsheets and pool chlorine. These scents seem to be profound in my memory. During my childhood I had spent lots of time vacationing at Disney with my family. We went on cruises, Disney World, and hotels around Florida. I remember seeing my favorite Disney characters around every corner, and the imagination from watching all Disney movies. The smell of the ocean reminds me of walking the ship and feeling the waves crash and make it rock. The smell of clean sheets remind me of adventuring through each and every hotel room and playing hide and seek, even though we had been there a million times before. The scent from a memory can be very powerful, it can bring back flushes of memories.I will forever remember the smell at my grandma\u2019s house on Thanksgiving and Christmas day of all the food that she and my aunties cook for the family to enjoy. Also my grandma is in love with growing flowers and have an entire family of flowers around her house and the different smells that flowers let out into the air is something that I will always remember sense every time I go to her house I smell her beautiful flowers. I also remember the smell of coffee because before my granddad passed away coffee was his favorite drink in the morning and anytime I smell coffee I instantly remember the times my granddad would drink it early in the morning. That\u2019s all the smells that bring backs good memories and have me excited for upcoming holidays.The smell of fresh cut grass I loved the smell of our yard after my Dad cut the grass. People cut grass all the time, I know we do here, but it doesn\u2019t smell like it did when my Dad cut our grass. Still when I smell freshly cut grass I can see my father out back mowing our yard. Freshly washed clothing that was hung outside to dry as my Mom and I folded the wash or put the clean sheets on the bed, the smell was overwhelmingly crisp and it made me feel so fresh, clean and renewed. Even if you put something out to dry these days, and most places it isn\u2019t even allowed, it doesn\u2019t quite smell the same as it did back then.Smell and memories, there are so many smells that remind me of great memories. the smell of smoke remind me good many good Friday nights beside a fire. The smell of gun powder remind me of early morning duck hunts that I have been on with my buddy\u2019s. That sweet smell of perfume reminds of my women. There are so many smells that make me excited every time I catch a scent of them. Sometimes I wish I could make a candle out of all the smells I enjoy and memorize through my life. I would burn that candle any time I have a bad day to take a trip down memory lane. Smell can determine so many things. sometimes I feel like my nose has its own little brain. Like sometimes I will smell something and aromatically know what it is. Its crazy how our brains memorize all the smells we have smelled through our life and the even crazier part is I still have many years to go hopefully and many more smells to discover. But smells can be a blessing and a curse, present smells make us happy but bad smells make us quiver and sick to are stomachs. Smells will always be important in our life. Without smell we couldn\u2019t do a lot things that we do. It plays a very important role in our life._________My reaction to the punishments was the same as Ms. Sran\u2019s in the article, being that if they don\u2019t understand the meaning of what they are doing, then just sending them to do community service won\u2019t do them, or society any good. The books give them a good look into the severity of what they did. I don\u2019t think that the judge who sentenced the teenagers to read the books meant it as a punishment, it was meant to be a learning experience. Watching one of the movies could do the same thing, but the judge saw the benefit of reading the book. When reading a book, one is immersed in the imagery that is sometimes hard to show in a movie. If I were a judge, I would do all that I could to solve the problem, not suppress it, and I think this is exactly what this judge did. Other forms of community service may teach the people a lesson, but the idea of learning why what they did was wrong would be the best thing to do to change their lives.Take away the word, \u201cpunishment\u201d in this article. I agree with Emily. \u201cLearning experience\u201d or another word or phrase emphasizing the assignment as positive is needed.This punishment that the juveniles were given, reading books to expand their knowledge and remove their ignorance, was a very creative idea. Becoming more knowledgeable about the meanings behind the symbols they used or the insults they said would make them more remorseful on their actions, not just regretful that they were caught. Reading being used as a punishment would not lead to resistance to it in the future, but would rather motivate the juveniles to read more to develop a more intuitive mind. One book is all it takes to open one\u2019s mind and help one realize how much potential they have. However the punishments these teenagers received was in itself to soft. Of course reading was an innovative way to teach them about their mistakes, they should still be punished for them. The judge should have had them serve community service in order to show others that there are real consequences to their actions. Reading a book can literally place you in someone else\u2019s story, giving you an insight on their ideas and cultures. Reading gives you a look on how others live their lives, and you can find similarities and differences in that. That is why this idea with reading works because the vandals will have the great opportunity to not only learn from their mistakes, but to grow from them and help them become a better human being.The use of books being a form of \u2018punishment\u2019 for teenagers is the best type of reform to implement on them. Personally, I am a book lover. Any genre, any size, I will read. In my opinion, I believe that the characters in books have the ability to change the way someone thinks. I know it did for me. However, instead of enforcing specific books onto the juvenile offenders, I think that they should be able to choose any book of their choice from a specific genre. Most of the time, I feel like it\u2019s a burden when an individual forces me to read a book. By allowing the offenders to have a sense of control over what they read, they will be encouraged to read more and expand their narrow perspective.Most people would agree that they seem to enjoy a book more when they just get to read it. No marking passages, no time limit. Just you and a book of your choice. I believe this really helped these teens. Yes, this group of vandals that had defaced a historical black schoolhouse with insensitive racist symbols, had to pick from a list, but they got to chose the book, and they learned from it. You learn so much better just reading other\u2019s stories and what they had to go through than sitting in a room, listening to someone list the reasons why what you did was wrong. Books can be so powerful, and obviously, these reads left a lasting impression on the group. At first they didn\u2019t understand what what they were doing even meant, but after being able to read about how others had to go through thing such as the holocaust in \u201cNight\u201d by Elie Wiesel, racism in the South in \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d by Harper Lee, and what it is like being an immigrant in \u201cThe Tortilla Curtain\u201d by T.C. Boyle.It just proves how you can learn so much just by picking up a book, even how to be a better person._________I would call this story \u201cfind your friends and don\u2019t get lost yourself.\u201d This is a very bright spot, very bright campus that symbolizes a wonderful student days. When you are a student, you live on your own, study, walk and enjoy walks with friends. Sounds great! students in the picture dressed in different clothes, which distinguishes them from other faculty. The division into faculties does not prevent students from communicating, so everyone goes for a walk and just enjoy communicating with each other. To summarize, I would say that this is the story of a simple College life, where the youth simply enjoys lifeIt\u2019s pretty busy, and bright, and loud \u2026 All of these colours and sounds. I\u2019m just making my way through the street like I do every day. Just the same as the last, the same colours as the last, the same sounds as the last. The same movements as the last. There\u2019s nothing particular here, we\u2019re all different I know, but it\u2019s all the same. If an artist portrayed us we\u2019d all be made of different brush strokes, but we\u2019re all the same, are we not? Trying to get somewhere, trying to do something, so we never really pay attention to the colors of others. Her and his and their fluorescent pinks, they don\u2019t glance at my bright yellow. Until our eyes meet. But that\u2019s a story for another day. When I\u2019m not busy and rushing on my way.I need to find out where I am going \u2026 I am a freshman in my college and I\u2019m trying to get to my history class on time. I\u2019ve got to be the only one as dressed up as I am for my first day. Surrounding me are people in all different colors with unique outfits and friends that are all doing different things. I am alone until I almost run into a cat in front of me. Realizing that it was being chased by a boy I returned the cat to the owner. He thanked me for returning his pet and asked if I knew where world history was. I smiled and laughed as I told him you\u2019re not alone and I realized how wrong I was. We ended up becoming great friends throughout college and became roommates.My heart is pounding as I embark on this journey. The wild and colorful beasts are all around me, pushing and shoving me so much that I feel like I might be trampled. I think to get out my phone and text my mother to tell her I love her, just in case this expedition is fatal. Just when it seemed like I was never going to come back from this, I realize I have successfully crossed the commons without my panic attack getting too bad. We didn\u2019t need a repeat of last year. I shudder at the thought. Time to get to class, until the next bell rings and we do it all again.I standing dead center of the great lawn, planning my route to get through the massive crowd of people. Left at the group playing frisbee, then a hard right towards the couple laying on the lawn. I had somewhat of an idea of where I was going, then all of a sudden, my feet started moving and next thing I knew, I was in the middle of the Great Lawn. My plan kinda worked, but I intended to be a little more to the left than where I was right now. I ended up running the rest of the way, through the lawn, dodging people left and right. All I had to do was make it to the other side, then I was basically in my classroom._________I have a facebook account which I never use nor do I really care about it anymore. After the data leak, I don\u2019t know how anyone could trust facebook. It\u2019s clear what lengths people, such as Zuckerberg, go to just to make more money than they already do. Zuckerberg violated the \u201cbranch of trust\u201d that he extended to all Facebook users and in turn, got caught red-handed. The company clearly doesn\u2019t have the people\u2019s interest in mind whatsoever. Violating a slogan which was used to start the company does not show sympathy or care for any users they have.This recent data leak sums up the problems that come with social media. The fact that a company like Cambridge Analytica is able obtain your private information that easily is scary to me. It makes me wonder what the real purpose of all this social media really is. Is it a way for us to be able to share things with friends and family and to keep up with the world, or is it just a platform for companies and the government to learn anything they want about you. Facebook not only displays information about where you live, your birth date, and name, but just from the pictures you like, companies can know about your personality and how to persuade you in certain situations. Without ever meeting some of companies, they may know your entire life.Some might say that if you don\u2019t want you privacy taken away, then just don\u2019t use Facebook. For some, this is very easy, but it is hard for others because of the instant gratification that Facebook and other sites bring in. Whenever someone likes or comments on your post, you feel a sense of gratification. It\u2019s almost like social media keeps sucking you in because of your desire for likes. Facebook should be more protective or their users privacy instead of handing it out to the rest of the world.the facebook data leak was dangerous to everyone who uses facebook. Our privacy is the most important thing and social media shouldn\u2019t be trusted with it. I don\u2019t trust facebook or any social media since it is so easy for people to hack accounts and reach all your information. the company doesn\u2019t have people\u2019s best interests in mind seeing as they allowed this to happen. I do not think that social media platforms should be regulated by the government because that breaks our freedom of posterity and doesn\u2019t allow us to use social media as our ways to express ourselves as who we really are. The government regulating our posts will just bring back censorship and it will allow the government to start taking away our rights. Facebook should protect users data better because even though users can chose what the post, they should still have some type of privacy to share things with their friends online and not have anyone else be able to access it.Multiple times I\u2019ve been told, and perhaps some of the whole hasn\u2019t, that anything you post on Social Media that\u2019s \u201cyour\u201d privacy, now becomes anyone\u2019s privacy. Whenever you sign up for a social media site, or for anything in the world, there is always a contract; a contract that few ever feel the need to read. For Facebook there was a very clear Terms of Service; \u201cFor content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos (IP content), you specifically give us the following permission, subject to your privacy and application settings: you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post\u2026\u201d.How people share their personal experiences and in-depth details of their life on Social Media, for the whole world to see, not paying attention to the contract, or the simple fact that anyone can see it, befuddles me. Who are you to blame but yourself? The social platform must be to blame, right?I am Facebook user about 6 years ago. In these time, I wrote my personality information but I dint know what importance is to share this information about myself. Now, I am very meticulous about what shared with my friends, what tweets I like and what information I put about me. When you answer an online test or poll you do not know for what or for who is these information, and these is very dangerous. Facebook did a very bad activity sharing our privacy because they are supposed to protect our personal information, but we are responsibilities too. We are responsibilities because we need to be smart and think that in these world so computerizing, our personal data is being exposed all the time and you do not know who is going to see it, and with what purpose. When we are in the internet, we read that the page used cookies and we accept, but we know exactly what it means? So, I think that we need know more about all of these things and act accordingly.In my opinion, this Facebook data leak was responsibility of the company because they have the whole information that people bring to them. Most of this people bring their information and do not know what this company should do with it, even though you do not want to bring too much information about you Facebook push people to give unnecessary information in my point of view. People have to be a little more reserved with things that they shared with other people because now it is a great issue, we aren\u2019t take a due responsibilities with our information and private life. We have to learn to make a good use about this kind of tools such as communicate with important people to us, if you think that you do not bring too much information to Facebook you already did with google. Why does Facebook need all those information about us? We do not know even though we accept terms and conditions; well, no one is going to take a little time to read all those small words, neither do I._________I myself am a huge fan of older fashion trends making a reappearance and mixing with modern trends to create something new and unique. The woman in the photograph is wearing clothing that appears to be very old fashioned; the brown blazer and short culottes are extremely 90s-esque, but her hairstyle and the black shoes, that appear to be similar in style to Gucci\u2019s popular classic black slides, make the look feel more modern.An older fashion trend that I would like to see revived is fit and flare jeans/pants. They are being included more and more into high end runway looks and have already trickled down to Instagram models everywhere. The idea that skinny jeans/pants are the only attractive pant is a misconception; realistically, fit and flare pants make the body look more proportional, and with more emphasis on embracing different body types, I think these pants would be suitable for everyone when styled correctly.Vintage is becoming the new sensation of our generation. We are learning to appreciate the fashion of our forefathers and mothers. I think that going vintage is a great trend to follow, while it\u2019s great to come up with your own original idea it I also great to learn from history to make something equally impressive. Personally, I love the 50s swing dresses and I wish those would come back because honestly, they are so cute. They were dresses that were easy to move in, seeing that they were made to dance in. Something that I think should stay in the past is wearing leotards on top of our clothing, it really wasn\u2019t a very flattering outfit.Spring is one of the best times for fashion. The colors of nature are finally starting to bloom, the sun is out and it is finally warm again. Many see Spring as a time for fashion designers to release new lines of clothes. Nowadays, many fashion designers like to look to clothes in the past for inspiration like neon windbreakers, denim jackets and track pants. These are all great fashion pieces that came back and are killing it in the fashion game. Now, there are other fashion trends that should stay dead like sweatbands, leg warmers, and MC Hammer pants. They just shouldn\u2019t come back.Enough with this nostalgia fashion! Today, the walls of fast fashion stores are lined primarily with the trends of the \u201880s and \u201890s making this age seem like copycat fashion. High-end fashion companies, like Balencia and Gucci, have been taking trends that blossomed on the runway decades ago but slightly modernized them to be made the \u201ctrend\u201d of this decade. Sure, a few trends could come back like bell-bottoms have over the years, but it has become overwhelming when the major fashion trends of 2018 are crushed velvet, statement chokers, track pants, and more that also started in the \u201880s and \u201890s. I say, we as a fashion community must end the recycling of style comebacks, and start generating styles of our own._________At first glance, this picture seems to be depicting the attainment of a degree between two different groups. One group, the more privileged, have a grand, red-carpeted staircase which allows them to easily descend up and collect their \u201cprize\u201d. On the other hand, the other group is desperately trying to pull themselves up by means of the tassle. They are in the shadows and seem to be completely overlooked by the people relaxing on the top of the cap. I believe this shows the struggles of those less fortunate in their journey to receiving a proper college or high-school education. Some people just have everything working for them: grades, socioeconomic status, opportunities, but others have to find another way to achieve the same goal. After reading the article, it seems the other is trying to prove this very point. He feels guilty that while he and his family could afford a great Ivy league education, others cannot simply because of their family\u2019s income. While there is some economic diversity, most high ranked colleges have more students from the top 1% than the entire bottom 60%. I agree that college opportunity shouldn\u2019t be unavailable just because of an individual\u2019s inability to pay a large sum. As a country, we need to work towards making college more accessible to those who deserve it but can\u2019t attend just because of a poor economic situation.This image depicts an extremely significant message toward the young adults of our generation. It is illustrated that some people find their way to college quite easily, making their way to university with little struggle. However, others are faced with more challenges when try to go to college. The hardships are endless, this could consist of financial aid, lack of acceptance, GPA/SAT scores, and more. Despite the obvious problems, these students will still find their way to college one way or another \u2014 it just may not be as easy for them. Nonetheless, college is an achievable goal for every high school graduate. Students should be encouraged and motivated by this picture and look forward to the upcoming years.This photo prompt conveys a very important message. The act of people climbing the stairs to reach the top of the graduation cap represents that college is the way to reach success. The message in this is that education can help anyone reach the top of their goals. In the photo, there are two sets of people depicted. Although one group appears to be struggling to climb the tassel of the cap, the other group has red carpet stairs to walk up. Either way, with or without difficulty, eventually, the students will reach their goals and be on top for graduation.In this picture, I see two groups going towards the same goal but on two completely different paths. This picture is signifying the wealthy and the poor I believe. The wealthier can walk their red carpet into anywhere or anything and receive something they might not deserve. Then there is the people cast in the shadow of the red carpet, showing they are hidden behind all the \u201csuccessful\u201d people. They are trying to climb up the tassel and begging for help but are simply ignored because they are less valuable than the wealthy. This image is showing the struggles of the less fortunate in society and college. People should be chosen by a college for who they are academically and actions they took to get here, not by how much money they have or if there family is alumni. In the Harvard class of 2021, 29% had a parent or grandparent attend there. Legacy admission should no longer be around, it is unfair for the people who have worked so hard to get into an Ivy League but have a lesser of a chance because their parents didn\u2019t attend that college. More colleges need to start following the footsteps of Emory and Princeton, by not looking at if the applicant has taken tours or visited the college into consideration when looking to see if they will be accepted. It is unfair because some people can not afford to take a tour. We need to work towards a fair college admissions process, so everyone can have a chance at getting great education._________I like the idea a lot, and feel it could be very beneficial. I would probably choose to go to a class like this if it would interest me, because when it comes down to it, knowledge is power. I would probably do the \u00b4drones and rockets\u00b4 class that was stated in Ellin\u00b4s article. This is because I really enjoy STEM type classes. I wish our school would offer something first aid related, because it is very important. I would teach a class about LEGO\u00b4s. I would teach it very hands on, and tie it into architecture and creativity.I really like the idea of \u201cpop-up\u201d classes because they give students the opportunity to explore and experiment in different fields that they may be interested in. Many people pay a lot of money to go to specialized classes, but pop-up classes allow every student the opportunity to try something new. With that said, I would definitely choose to go to a pop-up class in my free time because I love to learn more about something that I am interested in. I would like to take the gun control class at Bennington College that was mentioned in the article because I think that with the recent gun violence that has been plaguing the United States, it is important to learn more about gun policy.I think \u201cpop-up\u201d classes would be a great addition to my school. They allow students who wish to explore a topic to do so, and students who feel too stressed out aren\u2019t forced to go. I believe that pop-up classes would create a better learning environment because every student that attends one, wants to be there, and when the room is full of students that want to learn, it is very effective. Many students want to take initiative in their education and learn about topics they care about, and these classes are a perfect opportunity. I would attend a pop-up class if it was one of my interests because the more you know about different topics, the more equipped you are to deal with adulthood and I believe that everything you learn will benefit you. The class mentioned in the article that I would take is \u201cWhite Privilege\u201d, because I have heard a lot of different opinions about the topic of race, and I would want to be more educated. I wish my school offered a pop-up class about social media and how it affects our society. If I taught a pop-up class, it would be about creative writing because I love creative writing and although we write plenty of essays in school, we never write creatively.I think the idea of \u201cpop-up\u201d classes is very creative and innovative. It gives students a chance to explore outside of their comfort zone. After a while, going along with the regular curriculum gets a bit dull. This would be a breath of fresh air. I would take the \u201cwhite privilege\u201d class because I feel like it\u2019s such an important issue that affects many people. I wish my school offered a pop-up class about our country\u2019s politics. I know, I know, this topic is so overrated. But everything moves so fast that I can\u2019t keep up, and can\u2019t really understand what\u2019s going on. Discussing it and debating about it would be great. If I could teach a pop-up class, it would be about psychology, and more specifically, the social aspect. Many people have a hard time connecting with others, and I want to break it down to understand how the mind works and reacts to certain things.I love the idea of \u201cpop up\u201d classes I think this type of classes is not only benefitting the students but the teachers as well. The change of environment and the timing I believes tricks the mind that school or class is not really taking place and gives you reassurance in the mind that you normally would be worrying in a normal class setting. This also gives teachers elbow room because now they can talk about other topics further on without needing to care what they say for school\u2019s purposes and judgement. I really thought the class: \u2018Self-Determination: Restoration and Resiliency,\u2019 at St. Michael\u2019s College because I love that it is not just something academic but something you can apply in life and I love things that exercise my mind. I would love to teach a pop up class on art history like going to a museum to see different arts or a something with culture to enrich students with different ethnicities and customs. The class could be maybe at culture center or even where there is prone to be only one type of culture in that area while still teaching the history of that culture._________Although far from perfect, I believe that now is the best time to be alive. The world is changing and globalizing at a record speed. Places once closed off are becoming more accesible. Even some of the most remote nations, Myanmar, Micronesia and Tanzania, just to name a few, are opening up. With this move towards an interconnected world comes the empowerment of those once undermined, fueled by the Internet. This is the world of the future. Driverless cars are a reality, along with holograms of once deceased singers and potential commercial space flights. There is so much room for innovation, in every field imaginable and more. Inequality and poverty are becoming less prevalent. There are more opportunities for rural women and girls, whose options once looked bleak. More females are running for office than ever before. Minorities are rising up. Whenever I read the news each day, I see an endless stream of articles about war and tragedy. But, I choose to look past the grim and focus on the positive. Of course, no world is perfect, certainly not ours, but there is so much growth in our society that one cannot help but embrace it.I believe that today in time we are certainly lucky to have many new advancements, especially in technology. We can easily get in touch with friends and family in case of emergency. However there are times I wish I grew up 10 years ago when no one had to worry about how many followers they have or how long ago someone opened a snap chat. Back then without advanced technology and media, life was probably much easier and less complicated. Now teenagers today live in panic and are worrying about their phones at all times. With the internet, teens are more exposed to the dangers of the world and it puts them in a constant panic.According to Steven Pinker, your beliefs regarding the progress and quality of today\u2019s world is all dependent on how you look at things- and he\u2019s absolutely right. You can look at things in terms of how bad they\u2019ve gotten, or you could look at things in terms of how much we\u2019ve improved upon those bad things; and once you do, it\u2019s hard to disagree with him. Throughout our evolution, we\u2019ve lost things, but we\u2019ve definitely gained things too. And your personal \u201cgolden age\u201d will reflect what you believe to be most important. For example, environmentalists might say it was back before the industrial revolution \u2014 or even further \u2014 when humans didn\u2019t have such an impact on the environment. My ideal time to be born is in the future when humans have built successful colonies on other planets, and I fully credit this to my interest in astronomy.The one thing you can\u2019t argue with is our capacity to change and evolve. Steven Pinker said that \u201cThe Enlightenment\u201d changed everything for the better; it worked. And it\u2019s also working now. As time has gone on, humans have been advancing at an exponential rate. Pinkers understand that, overall, the world has become a better place- despite the media\u2019s exaggerated image of our Earth. The Enlightenment started a movement that I don\u2019t think will ever be stopped, and I\u2019m sure that future humans will say the same things about their vastly improved world too.I am not at all surprised by Mr. Pinker\u2019s claim, the world is without a doubt a better place to live in now than ever before. Like he said, lifespans are longer, human rights are better, and lives are more comfortable (in general) than in the past. Yes, the past may have been simpler, but I know for a fact that I would choose high taxes, bad internet connection, and some social issues over having more than half of my country\u2019s population wiped out by the plague.I feel that the reason we hear so much more bad news these days is not because there is more bad news to hear, but more ways to hear it. The sources that supply news are businesses, they need to make money. If they see that bad news sells better, they will sell more bad news. I think acknowledging progress motivates people to keep advancing. They appreciate it when you take notice of their accomplishments and it makes them want to do it more, not less.Overall I do believe now is the best time to be alive due to a multitude of technological advancements along with the new equality movements that have risen in the past decade. However, when I first read this article my original answer was that the world isn\u2019t becoming a better place or it isn\u2019t the best time to be alive due to the latest displays of gun violence, inequality of gender and race, opioid epidemic, and terrorism. This article changed my mind because statistics show that extreme poverty has improved, life expectancy is much longer, and \u201c90% of the world\u2019s population under the age 25 years can read and write\u201d. All of these are extraordinary accomplishments, and are overlooked because this type of improvement is not immediate, it takes time. Furthermore, I agree with the author of Enlightenment Now because when all we do is look at the negative, we will always fail to see the good.In the midst of the sensationalized stories and journalism spoon-fed to us by commercialized news stations, it can be hard to take a step back and acknowledge the significant progress humans have made in the past couple of centuries. As Pinker said, the immense improvement of global health, affluence, and intelligence, as well as other more recent progressions such as the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency, seem to go virtually unnoticed in the interest of pushing for even more regulations. However, this seemingly endless hunger for progress seen in our very politically active generation has been and forever will be crucial to achieving the goal of equality on our planet.Many hundreds of years ago, the impoverished citizens living under the oppressive rule of their oftentimes coronated male leader knew they weren\u2019t being treated fairly, but they had no choice but to accept the fate they were born into or be executed for speaking against the government. Now, with the spread of democracy, many citizens are allowed to protest and vote on hot-topic issues, and we have the ability to push for progress until we can reach the most realistically equal state possible. That\u2019s why I believe it\u2019s currently the best time to be alive in human history, but I don\u2019t doubt that, assuming humans continue their pressuring of politicians to make positive progress for human rights and the environment, the future will hold a society that\u2019d make living in 2018 seem awful in comparison.I believe the best time in human history would be when the leaders of the world stop thinking more nuclear missiles is the path to world peace. Only then would I be able to think that it\u2019s the best time in human history. with such weapons of mass destruction, the condition of our planet is at constant risk.The idea that the world is becoming a livelier, healthier, and an overall improved place doesn\u2019t shock me at all. Around the world, the standard of living in the last century has drastically improved surpassing any point of recognition. So, do I believe that right now is a better time than ever to be alive? Of course I do. That said, there\u2019s still obvious work to be done. Equality is something many oppressed minorities long for and never achieve. Another pressing issue nowadays is public education, underfunded and underdeveloped educational systems around the world are stunting the growth of youthful minds. There have been so many great advancements in medicine, science, politics, and so much more that it\u2019s impossible to suggest there has been a better time for man.Progression is the key to human advancement. Steven Pinker made a great point disproving claims that tragedy put an end to progress. Those who feel our society is not advancing due to various tragedies or epidemics are naive and two-dimensional. I feel just as Pinker does, that progress cannot always be defined by the expulsion of evil, but by the transformation of society\u2019s most pressing issues. I also agree with Pinker\u2019s views on ignoring progression and the result of that. If groups of people band together to deny or resent the state of progression, how are we to move forward? Denying man\u2019s strides in environmentalism, equality, politics and economics hinders the progression of the future._________Advertisement"}

Bollywood and its smaller cousins (such as Mollywood, Tollywood and Gollywood \u2014 all named after the areas where the films are shot or the languages they use) represent a hugely influential industry.After videos and pictures of a topless Ms. Reddy spread quickly on the internet, the question turned to what would be the impact. Ms. Reddy is not widely known across India, and she staged her protest in Hyderabad, a big city in the south-center of the country, but not nearly as important for the movie industry as Mumbai.That seems to have already begun. Some actors have taken swipes at Ms. Reddy, accusing her of staging the protest just to bolster her career, an accusation that she has rejected.But, Ms. Narayan said, \u201cIf she can get a few women to rally around her, maybe it will lead to real change.\u201dShe added: \u201cWhat India needs is a powerful man to be implicated.\u201dThe sexes in India are often strictly separated. Many families favor male babies to the extent that they abort female fetuses, leading to a gender imbalance in some areas that makes relations between men and women even worse.\u201cThe typical Indian male\u2019s psychology stems from a background where he has never seen women enjoying all these freedoms, like smoking and drinking,\u201d said Ashis Nandy, a prominent political sociologist, author and commentator.\u201cMen in the film fraternity are no exception,\u201d he added. \u201cTheir abuse of women rests on the assumption that in a contractual relationship, they have a right to sexually abuse her.\u201dShe has appeared in a few movies, including \u201cNenu Nanna Abaddam\u201d and \u201cAravind 2.\u201d In interviews before her protest, Ms. Reddy said that she wished directors in central India would hire more local actors and that she had struggled to make a breakthrough.The actress said some filmmakers had demanded that she send them nude videos before considering hiring her for a part. She complied, she said, and then didn\u2019t even get the part.\u201cAren\u2019t we beautiful and good looking? Aren\u2019t we talented?\u201d Ms. Reddy said in an interview this year. \u201cThen why aren\u2019t we being given opportunities?\u201dKai Schultz and Suhasini Raj contributed reporting from New Delhi, and Ayesha Venkataraman from Mumbai, India.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What a Scientist Learned From Studying the \u2018Synchronized Swimming of Sea Monkeys\u2019", "Date": "2018-04-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTiny crustaceans complete a massive daily vertical migration in the world\u2019s oceans. New research suggests their commute may play an important role in the health of the planet.John Dabiri isn\u2019t an oceanographer. And he\u2019s not a biologist. But for more than a decade, he\u2019s been studying tiny shrimp swimming through water. It hasn\u2019t always been easy.Every night, trillions of sea creatures \u2014 whales, jellyfish, swarms of shrimp and plankton \u2014 take part in what some call the largest mass migration on the planet. From depths of at least 2,000 feet, they swim to the ocean\u2019s surface, in a wave of animals that propagates as the sun sets around the planet. By daylight, they return below.No one knows for certain how they know to do this \u2014 or why. But this vertical migration \u2014 especially the one completed every day by some of the ocean\u2019s smallest creatures \u2014 may be making big waves.Dr. Dabiri would later discover in an email exchange with Dr. Munk that he had said this in jest: Animals can\u2019t kick up much more water than the amount directly around their bodies. \u201cThese animals are individually small, and the ocean is enormous,\u201d said Dr. Dabiri. \u201cIt sort of defies intuition that such small organisms could have a major impact in the oceans.\u201d Rather than going out on the ocean aboard a ship that cost $20,000 a day, Dr. Dabiri spent more like $100 a day in the lab using tall tanks filled with layers of salt water. He also used brine shrimp \u2014 Mr. Coburn\u2019s \u201csea monkeys.\u201d Although these shrimp do not live in the ocean, his team used them because they are a similar size to plankton or krill and their response to light allows the researchers to trigger vertical migrations on demand, which makes them easier to study.They positioned lights at the top and bottom of the tanks, turning them on and off to attract the brine shrimp. They did this repeatedly \u2014 six times up and down for two hours \u2014 to replicate what you might actually see in the ocean if you dropped in to watch the marathon yourself. There, a mob of creatures can extend dozens of feet long and travel hundreds of feet. It would take you two hours to watch them pass by. As expected, Dr. Dabiri\u2019s team found that a single shrimp swimming upward doesn\u2019t produce much flow, but combined with other shrimp, the mob created a downward jet that rapidly and irreversibly churned the different layers of seawater. There\u2019s a lot more to these results than just teaching sea monkeys to synchronize swim, Dr. Dabiri said. Showing that these physical dynamics are possible in the lab is a first step to better understanding the dynamic processes that drive ocean mixing and its role in the planet\u2019s health. And some scientists are starting to accept that the daily commutes of animals may be more important than we thought. In an interview on Thursday, Mr. Coburn stood by his dismissal of the research in 2014. He pointed out that Dr. Dabiri\u2019s study used a different organism than the ones found in the ocean as its model, and called the work \u201cjunk science.\u201d\u201cBasic research is fine. I\u2019m for that. I want to expand the N.I.H., but I also want to get rid of the stupid stuff in there,\u201d he said, referring to the budget of the National Institutes for Health. He added that scientists must stand up to scrutiny. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice, little, cute story, but to me, it\u2019s meaningless.\u201dDr. Dabiri acknowledged that before making any permanent conclusions, it will be important to confirm that similar dynamics exist when tiny crustaceans make their nightly commutes in the real ocean. Understanding the ocean better will help scientists predict the climate on land \u2014 and essentially, our future.\u201cWe didn\u2019t know when we started that we would have discovered this,\u201d Dr. Dabiri said. \u201cBut we won\u2019t know those things if we\u2019re not supporting basic research.\u201d_____Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Dressing (or Dip) That\u2019s Easy to Love", "Date": "2018-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCity KitchenYou either love it, or you don\u2019t. But honestly, it\u2019s pretty easy to love bagna cauda.Traditionally served warm and used as a dip for raw vegetables, bagna cauda is a classic Italian sauce that features, unabashedly, a fair amount of anchovy and garlic.Making bagna cauda couldn\u2019t be simpler. Mash some anchovy fillets (the better the anchovy, the better the sauce) with a few cloves of garlic, and simmer the result in olive oil for a few minutes. This tames the garlic somewhat and dissolves the anchovy. You can stop right there, but it tastes better with a little lemon juice or vinegar. Some cooks add butter; some add cream. There are versions with walnut oil. If you happen to be in northern Italy in the winter, you may come across bagna cauda laced with truffles. My version calls for cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche.Bagna cauda is often compared to fondue, but it is really more like a warm vinaigrette for vegetables, a step up from a sauce of plain olive oil, salt and lemon (also a worthwhile treatment).In fact, bagna cauda is so versatile it can be a sauce for pasta or grilled fish or any number of dishes. It\u2019s good with eggs \u2014 fried, or hard cooked.Here, it is used to dress an impromptu spring salad. Arranged on a large platter, colorful spring vegetables make a glorious display. So while you could toss the salad, simply drizzling with bagna cauda is a better choice.I used radish, celery, fennel, asparagus and shaved golden beet, plumped up with diminutive endive, arugula and spinach leaves. Slightly bitter vegetables like radicchio and artichokes pair well with anchovy and garlic, but so do boiled potatoes.Use the quantities given and vegetables suggested in my recipe as a guide, choosing whatever fresh, crisp offerings are available at the market. When the season changes, you can simply change the assortment, and make this salad year-round. Ripe tomatoes, now months away, are a happy pairing to anticipate.This recipe makes about one cup of dressing, which may seem like a lot for a salad meant for four diners. Dress it lightly with just a few tablespoons, but bring the rest of the sauce to the table. You\u2019ll want more for mopping or dunking, so be sure to serve the salad with a crusty baguette or hearth-baked loaf.cookingAdvertisement"}

Patreon, a crowdfunding site, also said it removed a page linked to the group, adding that only $194 was raised in total but never paid out.PayPal confirmed that an account linked to the false Black Lives Matter page was no longer active on the payment platform. On Classy, a fund-raising site, a campaign linked to the sham page was \u201cfound not to be valid\u201d and had been disabled, with the account owners receiving no money, Monica Finch, a company spokeswoman, wrote in an email.\u201cThese fake BLM accounts and fake BLM people literally stealing money off Black Death is so stomach churning I can\u2019t even begin to explain,\u201d she wrote. \u201cGlad it\u2019s down now.\u201d\u201cWe live in a digital world, and it\u2019s extremely important that platforms like Facebook and Twitter do their due diligence with users so that supporters of our movement, and movements like ours, aren\u2019t misled and that resources aren\u2019t misappropriated,\u201d the statement said.Mr. Mackay also ran a Black Lives Matter Facebook group, which functioned like a forum where members had to request access, with nearly 40,000 participants, according to CNN.Mr. Mackay told CNN that buying and selling domain names was a personal hobby but he declined to clarify his role in the Black Lives Matter page.Advertisement"}

And then, in the span of six days, a team of law enforcement officers in Sacramento located and arrested the man they say is behind one of America\u2019s most brutal and mysterious crime sprees, the Golden State Killer.Joseph James DeAngelo, 72, was living in Citrus Heights, a suburb of Sacramento and a short drive on the freeway from the neighborhoods that he is alleged to have terrorized in the 1970s and 1980s. He is a former police officer who the authorities now say raped more than 50 women and killed 12 people.

{"Headline": "What Good Is \u2018Community\u2019 When Someone Else Makes All the Rules?", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFirst WordsYou can tell a lot about the cultural status of capitalism by how we refer to people who buy stuff. \u201cCustomer,\u201d with its implicit deference \u2014 its suggestion that the buyer is always right \u2014 is now a relic of a bygone era. \u201cClient\u201d is formal and reserved for professional relationships. \u201cConsumer,\u201d with its air of piggish, Pac-Man voracity, is the slightly dehumanizing moniker most of us grew up with, but that was some time ago, before the rise of the brand as a cultic family. Now everyone who buys or uses or even just cares about a product or service has been collectively upgraded to something more ephemeral, almost spiritual, a loose association of souls brought together in one churchlike congregation: a \u201ccommunity.\u201dImagining such groups as little virtual villages is an old tech clich\u00e9, an echo from the days when the agglomerations of people on the internet were smaller, more like-minded and manageable. It\u2019s still how Facebook describes its more than two billion users, stretching the notion of \u201ccommunity\u201d thin enough to cover over a quarter of the earth\u2019s population. This is the scale of the demographic Mark Zuckerberg has now spent so much time reminding us \u2014 and, over two days of testimony in Washington, our congressional representatives \u2014 that he feels very, very sorry to have disappointed. As he told Recode last month, he is sorry that the company \u201clet the community down.\u201dThere\u2019s an association that still lingers between a \u201ccommunity\u201d and a physical location \u2014 the idyllic small town, say, or the utopian village, real or imagined. It evokes a cozy, friendly, simple place in which people live in easy harmony and cooperation, each with a role to play, each mattering to the whole.But the countless, ever-multiplying communities of today are something different: not collections of humans functioning in unison but random assortments of people who do the same things, like the same things, hate the same things or believe the same things. Life online is absolutely full of communities. There are fan communities, hobbyist communities, communities for users or enthusiasts of every consumer product imaginable. Every interest, every circumstance and point of identification, it seems, benefits by gathering under this feel-good umbrella word, which instantly puts a friendly gloss on every activity. People who interact are a community. People who don\u2019t interact but share some quality or belief become a community. People who are lumped into communities by other communities are communities. \u201cCommunity\u201d makes everything sound better. It makes \u201cthe activist community\u201d sound approachable; it makes \u201cthe skin-care community\u201d sound important; it makes \u201cthe Christian community\u201d sound inclusive and kind; it makes \u201cthe medical community\u201d sound folksy and skilled at the bedside; it makes \u201cthe homeless community\u201d sound voluntary; it makes \u201cthe gun rights community\u201d sound humanistic; it makes \u201cthe tech community\u201d sound like good citizens.The tech community, of course, is partly responsible for this explosion. Platforms like Facebook, which exist for the express purpose of \u201ccreating community,\u201d turn out to be in the business of exploiting the communities they\u2019ve created for the benefit of those outside (the business community, the strategic communications community, the Moldovan hacker community). They invite members to \u201cparticipate,\u201d but not, in the end, to make decisions together; the largest rewards, and the greatest powers, stay private. The company lays claim to everything of value that can be extracted from the assembled group. Nobody feels any personal kinship with a \u201ccommunity\u201d of billions of fellow Facebook users; only people who work for Facebook would ever describe things this way. But this communal language maintains the illusion that we\u2019re all in this together, working for something that will benefit us all \u2014 neatly keeping the focus on the things being \u201cliked\u201d and \u201cshared,\u201d rather than the ones being mined or sold.McMillan and Chavis also cited an important distinction between two types of community that have long coexisted. One is geographical \u2014 neighborhood, town, city \u2014 and the other is \u201crelational,\u201d concerned with the interconnections among people. Our sense of community seems to shift steadily among these very different modes of thinking. Over the decades, its meaning has lost the precision of city limits and has expanded to accommodate groups with shared values, planned and intentional organizations and a general sense of interpersonal connectedness. In 2018, it feels as if community is about being recognized as a certain kind of person \u2014 when it\u2019s not merely about fitting into a broad category. In other words, our sense of community is less and less about being from someplace and more about being like someone.This is certainly how it works in politics, where \u201ccommunity\u201d magically converts huge groups of people \u2014 what we\u2019d maybe once have called a constituency \u2014 into neat, undifferentiated units. Community is the spoonful of sugar that makes the othering go down. A politician might gingerly refer to \u201cthe black community,\u201d which sounds more validating and supportive than simply saying \u201cblack people.\u201d A \u201ccommunity,\u201d it\u2019s implied, is vibrant and productive and self-sustaining. It doesn\u2019t need others outside it to defend its rights or protect its interests. Adweek once suggested that \u201cthe female community is finding and establishing itself among the ranks of the techies in the Big Apple.\u201d The \u201cfemale community,\u201d of course, implies that disenfranchisement is just another ladies\u2019 choice.In the utopian-village sense of a \u201ccommunity,\u201d it\u2019s other human beings who accomplish this, exerting all their different social pressures over us to make us behave a certain way. This is a dynamic we can understand, and accept. Raymond Williams\u2019s observation \u2014 that \u201ccommunity\u201d seems never to be used unfavorably \u2014 still rings true. We imagine community as a cocreated project in which everything can be negotiated, in which everyone has a stake, in which democracy can flourish. The only things that can\u2019t be negotiated are the laws of nature, the floods and droughts and cataclysms and acts of God no village can avoid.Advertisement"}

It was just after 9 p.m. on election night and she was having her hair and makeup done in the family\u2019s suite at the Peninsula hotel. She stopped to pour what someone said was Veuve Clicquot into everyone\u2019s glasses, figuring that in a couple of hours Donald Trump\u2019s run of early victories in red states (West Virginia, Oklahoma, Alabama) would end and the map would turn back in her mom\u2019s favor.Three hours later, the Rust Belt was awash in red, and somebody had to tell Hillary Clinton.Robby Mook, the drained and deflated campaign manager, told his boss she was going to lose. She didn\u2019t seem all that surprised.\u201cI knew it. I knew this would happen to me,\u201d she said, now within a couple of inches of Mr. Mook\u2019s ashen face. \u201cThey were never going to let me be president.\u201dIn July 2013, Jill Abramson, the former executive editor of The New York Times, put me on the \u201cHillary beat\u201d ahead of the 2016 election. It was 649 days before Mrs. Clinton would announce she was running for president again, 1,226 days before she would lose to Mr. Trump.Every major life decision in my 20s and 30s \u2014 when to get married, where to buy an apartment, whether to freeze my eggs until after the election \u2014 had revolved around a single looming question: What about Hillary Clinton?I figured that if anyone knew whom Mrs. Clinton was referring to with that insidious \u201cthey\u201d that, like some invisible army of adversaries (real and imagined), wielded its collective power and caused her to lose the most winnable presidential election in modern history, it was me.And yes, they were political reporters (\u201cbig egos and no brains,\u201d she called us) hounding her about her emails and transfixed by the spectacle of the first reality TV show candidate.It\u2019s dizzying to realize that without even knowing it, you\u2019ve ended up on the wrong side of history. Months after the election, every time I heard the words \u201cRussia\u201d and \u201ccollude,\u201d this realization swirled in my head, enveloping everything.And the strange thing is, Oct. 7, 2016, started just like any other day.The Times newsroom had been quiet that afternoon. Then, around 4 p.m., I heard \u201cOh, my God,\u201d and \u201cOh, God,\u201d and \u201cJesus Christ\u201d float from cubicle to cubicle until my largely agnostic colleagues sounded like a Sunday church choir. The Washington Post had published video of the Republican nominee for president bragging about sexually assaulting women.I stared into my screen, as frozen as the paused image of Mr. Trump and Billy Bush stepping off the bus, the unknowing actress in the fuchsia halter dress waiting to greet them.I was still in this haze at 4:32 p.m. when WikiLeaks tweeted a link to emails from the Gmail account of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta, including excerpts from her speeches to Wall Street firms.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s refusal to release the speeches had been such a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre in the Democratic primary that I regularly saw protesters holding signs that said, \u201cI\u2019d rather be at home reading your Goldman Sachs speeches.\u201d Now the juicy parts of this most sought-after trove of documents had landed in our laps.But it wasn\u2019t a scoop. It was more like a bank heist.Editors and reporters huddled to discuss how to handle the emails. Everyone agreed that since the emails were already out there \u2014 and of importance to voters \u2014 it was The Times\u2019s job to \u201cconfirm\u201d and \u201ccontextualize\u201d them. I didn\u2019t argue that it appeared the emails were stolen by a hostile foreign government that had staged an attack on our electoral system. I didn\u2019t push to hold off on publishing them until we could have a less harried discussion. I didn\u2019t raise the possibility that we\u2019d become puppets in Vladimir Putin\u2019s master plan. I chose the byline.The Bernie Bros and Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter trolls had called me a donkey-faced whore and a Hillary shill, but nothing hurt worse than my own colleagues calling me a de facto instrument of Russian intelligence. The worst part was, they were right.A few weeks before Election Day, I was stuck in my cubicle poring over John Podesta\u2019s emails. I wanted to be on the road. \u201cI just feel like the election isn\u2019t happening in my cubicle,\u201d I said. \u201cBut it\u2019s over,\u201d an editor replied, reminding me that the Times\u2019s Upshot election model gave Mrs. Clinton a 93 percent chance of winning. The ominous \u201cthey\u201d who would keep the glass ceiling intact didn\u2019t look that powerful then.Until the last day on the road, though, it never really felt like a winning campaign. Not that I thought Mr. Trump would win. I believed in the data. Yet I couldn\u2019t shake the nagging sensation that no matter how many people I\u2019d met in black churches and union halls and high school gyms around the country who told Hillary Clinton their problems, no matter how many women chanted, \u201cDeal me in!\u201d in unison, she wouldn\u2019t win.I looked around at a get-out-the-vote rally in Akron, Ohio. It was just over a month until Election Day. Dozens of empty chairs sat in the press area. Extension cords dangled unused off folding tables. Cherry pickers set up to give photographers an aerial shot sat idle.The first woman with a real shot at the presidency, then able to capture the world\u2019s attention with a single flip of sirloin, hardly registered by the time voting approached.I always figured that this was just how Hillary Clinton would win. It was the painful logic always at work for her: She was expected to project the iron of a commander in chief, the warmth of a best girlfriend and the charisma of a drinking buddy. And if she had somehow done all of that, there would still be some essential quality she lacked, in many people\u2019s minds, because we simply had no template for a female president. The long-suffering feminist heroine would make history not in a festooned lovefest but in a dreary, mechanical slog.By late fall, the traveling press \u2014 called \u201cthe Girls on the Bus\u201d since on any given day, of our cohort of about 20 regular reporters, as many as 18 of us were women \u2014 were calling it Hillary\u2019s Death March to Victory.She went through the motions. \u201cHello [insert swing-state city here]!\u201dShe did a whole riff on making lists. \u201cI have a plan for just about everything,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, maybe this is a woman thing. We make lists, right? I love making lists. And then I love crossing things off!\u201dIf I had to identify a single unifying force behind Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy, it was her obvious desire to get the whole thing over with. \u201cThis election is 10 days away,\u201d she said at a rally in Des Moines. \u201cEleven, but we\u2019re more than halfway through today.\u201dWhen I started covering Mrs. Clinton in 2007 for The Wall Street Journal, she\u2019d been a hands-on senator constantly in touch with her upstate constituents. But by her second campaign, she seemed like Rip Van Winkle, awake again after her stint as secretary of state to find a vastly different country. She\u2019d missed the rise of the Tea Party. She\u2019d missed the Occupy Wall Street movement and the rage over health care and bank bailouts and the 1 percent.Her consultants contemplated what to call this curious specimen of 121 million Americans who were technically middle class. Everyday Americans! It even sounded like Walmart\u2019s Everyday Low Prices.\u201cEveryday Americans need a champion and I want to be that champion,\u201d Mrs. Clinton repeated this corporate catchphrase for several months until her campaign tested 84 possible replacement slogans.It didn\u2019t take long before we\u2019d turned Everydays into a proper noun. When the traveling press needed to get past the barricades to talk to voters, it was \u201cC\u2019mon, my editors need me to quote some Everydays.\u201d Or when a line of women snaked around outside an event in North Charleston, S.C., we\u2019d ask the campaign, \u201cWhat\u2019s the crowd count on the Everydays who couldn\u2019t get inside?\u201dEven the Brooklyn campaign headquarters weren\u2019t immune. When Chelsea Clinton requested a private plane to fly to an event, Mr. Podesta shrugged. \u201cShe\u2019s not an Everyday American,\u201d he said.Now we have an administration with hardly an everyday American in it. We are all living through the chaos of the Trump presidency, and Robert Mueller continues to dig into the possibility of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Hillary Clinton has settled into a surreal life of speaking at women\u2019s conferences. I\u2019ve started to see the \u201cthey\u201d she spoke about on election night differently.They were Facebook algorithms and data breaches. They were Fake News drummed up by Vladimir Putin\u2019s digital army. They were shadowy hackers who stole her campaign chairman\u2019s emails hoping to weaken our democracy with Mr. Podesta\u2019s risotto recipe. And they were The Times and me and all the other journalists who covered those stolen emails.Of course, these outside forces wouldn\u2019t have mattered or weighed so heavily on me, on the country, had Hillary Clinton, her campaign and her longtime aides \u2014 the same box of broken toys who\u2019d enabled all of her worst instincts since the 1990s \u2014 not let the election get so close in the first place. The Russians, after all, didn\u2019t hack into her calendar and delete the Wisconsin rallies.I never told anyone this, but one time when I\u2019d been visiting the Brooklyn campaign headquarters I found an iPhone in the women\u2019s restroom. I wasn\u2019t sure, but it seemed to belong to Mr. Podesta\u2019s assistant because when I picked it up, a flood of calendar alerts for him popped up. I placed it on the sink counter, went into the stall, came out and washed my hands. I left the phone sitting there, worried that if I turned it in, even touched it again, aides would think I had snooped. This seemed a violation that would at best get my invitation to the headquarters rescinded and at worst get me booted off the beat for unethical behavior.I can\u2019t explain why, in the heat of breaking news, I thought covering John Podesta\u2019s hacked emails was any different.Amy Chozick is a writer at large for The New York Times and the author of the book \u201cChasing Hillary,\u201d from which this essay is adapted.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Memorial to War Dead, Israel Avoids Addressing Its Conflicts", "Date": "2018-04-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 When Israel\u2019s leaders gather on Wednesday at the country\u2019s new National Memorial Hall for Israel\u2019s Fallen, there will be little trace of the long battle it took to build it.The somber, annual Memorial Day ceremony will take place a day before the celebrations marking the 70th anniversary of Israel\u2019s foundation, according to the Hebrew calendar \u2014 and it took nearly that long to create the country\u2019s first national pantheon. Adjacent to the national military cemetery on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem, the Memorial Hall opened to the public without fanfare a few months ago.The product of decades of political wrangling, emotional strife and procrastination, the monument reveals little about Israel\u2019s wars with its external enemies.Instead, its minimalist design sidesteps internal conflicts over what should be memorialized, why and how, in a country still fighting its battles and split by deep ideological divisions. Lacking a consensus around a single national narrative, commemoration has been pared down to bare essentials.Partly dug into the mountain, the monument consists of a wall of more than 23,600 white bricks, engraved with only the sparest of details: the names of the dead and the dates they died, arranged in chronological order. It spirals around an undulating funnel of light that seems to defy gravity, reaching skyward.There are no ranks, no mention of the places or circumstances in which the soldiers perished. Using a broad definition of the fallen, it includes not only those killed in action, but also anybody who died in uniform; not only soldiers who fought for Israel, but also those who fought to create Israel.Avoiding any hierarchy of prestige or loss, privates take their place alongside generals and national heroes. No battles are deemed more or less important than others.\u201cOnce we introduced the concept of unity and equality, it solved all the problems and prevented the arguments,\u201d said Aryeh Muallem, deputy director general of the Israeli Ministry of Defense and head of its Bereaved Families, Commemoration and Heritage department.Preserving morale is considered critical in a small country where most 18-year-olds are drafted for years of compulsory military service. Last Memorial Day, about 1.5 million Israelis, or roughly one-sixth of the population, visited military cemeteries around the country.But Israelis cannot even agree on what to call some hostilities, like Israel\u2019s 1982 invasion of Lebanon, which is criticized by many here as an unjustified \u201cwar of choice.\u201d Officially called Operation Peace for Galilee, it is usually referred to as the First Lebanon War.Mr. Muallem said the memorial was the outcome of a long dialogue with representatives of bereaved families. They presented the state with a challenge, wanting their dead to be remembered individually, on the day they had fallen.So each inscribed brick has a light beside it, which is illuminated on the personal anniversary. At 11 a.m. every day, a brief remembrance ceremony is held for those killed on that date, as their names and images appear on digital screens mounted on 12 pillars. The screens, and a smartphone app, provide more information about the dead.The wall begins with rows upon rows of blank white bricks, waiting ominously for more names; the design imposes no limit. The first names a visitor sees are the most recent fatalities, and then the wall spirals back to the 1870s, commemorating the earliest casualties of the Zionist struggle and the soldiers of Zionist militias who fought and died before independence.\u201cWe decided to begin from the end, with what most speaks to us today,\u201d said Michal Kimmel-Eshkolot of Kimmel Eshkolot Architects, which designed the monument. The inscribed bricks are no higher than about six feet from the floor, she said during a recent tour of the site, \u201cso a mother can reach up and touch the name.\u201dEtan Kimmel, the chief architect of the project, wrote in the brochure that the challenge had been to create a space \u201cin a way that touches everyone, but without imposing a uniform interpretation.\u201dThat is at least partly because the issue of war dead still stirs painful debate in Israel.When it was announced last month that Miriam Peretz, who lost two sons in combat and who then dedicated herself to Zionist education, was to be awarded the Israel Prize for lifetime achievement, another bereaved mother, Nomi Miller, criticized the choice as a cynical glorification of suffering.Before the Memorial Hall, most of Israel\u2019s fallen had been commemorated in museums or monuments established by veterans of particular battles or military corps, or in private memorials scattered around the country. But about 3,000 soldiers were not memorialized anywhere.The idea for a national monument goes back to 1949, when Israel\u2019s leadership proposed erecting a tomb of the unknown soldier. But the location kept changing, and bereaved relatives had no interest in the idea, arguing that their loved ones were not anonymous, according to Prof. Maoz Azaryahu, director of the Herzl Institute for the Study of Zionism at the University of Haifa, Israel.\u201cWhen I go back, the whole story of commemoration here in Israel is about names,\u201d Professor Azaryahu said. In the new hall, \u201cmetaphorically, the bricks \u2014 the names \u2014 are the building material of the whole structure.\u201dMount Herzl became the focal point of Israeli memory, with its military cemetery and tombs of the founding fathers.But the idea for a collective monument was quietly dropped until the 1970s, when a plan was developed to build a museum of war and military heritage and a memorial complex on Mount Eitan, outside Jerusalem.Committees sat. Architects planned. Large amounts of money were invested. Historians, experts and intellectuals filled files with recommendations.\u201cThe new left wanted it to begin in 1948,\u201d said Udi Lebel, a professor of sociology at Ariel University in the West Bank and at the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies at Bar-Ilan University. \u201cOthers wanted it to begin with the Bible and Jericho.\u201dThere were arguments about how to present the consequences of the 1967 war, with some viewing the newly occupied territories as a card for peace negotiations and others as the liberation of Greater Israel. Some wanted the Mount Eitan project to lift morale and encourage service. Others worried about presenting Israel as a militaristic, Sparta-like state.The debates went on until the 1990s. By then, Israel was signing peace accords with the Palestinians and a treaty with Jordan, and many felt it was not the time to build a war museum.The push for a memorial resumed in the following decade, finally leading to construction.\u201cWhat went up in the end is a place with one function only \u2014 to give the names of the fallen,\u201d said Professor Lebel, who specializes in collective memory and the politics of bereavement, adding that even one sentence about how they died could be cause for argument.\u201cThat reflects Israel,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only consensus there can be here is empathy for the families and remembering the victims. There is no consensus over the past and we are still living the conflict.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Now he is doing the same with profit.The company, which once seemed to have only a passing interest in turning a profit, said its net income for the first quarter more than doubled. Although Amazon is best known as an internet shopping destination, its cloud computing and advertising businesses were big contributors to the jump in profit.Mr. Bezos singled out the performance of the company\u2019s cloud computing business \u2014 known as Amazon Web Services, or A.W.S. \u2014 referring in a statement to a \u201cremarkable acceleration\u201d in growth in the segment for a second consecutive quarter.Amazon often boasts of its commitment to lowering prices \u2014 part of the reason its profits have been so limited until now \u2014 but on Thursday it announced a price hike for one of its most important offerings.

Prime memberships include two-day shipping at no extra cost, a video streaming service and other benefits.Amazon\u2019s shares surged 7 percent in after-hours trading following the release of the quarterly news.The company reported that its net income for the first quarter, which ended March 31, was $1.63 billion, or $3.27 per share, compared with net income of $724 million, or $1.48 per share, in the same period last year. Revenue jumped 43 percent to $51 billion, up from $35.7 billion a year earlier.The average estimate of financial analysts, compiled by Thomson Reuters, was for revenue of $49.87 billion and earnings of $1.27 a share.\u201cThis was an unusually strong quarter for Amazon, where results came in both better for revenue and profits across the board,\u201d said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.Like Facebook, which has faced a grilling in Congress over its data protection practices, Amazon has faced criticism in Washington. President Trump has regularly slammed the company, saying it was killing jobs and not collecting enough taxes.But as with Facebook\u2019s users, Amazon\u2019s customers have apparently not been swayed by criticism of politicians, though many of Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks happened after the end of the quarter.Amazon\u2019s revenue received a big lift from the company\u2019s acquisition of Whole Foods Markets last year. The company\u2019s physical stores business, most of which is from Whole Foods, added $4.26 billion in revenue for the quarter.Revenue from A.W.S., meanwhile, rose 49 percent to $5.44 billion from the same period a year earlier.That increase is larger that what the A.W.S. business was seeing just a few quarters ago. It is unusual to see revenue growth increase significantly at Amazon\u2019s size and in a hypercompetitive market, and it seems to have prompted Mr. Bezos to single out the business in his statement.Mr. Mahaney, the RBC analyst, said, \u201cThat\u2019s rare to see him say something like that.\u201dThe increase in the cost of Prime memberships came shortly after Mr. Bezos announced, in the company\u2019s annual shareholder letter, that Amazon had more than 100 million Prime subscribers globally. During the first quarter, revenue from subscription services, including Prime, jumped 60 percent to $3.1 billion.Amazon said the price on Prime will go up on May 11 for new members, and starting June 16 for renewals of membership for existing members. The company said the increase, the first for its annual plan in four years, was the result of significantly increased costs for the service.Those include the billions of dollars that Amazon has poured into financing new television shows and movies which have been added to its video streaming service. On Thursday, it announced with the National Football League a renewed agreement for Amazon to exclusively stream Thursday night football games to Prime subscribers.In a call with financial analysts, Brian Olsavsky, Amazon\u2019s chief financial officer, said that four years ago, Prime members could receive free two-day shipping on about 20 million products from Amazon. Now that figure is 100 million.\u201cThere\u2019s all kinds of new features that we\u2019ve continually added to the Prime program,\u201d Mr. Olsavsky said. \u201cIt\u2019s much different than it was in 2014.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They are Diamond and Silk.Diamond and Silk are African-American sisters, Lynnette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson, who became known during the 2016 presidential campaign for their unwavering support of Donald J. Trump.They found a new audience this week when Republican lawmakers pressed Mr. Zuckerberg, the Facebook chief executive, on the sisters\u2019 accusation that the social media giant was discriminating against them for their beliefs. (The company says that is not true.)Here is a brief guide to Diamond and Silk and their troubles with Facebook.Mr. Zuckerberg said \u201cnothing is unsafe\u201d about their support for the president. Diamond and Silk responded to two interview requests with an email that said, \u201cStatement: We\u2019ve made contact with Facebook and are looking to get this matter resolved.\u201dOn Thursday, a Facebook spokeswoman said the note the company had sent to the two women should not have been sent and was a result of a communications problem, not a partisan bias. She also said any dip in their traffic was caused by new policies that show Facebook users more posts from friends and fewer from public pages.She said Facebook was investigating how the note came to be written and sent.Bree Newsome, an artist and activist, described them in an interview as \u201ca modern-day minstrel show\u201d aimed at \u201cwhite conservatives who want to believe Trump can\u2019t be racist or they themselves can\u2019t be racist because there are these two black women named Diamond and Silk who are constantly rooting for Trump.\u201dMs. Newsome said their performances relied on \u201cstereotypical images of black women\u201d that would not be celebrated on conservative media if they were not Trump supporters.Keith Boykin, an adjunct professor at Columbia University and a former White House aide to President Bill Clinton, offered a similar critique.\u201cIf these two women, the way they speak, the way they talk and act and behave, were saying anything that was contradictory to Trump, the Trump supporters who defend them would be the first to attack them,\u201d Mr. Boykin said.Mr. Boykin said their conservative fans, who are often quick to note their race and gender, \u201conly want to listen to the people who reaffirm their narrow, limited vision of what blackness is all about and how black people should perceive white people and specifically how they should perceive Donald Trump.\u201dThe White House did not respond to an email asking that question on Thursday. But in the past Mr. Trump has said he is a fan of Diamond and Silk.\u201cI turn on my television one night and I see these two on television,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cI say they are the greatest, what is it?\u201dMr. Trump then asked them to \u201cdo a little routine.\u201d The sisters took the microphone and obliged.\u201cThe silent majority has spoken, baby!\u201d Diamond told the crowd. \u201cBuild that wall, Donald J. Trump!\u201dAn earlier version of a video caption with this article described Facebook\u2019s actions incorrectly.

My Whole Family", "Date": "2018-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySocial Q\u2019sFifteen years ago, after my parents\u2019 deaths and a bad real estate deal, I fell out with my two siblings. None of us have spoken since. One lives across town, the other across country. Five years ago, I crafted a letter calling for reconciliation without blame. No response \u2014 which hurt. Since then, when people ask if I have siblings, I say no. I used to feel guilty, but now it\u2019s freeing. Some people know I have siblings. I\u2019d hate for them to think I\u2019m a liar, but it feels true to me. And I want to avoid explanations. Thoughts?ANONYMOUSThe lie I tell most often \u2014 generally on airplanes, where I do my best lying \u2014 is that my mother is still alive: I\u2019m on my way to visit her, or just coming back. She\u2019s been dead for three years. Still, there is comfort in that lie, of living in a world where parents don\u2019t die, where we don\u2019t become estranged from siblings or old friends.I suspect your lie is similar, so I\u2019m poorly placed to fault you. Denying your siblings\u2019 existence means you never wounded each other. They never ignored your heartfelt letter. And perhaps you find comfort \u2014 or at least, an absence of pain \u2014 in their oblivion.But your lie also signals that this conflict weighs heavily on you. Lies are hard work. (And you could easily admit your siblings\u2019 existence without a word of the estrangement.) Here\u2019s my two-pronged advice: Keep lying if it helps. But consider asking the sibling who lives across town to go for a walk with you. No global reconciliation required \u2014 just a walk some day when the weather is fine. I think you\u2019d enjoy it.My boyfriend and I were traveling to Mexico to celebrate his mother\u2019s 60th birthday. His parents arrived on Wednesday; we were flying on Thursday morning. When we got to the gate, the airline offered us $2,200 (each!) to switch to a later flight that day. I wanted the cash; my boyfriend wanted to get to Mexico ASAP. A tiff ensued. He didn\u2019t want to upset his parents. I didn\u2019t want to lose out on a month\u2019s rent for a slight travel inconvenience. (He\u2019d bought the tickets.) Was I greedy, or was he foolish?ROBINForty-four hundred bucks is a nice chunk of change, which makes me suspect your boyfriend must have had very good reason to refuse it. Let\u2019s try on a few options for size: His parents were already annoyed that you didn\u2019t fly on Wednesday. Or they paid for the trip. Or forcing them to hang around an airport all day would have infuriated them for the rest of the weekend. (I can go on like this forever!)When you are a freebie tag-along, as you were, remind yourself: A free vacation is already pretty great. No need to get piggy about it. Then defer to your host, when possible. Here, Boyfriend was the more relevant judge of how a delay would affect his parents, and he did buy the tickets, after all. In better news: When it\u2019s your mother\u2019s 60th, accepting paid delays will be your call!An ex-boyfriend invited me for coffee to \u201cwrap things up properly.\u201d We have the same friend group; so far, we\u2019ve avoided events the other will attend. Also, I\u2019ve been dating a new guy for a year. Is it completely inappropriate for me to accept?LAURADefine \u201ccompletely.\u201d (Don\u2019t bother.) I\u2019m throwing this back to you, Laura. If one or both of you behaved so badly that there\u2019s still an open wound to be sutured (more than a year later), I\u2019m not optimistic about a cappuccino cure. Apologize (or forgive) and move on.Or if your romance simply didn\u2019t work out, and you\u2019re tired of missing parties, reply: \u201cWe tried our best! Let\u2019s just be nice when we see each other.\u201d But why meet? Still, I am not the boss of coffee dates. So, if you want a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate, say hi to your barista for me. (Just don\u2019t use \u201cwrap things up properly\u201d as a cheesy ruse to explore reconciling unless you\u2019re clear about it up front, O.K.?)My husband\u2019s brother is marrying his girlfriend. I am not super-close with her, but she\u2019s been part of my married life for four years. My husband will be the best man; their sister, a bridesmaid; and my son, the ring bearer. But I wasn\u2019t asked to be in the wedding party. I am insulted. Should I let this go or push to be included because family is important to me?ANONYMOUSOh, definitely push! And if she refuses, wreak havoc at the reception. Topple the cake! You get that I\u2019m kidding, right? If family is important to you, take pleasure in your husband\u2019s and son\u2019s roles.

The 34-year-old defense attorney had no challengers.But for his supporters who packed into a Mexican restaurant that evening, there was still something impressive to celebrate. Many in the crowd were members of the Democratic Socialists of America, or D.S.A., a group that has experienced an enormous surge of interest since the election of President Trump, even in conservative states. And Mr. Bynum was one of their own \u2014 a socialist who, along with at least 16 others, appeared on the ballot in primary races across the state of Texas.\u201cYes, I\u2019m running as a socialist,\u201d Mr. Bynum said. \u201cI\u2019m a far-left candidate. What I\u2019m trying to do is be a Democrat who actually stands for something, and tells people, \u2018Here\u2019s how we are going to materially improve conditions in your life.\u2019\u201dSupporters, many of them millennials, say they are drawn by D.S.A.\u2019s promise to combat income inequality, which they believe is tainting every facet of American life, from the criminal justice system to medical care to politics. They argue that capitalism has let them down, saddling them with student debt, high rent and uncertain job prospects. And they have been frustrated by the Democratic Party, which they say has lost touch with working people.Outrage over rising inequality has simmered for years, erupting into the Occupy Wall Street movement and the groundswell of support for Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist. But it was the election of Mr. Trump that convinced tens of thousands that both parties were broken and that the country was in need of a radical fix.\u201cWe want to see money stop controlling everything. That includes politics,\u201d said Amy Zachmeyer, 34, a union organizer who helped revive the moribund Houston chapter. \u201cThat just resonates with millennials who are making less money than their parents did, are less able to buy a home and drowning in student debt.\u201dMs. Zachmeyer, who pays about $1,000 a month in student loans, says that financial burden helped convince her to become a socialist.Those results surprised John Della Volpe, the institute\u2019s director of polling, so much that he thought they might be a mistake. He conducted a new study, this time of the general population, and got the same result.\u201cThe only group that expressed net positive support for capitalism were people over 50 years old,\u201d he said. \u201cThe largest generation of Americans in history \u2014 millennials \u2014 have lost confidence. They are interested in finding a better way.\u201dMany socialist candidates sound less like revolutionaries and more like traditional Democrats who seek a return to policies in the mold of President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal. They want single-payer health care, a higher minimum wage, and greater protections for unions. But others advocate more extreme changes, such as abolishing the prison system. In the case of Mr. Bynum, he wants an end to a cash bail system that requires people accused of crimes, even minor offenses, to pay money to be released from jail before trial.Some local Democratic Party leaders worry that talking openly about being a socialist is only going to make it harder to defeat Republican opponents. And it is unclear how many older voters, who are more likely to vote in midterm cycles, could be turned off by the idea of voting for a socialist.D.S.A., despite its criticism of the Democratic Party, does not identify itself as a third party. Instead, many members work within the party\u2019s progressive wing to support their goals.\u201cDiversity helps the party,\u201d said Christine Pelosi, a California member of the Democratic National Committee who has focused on making the party more connected to grass-roots activists. \u201cI welcome their constructive criticism.\u201dMany Democrats have begun to ask socialists for their support and adopt some of the D.S.A.\u2019s platform on health care and pay.In Pittsburgh, eight Democrats in this year\u2019s midterm cycle sought the endorsement of the local D.S.A. chapter.\u201cPeople are more willing to come out and say \u2018I\u2019m a Democratic socialist running,\u2019\u201d said Jorge Roman-Romero, 24, who helps lead a new D.S.A. chapter in Tulsa, Okla., where six Democratic candidates \u2014 four of whom were willing to run as Democratic socialists \u2014 sought the group\u2019s endorsement. \u201cIt\u2019s not a liability to say that anymore.\u201dBut others, especially among the influx of new members, want to keep their distance from the Democratic Party, which they see as hopelessly compromised by corporate donations.\u201cThe new, younger people are much more willing to say \u2018We\u2019re not going to tie ourselves to the Democratic Party,\u2019\u201d said Frances Reade, 37, an education researcher who joined the East Bay D.S.A. chapter in California on Mr. Trump\u2019s Inauguration Day. \u201cAt the same time, we\u2019re nowhere near being able to launch a third party.\u201d\u201cIf, after the election, I had tried to join the Democratic Party, what would I have done?\u201d she asked. \u201cThere\u2019s no night school to learn more about ideas. The Democratic Party is essentially a fund-raising apparatus.\u201dBy the 1950s, socialism was widely seen as antithetical to the American way of life. In 1982, Michael Harrington, author of \u201cThe Other America,\u201d a seminal book about poverty, helped found the Democratic Socialists of America, which aimed to realign the Democratic Party toward increased protections for unions and the poor. But the group never gained much traction, until now.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of power in getting people to come together and do things together,\u201d said Bryan LaVergne, 22, a biomedical researcher in Houston who became a socialist after a drug therapy he had been working on was purchased by a private company that increased the price.\u201cHouston is incredibly atomizing,\u201d Mr. LaVergne said. \u201cWe sit in our cars, drive to our suburbs, don\u2019t know our neighbors. We\u2019re countering that.\u201dMr. Bynum, the candidate for judge in Houston, approaches politics in that same spirit. He collected nearly all of the signatures required for his campaign outside the county jail, from family members of defendants who could not afford to post bail. He has forsworn donations from lawyers practicing before the court that he is running for, and intends to staff a table outside the jail during the campaign, with the help of D.S.A. volunteers.He wants his campaign to highlight injustices in Harris County, where historically roughly 40 percent of defendants in misdemeanor court were kept in jail because they could not pay bail.But the Harris County Democratic Party is struggling to figure out what to make of Mr. Bynum, who they say stands a good chance of being elected, along with other Democrats on the local ballot in November. Mr. Bynum\u2019s Republican opponent, Dan Simons, a former prosecutor backed by religious conservatives, is already fund-raising under the slogan \u201cReject socialism.\u201dGerald Birnberg, a former chairman of the Harris County Democratic Party, has discouraged Mr. Bynum from talking about socialism or bail reform on the campaign trail. Socialism is too taboo in Texas, he said. And although bail reform is important, he said, \u201cit\u2019s not an issue that inspires voters in Harris County.\u201dThe way to win in November, Mr. Birnberg advised, was simply to turn out Democrats. To do that, the county Democratic Party needed money to pay for mailings and voters lists. In a meeting, Mr. Birnberg, a 71-year-old lawyer, asked Mr. Bynum to contribute $20,000 to the effort.Mr. Bynum made no promises.\u201cIf I have the money, I will give them money because I can\u2019t organize a get-out-the-vote campaign by myself,\u201d Mr. Bynum said. \u201cBut I am focused more on building a movement than I am on helping Democrats get elected. My priority is reaching people who aren\u2019t being spoken to at all.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Our Journalism Is Like a Car Crash (Wait, That Didn\u2019t Come Out Right)", "Date": "2018-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTo give some credit to John Seabrook, a staff writer at The New Yorker, there was probably a pause of at least several minutes between the car crash that nearly killed him and his decision to convert it into magazine content. Hours, even.We mention it as an excuse to talk craft a little. If you like reading about how people think about their jobs, maybe this will be of interest.Mr. Seabrook writes his article in a way that does explicitly, using hard science, what we often try to do more implicitly, using social science.Like many New Yorker articles, it is structured as a straight chronology, telling the story of his crash from start to finish. But, at a few key moments, Mr. Seabrook interrupts the narrative to deeply explain the science behind what\u2019s happening in the crash.The car crash becomes a device for getting readers to care about long sections on, say, the molecular physics of black ice and other such topics, which are the actual meat of the article.There\u2019s something else Mr. Seabrook does that resonated with us. His article is animated by his own curiosity about the things around him. He hits a patch of black ice and, as narrator, expresses an immediate desire to learn how it forms and why it\u2019s so dangerous. But he follows his curiosity to the wider world, considering bigger questions like the physics of ice or how road authorities detect and prevent its spread.But that takes a few steps when it comes to matters of hard science. It\u2019s a winding route from asking why black ice is so slippery to quizzing a physicist on the delineation between liquid and solid.With social science, the leap from the particular to the universal is immediate. And that\u2019s part of what we love about it. Because what is social science if not the search for universal truths and laws governing the forces that otherwise feel particular to our own individual lives, clans or countries?Our equivalent of getting into a car crash might be, for instance, encountering the politics of white backlash in our personal lives. It makes us curious about where that anger comes from, which eventually leads us to small-town Germany, to find a car crash through which to tell the story.Another example might be hearing friends express fear about terrorism, though, statistically, it poses little threat to them. We get curious about how that fear works and why it\u2019s so much more severe than fear of something deadlier such as, say, car crashes.Another: logging on to Facebook and experiencing the same bad feelings it seems to bring so many users, and wondering what those feelings mean for society.These are the sorts of questions for which everyone has a guess. The great thing about social science is that it means we don\u2019t have to guess. We can study the issues empirically. We can approach them the way that Mr. Seabrook thinks about the black ice sliding under car tires: as not just the cause of one particular crash, but as a universal phenomenon to be explicated and understood.Those phenomena are a little less obvious when they exist in the realm of social science, but we think they\u2019re pretty interesting. We hope you\u2019ll find, like us, that once you start to notice those hidden moments of social science, you quickly realize that they\u2019re everywhere. And you\u2019ll find that the world is even more interesting than you\u2019d thought.Advertisement"}

Two others are scholars \u2014 one studies accounting, the other agriculture \u2014 who taught at a prestigious science and technology university before they were arrested in 2017 on suspicion of \u201chostile acts.\u201dAll three are Korean-American men who were held in North Korea until Wednesday, when they were released during a visit by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital.The three former detainees share a common surname, Kim, but they are not related. Their release removes a point of tension as President Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, prepare for their summit meeting, the first face-to-face encounter by the top leaders of the two nations.On Wednesday, Mr. Trump, called the three released Americans were \u201cwonderful gentlemen,\u201d who, he said, \u201cseem to be in good health.\u201dHere is what is known about the three former detainees.The university said in a statement that he had been doing agricultural development work at its research farm and was arrested after a trip there.According to CNN, Mr. Kim, an ethnic Korean, was born in Jilin, China, near the North Korean border, and emigrated to the United States in the 1990s. After becoming an American citizen, the network said, Mr. Kim returned to China and studied agriculture at Yanbian before moving to Pyongyang, the capital.The Pyongyang University of Science and Technology, where Kim Hak-song and another detainee, Tony Kim, worked before their detention, said on Wednesday its leadership and international faculty rejoiced over the news, thanking diplomats who have worked for the Americans\u2019 release.\u201cAll three men have been daily in our thoughts; and our hopes and prayers have been fulfilled by their release,\u201d the school said in a statement. \u201cOn behalf of the PUST community, the leadership wants to express our sincere hope that our two co-workers and Mr. Kim Dong-chul can now enjoy some peace and rest with their families and friends; and begin to rebuild normal life.\u201d\u201cThe cause of his arrest is not known, but some officials at P.U.S.T. told me his arrest was not related to his work at P.U.S.T.,\u201d Mr. Park told Reuters. \u201cHe had been involved with some other activities outside P.U.S.T., such as helping an orphanage.\u201dMr. Kim, who is in his 50s, had previously taught at Yanbian University of Science and Technology, an affiliated institute in the Chinese province of Jilin, near the North Korean border.

{"Headline": "Israeli Leader Is Forced to Retreat on African Migrant Deal", "Date": "2018-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 In a head-spinning turnaround, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel announced on Monday that he had reached an extraordinary deal with the United Nations refugee agency to resettle thousands of African asylum seekers in Western countries. Within hours Mr. Netanyahu suspended the deal after coming under heavy criticism from his coalition partners.The flip-flop appeared to reflect Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s fear of losing support from those partners or from his right-wing constituency, who call the asylum seekers infiltrators and want them gone. His opponents on the left described the prime minister\u2019s behavior as an embarrassing and cowardly surrender under pressure.If the deal with the United Nations refugee agency bought Israel some international good will, diverting attention from Friday\u2019s flare-up along the border with Gaza when Israeli forces killed at least 15 Palestinians and wounded many more, the effect was short-lived.The agreement with the United Nations was meant to replace a contentious Israeli plan that had offered the migrants a stark choice: forced deportation to Africa or prison. That plan fell through after Rwanda, the African country meant to receive the deportees, announced that it would accept only those who left Israel voluntarily.In the afternoon, in a televised news conference, Mr. Netanyahu triumphantly announced the new deal, under which the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees committed to persuading countries in the West to take at least 16,250 migrants over five years, while Israel would grant official status as temporary residents to most who remained.Estimates of the population of African asylum seekers in Israel, mostly from Eritrea and Sudan, range from 35,000 to 39,000.But the agreement to let many stay in Israel drew harsh criticism from some of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing coalition allies, who were taken by surprise. Naftali Bennett, the education minister and leader of the far-right Jewish Home party, said the deal would \u201cturn Israel into an infiltrator\u2019s paradise.\u201dMr. Netanyahu backtracked.He said he was suspending the deal with the United Nations refugee agency pending a meeting on Tuesday morning with the veteran residents of south Tel Aviv, where many of the African migrants are concentrated, and that he would then review the understandings reached with the agency.The European Union\u2019s delegation in Israel was incredulous.The New Israel Fund accused Mr. Netanyahu of lying, saying the organization, which has offered support for the asylum seekers in Israel, \u201chad nothing to do with Rwanda\u2019s decision to refuse to participate in the Prime Minister\u2019s cruel mass deportation plan.\u201d\u201cIt is pathetic, shameful, and a stain on Israel in the global arena that the Prime Minister would blame Israel\u2019s human rights defenders for his ineptitude and his immoral policies,\u201d the New Israel Fund said in a statement.Earlier, at the news conference, Mr. Netanyahu revealed details of the new deal.\u201cThe agreement states that for every person who leaves, one will stay,\u201d he said, noting that the refugee agency would be financing the departure. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good solution, a proper solution.\u201dThe plan was to be carried out in three phases, with the first 6,000 migrants expected to leave over the next 18 months.William Spindler, a spokesman for the United Nations refugee agency in Geneva, said there was no agreement in place with other countries to take any of them. He said that the agency would need countries to come forward with offers, but that \u201cwe are confident we will be able to find places for these 16,000 people.\u201dMr. Netanyahu explained to the Israeli public that he had come to the arrangement with the United Nations after it became clear that sending the migrants to Rwanda was no longer an option. \u201cWe were in a catch,\u201d he said, \u201cmeaning they would all have remained here.\u201dAs part of the new plan, the Israeli government and the United Nations refugee agency said they would encourage a more balanced distribution of the asylum seekers who remain in Israel. That effort would include vocational training, job placement, and help with integrating into new communities.The issue of the African asylum seekers has long roiled Israeli society.From 2005 until 2012 about 60,000 surreptitiously crossed into Israel over the once-porous border with Egypt. Under international conventions, Eritrean and Sudanese asylum seekers could not be sent back to their home countries, where they could face persecution.Anger built up among many longtime residents of south Tel Aviv, who complained that the migrants had brought crime and made their neighborhood unlivable. Other Israelis volunteered to help the migrants. Many passed through a remote detention center in the Negev desert.The government stopped the flow by building a steel barrier along the border and by making life for the migrants in Israel increasingly uncertain and uncomfortable. Few asylum seekers have received refugee status. Government ministers routinely call them \u201cinfiltrators\u201d and economic migrants who threaten Israel\u2019s future as a Jewish state.At least 20,000 have left Israel, and Mr. Netanyahu said he had made it his mission to deport the rest.Stickers appeared in pubs, cafes and other establishments saying, \u201cThis business opposes the expulsion of asylum seekers,\u201d and citing biblical verses like Leviticus 19:34: \u201cThe stranger who resides among you shall be to you as one of your citizens; you shall love him as yourself, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.\u201dNick Cumming-Bruce contributed reporting from Geneva.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Thinks It Has a Fix for the Problems It Created: Blockchain", "Date": "2018-04-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Worried about someone hacking the next election? Bothered by the way Facebook and Equifax coughed up your personal information?The technology industry has an answer called the blockchain \u2014 even for the problems the industry helped to create.Now, countless entrepreneurs, companies and governments are looking to use similar databases \u2014 often independent of Bitcoin \u2014 to solve some of the most intractable issues facing society.\u201cPeople feel the need to move away from something like Facebook and toward something that allows them to have ownership of their own data,\u201d said Ryan Shea, a co-founder of Blockstack, a New York company working with blockchain technology.Blockchain allows information to be stored and exchanged by a network of computers without any central authority. In theory, this egalitarian arrangement also makes it harder for data to be altered or hacked.Most of the projects have not gotten beyond pilot testing, and many are aimed at transforming mundane corporate tasks like financial trading and accounting. But some experiments promise to transform fundamental things, like the way we vote and the way we interact online.\u201cThere is just so much it can do,\u201d said Bradley Tusk, a former campaign manager for Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, who has recently thrown his weight behind several blockchain projects. \u201cI love the fact that you can transmit data, information and choices in a way that is really hard to hack \u2014 really hard to disrupt and that can be really efficient.\u201dMr. Tusk, the founder of Tusk Strategies, is an investor in some large virtual currency companies. He has also supported efforts aimed at getting governments to move voting online to blockchain-based systems. Mr. Tusk argues that blockchains could make reliable online voting possible because the votes could be recorded in a tamper-proof way.\u201cEverything is moving toward people saying, \u2018I want all the benefits of the internet, but I want to protect my privacy and my security,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThe only thing I know that can reconcile those things is the blockchain.\u201dBlockchains assemble data into so-called blocks that are chained together using complicated math. Since each block is built off the last one and includes information like time stamps, any attempt to go back and alter existing data would be highly complicated. In the original Bitcoin blockchain, the data in the blocks is information about Bitcoin wallets and transactions. The blocks of data in the Bitcoin blockchain \u2014 and most of its imitators \u2014 are kept by a peer-to-peer computer network.These experiments have drawn skepticism from Bitcoin aficionados, who say blockchains are being applied to problems that could be more easily solved with old-fashioned databases.Other critics say the rapid pace of blockchain development could lead to the same problem facing the broader tech industry: a willingness to disrupt and overthrow old systems before the replacement has been thoroughly tested.\u201cThe blockchain industry is ready and waiting to say, \u2018Yes, we are the solution,\u2019 and they have every incentive to do so,\u201d said Angela Walch, a research fellow at the Center for Blockchain Technologies at University College London. \u201cBut somebody needs to ask the question: \u2018Is it actually better? Is it measurably better?\u2019\u201dMany blockchain projects opened themselves to criticism and regulatory scrutiny by raising money through so-called initial coin offerings last year. These fund-raising campaigns often brought in tens of millions of dollars in minutes with little regulatory oversight.But new blockchain efforts continue apace, motivated in no small part by concerns about the emergence of internet giants like Facebook and YouTube.Most of the biggest internet companies make their money from collecting personal information and using it to sell targeted advertisements. This kind of massive data collection makes them vulnerable to hackers and outsiders who want to leverage the data \u2014 as was evident when Cambridge Analytica improperly gained access to 50 million Facebook profiles. And start-ups are using the blockchain in an attempt to pry control of all that data out of their hands.Blockstack has built a way to record the basic details about your identity on a blockchain database and then use that identity to set up accounts with other online projects that are built on top of it.The animating force behind the project is that users \u2014 rather than Blockstack or any other company \u2014 would end up in control of all the data they generate with any online service.Blockstack is one of several blockchain-based projects hoping to create a new generation of online services that don\u2019t rely on having unfettered access to our personal information.The idea has gained enough steam that in the days after news of Facebook\u2019s relationship with Cambridge Analytica broke, Twitter was filled with people calling for blockchain-based alternatives.Even blockchain advocates say the hype has conditioned people to think that good answers are close at hand, when it could take five or 10 years for the technology to properly develop.In fact, most blockchain projects are still plagued by concerns about privacy. For example, the widely used Bitcoin blockchain allows certain data \u2014 details of the transactions between users \u2014 to be seen by anyone, even if other data \u2014 the users\u2019 identities \u2014 remains obscured. Voting start-ups have solved this by encrypting the data before putting it on a blockchain, but there are questions about whether this will solve other privacy concerns.Blockchain-based accounts also rely on users keeping their own passwords or private keys, which people are famously bad at doing. With Bitcoin, when people lose their private key they lose access to the money in their account \u2014 if someone lost the private key to a blockchain-based online account, they could lose access to their identity.\u201cWe\u2019re not saying that tomorrow you can flip the switch and a blockchain is going to solve these problems,\u201d said Michael Casey, a co-author of \u201cThe Truth Machine,\u201d a new book on the blockchain. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is how it opens the door to a new way of thinking about the problems we face.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Spotify\u2019s Wall Street Debut Is a Success", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpotify is a hit.On its first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the music streaming service finished with a valuation of $26.5 billion. The share price closed at $149.01, giving Spotify a market value similar to that of companies like M&T Bank and General Mills.\u201cThere\u2019s a healthy appetite among public market investors for streaming media assets,\u201d said Rob Sanderson, an analyst at MKM Partners.The stock opened trading at $165.90, meaning that Spotify was valued at $29.5 billion to start the day, before declining gradually through the afternoon.Among Wall Street traders, Spotify\u2019s debut as a public company drew attention for the way it decided to list its shares. It went with a so-called direct listing approach, a rare process that eschewed the usual circus \u2014 and safeguards \u2014 of a standard initial public offering.Typically, a company lists its shares publicly as part of a broader plan to raise fresh cash for acquisitions or other investments. Spotify chose not to raise any new funds by issuing shares, which would have diluted the value of existing stakes owned by shareholders.Instead, the company is taking existing shares and allowing them to be traded on the exchange. That allows longtime shareholders \u2014 like investors and employees \u2014 to sell their shares on the exchange immediately, though for years an active secondary market has existed for Spotify stock.The Stockholm-based company, which was founded in 2006 and went online in 2008, said it did not need to raise any new cash from investors, citing the roughly $1.84 billion it had on hand at the end of 2017.Daniel Ek, the company\u2019s chief executive and co-founder, characterized Spotify\u2019s manner of going public as perfectly in keeping with the company\u2019s self-image as a disrupter.\u201cWhile I appreciate that this path makes sense for most, Spotify has never been a normal kind of company.\u201dSpotify\u2019s direct listing approach was still seen as risky. Without underwriting banks acting as \u201cstabilizing agents,\u201d and without millions of newly issued shares to guarantee liquidity, the process for setting an opening price proved slow and complex. The stock did not begin trading until 12:43 p.m., the latest start for any company ever listed on the New York Stock Exchange, according to Kristen Kaus, a spokeswoman for the exchange.Afterward, the day went without a glitch, with Spotify achieving a trading volume of 30 million.\u201cIt was a safe landing,\u201d said Santosh Rao, the head of research at Manhattan Venture Partners. \u201cPeople thought this was going to be chaotic, but it was smooth.\u201dSpotify\u2019s arrival on the market followed the Wall Street debut of Dropbox last month, when the cloud storage company\u2019s shares jumped 36 percent on its first day of trading. Dropbox closed Tuesday at $31.59, far above its I.P.O. price of $21 a share.Taken together, the new offerings amount to a bright spot for a technology sector that has been badly beaten up by investors this year. Amid growing concern over trade tensions with China and possible regulatory scrutiny of Facebook, technology shares shed roughly $450 billion in market capitalization between March 12, the peak of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 tech sector, and Monday.Advertisement"}

Contributing filmmakers include Errol Morris, Laura Poitras, Alex Gibney, Casey Neistat, Lucy Walker, Roger Ross Williams, Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady. Note that Op-Docs is part of the Opinion section, which is separate from the news department.While we value our established contributors, we very much encourage a diverse range of directors from all over the world, as well as first-time filmmakers, to make films for our series.What should I pitch? What should I NOT pitch?Don\u2019t pitch topics \u2014 the importance of a topic alone isn\u2019t enough! Instead, pitch specific stories, people and filmmaking approaches. We\u2019re looking for films rather than news pieces (even if there is sometimes overlap between the two). Does your documentary go beyond providing information to provide new levels, unexpected insight or a mind-altering creative approach? Political arguments and perspectives are welcome, but think twice about advocacy pieces that hew tightly to a particular party line or policy. Similarly, although the work of a renowned artist, musician or humanitarian may be important or interesting, please consider carefully whether a film about that person provides the story, conflict or emotion that will challenge and engage our audience.When should I pitch?What kind of support and promotion do you offer to Op-Doc filmmakers?We offer unique reach and visibility for the film and deep audience engagement around a film\u2019s topic. Upon publication, every Op-Doc appears on the Times website, mobile app and branded channels such as Facebook, Vimeo, YouTube and Snapchat, all of which have different (and overlapping) large audiences. Each Op-Doc is published with a written director\u2019s statement and a filmmaker bio, and takes viewer comments. We offer prominent New York Times home page play, robust social media and email distribution, public-relations outreach and creative ways to engage readers.What kind of funding do you provide?Most projects receive a modest stipend paid upon publication. For projects requiring more support, we sometimes have grants available. To help reduce costs, we execute all text, graphics, subtitles and credits at The New York Times and can also provide access to its archives and use of a music library. Our contracts are favorable to filmmakers seeking to repurpose their Op-Docs and the underlying material for other projects (such as expanding into a feature) \u2014 or simply looking to build a broader audience for their work.Can my submission be based on a feature-length project?Yes. We consider both new works and adaptations from longer projects (whether works-in-progress or completed films). However, we don\u2019t publish excerpts, cut-downs or trailers. The Op-Doc must work as a companion piece or self-contained short film and must be worth watching even to an audience that has already seen the feature. Shorts related to features must also be published before the feature is on television, has a wide theatrical release or is available online. (See below.)Do you consider films that are already released?We require that each Op-Doc be an exclusive online premiere at nytimes.com (we ask for a 30-day exclusive and a joint copyright thereafter). We don\u2019t accept films or shorts related to features or larger projects that have been publicly posted online, broadcast on television or released theatrically. We do consider projects that have played at festivals (and encourage further festival submissions after an Op-Doc publishes).Can you provide feedback on my film or pitch?Because of the large volume of submissions, we aren\u2019t able to provide feedback on films that we don\u2019t accept for publication. We do read and watch all submissions, and strive (though can\u2019t guarantee) to respond in a timely fashion to all submissions.How long are Op-Docs?Op-Docs are typically five to 10 minutes, but we also consider longer projects (up to 40 minutes) and series.How do I submit a pitch?What\u2019s the next step?If your project is a good fit, we will follow up about your submission. (Please note it can be difficult to assess a project without a cut or representative footage.)

I, too, have been Beto-struck.I have seen the alternative to Ted Cruz \u2014 Lord knows we need an alternative to Ted Cruz \u2014 and he\u2019s a peppy, rangy, toothy progressive with ratios of folksiness to urbanity and irreverence to earnestness that might well have been cooked up in some political laboratory. Could that formula enable Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke, a Texas Democrat, to wrest Cruz\u2019s seat in the Senate from him in November?He even appeared last month on Bill Maher\u2019s HBO show, generating headlines with his response to Maher\u2019s characterization of Cruz.\u201cDon\u2019t forget,\u201d Maher said, \u201che\u2019s a giant asshole.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Beto concurred.It was a naughty swerve from his usual niceness, and over lunch in Houston on Thursday, he told me that he regretted it.\u201cI think I was just moving the conversation along,\u201d Beto said. \u201cAnyhow, I don\u2019t think that Ted Cruz is an asshole.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d I asked, incredulous.\u201cI certainly don\u2019t think that publicly,\u201d he answered.Cruz is a rare and precious gift. He\u2019s so loathed that any passable Democrat with a picayune chance of toppling him was bound to draw more attention and inspire more hope than the political dynamics warranted. While President Trump\u2019s unpopularity endangers his party\u2019s incumbents far and wide and Texas may indeed be getting bluer, the state has been very red for very long. The last time a Democrat won statewide office was 24 years ago.But Beto is more than passable. Many of his campaign events are mobbed. People line up for selfies and then insist on hugs.\u201cEven the most skeptical person has to acknowledge that there\u2019s something going on here,\u201d Jim Henson, the director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin, told me. \u201cBut is it something that can overcome the deep hole that any Democratic candidate in this state is in?\u201dBeto\u2019s answer to those odds is an oddball campaign. This has freed him to be freewheeling. He has no speechwriter, because he never speaks from a fixed script. He has no pollster, because he\u2019s not going by polls.\u201cNo political consultant worth their salt would allow us to go to college campuses, because young people don\u2019t vote,\u201d he told a group of Latino leaders during a meeting on Thursday that I accompanied him to. \u201cThat\u2019s why we don\u2019t have a political consultant.\u201dHis next event, in fact, was at the University of Houston.He was driving himself from stop to stop in a rented red Dodge Caravan. There was a banana and bag of nuts beside him; his two campaign aides \u2014 the entirety of his traveling entourage \u2014 huddled with their smartphones in the back. \u201cTheir highest value in the car is cranking on stuff,\u201d he told me. The steering and navigation could be left to him.On Thursday night, viewers beheld the action-packed minutes of him refueling the Caravan. \u201cOur purchase came to $44.45,\u201d he narrated. \u201cYour contributions literally go into the gas tank.\u201dIn late January, he did a 24-hour Facebook Live beginning with a run with several hundred supporters at dawn and continuing through a chat with all-night street cleaners. (When he had to shower or such, his wife, Amy, kept viewers engaged.)I asked him why.\u201cHow do I get your attention?\u201d he answered. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen politics before. You\u2019ve seen the well-produced ads where I\u2019m holding my wife\u2019s hand and our kids are running down a hillside. You\u2019re sick of that. How do I honor what\u2019s going on now? Politics are changing dramatically. People are really looking for the most transparent, honest, direct way to connect with one another. And we\u2019re going to find it.\u201dBeto, 45, lives in El Paso, grew up there and has spent most of his life in Texas, apart from college at Columbia University, where he majored in English. He and Amy have three children, ages 7, 9 and 11. He started a small technology company before he served on the El Paso City Council and then in Congress.That background has somehow given him enough material that whenever a voter asks him a question \u2014 about health care or school safety or the treatment of veterans \u2014 he\u2019s able to draw on some personal anecdote. After a town hall meeting on Thursday, two of the attendees whom I interviewed separately used the same adjective to praise him: \u201cRelatable.\u201dHe hits so many right notes that it\u2019s eerie. During campaign swings last summer, when school was out, the family camped out at night in state parks. His two youngest kids learned all the words to George Strait\u2019s \u201cAmarillo by Morning\u201d before an event in Amarillo, which they opened with an a cappella rendition.He\u2019s quick to validate voters\u2019 ill will toward federal lawmakers, and he said, during that town hall, that only 9 percent of Americans approve of Congress. \u201cYou know that communism has an approval rating of 10 percent,\u201d he added. \u201cChlamydia is at 8 percent. So Congress is in the sweet spot. But watch out! The chlamydia lobby is working it hard and they are going to move up and surpass Congress soon.\u201dBut he\u2019s also careful to praise his colleagues in the House. \u201cThere\u2019s so much talent in the Democratic caucus,\u201d he told me, \u201cfrom Joaquin Castro to Cheri Bustos to Joe Kennedy to Hakeem Jeffries.\u201d In that one seemingly off-the-cuff sentence, he managed to include a fellow Texan, a storied dynasty, both genders and multiple regions and races.He talks about fried catfish one second, James Joyce the next. (The older of his two sons is named Ulysses.) He\u2019s fluent in classic punk rock and contemporary country. He\u2019s fluent in Spanish, too.He\u2019s clear about his beliefs that health care should be guaranteed, marijuana should be legal, Trump should be impeached and the border wall is ridiculous. That puts him to the left of many Texans. But he\u2019s just as voluble about his exhausting effort to visit every county in Texas, including the most staunchly conservative ones, and about the need for people of all political stripes to be respected.Beto is more than the anti-Cruz. He\u2019s a political fable, holding out the happy if far-fetched possibility that a candidate\u2019s effervescence matters more than a state\u2019s partisan breakdown and that gumption beats any focus group.\u201cPeople are watching,\u201d he told his town hall audience. \u201cIf we win this race in the right way, I guarantee you, it is going to change politics in the United States going forward.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The page will be updated throughout the hearings. Not quite \u2026Tuesday was the first time that Mr. Zuckerberg cited 2016 as the date when the company identified new operations linked to the election.Facebook requires people to register for accounts with their real names. But the fact is that fake accounts and false pages have persisted on the social network. False.Former employees of Cambridge Analytica have told The New York Times that they were using Facebook as early as 2014. Mr. Zuckerberg later said he had misspoken.During the hearing, Mr. Zuckerberg was shown the terms of service of the quiz app that Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, used to gather data from Facebook users. The fine print may have told users that their data could be used for commercial purposes, according to a draft of the app\u2019s terms of service that was reviewed by The Times, and which was shown to Mr. Zuckerberg by Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut. In other words, it appears that Facebook may not have regularly checked to make sure that apps complied with its rules. The final wording of the terms of service for Mr. Kogan\u2019s app is now most likely unknowable. Facebook executives said they deleted the app in December 2015 after they found out about the data harvesting.Not exactly.Facebook users who downloaded Mr. Kogan\u2019s quiz app did consent to sharing their own and their friends\u2019 information by agreeing to the app\u2019s terms and conditions. But their friends were not aware that their information had been shared and did not knowingly grant permission. \u2014 Senator Chuck Grassley, Republican of IowaMore than a million people downloaded the 2012 Obama campaign\u2019s app, which gained access to the data of supporters and their friends. Facebook users who downloaded the Obama campaign app were aware of its aims: supporting and campaigning for a political candidate. Those who downloaded the app from Mr. Kogan, however, believed they were taking a personality quiz for academic purposes and did not know that their data would end up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica.\u2014 Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of TexasA former Facebook employee told Gizmodo in 2016 that people working at the social network prevented stories about right-wing conferences and candidates from trending on Facebook. Other former employees disputed this suggestion and Gizmodo said it was \u201cunable to determine if left-wing news topics or sources were similarly suppressed.\u201d Facebook denied the allegations at the time, but the episode underscored the question of whether the social network was a media entity.Not exactly.While Facebook recently introduced a tool that allows people to download data that Facebook has collected on them, the tool appears to be incomplete. Some people have noticed that some data are missing, such as a long-forgotten feature of Facebook that lets you \u201cpoke\u201d people.Facebook now allows users to opt-out of certain categories of data, including deciding what is shared with advertisers. But certain basic data will always be shared with the company unless a Facebook account is permanently deleted by the user.While Facebook doesn\u2019t collect the content of phone calls, it has been collecting call records and SMS data from Android devices that have the Facebook app installed.

Smith, the chairman of Sinclair Broadcast Group, says the media is getting his company all wrong.His remark, in a lengthy email exchange with The New York Times, came in response to renewed scrutiny of Sinclair after a video spread rapidly showing anchors at dozens of its stations across the country reciting the same speech about media bias.Mr. Smith defended the anchors\u2019 segments, known as \u201cmust-runs,\u201d and likened them to the late-night shows that networks air on their local affiliates.\u201cNot that you would print it, but do you understand that every local TV station is required to \u2018must run\u2019 from its network their content, and they don\u2019t own me,\u201d he wrote on Tuesday. \u201cThat would be all their news programming and other shows such as late-night talk, which is just late-night political so-called comedy.\u201dIn the Sinclair-mandated segments, the anchors warned that some media outlets published fake stories. They also said they were \u201cconcerned about the troubling trend of irresponsible, one-sided news stories plaguing our country.\u201d\u201cOur commitment to factual reporting is the foundation of our credibility,\u201d the anchors added. \u201cNow more than ever.\u201dThe video was assembled by the sports news site Deadspin and posted on Saturday. Soon after it went online, it triggered an outcry on social media and prompted many critics to denounce Sinclair\u2019s practice of requiring its local television stations to air must-runs.Opponents of the deal have cited the dangers of media consolidation, as well as Sinclair\u2019s willingness to use must-runs to advance a mostly right-leaning agenda.In subsequent emails on Tuesday, Mr. Smith, said that the networks \u201cdo exactly the same promotional things that we do\u201d and that such segments were \u201cstandard practice in the industry.\u201dAsked about the widespread criticism prompted by the Deadspin compilation, Mr. Smith expressed disbelief.\u201cYou cant be serious!\u201d he wrote. \u201cDo you understand that as a practical matter every word that comes out of the mouths of network news people is scripted and approved by someone?\u201dHe also said the promotional segments \u201cwere tested by a well-recognized research firm in this industry.\u201dOn Monday, the criticism directed at Sinclair drew the attention of President Trump, who often praises media outlets that espouse his viewpoints and denounces other news organizations.Mr. Smith did not answer a question about his relationship with Mr. Trump and said he did not \u201cengage in Twitter, Facebook or other such activities and have not read anything the president has said.\u201dMr. Livingston also sent an email to employees about the video, urging \u201ccontext and perspective.\u201d\u201cI know many of you and your stations are now in the media spotlight after the launch of our corporate news journalistic responsibility promotional campaign,\u201d he wrote. He added that the \u201cfalse stories\u201d that the script referred to were \u201cunsubstantiated ones (i.e. fake/false) like \u2018Pope Endorses Trump\u2019 which move quickly across social media and result in an ill-informed public.\u201d\u201cPlease DO NOT answer any questions or get into any discussions with callers, as they try to navigate to someone internally,\u201d the general manager, Robert Truman, wrote. \u201cMost certainly don\u2019t talk to any press about this issue.\u201dThe attention on Sinclair has embarrassed, frustrated and angered current and former employees, some of whom have decided to speak out about the promo and working for Sinclair.

{"Headline": "Oaxaca on the Gowanus: The Charms and Chiles of Claro", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRestaurant Review12 PhotosWhen you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.If you love Oaxacan food and live in New York City, it helps to be mobile. About half a million Mexican-Americans live here, too, and while more have been arriving from Oaxaca in recent years, very few have opened restaurants.Claro, in other words, is not where you go for Oaxacan recipes that have been passed down from generation to generation. Home-style soups and stews are rare. So is cooked fish. On the other hand, Mr. Steele has given himself liberty to work with ingredients that might furrow the average Mexican grandmother\u2019s brow, like kale and sunchokes. Although he has lived part-time in Oaxaca City for more than a decade, he still thinks like a New York chef.But as his head-to-toe artwork suggests, Mr. Steele has a tendency to go all in. This is, as it happens, the only way to make the moles that are the pride of Oaxaca. The moles at Claro are riveting: The ground nuts and dried spices, the garlic and onions all seem to bring out the personalities of the chiles \u2014 sometimes fruity, sometimes vegetal \u2014 while tamping down their heat. He keeps their bitterness in check, too.Pork cheek was stewed in a mole rojo that has just enough chocolate to make you smile; the mole negro, in which marbled short ribs were cooked to extreme tenderness, was so balanced that no one ingredient ever seemed to be in the lead. Chichilo, not one of your everyday moles, was the brightest and most outgoing of the three, and a big pool of it made an exciting foil for a chile relleno filled with shredded, spiced duck.Mr. Steele also goes all in on masa, which is stone-ground and nixtamalized on site from strains of blue and yellow corn native to Oaxaca. Ten years ago you couldn\u2019t talk about the state of masa in New York without experiencing early signs of depression; now Claro is among a handful of local restaurants whose masa is worth getting excited about.Thicker, softer wheels of masa with raised rims make up the base of memelas, the Oaxacan version of sopes and huaraches. The one with goat-cheese crema and wild mushrooms has a meaty intensity, without any meat; another, spread with an unexpectedly fluffy hash of chorizo and potatoes, is topped with house-made queso fresco to calm the chorizo\u2019s burn.Occasionally, it can be hard to tell Claro\u2019s memelas from its tostadas. Because together they make up a substantial chunk of the menu, if you don\u2019t order carefully you can end up with a long, unbroken run of masa discs. (This is not the worst fate on earth.)The flavors at Claro tend to be finely tuned, so when a dish was out of alignment, I noticed. Beef tongue tacos would have needed a heavier glug of salsa to make up for meat that was as salty as country ham. And when the pickled-pepper sauce binding the bacon-and-octopus tostada was too sharp and sour, what had been the high point of one dinner became the low point of another \u2014 a vinegar tostada.Claro is filled with evidence of the connections Mr. Steele has made over the years in Oaxaca. The bar stocks a smoky but approachable mezcal that he imports, called El Buho. The tiles under the bar and the charcoal-toned plates and dishes are made by ceramists he met there. It\u2019s all pretty restrained; you don\u2019t get the sense he has turned the restaurant into a warehouse for crafts he bought, drunk on the exchange rate, at the artisan\u2019s market.On the wall is a mural of three goats surrounding a woman who seems to be having a bad day; she is in a caldron over a fire, and the goats look hungry. If you want to turn the tables, try to go to Claro on a night when barbecued goat is on the menu. Served with blue and yellow tortillas, red and green salsas, and a bowl of consomm\u00e9, it is more than enough to make a meal of.I ate it with one eye on the back door, thinking about what else Claro might serve when the weather is warm enough to start cooking on the wood grill every night.An earlier version of this article misstated Claro\u2019s ties to a nearby restaurant. Claro is run by one owner of Freek\u2019s Mill, not two. An earlier version also misstated the number of Oaxacan ceramists responsible for the tiles, plates and dishes at the restaurant. It was two, not one.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Reservations powered by ResyAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "European Regulators Ask if Facebook Is Taking Too Much Data", "Date": "2018-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byData. It is the gasoline that fuels advertiser-supported internet giants like Facebook and the gold that companies mine for their algorithms.Now regulators in Europe are asking whether Facebook is excessively collecting details about the online activities of internet users \u2014 in effect, forcibly extracting a valuable commodity from consumers.Until recently, few consumers stopped to consider the value of their personal information or how much of it they were forking over in exchange for free online services.They say consumers in Germany have little choice of social networks, forcing users to consent to Facebook\u2019s collection of their web-browsing data if they want Facebook accounts. According to the regulators\u2019 analysis, Facebook has a 95 percent market share of social networking in Germany.Because users in Germany lack a real choice, he added, Facebook in effect is able to extract whatever data it wants from them. \u201cThe Facebook case is really about excessive pricing vis-\u00e0-vis the consumer,\u201d Mr. Mundt said.The regulators are not trying to quantify the specific monetary value of data. German, Italian and Belgian regulators are arguing in different ways that certain Facebook data practices are unfair or misleading, not directly causing financial harm to consumers.\u201cLike Facebook, many of those services are supported by ads and offer tools to other apps and websites, then use information they collect to improve people\u2019s experience,\u201d Mr. Steinfeld said in a statement. \u201cThis is not the picture of an internet dominated by a single renegade company.\u201dHe said the company looked forward to answering questions from regulators in Italy.Marketers have long contended that consumers willingly trade their data for more customized ads and personalized services.Ms. Sekar, the start-up employee, said she had long accepted that using Facebook and Facebook-owned services like Instagram meant that the company would collect information about her for ads.But that exchange has become more complicated, she said, as new questions emerge about how consumers\u2019 data could be mined to profile and potentially manipulate them. While she is still using Facebook and Instagram and has a \u201cdecent sense\u201d of what the company collects, she added, \u201cit\u2019s probably worse than I know.\u201d\u201cIt really frustrates me that all of this is done under the guise of: \u2018Well, you made this choice. Nobody is making you sign up for Facebook,\u2019\u201d Ms. Sekar said.Some industry experts, however, said it was illogical to suggest that Facebook was overcharging in data \u2014 because consumer data does not have a face value like a dollar bill. It\u2019s a commodity with a fluctuating value, they said, depending on what it is used for.Facebook made about $84 on average per user in the United States and Canada last year and about $20 on average from users globally, up from $13.50 and $5 in 2012, the year it went public. Targeting ads to its 2.2 billion users helped Facebook generate revenue of $40.6 billion in 2017.The consumer-tracking techniques underpinning that revenue are not unique to Facebook. But the Cambridge Analytica revelations and Facebook\u2019s gargantuan online reach have put the social network in the hot seat. The company has compounded its problems by being unclear about its practices.In two days of questioning during congressional hearings this month, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, told legislators that he did not know how many data points Facebook collected about individual users or how many non-Facebook sites the company tracked users on, and he offered incomplete answers about how the tracking worked.Although Facebook allows users to opt out of seeing ads based on their use of other sites and apps, they cannot opt out of the company\u2019s collection of details about their activities on those services.\u201cWe can and will do more to help people understand how Facebook works and the choices they have,\u201d Mr. Steinfeld, the Facebook spokesman, said.Ms. Sekar\u2019s ambivalence lines up with a sense of resignation that researchers at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Annenberg School for Communication found when they asked Americans about their feelings on sharing unknown quantities of their data with companies.While much of the ad industry views the consumers from whom it extracts information as willing and informed participants, the Penn researchers say users are in the dark about what they\u2019re giving up.This year, 63 percent of consumers who responded to the researchers\u2019 questions said they wanted to have control over what companies can learn about them online, but have come to accept they have little control over that. That\u2019s up from 58 percent in 2015.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "I Downloaded the Information That Facebook Has on Me. Yikes.", "Date": "2018-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixBut when I opened my file, it was like opening Pandora\u2019s box.With a few clicks, I learned that about 500 advertisers \u2014 many that I had never heard of, like Bad Dad, a motorcycle parts store, and Space Jesus, an electronica band \u2014 had my contact information, which could include my email address, phone number and full name. Facebook also had my entire phone book, including the number to ring my apartment buzzer. The social network had even kept a permanent record of the roughly 100 people I had deleted from my friends list over the last 14 years, including my exes.There was so much that Facebook knew about me \u2014 more than I wanted to know. But after looking at the totality of what the Silicon Valley company had obtained about yours truly, I decided to try to better understand how and why my data was collected and stored. I also sought to find out how much of my data could be removed.But that\u2019s an overstatement. Most basic information, like my birthday, could not be deleted. More important, the pieces of data that I found objectionable, like the record of people I had unfriended, could not be removed from Facebook, either.Beth Gautier, a Facebook spokeswoman, put it this way: \u201cWhen you delete something, we remove it so it\u2019s not visible or accessible on Facebook.\u201d She added: \u201cYou can also delete your account whenever you want. It may take up to 90 days to delete all backups of data on our servers.\u201dDigging through your Facebook files is an exercise I highly recommend if you care about how your personal information is stored and used. Here\u2019s what I learned.A history of the steps the company took to become an advertising giant.When you download a copy of your Facebook data, you will see a folder containing multiple subfolders and files. The most important one is the \u201cindex\u201d file, which is essentially a raw data set of your Facebook account, where you can click through your profile, friends list, timeline and messages, among other features.This was unsettling. I had hoped Messenger would use my contacts list to find others who were also using the app so that I could connect with them easily \u2014 and hold on to the relevant contact information only for the people who were on Messenger. Yet Facebook kept the entire list, including the phone numbers for my car mechanic, my apartment door buzzer and a pizzeria.My Facebook data also revealed how little the social network forgets. For instance, in addition to recording the exact date I signed up for Facebook in 2004, there was a record of when I deactivated Facebook in October 2010, only to reactivate it four days later \u2014 something I barely remember doing.Facebook also kept a history of each time I opened Facebook over the last two years, including which device and web browser I used. On some days, it even logged my locations, like when I was at a hospital two years ago or when I visited Tokyo last year.Facebook keeps a log of this data as a security measure to flag suspicious logins from unknown devices or locations, similar to how banks send a fraud alert when your credit card number is used in a suspicious location. This practice seemed reasonable, so I didn\u2019t try to purge this information.But what bothered me was the data that I had explicitly deleted but that lingered in plain sight. On my friends list, Facebook had a record of \u201cRemoved Friends,\u201d a dossier of the 112 people I had removed along with the date I clicked the \u201cUnfriend\u201d button. Why should Facebook remember the people I\u2019ve cut off from my life?Facebook\u2019s explanation was dissatisfying. The company said it might use my list of deleted friends so that those people did not appear in my feed with the feature \u201cOn This Day,\u201d which resurfaces memories from years past to help people reminisce. I\u2019d rather have the option to delete the list of deleted friends for good.What Facebook retained about me isn\u2019t remotely as creepy as the sheer number of advertisers that have my information in their databases. I found this out when I clicked on the Ads section in my Facebook file, which loaded a history of the dozen ads I had clicked on while browsing the social network.Lower down, there was a section titled \u201cAdvertisers with your contact info,\u201d followed by a list of roughly 500 brands, the overwhelming majority of which I had never interacted with. Some brands sounded obscure and sketchy \u2014 one was called \u201cMicrophone Check,\u201d which turned out to be a radio show. Other brands were more familiar, like Victoria\u2019s Secret Pink, Good Eggs or AARP.Facebook said unfamiliar advertisers might appear on the list because they might have obtained my contact information from elsewhere, compiled it into a list of people they wanted to target and uploaded that list into Facebook. Brands can upload their customer lists into a tool called Custom Audiences, which helps them find those same people\u2019s Facebook profiles to serve them ads.Brands can obtain your information in many different ways. Those include:\u25a0 Getting your information in simpler ways, too. Someone you shared information with could share it with another entity. Your credit card loyalty program, for example, could share your information with a hotel chain, and that hotel chain could serve you ads on Facebook.The upshot? Even a Facebook lurker, like myself, who has barely clicked on any digital ads can have personal information exposed to an enormous number of advertisers. This was not entirely surprising, but seeing the list of unfamiliar brands with my contact information in my Facebook file was a dose of reality.I tried to contact some of these advertisers, like Very Important Puppets, a toymaker, to ask them about what they did with my data. They did not respond.Let\u2019s be clear: Facebook is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to what information tech companies have collected on me.In another folder, labeled Android, Google had a record of apps I had opened on an Android phone since 2015, along with the date and time. This felt like an extraordinary level of detail.Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.On a brighter note, I downloaded an archive of my LinkedIn data. The data set was less than half a megabyte and contained exactly what I had expected: spreadsheets of my LinkedIn contacts and information I had added to my profile.Yet that offered little solace. Be warned: Once you see the vast amount of data that has been collected about you, you won\u2019t be able to unsee it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Personal Data of 346,000 People, Hung on a Museum Wall", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Deng Yufeng wanted to create art that prods people to question their lack of data privacy. What better way, he reasoned, than to buy the personal information of more than 300,000 Chinese people off the internet and display it in a public exhibition?The police did not appreciate the irony.Last week, the authorities in the Chinese city of Wuhan shut down Mr. Deng\u2019s exhibition in a local museum after two days and told him that he was being investigated on suspicion of amassing the information through illegal means.Mr. Deng, a 32-year-old artist based in Beijing, said he hoped to get Chinese people to question that everyday scenario.\u201cWhen these nuisance text messages become a daily routine, we develop a habit of ignoring and avoiding these text messages in a numb state,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cThis is actually the mental state of most people here: a state of helplessness.\u201dLast month, Robin Li, the chief executive of the search giant Baidu, set off a firestorm when he said that Chinese people were willing to trade privacy for convenience, safety and efficiency. In December, the software developer Qihoo 360 angered many internet users when a blogger discovered that the company was taking surveillance footage from restaurants and gyms in Beijing and broadcasting it without permission onto its platform.So six months ago, Mr. Deng started buying people\u2019s information, using the Chinese messaging app QQ to reach sellers. He said that the data was easy to find and that he paid a total of $800 for people\u2019s names, genders, phone numbers, online shopping records, travel itineraries, license plate numbers \u2014 at a cost at just over a tenth of a penny per person.He said he knew he was breaking the law. He wanted to prove a point.\u201cArtists are not merely aesthetic creators,\u201d Mr. Deng said. \u201cIn the very complicated state of our world today, we should also bear social responsibility.\u201dAt his exhibition, called \u201c346,000 Wuhan Citizens\u2019 Secrets,\u201d he printed the pieces of personal data on sheets of paper using a special liquid solution. The sheets were hung in neat rows and columns on a wall. Museumgoers could only see the data under a special light source, and key identifying details were redacted.According to Mr. Deng, plainclothes police officers took him away on April 6, two days after his exhibition opened. They told him that he was being investigated for the buying of citizens\u2019 information online and was barred from leaving Wuhan. When reached for comment, a Wuhan-based police officer from the station investigating the case said she did not know anything about it and hung up.Under Chinese criminal law, Mr. Deng faces up to seven years in jail. But Raymond Wang, a lawyer who specializes in data security, said he believed it was unlikely that Mr. Deng would be sentenced because there were no \u201cdamaging consequences.\u201dWhether Mr. Deng\u2019s exhibit will catch the attention of China\u2019s leaders isn\u2019t clear. But Legal Daily, an official, government-run publication, said Mr. Deng\u2019s project showed how the existing laws on the protection of personal information were weak and enforcement was poor.\u201cThe organizer\u2019s purpose was to call for the protection of personal privacy, and he himself violated the law to purchase personal information,\u201d the newspaper wrote in an opinion piece. \u201cDue to the complexity of the plot, it will make for a lively legal lesson.\u201dThe privacy project is just one of Mr. Deng\u2019s many works of art touching on social issues. He has gone undercover to investigate the kidnappings of children, a major problem in China. He has also worked on a project on how people buy fake identification cards and guns.Mr. Deng pointed out that the lack of data privacy was also a global problem.With the help of volunteers, Mr. Deng sent about 10,000 text messages to the people whose information he used in the exhibition, inviting them to come.One of them was not amused, according to Mr. Deng, responding back: \u201cYou\u2019re sick.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Jerry Brown moves through his final months in public life, an elusive signature project \u2014 the construction of two massive water tunnels under the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, intended to salvage the state\u2019s water supply network \u2014 has seemed endangered. The $17 billion tunnels faced daunting costs and opposition from environmentalists and some Californians who saw it as another in a long line of water heists from the north by Southern California and Central Valley farmers.Mr. Brown insisted that in a time of climate change and drought the tunnels were essential to assure the integrity of a water system central to this state\u2019s economy, as it moves water to farms and the bustling, arid southern parts of the state.The project received a huge boost on Tuesday as the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California voted to commit nearly $11 billion to help finance it. It stepped in to fill a financial void created after agriculture districts in the San Joaquin Valley refused to pay for a project, deeming it to be too expensive.The Metropolitan Water District is calculating that it will recapture the money it is investing once the 35-mile tunnels are done and it has water to sell to needy farmers.Potential obstacles lay ahead, including lawsuits and regulatory permits. Still, this project \u2014 which has daunted Mr. Brown throughout his years as governor \u2014 seems as close to reality as ever. \u201cThis is a historic decision that is good for California \u2014 our people, our farms and our natural environment,\u201d he said.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s visit to Capitol Hill was highly anticipated in both Silicon Valley and Washington, and the internet was along for the ride Tuesday.There was plenty of jeering and cheering throughout the day, some inside the room and a lot more online. In one particular exchange that caught people\u2019s attention, Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah asked Mr. Zuckerberg if it was his intention to keep Facebook free. Mr. Zuckerberg responded affirmatively.\u201cWell, if so, how do you sustain a business model in which users don\u2019t pay for your service?\u201d Mr. Hatch asked. A slight pause followed.\u201cSenator, we run ads,\u201d responded Mr. Zuckerberg, his mouth suddenly curling into a big smile. Others in the room laughed. The internet dug in.\u201cTo my mind, the real issue here is transparency, it\u2019s consumer choice. Do users understand what they\u2019re agreeing to when they access a website or agree to terms of service?\u201d he said. (That video received less circulation.)Senator Richard Durbin of Illinois asked Mr. Zuckerberg if he would be comfortable sharing the hotel where he was staying in Washington.\u201cNo. I would probably not choose to do that publicly here,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.\u201cI think that may be what this is all about,\u201d Mr. Durbin said. \u201cYour right to privacy. The limits of your right to privacy.\u201dSenator John Cornyn of Texas asked about Facebook\u2019s former motto: \u201cMove fast and break things.\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg noted it had been changed.\u201cI don\u2019t know when we changed it,\u201d he replied, \u201cbut the mantra is currently \u2018move fast with stable infrastructure,\u2019 which is a much less sexy mantra.\u201dCalifornia Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Another bank takes steps toward gun safety.\u2022 The next steps in the tariffs tit-for-tat.\u2022 Investigators are looking into the motive behind the shooting at YouTube\u2019s headquarters.Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union provides pointers for investors as President Trump ratchets up trade tensions with China.In the weeks following Britain\u2019s vote in 2016 for \u201cBrexit,\u201d fears grew that the post-war economic order was under serious threat. But European stock markets recovered, including Britain\u2019s. Investors came to see that the European Union was not going to break up, and Britain was not going to erect tall walls around its economy. Looking back, the panicky early reaction to Brexit seems to have sprung more from a fear of the unknown than any big threats to the global trading system. Investors took a deep breath and gained some perspective.Movements in the United States stock market suggests the same thing is happening in response to President Trump\u2019s trade policies. China on Tuesday evening announced the tariffs it plans in retaliation against those President Trump is threatening. Reacting to China\u2019s announcement, the S.&P. 500 index plunged early on Wednesday but recovered strongly to close up 1.2 percent.Investors may believe China\u2019s move will lead to drawn-out negotiations. Here, Brexit is again illustrative. As the back and forth between the European Union and Britain has gone on, investors have gained more clarity and confidence. If talks between the U.S. and China gain steam, the uncertainty now clouding relations between the two countries may gradually clear.But the standoff between the U.S. and China differs in important ways from the Brexit tensions. The U.S., for instance, is in a much stronger position than Britain. China exports far more to the U.S. than the U.S. does to China. Limiting access to the U.S. economy could hurt China\u2019s growth at a time when it is trying to overhaul important economic sectors. If investors believe that the U.S. can successfully exploit its advantages to make China more friendly to foreign businesses, they may even see the trade skirmish as positive for the global economy.But Brexit also flashes a warning to those expecting a big win for Mr. Trump. One of the reasons that the European Union has presented a united front is that it sees Brexit as a threat to its values and goals. Similarly, China may believe that Mr. Trump\u2019s trade attack puts some of its most deeply held aspirations under threat \u2013 and will fight back hard.- Peter EavisAfter Citigroup announced plans to limit firearms sales by business customers, the question was which lenders would be the next to make a move on guns. The latest: Amalgamated Bank, the union-owned bank known for its socially minded policies.\u2022 Require gun dealers to protect merchandise from burglary and theft and refuse sales to people who appear in distress or intoxicated\u2022 Require retailers to stop selling high-capacity magazines and bump stocks\u2022 Require gun makers to \u201ccommit to developing innovations in firearms that will allow law enforcement to more easily solve gun crimes\u201dAmalgamated said that it would not only require all business customers to adhere to those guidelines but added that it won\u2019t invest any of its own money in gun manufacturers or distributors.Here\u2019s what Amalgamated\u2019s C.E.O. Keith Mestrich, said in a news release:\u201cCollectively, banks and lenders have the power to promote responsible business practices from gun manufacturers and distributors, and ultimately contribute to a safer society for all. Amalgamated will do whatever we can to achieve that goal and we hope other banks and financial institutions will agree and act.\u201dThe new figure sharply increased the company\u2019s previous estimate of how many users\u2019 information was harvested by Cambridge Analytica. The number had been put at more than 50 million users.The sharing of the user data has unleashed a torrent of criticism at Facebook, the world\u2019s largest social network. The company\u2019s stock is down sharply since The New York Times and The Observer of London reported on how Cambridge Analytica improperly acquired users\u2019 data.The company released the revised estimate of affected users in an extended statement on Wednesday about its plans for handling personal data. The company said it will start alerting users on April 9 about whether their information may have been shared with Cambridge Analytica.In related Facebook news\u2022 Earlier on Wednesday, lawmakers in Washington had said Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, would testify before the House Energy and Commerce Committee on April 11 about the company\u2019s handling of sensitive user data.And is dragging down the Dow Jones industrial average.

Boeing is the highest priced stock in the price-weighted index, which means Boeing has an outsized impact on the index\u2019s moves.Boeing\u2019s shares have served as a proxy for investor concern about a possible trade war with China since the Trump administration announced tariffs on aluminum and steel.Over that period, the stock has fallen 12 percent.The streaming-music company\u2019s shares opened at $165.90, but they steadily decline throughout their first day of trading, closing at $149.01.The stock is down 4.1 percent to $142.91 in early trading Wednesday.Because Spotify eschewed a typical initial public offering in favor of a direct listing, there is no I.P.O. price off which to base the performance of its shares. But the company\u2019s current shares price remains well above the $132.50 its private shares changed hands at earlier this year.Sony.At Tuesday\u2019s close, Sony\u2019s 5.7 percent stake was worth $1.5 billion.What may change: security in Silicon Valley.

When people join the League, they receive a message from the concierge, who is there to offer support. So you were the first person to do that job?For the first year and a half, I was the concierge. We didn\u2019t want people emailing to a support line. When you\u2019re the first touchpoint for a new tech company, every message really matters. In the beginning we were a small community. People were running out of potentials really fast. I had to encourage people to stay on and bear with us. That was a challenge, as well as telling people they need to be less picky, especially when we believe that you should absolutely be picky about education and profession. How did you tell people to be less picky diplomatically?I would tell them, you\u2019re incredible but you need to go out on more dates, meet more people, maybe date someone who is 30 miles away, maybe try to date the guy who\u2019s not as tall as you want him to be. Pick one thing that\u2019s nonnegotiable. Do people actually write to the concierge often? One in four users write in to the concierge. People want a friend in this process. They ask a lot of questions about exes, whether their ex is on the League. They try to be sneaky: \u201cCan you check if my best guy friend got in?\u201d And I do a little background research and realize it\u2019s their ex. We definitely don\u2019t provide that info.There\u2019s a lot of venting. This woman went on a date for Valentine\u2019s Day and she ended up, on Date 2, sleeping with the guy. He didn\u2019t text her back the next day, and she was livid. And she sent me this scathing review of him: \u201cHe\u2019s a 34-year-old man. There\u2019s no way this is appropriate for his age. He brought over a sleepover bag with earplugs.\u201d Two hours later she writes, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, he texted me back. We\u2019re all good.\u201dWhat else did you get questions about? People chat for an average of 34 messages before exchanging a number. I got so many questions about that. When is it appropriate to ask for her number? When is appropriate to ask her about a date? When is it appropriate to have sex? Have you ever used a dating app?I\u2019m a League success. I went on two dates a month. I didn\u2019t want to get jaded. I have friends who double stack. I wanted to limit myself. It took two years of two dates every month, and finally I met someone amazing and now we\u2019re cohabitating.How many matches do people tend to have before hitting a successful match?It\u2019s an average of 84 matches. Let\u2019s say you go out with maybe 50 percent of those. We\u2019re really the first generation to have 10-plus years to date, and not just to date, but to find ourselves. I think that\u2019s why people get angsty, just because we have so much time to do it. Our grandparents were the first generation to start marrying for love. And this generation is realizing love just isn\u2019t enough. You can have love and compatibility. How can users make their profiles the best they can be?On the League, you have six photo spots. This is basically six advertising templates. Show one photo with your family. If you don\u2019t have children, don\u2019t put your baby cousins or your nieces. If your best friend is super-attractive, more attractive than you, think about that. No sunglasses. It hides your identity and people can\u2019t relate to you when you have sunglasses on. You\u2019d be surprised how many ex-girlfriend and ex-boyfriend photos we see. Get feedback from friends. If you\u2019re a guy, ask a good girlfriend, \u201cCan you look through my Facebook photos?\u201d How did you come up with the idea for FarmersOnly.com?In 2005, I was doing agricultural marketing, and one of my clients confided in me that she recently got divorced. She was talking about how hard it is to meet someone being in a rural area and working a thousand hours a week on a farm, with no time to socialize. When you live in a small community, everybody knows everybody, and if you\u2019re not compatible with anybody in that community, it is a challenge. She said, \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll try online dating.\u201dA month later I asked her, \u201cDid you ever try online dating?\u201d She said the guys who contacted her couldn\u2019t relate to her lifestyle at all. One guy said, \u201cLet\u2019s meet at Starbucks at 8 or 9 at night.\u201d She said, \u201cFirst of all there isn\u2019t a Starbucks anywhere near me. And I have to go to bed, I have to be up at 5 in the morning to take care of the animals.\u201dWhat defines \u201ccountry living\u201d?There are two groups in America. Group No. 1 is blue suits, high heels, taxicabs, trying to get ahead in the corporate world. If you\u2019re in this group, the site\u2019s probably not for you. Group No. 2 is wide-open skies, wide-open spaces, animal lovers. This is the site for them. Over 6 million people have signed up on FarmersOnly.com. There\u2019s only a million something farmers in the U.S. What\u2019s one of your favorite stories? There was a girl from Ohio State, and she was into horses. She was dating a guy, they got engaged, and they\u2019re talking about where they\u2019re going to live. She wanted to move out into the country and have a place for her horses, and he wanted to move to the suburbs. She goes, \u201cWhere am I going to keep my horses?\u201d And he said, \u201cCan\u2019t you just keep them in the garage?\u201d She said that was it. She knew it wasn\u2019t going to work out. She went on FarmersOnly and met a guy from the country. That was one of the early marriages. Now they have a handful of kids. Have you created any other dating websites?CurvesConnect. That\u2019s for people who have a few extra curves and have some challenges on online dating. The whole movement has been these swipe sites. You look at a picture for a few seconds. That really got to me. There\u2019s more to a person than a one-second look. People who don\u2019t look like Hollywood fashion models don\u2019t get swiped right on as often. What kinds of questions do users have to answer to build a profile?We don\u2019t ask 500 questions. A lot of sites take a long time to fill out. One of the things I learned over the last 10 years is when you\u2019re dating, one of the most exciting aspects is discovery. I think it\u2019s fascinating learning about somebody instead of getting a Wikipedia sheet: \u201cNot only do I like blue, I like light blue and here are my 500 favorite songs.\u201dHave you ever tried online dating?I\u2019ve been married over 40 years. I got married before the internet was invented. What have been some of your favorite pop-culture moments for FarmersOnly?At the Country Music Awards, Carrie Underwood came out and they were talking about all the breakups in the country music industry. I guess Blake Shelton just had a breakup and they came out and said, \u201cWe just want you to know one thing, there\u2019s a dating website out there for you. FarmersOnly.\u201d I got 5,000 texts asking how I set that up. I didn\u2019t. What do you do for Match.com?What kinds of questions do you ask?Every year I ask, \u201cHave you ever had a one-night stand?\u201d \u201cHave you ever had a friends-with-benefits relationship?\u201d \u201cHave you lived with someone long term?\u201d Every year, over 50 percent say yes to those three questions. We don\u2019t find a lot of difference between people in their 20s and their 60s. We don\u2019t see much difference between gay and straight, or the suburban and urban parts of the country. Tell me about your theory of \u201cslow love.\u201dAmericans think that all this sleeping around before marriage is reckless. It began to occur to me that it\u2019s not recklessness, it\u2019s caution. This is the extension of the pre-commitment stage of relationships. Marriage used to be the beginning. Now it\u2019s the finale. We\u2019ve extended the period of getting to know someone. In past generations, a girl was married at 20. Now it\u2019s 27. For men, it\u2019s 22 and 29. That gives you almost a decade to experiment with sex and love. You learn a lot about somebody between the sheets \u2014 whether they\u2019re patient, kind, have a sense of humor. The young are not scared today. They\u2019re using sex sometimes as an interview or to try to jump-start feelings of romantic love. If there\u2019s this long period of pre-commitment, you can get rid of relationships you don\u2019t want before you marry. Maybe we\u2019ll see happier marriages. What\u2019s something compelling you learned from last year\u2019s survey?We found three ways that singles are courting: Either they\u2019re starting with just friends and they\u2019re really getting to know someone before they kiss them; another way is a friends-with-benefits relationship; and a third is having a date with somebody. People are dating less. In my day a date was a look-see. These days you get to know somebody quite a bit before the first date. By the time you\u2019re on your first date you\u2019re actually saying, \u201cI\u2019m somewhat interested with you, let\u2019s see how this goes.\u201d Was anything surprising?We asked men, \u201cHow would you feel if a woman asked you out?\u201d Ninety-five percent of men would be happy to have a woman ask them out. Only 13 percent of women would be willing to do that. What\u2019s the hardest part of this job? Analyzing all of that data over Christmas. I open my presents and then go to my desk while other people are dancing, cooking, exercising. Why was Shaadi created? In the \u201990s we had seen a lot of urbanization, and a lot of folks were starting to move away from their family homes. A lot of displacement. It became more difficult for parents to identify the right matches for their kids. The internet was just coming into its own, it seemed like a good time to start a business where people could do matchmaking for themselves instead of relying on their relatives. This changed who\u2019s driving, but the decision was still very much a family process. Once they found compatibility, the family would be involved. Individuals can make their profiles. Parents can make them. The parents are accessing the accounts at different times and they give their thoughts on who the individual is connecting with. We let people know that this is a profile created by a parent or an individual. Does Shaadi ever get more deeply involved in the matchmaking process?For about 10 percent of the business, we play the role of matchmaker. We help these people identify the right matches, but then we go further, we play the role of go-between where we have counselors for the members. What\u2019s your favorite Shaadi story?The nicest stories are typically people you would not expect to get married, like a man who was 72 and a 63-year-old woman who found each other. They had gone beyond all the things people generally look for. All they wanted was someone who would be a companion. Every now and again we get some of these stories where people have met against all odds. They had been widowed for a long time and their kids convinced them to find a companion. I think they opted for the personalized service. We explained that there\u2019s no guarantee that at that stage we could do something for them. How can users optimize their profiles?You want to write it in a way that makes you look attractive. The nature of the internet is that it\u2019s snacky. You don\u2019t want to turn away someone who could be right for you. People on Shaadi look for the One, as opposed to someone you can take out on the weekend. I also tell people not to embellish. In India, because it\u2019s such a family business, everybody is connected to each other with two or three degrees of separation. For most marriages, they will do some background checking. Accept that that\u2019s going to happen. There\u2019s no point in going beyond what\u2019s true.How has Shaadi changing the courting process in India? Of the matches we have, one in three end up meeting face to face. There\u2019s a lot of conversations before the meeting on our platform. Once you talk to a person on the phone, sometimes that doesn\u2019t work out. You will meet seven or eight people in person. Back in the day, it was more like 30. The regular matchmaking process can get very stressful. People put out the word. After the initial three or six months, everybody starts asking, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her?\u201d It should be a much more private decision and not so much in the public domain. A matchmaking platform gives the women so much more voice. How many people are using Shaadi and where? We sign up around 15,000 every day.

{"Headline": "The New Noma: Frequently Asked Questions", "Date": "2018-04-24", "News": "Critic\u2019s NotebookWhat\u2019s it like to eat at the second incarnation of the rule-defying Copenhagen restaurant? Our critic explains it all for you.Supported byWhat is the \u201cnew Noma\u201d?Will I be able to get a reservation?You might. Less than a day after its online ticketing system opened, in November, journalists, cooks, locals and destination-restaurant pilgrims from around the world had booked every seat through the end of April. This critic, not very quick on the draw, failed to get a table, but a former colleague who has written about Noma did, and offered a seat at his table. Sporadically, the restaurant seems to find additional space and puts new tickets up for sale. More usefully, the second batch of tickets, running through the end of September, has not quite sold out yet. A table for eight, in particular, is up for grabs on many dates.Where is it?The mailing address is Refshalevej 96, 1432 Copenhagen K, Denmark. More generally, the new Noma is in the part of the city called Christiania, where fortified walls were built on landfill in the 1600s to defend the city. The area was neglected until it was taken over by residents in 1971, first as a playground and then as the base of Freetown, an experimental anarchist community that proclaimed itself self-governing and self-sufficient. \u201cIt is so far the biggest opportunity to build a society from scratch,\u201d one of the founders wrote. \u201cFor those who feel the beating of the pioneer heart there can be no doubt as to the purpose of Christiania.\u201dDoes the pioneer heart still beat in Christiania?Yes, despite continuing conflict over hashish vendors on Pusher Street. The Noma complex, parts of which were still behind plywood early this month, is an island within the island of Christiania. It is cordoned off by a chain-link fence through which you can see the closest neighbor\u2019s home, a makeshift yurt in the woods. At the edge of the property is a pond where swans, mallards and coots paddle around. It is as if Mr. Redzepi had located Copenhagen\u2019s back door and walked through it, carrying the restaurant with him.Does Noma look like a restaurant?Not as the word is commonly understood, no. With its rooftop garden, its cluster of outbuildings and a main structure where work is carried on in a cluster of \u201chuts\u201d connected by glass-roofed corridors, it more closely resembles the campus of a tech firm or a small progressive college.Who designed it?If I get a reservation, will eating at Noma make me feel like a Viking?What will happen when I arrive?You may look for a sign. You will not see one, but if you see greenhouses and a long concrete bunker built into a 17th-century earthen rampart, you are in the right place. Somebody will greet you at the gate, perhaps Ali Sonko, who immigrated to Denmark from Gambia, started at Noma as a dishwasher and is now one of Mr. Redzepi\u2019s partners. If you are a repeat customer, he may hug you before leading you to the restaurant. When you enter, most of the kitchen and dining room staff, including Mr. Redzepi, will be standing inside the door. They will act as if they have been particularly looking forward to your arrival and had all the time in the world to greet you. It is a little like meeting the von Trapp children. Once this ritual is over, they return to their posts and you are brought to your table. A glass of sparkling wine will probably materialize quickly.How are meals at the new Noma different?The menus are more tightly focused. The old Noma restricted itself to ingredients that grew in the Nordic countries. The new one narrows the scope even more, with three major themes a year that stick to what Mr. Redzepi thinks is best at the time. The menu in late spring and summer will revolve around plants, although it will not necessarily be vegetarian. \u201cWe will have things we think belong, like ants and snails,\u201d Mr. Redzepi said during one of his frequent trips to the dining room. \u201cThey\u2019re there, in the garden.\u201d Foragers and hunters will supply the late-fall and early-winter kitchen with wild mushrooms, nuts, game birds, deer, moose, bear. Every course in the current menu, in effect until late spring, contains something from the ocean.How many courses are in the tasting menu?There are around 20 dishes, a few of which come at the same time. Matchstick strips of the firmer bits of a mahogany clam, decorated with seaweed fronds and little salt-preserved unripe gooseberries and black currant buds, arrive in its shell in a bath of mussel juice and oil pressed from black-currant wood at the same moment as a bay scallop and its roe, pulled from Norwegian seas by a diver named Roderick Sloan, who must be immune to hypothermia.Is that good?Unless Mr. Sloan is a friend of yours, the scallop is likely to be the sweetest you have ever tasted. The clam is briny and tart and chewy, and affects you like a splash of Norwegian water in the face.Will I see a menu before I eat?In a manner of speaking, yes. You won\u2019t see a printed menu until the meal is over, but hanging to the right of the entrance is a framed beachcomber\u2019s collage of shells, seaweeds, starfish, sea horses and other saltwater creatures. Nearly every course is represented somewhere.Is Noma serving sea horse and starfish?Both are decorative items in the collage, like the polished rocks, although the test kitchen gave ground starfish the old college try. \u201cWe did not enjoy it,\u201d Mr. Redzepi said, emphatically. Instead cooks paint a starfish on the plate with a pearlescent sauce of egg yolks and pumpkin-seed oil and cover it with wild Danish trout roe. Studded with tiny flecks of dried fermented plum, it is wonderful to eat, although you could see trompe l\u2019oeil plating as a small betrayal of the all-natural ethos that animates most of Noma\u2019s cooking.What is the black-and-white shell, the size of a soapdish, in the bottom-left corner of the collage?A horse mussel. Horse mussels are almost never eaten, not even by horses. After throwing away the nondelicious parts, which Mr. Redzepi estimates at roughly two-thirds to three-quarters of the animal, Noma\u2019s cooks stew the rest with chanterelles they preserved in oil last year. It tastes meaty, a bit like lamb, or at least more like lamb than anything else on the menu, and its flavor is considerably perked up by some tart foraged mirabelle plums, salted and dried before the winter.Should I start eating horse mussels?If you can get them the way Noma cooks them, sure.Are regular blue mussels not on the menu?They are, and they must be among the best mussels on earth. Four or five of their stout bellies have been joined together after being separated from the stringier bits, which are ground up in a smoked butter sauce that is insanely good.Does the all-seafood menu get monotonous?Not for a minute. At around two hours, the meal skates along briskly and pulls a greater variety of flavors out of the Nordic waters than another restaurant would get by importing seafood from around the world.How do all these courses get to my table?Mr. Redzepi will bring one or two, stopping to chat about, say, snails and starfish. Others will be brought by cooks. You will probably be served by Lars Korby, who helps herd the wine collection; James Spreadbury, a kindly Australian who manages the restaurant; Mette Soberg, who as head of Noma\u2019s research and development department works out the first drafts of many dishes. There is no discernible hierarchy in the service staff, although Mr. Redzepi is obviously the boss.What happened to the famous fermentation laboratory?I neither know nor care how fermentation works. Will I still appreciate the food?If you can enjoy wine or cheese without understanding their metabolic underpinnings, you will be fine. But when you are eating something at Noma that tastes like much more than the sum of its parts, when you realize that few of the restaurant\u2019s many imitators load as much depth and complexity into their cooking, when you start to lose your bearings and can\u2019t quite figure out what is happening, it can be helpful to recall that just out of sight is an entire room full of special sauce.Does fermentation make everything at Noma taste great?You may reach an answer in the negative if you drink the green liquid of plankton and raw pumpkin-seed milk thinned with yogurt whey. And then you may find yourself reflecting that to explore the boundaries of deliciousness it is sometimes necessary to go beyond them.Will I avoid plankton if I get the wine pairing?Not necessarily. One current dessert is a plankton mousse under a toasted-milk crumble. It does not taste weird at all. Neither do the two desserts made with kelp, but none of them is as likable over the short term (and probably the long term, too) as the icy cloudberry soup with snowdrifts of frozen yogurt and tiny candied pine cones, as chewy as jelly beans.All these small portions look as if they\u2019d been put on the plate by a team of synchronized hummingbirds. Will I get enough to eat?Just before the finale of desserts, when you may be second-guessing Mr. Redzepi\u2019s decision not to serve any bread with this menu, something close to perfect happens. It is a dish called \u201chead of the cod.\u201d It is not an entire head, but the meatiest chunks on sharp blades of bone that have been as carefully trimmed as any Frenched rack of lamb. The fish has been brushed with seaweed and mushroom glazes reminiscent of soy and miso and then grilled, something like the way yellowtail collar is cooked in an izakaya. There are four cuts and three garnishes, so you have the option of, say, dipping the cheek in horseradish oil and dredging the tongue in a tart pesto made from ground Danish wood ants. The fish is soft, extravagantly rich, and by the time you have found the last shred of flesh you are ready for something sweet.What is Noma all about?The cod-head dish sums it up. Noma\u2019s strategy in all things is to get rid of any received notions of luxury in restaurants and replace them with something seen as more humble (pottery spun on a wheel instead of Bernardaud porcelain), eccentric (natural wines rather than blue-chip Bordeaux), overlooked (horse mussels instead of no horse mussels), or undervalued (cod heads for lobster). Mr. Redzepi and his colleagues have rebuilt the template of high-end, destination dining piece by piece with stuff that has been thought about, considered and chosen for a reason. Sometimes the cook or dining-room worker bringing the food to your table tells you the reason, but even when you\u2019re not told, you can still sense that everything has a purpose. That\u2019s what Noma is about as a business serving food. As an aesthetic project, it is also about questioning received hierarchies of value. The stray plant in your backyard or window box is a weed only if you pull it out. Let it grow and it could be a wildflower, or a tasty addition to tonight\u2019s salad.How much does it cost?About $375 for lunch or dinner without drinks, paid in advance when you reserve on the restaurant\u2019s website. Wine pairings cost about $166 and the slate of juices runs about $133. Each night four students, randomly chosen from a waiting list, are seated and charged about $165 a person, including wine or juice pairings.Isn\u2019t $375 a lot of money?Yes. Noma is redefining luxury, not abolishing it.An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of the Copenhagen area where the new Noma has opened. It is Christiania, not Christiana.An earlier version of this article misstated the year when Christiania was taken over by residents. It was 1971, not 1961.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Black Cops on Both Sides of the Badge", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn \u201cBlack Outlined Blue,\u201d Daniel Edwards, the son of two law enforcement officials, examined the difficulties and insights of being both black and a police officer.Daniel Edwards was scrolling through his Facebook feed in the summer of 2016, when he came upon a viral video of Diamond Reynolds who, in a calm panic was recounting how a police officer in St. Anthony, Minn., shot and killed her boyfriend, Philando Castile, during a routine traffic stop. The contradictions between the good policing his parents exemplified and the anger stirred up by the steady stream of cellphone and dashcam footage that exposed police brutality, became the cornerstone of \u201cBlack Outlined Blue,\u201d a series of 4 x 5-inch large-format black-and-white double portraits of African-American officers. The year-old photo project is continuing, currently being shot in Atlanta, where Mr. Edwards is pursuing a Master of Fine Arts in photography at Savannah College of Art and Design. It features 10 diptychs of members of the Atlanta Police Department in uniform and in their street clothes. Mr. Edwards mostly captured the officers gazing directly at the camera against backdrops of \u201csignificance\u201d \u2014 places where something happened that personally defined the job for them. Depending on what the subjects are wearing, the closely cropped images conjure complicated representations that are not unlike his own views of modern policing. The side-by-side frames of Officer Eric King show him in uniform wearing his badge, handcuffs and firearm \u2014 all symbols of state-sanctioned power long regarded suspiciously in many black communities. The second image is a portrait of Mr. King wearing a black hoodie \u2014 an article of clothing that often results in black men and boys being seen as suspects on the streets of their communities. To answer those questions, Mr. Edwards asked the officers to jot down reflections that add another layer to his portraiture. His subjects explain why they serve; the difficulties and insights they have being both African-American and law enforcement officers; and their impressions of their profession in the aftermath of the Movement for Black Lives. \u201cPeople often have to do a double take to realize that it\u2019s the same person in the diptych portraits,\u201d Mr. Edwards said. \u201cAt first, all they see is a broken and dangerous system personified. This project is about challenging people and the police to avoid the danger of the single story.\u201d Advertisement"}

She knew the dish by smell and feel, sensing exactly when the pan was hot enough to add the chicken, or how much ginger and soy sauce would be enough to flavor the blistering oil that she then poured over the cooked meat.In Ms. Riggin\u2019s recipe, the main ingredient is cooked separately, then the sauce \u2014 a pungent mix of hot oil, soy sauce, ginger and scallion, balanced with the tiniest pinch of sugar \u2014 is poured on top. In classic Cantonese cooking, the protein (usually chicken or a whole fish) would be steamed or poached. But Jade\u2019s mother sometimes stir-fried the chicken, so she could use the same pan to make the sauce.Part of the pleasure of this dish is that, unlike in a more classic stir-fry, the flavors of the sauce and the chicken are not thoroughly intertwined. In some bites, you taste only the brawniness of the bird; in others, there\u2019s more complexity, with the tangy sauce, crisp chicken and a garnish of raw scallions together on your tongue. Each mouthful is a little different, one more compelling than the last. It is also fast to make \u2014 under 20 minutes from start to finish.Jade\u2019s grown-up tweak to her mother\u2019s recipe is to add a leafy thatch of cilantro to the raw scallions on top of the chicken, which wilt when they are hit with the steaming sauce. Cilantro wasn\u2019t something she\u2019d ever touch as a child; she hated its aggressive flavor. But now she can appreciate the freshness and earthiness the herb brings to the mix.I can relate: I feel the same way about sliced onions on my bagels and lox.

{"Headline": "What the Mona Lisa Tells Us About Art in the Instagram Era", "Date": "2018-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The young couple moved to the front of the crowd to look at the painting. After a few seconds, the woman turned around, smiled into her cellphone and took some selfies. Next, she handed her device to her husband, who took more formal shots of her in front of the work. The two then posed arm in arm for selfies together, turned to have a last brief look at the painting \u2014 and moved away.\u201cIt\u2019s too small, and it\u2019s too crowded to get close to look at the detail,\u201d said the woman, Jeannie Li, 28, a financial analyst in Shanghai, unimpressed by her first sight of Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s \u201cMona Lisa.\u201d \u201cI can see it better in a book or on the internet.\u201dThe way the couple interacted with the 500-year-old painting exemplifies how differently the digital generation experiences art. Most of the roughly 150 people crowded around the painting at the Louvre were taking photographs of the piece, or of themselves in front of it. In the presence of the \u201cMona Lisa,\u201d digital photography, more than looking at the actual artwork, has become the primary experience.Ms. Li and her husband, Steven, were in Paris for their honeymoon. Why had she wanted to visit the Louvre and see this particular artwork? \u201cBecause it\u2019s famous, because of its mysterious smile, and because I read \u2018The Da Vinci Code,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Li said, referring to the best-selling novel by Dan Brown, which opens with the shooting of a curator in the museum\u2019s Grand Gallery.\u201cA lot of people take photos and post them on Twitter or Facebook,\u201d Ms. Li said. \u201cIt\u2019s evidence that \u2018I\u2019ve been there.\u2019 \u201dIt would be easy enough for a critic or curator to dismiss the \u201cMona Lisa experience\u201d as nothing more than selfie tourism. Yet Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9, like pretty much everyone who visits the Louvre, did actually look at the painting.\u201cShe is older than the rocks among which she sits; like the vampire, she has been dead many times, and learned the secrets of the grave,\u201d the British critic Walter Pater wrote in 1873, evoking the timelessness of the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d long before the advent of mass tourism, mobile phones, apps and fragmented attention spans.Mr. Pater\u2019s much-quoted description of \u201cLa Gioconda\u201d (as the painting is also known) is redolent of a culture in which a privileged few would spend hours with masterpieces to try to divine their profoundest meanings.But mechanical \u2014 and digital \u2014 reproduction has changed things. Another British critic, John Berger, wrote in his influential 1972 book, \u201cWays of Seeing,\u201d that in an age of digital reproduction, \u201cthe meaning of paintings is no longer attached to them; their meaning becomes transmittable.\u201dSimilarly, a wealthy art collector does not need to spend hours in front of a Christopher Wool, Rudolf Stingel or Gerhard Richter abstract freshly purchased for a few million dollars. The collector knows exactly what it looks like, having already seen the image many times in digital reproduction.While the instantly recognizable quality of brand-name contemporary art reassures collectors \u2014 and by extension bolsters the pieces\u2019 value \u2014 other works can be diminished by their reproducibility. The \u201cMona Lisa\u201d is a prime example.\u201cIt\u2019s very underwhelming. It\u2019s small and dark,\u201d Katie Qian, 33, an engineer from Salt Lake City, said after seeing the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d for the second time in her life.\u201cThe bogus religiosity which now surrounds original works of art,\u201d Mr. Berger wrote in \u201cWays of Seeing,\u201d \u201cis ultimately dependent on their market value\u201d and \u201chas become the substitute for what paintings lost when the camera made them reproducible.\u201dBack at the Louvre, the millions of visitors who trudge through the Grand Gallery every year on their way to the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d tend to walk straight past \u201cThe Virgin of the Rocks,\u201d a fully documented Leonardo masterpiece from the early 1480s. Then again, perhaps not many tourists are aware that it is a painting that, in the unlikely event of it ever appearing on the market, would also sell for hundreds of millions of dollars.\u201cAt least millions of people want to see it,\u201d said Dulce Leite, 63, an Italian who seemed amazed by the throng in front of the \u201cMona Lisa.\u201d She had spent the previous 15 minutes contemplating a crowd-free \u201cVirgin of the Rocks\u201d (without taking any photos).\u201cNow they look at the picture and there\u2019s the possibility of taking a photo and posting it,\u201d she added. \u201cWe had to see it and memorize.\u201dImprisoned by its reputation as the most famous painting in the world, and by its security capsule, the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d has, to all meaningful intents and purposes, ceased to exist as an original work of art. It has become an idea \u2014 and a photo opportunity.What could be a more contemporary way of seeing?An earlier version of this article misspelled another name for the \u201cMona Lisa.\u201d It is \u201cLa Gioconda,\u201d not \u201cLa Giaconda.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mark Zuckerberg Testimony: Day 2 Brings Tougher Questioning", "Date": "2018-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOver the two days, there were nearly 10 hours of hearings, during which almost 100 lawmakers grilled Mr. Zuckerberg.While Tuesday\u2019s Senate hearing contained tough questions, the lawmakers were generally deferential to the executive. That was less the case in the House, where lawmakers repeatedly interrupted Mr. Zuckerberg and chided him for not answering questions to their satisfaction.Lawmakers on both side of the aisle on Wednesday pushed Mr. Zuckerberg on his company\u2019s handling of user data. They were particularly focused on the platform\u2019s privacy settings, which put the onus on users to protect their privacy. He was also asked about:\u2022 Whether the social network should be regulated.\u2022 What Russians did on Facebook during the 2016 election.\u2022 Whether the social network had a liberal bias.\u2022 What Facebook ultimately is as it has grown into a global behemoth.READ MORE:Representative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon and chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee, kicked off the hearing by declaring that \u201cwhile Facebook has certainly grown, I worry it has not matured.\u201dMr. Walden floated the prospect of regulation, saying that \u201cI think it is time to ask whether Facebook may have moved too fast and broken too many things.\u201dLater in the hearing, Mr. Zuckerberg said regulation was \u201cinevitable.\u201d But he repeated that the right kind of regulation mattered and he pointed out that some regulation could only solidify the power of a large company like Facebook, which could hurt start-ups.A history of the steps the company took to become an advertising giant.On Tuesday, several senators sounded a similar tune, saying Facebook couldn\u2019t be trusted with the vast amounts of data being collected, much of which was being done without users\u2019 full understanding. Three senators introduced privacy legislation that would require users\u2019 permission to collect and share their data.On Wednesday, Mr. Zuckerberg was asked to agree to privacy legislation that requires permission for data collection. Mr. Zuckerberg demurred and did not express support for any specific legislative proposal.Representative Frank Pallone Jr., a New Jersey Democrat, pressed Mr. Zuckerberg on whether Facebook would agree or refuse to change Facebook\u2019s default settings to minimize collection and use of users\u2019 data.\u201cThis is a complex issue that deserves more than a one word answer,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg answered.\u201cThat\u2019s disappointing to me,\u201d Mr. Pallone responded.The concern was echoed by Representative Bobby L. Rush, a Democrat of Illinois, who pointed a finger at Mr. Zuckerberg and asked: \u201cWhy is the onus on the user to opt in to privacy and security settings?\u201dBut Mr. Zuckerberg also did not dismiss a proposal from Representative Raul Ruiz, a Democrat from California, to create a digital consumer protection agency that would subject Facebook and its peers to some degree of government involvement.Mr. Zuckerberg called the idea one \u201cthat deserves a lot of consideration\u201d but said that the \u201cdetails on this really matter.\u201dThis morning, Representatives Gene Green, a Texas Democrat, and Jan Schakowsky, an Illinois Democrat, pressed him repeatedly on the issue. And Mr. Zuckerberg repeated his commitment to give all users those controls.But European regulators and privacy advocates said over the last week that a number of Facebook\u2019s current practices seemed violate the new law, called the General Data Protection Regulation.For one thing, the European law requires privacy by design and default. European experts said that, in their view, that would require Facebook turn off a number of advertising and privacy settings which are currently set to sharing and instead ask user permission to turn them on.Mr. Zuckerberg answered the legislators\u2019 questions by saying that the company plans to put a tool \u201cat the top of everyone\u2019s app\u201d where users will be able to make privacy and sharing choices. But the company may not offer affirmative consent \u2014 asking users to explicitly opt-in \u2014 in every country, depending on legal issues, he said.Facebook currently allows users to download a copy of their personal data like their messages, likes and posts.But Mr. Green wanted to know if Facebook would comply with the European law \u2014 and extend those protections to users worldwide \u2014 by providing individuals with the complete records and profiles the Facebook has compiled on them. That would include any data the company collected about its users by tracking them on other websites, and any data the company bought or acquired from third parties about users, and any categorizations or algorithmic scores Facebook created about users, regulators said.Mr. Zuckerberg said he believed all of the data is available.That isn\u2019t true for the moment \u2014 at least for a couple of reporters who recently downloaded their Facebook data. But Facebook has about six weeks to figure out how to give users a copy of their algorithmic scores, web tracking data and other records the social network has compiled before the law goes into effect in Europe.Facial recognition \u2014 a technology that scans your face and converts into a mathematical code that can be used to identify you in any other facial photo or video still \u2014 is a hot-button topic on both sides of the Atlantic. That is because it involves measuring and collecting data about people\u2019s unique physical attributes.Facebook uses the technology in a name-tagging feature that can automatically suggest the names of people in users\u2019 photographs. But regulators in Europe have cracked down on Facebook for rolling it out without users\u2019 explicit opt-in consent. And privacy groups in the United States filed a complaint last week to the Federal Trade Commission saying Facebook\u2019s recent expanded use of the technology violated a settlement the company made with the agency in 2011.When legislators asked him about the tough new European privacy rules today, Mr. Zuckerberg said he was generally concerned that some constraints could restrict companies based in the United States from innovating with technologies like facial recognition \u2014 allowing China to take the lead in developing the technology.Even so, Mr. Zuckerberg said, technologies like face recognition should require permission from users.For sensitive technologies, he said, \u201cI do think you want a special consent.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg pushed back against suggestions that Facebook is essentially a monopoly, \u201cwithout any true competitor,\u201d as put by Representative Fred Upton, Republican of Michigan.Reiterating a point made Tuesday before the Senate, Mr. Zuckerberg said that there is a \u201clot of competition\u201d that Facebook managers \u201cdefinitely feel in running the company.\u201d He mentioned, but did not name, eight apps that users rely on to communicate.He left out that, according to comScore, Facebook owns three of the top ten mobile apps used in the United States: Facebook, Facebook Messenger and Instagram.Of the remaining seven, Google owns five (YouTube, Google Search, Google Maps, Google Play and Gmail). Only Snapchat and Pandora are independent.Mr. Pallone, the New Jersey Democrat, chided Mr. Zuckerberg for his company\u2019s na\u00efvet\u00e9 in not realizing how Facebook data could be utilized.\u201cFor all the good it brings, Facebook can be a weapon for those, like Russia and Cambridge Analytica, that seek to harm us and hack our democracy,\u201d he said.Several lawmakers have pointed out to Mr. Zuckerberg, repeatedly, that the Obama campaign used a Facebook app to also scrape data from users and their friends in 2012.But those lawmakers have failed to mention one very important distinction between the Obama campaign\u2019s app and Cambridge Analytica\u2019s app: The Obama app was actually on Facebook itself, and it was very clear about who and what the data would be used for.The app used to scrape data for Cambridge Analytica was accessed through a personality questionnaire hosted on a site outside of Facebook, and it appeared to users to be for academic research, not for a political data company owned by a wealthy Republican donor and dedicated to reshaping the American electorate.Representative Joe Barton, Republican of Texas, zeroed in on a line of questioning that his Texas counterpart in the Senate, Ted Cruz, also asked, pressing Mr. Zuckerberg on why Facebook has been allegedly censoring content from conservative organizations and Trump supporters such as Diamond and Silk.Mr. Barton also asked Mr. Zuckerberg if he would agree that Facebook would work to ensure it is \u201ca neutral public platform,\u201d a question also asked by Mr. Cruz.\u201cI do agree that we should give people a voice,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.Republican lawmakers returned several times to the issue of bias on Facebook.Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana questioned whether Facebook\u2019s newsfeed algorithms tamp down conservative news in favor of more left-leaning outlets, to which Mr. Zuckerberg responded that \u201cthere is absolutely no directive\u201d to have \u201cany kind of bias in anything we do.\u201dThe proliferation of so-called fake news has put Mr. Zuckerberg in an awkward spot, as the company promises to do a better job of weeding out propaganda and falsehoods but insists it cannot police free speech.Out in the hall during a break in the hearing, Representative Billy Long, a Republican from Missouri, also expressed frustration about Facebook\u2019s treatment of Diamond and Silk, two pro-Trump video personalities who have complained about being censored by the platform.\u201cIt seems like they take down a lot more conservative content than they do liberal,\u201d he said.Mr. Long said that he needed more answers about the Diamond and Silk situation, and that he hoped Mr. Zuckerberg could ensure that the company\u2019s thousands of moderators weren\u2019t biased against conservatives.\u201cHe better hope he does it, not us,\u201d Mr. Long added. \u201cOr Congress is going to get involved, and regulate a private industry.\u201dMr. Walden of Oregon foreshadowed a line of questioning for Mr. Zuckerberg on how Facebook works and if the social media site has become a publisher or utility service that deserves regulation.\u201cWhat exactly is Facebook?\u201d Mr. Walden asked, listing industries like advertising, publishing and even telecom, or \u201ccommon carrier in the information age.\u201dThe definitions matter. If Facebook is viewed as a telecommunications service that is more like a utility, it may be regulated by the Federal Communications Commission. If lawmakers define Facebook as a publisher, it could also fall under regulations at that agency.\u201cI consider us to be a technology company,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg answered. \u201cThe primary thing we do is have engineers that write code and build services for other people.\u201d\u201cDo we have a responsibility for the content people share on Facebook? I think the answer to that question is yes,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Time Warner C.E.O. Testifies That AT&T Merger Is Needed to Battle Silicon Valley", "Date": "2018-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Time Warner\u2019s chief executive, Jeffrey Bewkes, vigorously defended his company\u2019s $85.4 billion merger with AT&T on Wednesday, saying the deal was necessary to confront \u201ctectonic changes\u201d in entertainment caused by internet competitors like Netflix and Amazon.Before a packed courtroom on Wednesday, Mr. Bewkes portrayed Time Warner as an underdog against Silicon Valley giants that can reach hundreds of millions of users and are spending billions of dollars a year to produce original shows that compete with Time Warner\u2019s HBO and Turner Broadcasting.\u201cWe don\u2019t have the tech platform, don\u2019t have the engineers, don\u2019t have the infrastructure,\u201d Mr. Bewkes said in arguing for his company\u2019s need to combine with AT&T, a mobile wireless and satellite television giant with access to more than 150 million subscribers nationwide.In cross-examination, a lawyer for the Justice Department grilled Mr. Bewkes on the underdog narrative, and presented an internal document that Mr. Bewkes wrote in January 2017 to Time Warner\u2019s board that touted the company\u2019s revenue projections. The document also showed that Time Warner was planning to introduce digital products even without the potential merger.AT&T\u2019s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, is expected to testify as soon as Thursday. John Stankey, the AT&T executive who is poised to run Time Warner after the merger, also began testimony on Wednesday afternoon. Arguments are expected to close as early as April 30. Judge Richard J. Leon of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, who is presiding over the case, is expected to take about a month before giving his opinion.For Mr. Bewkes, 65, the courtroom appearance was a rare public pleading to salvage a career-defining deal. The media titan is a 39-year veteran of Time Warner and has been chief executive since 2008, overseeing the spinoff of Time Warner Cable a year later, the rise of HBO and the turbulent evolution of CNN and the Warner Bros. movie studio.Confident and congenial, Mr. Bewkes engaged directly with Judge Leon, leaning forward in his chair and making eye contact as he explained how the media industry is being challenged by Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google and Netflix. He described the Justice Department\u2019s theory that the merged company would threaten to withhold Time Warner content from rival cable operators as \u201cridiculous.\u201dAmong the biggest problems for Time Warner as a stand-alone television and movie producer is that it does not have access to viewer data to target advertising and other valuable customer information the same way that Amazon and Netflix do, Mr. Bewkes said.\u201cWe don\u2019t have emails, contact information, billing information \u2026 any of these things,\u201d he said.At the center of the antitrust trial are arguments over consumer and competitive harms, with attention focused on economic analyses presented by both sides last week. The Justice Department and several consumer groups said the deal would hurt consumers, who would have to pay bigger bills as a result of higher prices for Time Warner programs.The companies have argued that the Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit is at least a decade behind the times. Time Warner said companies like Google and Facebook have the most valuable data on users but they are not willing to share that information.Mr. Bewkes said he has also unsuccessfully tried to buy data on viewers from distributors like Comcast, which was only willing to sell limited sets.These trends prompted Mr. Stephenson and Mr. Bewkes in the summer of 2016 to meet to discuss business options, Mr. Bewkes said Wednesday. In late August 2016, over a three-hour lunch on the 10th-floor dining room of the Time Warner building in New York, they agreed a merger made the most sense. The companies\u2019 boards approved the plan soon after.Judge Leon, who has not commented much throughout the trial, has said the action was a \u201crare breed of horse\u201d but not a \u201cunicorn.\u201dMr. Bewkes and Mr. Stephenson have previously suggested that the Justice Department was influenced to block the deal by presidential politics. President Trump said during his election campaign that the deal should be denied. Mr. Trump has also repeatedly bashed CNN for its coverage of his administration.The Justice Department has denied any political interference in its suit to block the deal.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How the Sprint Deal is a Feather in T-Mobile C.E.O.\u2019s Cap: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Monday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 T-Mobile and Sprint have their eye on regulators.\u2022 HNA is set to drop its pursuit of SkyBridge Capital\u2022 How close are the U.S. and Europe to a trade war?But from that, Mr. Legere sought to change the way U.S. wireless providers did business:\u2022 Lowering prices\u2022 Ending some long-term contract requirements\u2022 Offering unlimited data plans\u201cThe company took off like a rocketship and has sustained that momentum ever since the AT&T merger was blocked,\u201d the analyst Craig Moffett of the research firm MoffettNathanson told me in an interview.More on the legacy of Mr. Legere, from my and Cecilia\u2019s story on the deal:Those policies helped T-Mobile add nearly 40 million customers over the last five years, with 5 million new customers added last year alone. AT&T, Verizon and Sprint all followed suit, and in recent years the overall price of basic wireless plans has stayed flat or fallen, according to Obama-era regulators.The Un-carrier campaign helped propel T-Mobile ahead of Sprint in 2015. As of Dec. 31., the company had 58.7 million retail subscribers, compared to Sprint\u2019s 40.9 million. T-Mobile\u2019s market value also outstripped that of Sprint\u2019s, contributing to the structure of Sunday\u2019s deal: Mr. Legere would become C.E.O. of the combined company, which would keep the T-Mobile name.In an ironic twist, completion of the Sprint deal would put T-Mobile ahead of its former suitor, AT&T, in terms of retail subscribers. AT&T had 93.2 million at the end of 2017.But Mr. Moffett said that the very success of Mr. Legere and T-Mobile could pose problems for the Sprint deal, since it proves that regulators\u2019 opposition to the two companies\u2019 effort to merge in 2014 was justified.When I asked about the tweet in a phone interview on Sunday \u2014 which also involved Marcelo Claure, Sprint\u2019s C.E.O. \u2014 Mr. Legere chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re expecting me to remember tweets from 2014?\u201d he responded.\u2014 Michael de la Merced\u201cThe 5G aspects that are critical for the country and critical for us really was the flipping point as to this is the time.\u201d\u201cServices are going to be broadened, prices are going to go down, speeds are going to go up. The 5G capability is going to be beyond anything the United States has seen before. Jobs are going to go up from day one.\u201cIf you liked the competition before, you\u2019re going to love what\u2019s coming with this one. \u201dT-Mobile agreed to buy Sprint in an all-stock deal, which valued Sprint at $26.5 billion or $6.62 a share. At that deal price, Mr. Claure\u2019s long-term award of 10 million Sprint shares is worth $66.2 million. Those shares \u201cwill fully vest if he\u2019s terminated within 18 months of the deal\u2019s completion, or if his responsibilities change materially.\u201dHe also \u201cis eligible for cash severance of about $11.6 million and $54,000 of other benefits.\u201dSo far this year, companies and other buyers have announced $1.68 trillion of acquisitions, according to Dealogic. That\u2019s the biggest total through the first four months of a year on record, topping the $1.64 trillion of deals struck in 2007.Merger activity is also on a record pace in the United States. Acquirers have struck $674 billion of deals for U.S. companies through April 30, the highest level on record and exceeding the $607 billion agreed to through the same period in 2007.Whether they will succeed is another matter. Michael and Cecilia Kang point out that while the F.C.C. commissioner, Ajit Pai, has signaled an open mind toward mergers, many antitrust staffers at the Justice Department are the same people who opposed the deal in 2014.No matter how much hyperbole Sprint and T-Mobile expend, it is hard to see how the deal will pass muster with regulators.\u201cIt would not surprise me if they can come up with an economist with a model that says this is all unicorns and cupcakes,\u201d said Michael Kades, a former lawyer at the F.T.C. who is now the director of markets and competition policy for Washington Center for Equitable Growth. \u201cBut the market concentration is presumptively anticompetitive.\u201dFrom AnnaMaria Andriotis, Telis Demos and Emily Glazer of the WSJ:The financial companies have explored creating a new credit-card code for firearms dealers, similar to how they code restaurants, or department stores, according to people familiar with the matter. Another idea would require merchants to share information about specific firearm products consumers are buying, some of the people said.If the credit card companies and banks agreed, they could come up with a series of subcodes that would identify retailers that sold guns under a \u201cbest practices\u201d policy \u2014 like the policy that Citigroup proposed or the one that Walmart and Dick\u2019s follow \u2014 and the ones that don\u2019t. It would add transparency to the process, and it would give banks that issue credit cards the opportunity to decide which retailers they wanted to associate with.But such a move might concern opponents of gun control, who worry that keeping tabs on firearms sales would be contrary to the government\u2019s hands-off approach to monitoring such transactions. And then there are general privacy concerns: Adam Levitin, a law professor at Georgetown, told the WSJ: \u201cThere\u2019s the slippery slope danger if it\u2019s guns today maybe it is pornography tomorrow and the day after it\u2019s right-wing literature.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la MercedThe country says it will refuse to discuss President Trump\u2019s two toughest trade demands when American officials arrive in Beijing this week, potentially derailing the high-level talks.Keith Bradsher of the NYT reports:The Chinese government is publicly calling for flexibility on both sides. But senior Beijing officials do not plan to discuss the two biggest requests that the Trump administration has made over the past several months, according to people involved in Chinese policymaking. Those include a mandatory $100 billion cut in America\u2019s $375 billion annual trade deficit with China and curbs on Beijing\u2019s $300 billion plan to bankroll the country\u2019s industrial upgrade into advanced technologies like artificial intelligence, semiconductors, electric cars and commercial aircraft.What\u2019s behind China\u2019s stance? Beijing feels its economy has become big enough and resilient enough to stand up to the United States.Mr. Koum, who co-founded WhatsApp and had insisted that strong encryption be built into the service, was perturbed by the amount of data that Facebook collected on people and had advocated for stronger protections of that information, the executive said.Mr. Koum\u2019s exit is the highest-profile departure from Facebook after months of controversy at the social network.The gathering reliably draws leaders from Wall Street, Hollywood and sports to Los Angeles to discuss trade, health care, investing and more. This year\u2019s conference will touch on hot topics like the trade tensions between the U.S. and China, the #MeToo movement, the planned talks with North Korea, and the backlash against Silicon Valley.Attendees include Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Tim Sloan of Wells Fargo, Leon Black of Apollo Global Management and Eric Schmidt of Google.The worries of some critics, according to Nathaniel Popper:Countries that devote more resources to the process could successfully push their preferred cryptographic algorithms to be the standards, potentially creating so-called back doors that could be used in the future to spy on blockchain activity.More from Julie Creswell, Kevin Draper and Rachel Abrams:While Nike executives have told investors that the women\u2019s category was a crucial part of its revenue growth strategy, former employees said it was not given the budget it needed to roll out the sophisticated marketing campaigns that were the hallmark of traditional men\u2019s sports, like basketball.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018The Business of War\u2019: Google Employees Protest Work for the Pentagon", "Date": "2018-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Thousands of Google employees, including dozens of senior engineers, have signed a letter protesting the company\u2019s involvement in a Pentagon program that uses artificial intelligence to interpret video imagery and could be used to improve the targeting of drone strikes.The letter, which is circulating inside Google and has garnered more than 3,100 signatures, reflects a culture clash between Silicon Valley and the federal government that is likely to intensify as cutting-edge artificial intelligence is increasingly employed for military purposes.\u201cWe believe that Google should not be in the business of war,\u201d says the letter, addressed to Sundar Pichai, the company\u2019s chief executive. It asks that Google pull out of Project Maven, a Pentagon pilot program, and announce a policy that it will not \u201cever build warfare technology.\u201dThat kind of idealistic stance, while certainly not shared by all Google employees, comes naturally to a company whose motto is \u201cDon\u2019t be evil,\u201d a phrase invoked in the protest letter. But it is distinctly foreign to Washington\u2019s massive defense industry and certainly to the Pentagon, where the defense secretary, Jim Mattis, has often said a central goal is to increase the \u201clethality\u201d of the United States military.Google employees have circulated protest petitions on a range of issues, including Google Plus, the company\u2019s lagging competitor to Facebook, and Google\u2019s sponsorship of the Conservative Political Action Conference.Employees raised questions about Google\u2019s involvement in Project Maven at a recent companywide meeting. At the time, Diane Greene, who leads Google\u2019s cloud infrastructure business, defended the deal and sought to reassure concerned employees. A company spokesman said most of the signatures on the protest letter had been collected before the company had an opportunity to explain the situation.But improved analysis of drone video could be used to pick out human targets for strikes, while also better identifying civilians to reduce the accidental killing of innocent people.Without referring directly to the letter to Mr. Pichai, Google said in a statement on Tuesday that \u201cany military use of machine learning naturally raises valid concerns.\u201d It added, \u201cWe\u2019re actively engaged across the company in a comprehensive discussion of this important topic.\u201d The company called such exchanges \u201chugely important and beneficial,\u201d though several Google employees familiar with the letter would speak of it only on the condition of anonymity, saying they were concerned about retaliation.The statement said the company\u2019s part of Project Maven was \u201cspecifically scoped to be for non-offensive purposes,\u201d though officials declined to make available the relevant contract language. The Defense Department said that because Google is a subcontractor on Project Maven to the prime contractor, ECS Federal, it could not provide either the amount or the language of Google\u2019s contract. ECS Federal did not respond to inquiries.Google said the Pentagon was using \u201copen-source object recognition software available to any Google Cloud customer\u201d and based on unclassified data. \u201cThe technology is used to flag images for human review and is intended to save lives and save people from having to do highly tedious work,\u201d the company said.An uneasiness about military contracts among a small fraction of Google\u2019s more than 70,000 employees may not pose a major obstacle to the company\u2019s growth. But in the rarefied area of artificial intelligence research, Google is engaged in intense competition with other tech companies for the most talented people, so recruiters could be hampered if some candidates are put off by Google\u2019s defense connections.The employees\u2019 protest letter to Mr. Pichai, which has been circulated on an internal communications system for several weeks, argues that embracing military work could backfire by alienating customers and potential recruits.\u201cThis plan will irreparably damage Google\u2019s brand and its ability to compete for talent,\u201d the letter says. \u201cAmid growing fears of biased and weaponized AI, Google is already struggling to keep the public\u2019s trust.\u201d It suggests that Google risks being viewed as joining the ranks of big defense contractors like Raytheon, General Dynamics and the big-data firm Palantir.Like other onetime upstarts turned powerful Silicon Valley behemoths, Google is being forced to confront the idealism that guided the company in its early years. Facebook started with the lofty mission of connecting people all over the world, but it has recently come under fire for becoming a conduit for fake news and being used by Russia to influence the 2016 election and sow dissent among American voters.Paul Scharre, a former Pentagon official and author of \u201cArmy of None,\u201d a forthcoming book on the use of artificial intelligence to build autonomous weapons, said the clash inside Google was inevitable, given the company\u2019s history and the booming demand for A.I. in the military.\u201cThere\u2019s a strong libertarian ethos among tech folks, and a wariness about the government\u2019s use of technology,\u201d said Mr. Scharre, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security in Washington. \u201cNow A.I. is suddenly and quite quickly moving out of the research lab and into real life.\u201dScott Shane reported from Washington, and Daisuke Wakabayashi from San Francisco.

Minefields dot Bosnia\u2019s Trebevic mountainsides. Large areas of Kosovo, Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina remain plagued by mines and other live bombs two decades after the Balkan wars of the 1990s. Mr. Rorandelli, a Rome-based photographer who specializes in global social and environmental issues, was struck by how the locals dealt with the deadly reality underfoot. \u201cEven though the land was there,\u201d he said, \u201cit was as if it did not exist.\u201d Moved to expose the consequences of Bosnian war-era land mines, Mr. Rorandelli, a founder of Terra Project, an Italian photography collective, traveled through Croatia, Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina. His project, \u201cMineland \u2014 The Endless War,\u201d includes portraits of land mine survivors, aerial photographs of minefields and demining operations, and images of exploded ordnance and prosthetic limbs. Keeping the issue current helps countries raise the funds needed for demining, a painstaking, expensive proposition. Land mine watch groups estimate that globally there are 110 million land mines in the ground and an equal number in stockpiles waiting to be planted or destroyed. The cost to remove them all: $50 to $100 billion. None of the countries in the Balkan region will meet the demining deadline of 2019 that was set in the U.N. treaty. Nongovernmental personnel working on demining worry that Bosnia might never be declared mine free, Mr. Rorandelli said. \u201cA former Bosnian deminer who lost his leg during operations also told me that the company that used to employ him had subpar quality controls for decontamination,\u201d he said. The Bosnian, he said, vowed to never walk on a piece of land that his company had decontaminated \u201cunless some other company demined it again after us.\u201dFor the local authorities, land mine contamination is also a political land mine. They prefer to keep the issue \u201clow-key,\u201d Mr. Rorandelli said, to attract investors and tourists. \u201cOn the other hand,\u201d he said, \u201cthey need to keep talking about it, so to reduce the risk for civilians and to keep foreign aid agencies and N.G.O.s investing in demining.\u201dLand mine survivors told Mr. Rorandelli they lived two lives: one before losing an arm or leg, and another afterward, with more limited possibilities. The insult to their injury is that they often lose their place in the world, their standing in society \u2014 job, home, purpose.\u201cThere is still an aura of stigma around men \u2014 and women even more \u2014 who have lost limbs because of explosions,\u201d he said. \u201cMany victims lose their jobs and often the government cannot guarantee a decent pension. Without strong family support, people can lose hope.\u201d Among his subjects who lost limbs in the prime of their life is Avni Lubovci of Kosovo, who lost a leg at age 15 in 1999. In 2011, his prosthesis caused an infection, forcing another partial amputation. To Mr. Rorandelli, Mr. Lubovci represents a hopeful future. \u201cHe realized that the only way to get his voice heard was to find others similar to his,\u201d Mr. Rorandelli said. \u201cIn the face of great challenges, he opened the first N.G.O. in Kosovo assisting land mine victims.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rhodesia\u2019s Dead \u2014 but White Supremacists Have Given It New Life Online", "Date": "2018-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt WarIn the sepia-toned photo, two white soldiers patrol on foot over brush and rocky ground. Lean and bearded, they carry what appear to be Belgian rifles, and they wear an unusual uniform \u2014 cloth jungle hats, short shorts and tennis shoes \u2014 associated with a military unit that was disbanded nearly 40 years ago.That unit was called the Selous Scouts, a special-forces regiment from the Rhodesian Army, which fought black insurgent armies in the Bush War of the 1960s and \u201970s to maintain white-minority rule over territory that is now Zimbabwe.Not long after Rhodesia ceased to exist, it became morally untenable to mourn its disappearance. As the rest of the world woke up to the injustices of Western colonialism and its system of white-minority governments, the Selous Scouts and their cause became taboo.But late last year, the image of two Scouts began to circulate on Instagram, part of a social-media resurgence of Rhodesia as a source of inspiration. Photos of soldiers marching through grassland and rivers, special-forces units jumping out of helicopters and civilians posing in front of their homes with rifles collected hundreds, sometimes thousands, of likes on posts seeming to offer tribute to a hardened and forgotten cadre of Cold War-era bush fighters. The online movement also caught the attention of opportunistic apparel marketers who started selling Rhodesian-themed T-shirts, posters and patches, among other collectibles.Nostalgia for Rhodesia has since grown into a subtle and profitable form of racist messaging, with its own line of terminology, hashtags and merchandise, peddled to military-history fans and firearms enthusiasts by a stew of far-right provocateurs.In conversations and email exchanges with The New York Times, some prominent social-media figures and companies selling Rhodesia-themed merchandise denied trafficking in white-power messages, or said they had done so unwittingly. A few said their affinity for Rhodesia derived from the government\u2019s supposed anticommunist stance.Demand for Rhodesian-themed apparel has since increased. Today one retailer, the Commissar Clothing Company, offers \u201cMake Zimbabwe Rhodesia Again\u201d hoodies and T-shirts and others that read \u201cBe a Man Among Men,\u201d a Rhodesian Army recruiting slogan now used by hate groups. The online store was taken down in March, but its merchandise is still available on the company\u2019s eBay storefront.Commissar goes further, offering shirts that say \u201cSlot Floppies,\u201d a phrase that is sometimes used as a hashtag on Instagram and other social media platforms to promote Rhodesian-themed posts and messaging. \u201cFloppy,\u201d in 1970s Rhodesia, was the equivalent of an unprintable racist epithet in the United States, while \u201cslot\u201d was Rhodesian military slang for \u201cshoot.\u201dWhen The Times asked Instagram whether #MakeZimbabweRhodesiaAgain and other hashtags violated community standards, the social-media company issued this statement: \u201cWe have blocked these hashtags for violating our hate-speech policies,\u201d it said, \u201cand they will no longer be searchable on Instagram.\u201dIf such symbols and slogans, for a North American audience, lack the instant shock effect of a Confederate or Nazi flag, that is part of the point. Commissar Clothing\u2019s website, now shuttered, explained its products\u2019 wink-and-nod appeal: \u201cWe think you should be able to tell the world about you without saying a word,\u201d it read. \u201cThe great thing about most of our designs is that they are essentially inside jokes and references that the general public will not understand.\u201dWhen reached by email, Commissar Clothing\u2019s owner, Alexander Smyth, said, \u201cI do not support or condone racism of any sort.\u201dThe online apparel company FireForce Ventures, whose website is registered to the Canadian Army reservist Henry Lung, offers reproduction Rhodesian flags, recruiting posters and various patches of the Rhodesian security forces. Lung, who is of Chinese descent, told The Times, \u201cI see the veteran community, the Rhodesian community, as one to be honored,\u201d but insisted that he was not a white supremacist, and that he was \u201cjust trying to make a little bit of extra cash.\u201dHeidi Beirich, head of the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s Intelligence Project, said the uptick of pro-Rhodesian messaging is a purposeful amplification of the ideology and practice of \u201cracist colonial regimes\u201d \u2014 and possibly even an exhortation to war.\u201cAll the talk right now among people in the alt-right and the broader white supremacist movement is about the need for a white ethno-state,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd when you praise Rhodesia, in this context, what you\u2019re praising is violence to that end.\u201d\u201cThere were no defenses for apartheid regimes and colonialism 20 years ago,\u201d Beirich added. \u201cAnd now all of a sudden we\u2019re seeing this stuff pop up.\u201dThe colonial government refused. In 1965 it renamed itself Rhodesia and broke from the United Kingdom with the express purpose of maintaining white rule. The new government was led by Ian Smith, who declared that \u201cthe white man is master of Rhodesia. He has built it, and he intends to keep it.\u201dSmith\u2019s government soon found itself at war with a black insurgency, fighting for representative government and self-rule. Many of the fighters received weapons from China or the Soviet Union. Rhodesia\u2019s government labeled them \u201ccommunists\u201d and \u201cterrorists.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a complicated story,\u201d said Gerald Horne, author of \u201cFrom the Barrel of a Gun\u201d and a professor of history and African-American studies at the University of Houston. \u201cBut of course the apartheid side knew what sold in Washington, so they portrayed it as a battle against communism because it got pulses racing in the United States.\u201dThe battle for perception is playing out again now on social media, which pro-Rhodesia accounts or commenters are using to rewrite Rhodesian history in gentle tones. On Jan. 27, the Instagram page @historicalwarfareinc posted the photo below, claiming it depicted an army officer deciding the fate of a prisoner.The photograph is well known. It was taken in September 1977 by an Associated Press photographer, J. Ross Baughman, who was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for capturing the brutality of the Rhodesian Army.It added: \u201cNcube reportedly later died after three days of brutal, nonstop torture.\u201dAs of April 6, the photo with the more anodyne caption had nearly 1,850 likes.Some pro-Rhodesia voices on social media are not so subtle.Last December Joseph Smith, a 22-year-old resident of Rexburg, Idaho, who told The Times he had not heard of Rhodesia until 18 months ago, posted a YouTube video that he said offered \u201ca quick rundown\u201d of Rhodesian history. The video has received more than 180,000 views.Comments on it included calls for Rhodesia to return, claims that the West betrayed Rhodesia and outright hostility to the idea of black-majority rule. With more than 1,700 comments in just the last three months, the discussion quickly devolved into a stream of racial and ethnic slurs against African-Americans and Jews, calling for them to be shoved into gas chambers and ovens.In an email to The Times, Smith wrote that he felt persecuted and that he has found Rhodesian themes compelling. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware these days being a conservative heterosexual white male is rather unpopular in the eyes of many,\u201d and that \u201cthis is the demographic that caused Rhodesia to thrive as well as it did for as long as it did.\u201dHe insisted, however, that his attraction to Rhodesian nostalgia was not racist. \u201cI do not think that it\u2019s a race issue though,\u201d he wrote. \u201cPartly I just feel like white people like having a team to root for these days.\u201dThe Selous Armory, a Massachusetts apparel company run by Sean Lucht, a Boston firefighter and Marine veteran, sold a red-and-white \u201cMake Zimbabwe Rhodesia Again\u201d patch online until recently. The site also sold T-shirts with sayings like \u201cRhodesians Never Die\u201d and \u201cApply Violence\u201d with the Rhodesian Foreign Legion logo, in addition to \u201cBe a Man Among Men\u201d posters. When The Times reached out to Lucht for comment about the business in March, all the merchandise was stripped from the website and an announcement was published on its home page saying, \u201cThe Selous Armory was always a place for military history/humor and never a place for hate.\u201d The announcement added that the Selous Armory had ceased all operations. Lucht did not respond to numerous requests for comment.The Instagram account of retired Delta Force master sergeant Larry Vickers also displays an affinity for Rhodesia.With roughly 900,000 followers on YouTube, Facebook and Instagram, Vickers \u2014 a marksmanship instructor who says he trains special-operations forces, law enforcement and civilians \u2014 attracts a social-media audience with an interest in military history and firearms.On Instagram, Vickers first publicly professed his fondness for Rhodesian history in September 2014, posting a photo of Rhodesian soldiers returning from a raid. Since 2017, he has shared many photos of Belgian FAL rifles painted in the splotchy yellow-and-green camouflage favored by Rhodesian troops in the Bush War of the 1970s.The caption on one photo from last year expressed reverence: \u201cRespect and remember,\u201d it read. In a telephone interview, Vickers told The Times that his attraction to the Rhodesian security forces stems from their having carried out \u201csome of the most daring special operations missions in history on a shoestring.\u201d He has repeatedly referred to the fall of Rhodesia as \u201cthe greatest tragedy of the post-World War II era.\u201d His own YouTube videos on the Rhodesian rifle have nearly 300,000 page views. Racist comments and calls for racist violence cluttered the comments sections \u2014 until he was asked about them by The Times.The owner of the company, David Selvaggio, said in a telephone interview that he did not know what had been driving recent online interest in Rhodesia. \u201cI\u2019ve been told that yes, there\u2019s young guys getting into it and they\u2019re showing an interest in it. I\u2019m not sure why.\u201dWhen told that the Rhodesian rifle had become a totem for American white supremacists, Selvaggio pleaded ignorance. \u201cWhat I remember of it is seeing pictures of the FALs on the guys over there fighting. I don\u2019t even know what they were fighting, except against communism, from what I was told. Maybe I need to do some studying on my history here.\u201dHe added that he hoped the next Dylann Roof wouldn\u2019t carry one of his company\u2019s rifles. \u201cThat does concern me,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want anybody saying, \u2018Hey, this is a call to arms, and we have to use a FAL, and we\u2019re for this crazy wacko group.\u2019 That\u2019s not us.\u201dFor Beirich, it\u2019s impossible to pay tribute to the Rhodesian security forces and their equipment without also glorifying the ideology the country was built on.\u201cIn the same way you don\u2019t have people glorifying Nazi soldiers without understanding what the regime fought for,\u201d Beirich said. \u201cYou can\u2019t separate fighting for the Confederacy from the ultimate goal of the Confederacy.\u201dJohn Ismay covers armed conflict for The New York Times Magazine out of Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Shipping Costs Have Put Amazon in a Bind: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Good Friday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Does Amazon have its shipping costs under control?\u2022 What will come out of the Merkel-Trump meeting?\u2022 Why Deutsche Bank was so late to make necessary cuts.\u2022 More complaints have emerged about NBC News\u2019s response to harassment allegations.Amazon\u2019s shipping costs have suddenly become a hot subject, not just to President Trump, but also to the 100 million people who have Amazon Prime.Higher shipping costs are a reason Amazon is raising the cost of Prime membership to $119 a year from $99.But a 20 percent hike is a lot for even a popular service, and it could turn customers off. So why did Amazon do it? The e-commerce giant\u2019s results provide some clues.Members of Prime get free shipping, though their membership fees partially pay for that perk. As the Prime program covers more goods, it\u2019s getting more expensive for Amazon. \u201cOur two-day shipping, it\u2019s now available on over 100 million items, up from 20 million as recently as 2014,\u201d Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon\u2019s C.F.O., said on a conference call Thursday when announcing the increase in the Prime membership fee.The cost pressures from shipping are getting uncomfortable for Amazon. Worldwide shipping costs totaled $6.1 billion in the first quarter of this year, equivalent to 22.5 percent of Amazon\u2019s sales from its online stores during the period. That\u2019s up from 2017, when quarterly shipping costs averaged 19.9 percent of online sales. By bringing shipping costs back down to 20 percent of online sales, Amazon could, in theory, save over $2.5 billion a year (2.5 percent of annualized first-quarter sales comes to roughly $2.8 billion.)To save money, Amazon could offer free shipping on fewer goods, but that could undermine the company\u2019s efforts to bolster sales. And Amazon doesn\u2019t need to do that if it can increase its Prime fees, to help recoup the higher shipping costs. But the fee increase may not be enough. Charging 100 million Prime members an extra $20 per year, in theory, raises \u201conly\u201c $2 billion.- Peter EavisMore on her challenge, from the NYT:Few leaders seem less personally in sync with Mr. Trump than Ms. Merkel. Estranged by widely diverging temperaments and leadership styles, the two leaders have also clashed on substance \u2014 from climate change and military spending to Germany\u2019s chronic, yawning trade surplus with the United States, a particular bugbear of the president.Or as a former State Department official told the NYT, \u201cMerkel is going to Washington and it looks like the U.S. just doesn\u2019t care.\u201d But a foreign relations expert said, \u201cNever underestimate Merkel.\u201dA combination of the two companies would complete one of the telecommunications industry\u2019s most long-awaited transactions and would create the third-largest wireless carrier in the United States, with more than 127 million customers. Sprint and T-Mobile have tried to negotiate a merger twice before.Analysts have argued, and Sprint and T-Mobile themselves have acknowledged, that the companies need greater scale and more resources to better compete against the industry\u2019s leaders, Verizon and AT&T.Should the deal be completed, only three companies would dominate the market in the United States for cellphone service. It is unclear whether the transaction would get regulatory approval. A previous round of merger talks ended in 2014, having drawn strong opposition from the Obama administration.\u2014 Michael de la MercedWhat Mr. Ubben had to say: \u201cThe management and board of FOX has done a superb job of steering the company through a time of transition for the entertainment industry.\u201dWhat Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch had to say: \u201cJeff has been an important partner during a transformational period. Our board and, ultimately, our shareholders, have benefited enormously from his many contributions.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la Merced\u2022 Nonresidential fixed investment \u2014 what businesses spend on equipment, software, buildings and intellectual property \u2014 increased at a solid 6.1 percent.\u2022 Business spending on equipment climbed 4.7 percent, down from 11.6 percent in the fourth quarter.Bigger pictureEconomists on Wall Street and in Washington have repeatedly warned that the economy\u2019s upward streak is unlikely to extend beyond the next year or two.Over the longer term, the Fed expects real annual growth in the United States to fall to 1.8 percent. The Congressional Budget Office\u2019s 10-year outlook comes to the same disappointing conclusion.The nation\u2019s debt has topped $21 trillion and is growing, a level many view as unsustainable. And if the Federal Reserve follows through on its plan to raise interest rates, the cost of paying off that debt will grow larger.\u2022 Hubris: Unlike rivals, Deutsche Bank didn\u2019t raise capital after the financial crisis, ultimately leaving it significantly weaker. By the end of last year, its tangible equity capital ratio was still below JPMorgan Chase in 2011. (Perhaps Germany\u2019s banking regulator should have applied more pressure, as Switzerland\u2019s did.)\u2022 Fear: Did Deutsche Bank\u2019s leaders worry about scaling back the investment bank because of its huge importance for revenue? (Last year, it provided 54 percent.) And about the cost of unwinding some trades?The news organization asserted that the complaints that led to Matt Lauer being ousted from the \u201cToday\u201d show were the first of their kind. Others disagree:What NBC News has done: Brought in a consultant for in-person sexual harassment prevention seminars and pledged to share the results of an internal review.The online video giant has largely avoided the political heat that has burned Facebook, but it has still lurched from crisis to crisis, particularly over upsetting videos.The idea is that someday humans will be able to train the machines, in a similar manner, to sniff out misinformation, smut, and abuse.Sure, there\u2019s logic to it, in the face of the threat from Netflix and Amazon. But as the two companies continue to bicker over price and executive chairs, is there another reason Shari Redstone is pushing the idea so hard, when other CBS shareholders seem uninterested?What seems to be driving Shari Redstone is familial score-settling, a quest for victory over her father, who never wanted her to have a role in either Viacom or CBS. \u201cIt\u2019s the story of a person who was mistreated by her father,\u201d said the source who recently noted Sumner\u2019s physical condition, and has known the father and daughter for an extensive period of time.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Nicaragua Roiled by Protests Over Social Security Benefits", "Date": "2018-04-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 Extraordinary protests against the government of President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua extended into a third day on Friday as thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in Managua, the capital, and other cities, clashing with government security forces and barricading neighborhoods in opposition to newly announced changes in the social security program.At least three people, including a police officer, have been killed in the protests since they began on Wednesday, according to the authorities, and dozens of people have been wounded.The demonstrations have been partly driven by students from the country\u2019s public universities, which historically have been a faithful base of support for Mr. Ortega. They have been joined by a variety of groups, including retirees. The protests are among the largest and most violent in Nicaragua\u2019s recent history.They were set off by changes to the social security system approved by the Ortega administration this week, but they also tapped growing discontent with the government, protesters and analysts said.\u201cThe protests are a consequence of years of unsatisfied demands and growing repression and censorship to dissident groups,\u201d said Manuel Orozco, senior fellow at the Inter-American Dialogue, a think tank in Washington.The political situation in Nicaragua had been deteriorating since the re-election of Mr. Ortega in 2016 to a third consecutive term amid charges of electoral fraud. \u201cSince then, there\u2019s been an open wound in society,\u201d Mr. Orozco said.The Ortega administration further alienated more constituents by raising the possibility of censoring social media sites and by its widely criticized handling of a major wildfire that burned out of control for days, destroying parts of a protected tropical forest, Mr. Orozco said.Among the modifications to the pension system, both employees and employers must contribute more to the social security system, and retirees will see a reduction in their pensions, as more money will be taken out to cover medical expenses.Demonstrations initially erupted in Managua and Le\u00f3n but soon spread to at least 10 other cities, including Granada, Masaya and Matagalpa.Videos circulating on social media sites have shown protesters, wearing motorcycle helmets for protection, throwing rocks and homemade fire bombs at armed riot police officers, who have responded by firing tear gas and rubber bullets.Waves of counterprotesters have also spilled into the streets in support of the government. In Masaya, a bastion of support for Mr. Ortega\u2019s Sandinista movement, government supporters attacked protesters with sticks, Reuters reported.A 29-year-old man was killed on Thursday night near the Polytechnic University of Nicaragua in Managua, the scene of clashes between protesters and the police, according to the university\u2019s employees union. Family members told union representatives that the man had died after being hit in the neck by a rubber bullet.Also on Thursday, clashes with groups that the police described as vandals at the Polytechnic University left one police officer dead. A counterprotester was shot and killed in Tipitapa, a municipality near the capital, by \u201cgroups of vandals\u201d who were trying to storm the mayor\u2019s offices, the police said. Protesters claimed that the victim had been a member of the opposition movement.The government ordered cable television providers to cut the signal to several stations not under state control.\u201cThey are threatening us!\u201d Miguel Mora, the director of one of the stations, 100% Noticias, declared Friday on Facebook. \u201cWe are not scared!\u201d The station has continued to broadcast via social media.Liz Throssell, spokeswoman for the United Nations Human Rights Office, called on the Ortega administration \u201cto ensure that people are able to freely exercise their right to freedom of expression and to peaceful assembly and association.\u201d\u201cWe also urge those demonstrating to do so peacefully,\u201d Ms. Throssell added.The protests seemed likely to get bigger despite the crackdown. On Friday, a leader of a peasants\u2019 movement vowed to mobilize her constituents, potentially numbering in the thousands, and march on Managua.President Ortega has remained silent, issuing no public declarations. But Vice President Rosario Murillo, who is also the first lady, issued statements that were broadcast on state-controlled media on Thursday saying that the protesters were being manipulated for political purposes.Ms. Murillo said the protests were organized by \u201cthose tiny groups that inflame and destabilize to destroy Nicaragua.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Here\u2019s What He Can Expect.", "Date": "2018-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut Mr. Trump most likely will not get the honors of a traditional state visit, a highly ceremonial and very British affair, when he arrives on July 13.Here is what he can expect.Invitations for state visits, extended by Queen Elizabeth II on the advice of the government, are rare, honorific and convey a strong relationship between Britain and the country of the visiting foreign leader.But just how different in substance such visits are from working or official visits is less obvious.\u201cThe distinction between a working visit and a state visit is increasingly lost, apart from the ceremonial aspects,\u201d Peter Westmacott, former British ambassador to the United States, said by phone on Friday.\u201cWe got Nicolas Sarkozy to the U.K. for a state visit less than a year after he became president of France, and that was unusual,\u201d Mr. Westmacott said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t because the U.K. wanted anything in particular from him; it was rather that France is our closest, most important neighbor, and we would normally try and get a state visit for such an important figure into the diary as soon as possible.\u201d\u201cState visits are quite personal,\u201d he added, \u201cand it\u2019s often the case that the earlier you arrange one, the greater the impact it has.\u201d\u201cThe reason why we don\u2019t often get a full-blown state visit by a president of the United States, I think, is that it\u2019s four days, and it\u2019s often hard for the leader of the free world to spend that much time away in a single country,\u201d Mr. Westmacott said.The announcement of Mr. Trump\u2019s visit received mixed reactions from British politicians and the public. Britain\u2019s foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, used Mr. Trump\u2019s erratically capitalized tweet format to convey his excitement over welcoming the American president:\u201cLooking forward to seeing our closest ally and friend on the GREATest visit ever,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.Nigel Evans, a Conservative member of Parliament, also welcomed the visit, calling it \u201csuperb news\u201d that will strengthen the relationship between Britain and the United States.\u201cWhen Donald Trump arrives on these shores, we and thousands of our supporters will very definitely be making our voices heard,\u201d Kate Allen, Amnesty International U.K.\u2019s director, said in an interview with BBC Radio Kent.Some of Mr. Trump\u2019s critics have said that the president canceled a previous working visit planned for earlier this year because of his concerns over protests. At the time, Mr. Trump said he canceled the trip \u2014 originally planned for the opening of the new United States Embassy \u2014 because he considered the building\u2019s relocation a \u201cbad deal\u201d made under the Obama administration.Mrs. May hopes to strike a free-trade deal with the United States once it has quit Europe\u2019s tariff-free trading area.So Mr. Trump\u2019s visit to Britain provides an opportunity for Mrs. May to prove that she retains a healthy and close-working relationship with the president, despite recent tensions.Stephen Castle contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Marissa Mayer Is Still Here", "Date": "2018-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCorner OfficeThe former Yahoo chief is renting Google\u2019s original office, where \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of good juju,\u201d and planning her next act. She just won\u2019t say what it is. Marissa Mayer was celebrated as a savior when she left Google to become chief executive of Yahoo in 2012. A brilliant computer scientist, Ms. Mayer was the 20th employee at Google, and influenced many of the company\u2019s signature features \u2014 including Gmail and Google Maps.But could she save Yahoo? The company was reeling from boardroom tumult and a series of executive changeovers when she arrived, and Google and Facebook were winning the war for online eyeballs and ad dollars. Her tenure was ferociously controversial. Investors did well during Ms. Mayer\u2019s five years at the helm, seeing the value of their shares more than triple. But Ms. Mayer\u2019s every decision was second-guessed by Silicon Valley, and she was unable to make Yahoo relevant again. Last year, Yahoo was sold to Verizon, and Ms. Mayer left the company. This interview \u2014 Ms. Mayer\u2019s first since leaving Yahoo \u2014 was condensed and edited for clarity, and conducted in her personal office in Palo Alto, Calif. I rented the old Google office. So this is actually the office where I started my career in 1999. This is also where PayPal started, so there\u2019s a lot of good juju here. Coming back here, it reminds me of what Google felt like in those early moments. I remember running up those steps, because if you didn\u2019t get here fast enough on Saturday morning, someone in the world was going to get worse search results, and it might change their life for the worse. So you haven\u2019t joined a company or founded a company yet?We have this little lab that we\u2019re working on called Lumi Labs. In Finnish, lumi means snow, and I just love snow. I had a snowflake-themed wedding. We have some ideas in the consumer space. So I\u2019ve been meeting with different founders and just seeing what\u2019s happening in the industry.What kind of managers were Larry Page and Sergey Brin during the early days, and how did you think about developing your own management skills?Larry and Sergey just yelled at us until we became what they needed us to become, and get done what they needed to be done. And so I said, look, I\u2019m going to just rinse and repeat that, hopefully with less yelling. We ultimately brought in management coaches and all kinds of mentoring.I think you can have high expectations as a leader, and as long as they\u2019re consistent and clearly communicated, a lot of people find that really inspiring. I always knew what Larry and Sergey wanted. I knew what good looked like to them, and so I never got discouraged by them saying, \u201cWait, I don\u2019t think this is ready\u201d or \u201cI think this is overly ready.\u201d At a start-up you never really know when should you launch something. So Google built the philosophy of launching early and often. Try things out and see what works.As Google grew, how did you work to maintain a cohesive culture?There are different phases of companies. When you\u2019re in the tens of people, the idea itself either attracts people or it doesn\u2019t. People are there because they think the problem you\u2019re trying to solve is just that important.The next phase is where it\u2019s really critical and it\u2019s hard. Getting from 100 employees to 1,000, you have to be very careful. There\u2019s a strategy around compensation at that point, where you really want somebody who\u2019s coming for the right reasons. To get the people who are really aligned with the mission, you want to make sure that they\u2019re fairly compensated, but not necessarily motivated by that compensation. I had a strategy both at Yahoo and at Google of \u201cmeet, not beat.\u201d It\u2019s the trade-off between mercenaries and missionaries. And then around 1,000 people, the culture and the mission become self-reinforcing. At Google I\u2019d always ask new people, \u201cWhy did you come?\u201d When we were about 1,200 people, all of a sudden, for the first time, I actually heard the answer, \u201cI came for the culture.\u201d Why did you leave Google? I was 37, and I had been working at Google for 13 years. I had been on search for 10 of those years and just had very recently made the change over to focus on Maps as a search technology. And I was like, \u201cYou know, I\u2019m just not sure that I want to be like the 50-year-old search girl.\u201dI\u2019d always had huge respect for Yahoo as a company. When we were here in this office, we dreamed of maybe getting the Yahoo contract, maybe one day powering Yahoo search. In 1999, Yahoo was the internet. And I knew that while there were a lot of things going wrong for the board and leadership at Yahoo, there were a lot of really good people there working on the products. What was the best-case scenario for Yahoo when you took over? Returning it to the pre-eminence in its users\u2019 daily lives, where it used to be people were on Yahoo for half an hour to many hours a day. Could we get back to that type of usage? Yahoo had to deal with some nasty shareholder activist campaigns, and several readers asked about your thoughts on activism. Were there upsides, or was it more of a distraction? One of the more tragic cases of Yahoo is the Alibaba stake. Both Carl Icahn\u2019s campaign and some of the people who were part of Dan Loeb\u2019s campaign really wanted a commitment to see that stake sold. And Yahoo sold half of that stake in a $35 billion market cap for Alibaba, eroding tens of billions of dollars of upside. So certainly that was not positive. Sometimes that shortsightedness of wanting to get a return quickly can cause you to miss a much bigger gain.What would it have taken to fix Yahoo? I was playing with Magna-Tiles with my son one Sunday, and we had built this giant kind of castle complex, and it collapsed. And my son was crestfallen. I stopped, and I said: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be upset about. We built it and it worked once, and we\u2019ll just rebuild it.\u201d When I said that to him, I realized that\u2019s how I felt about Yahoo. You\u2019re rebuilding something and you know that it worked once, so it should be able to work again. With #MeToo in the news, lots of readers wanted to hear your thoughts on being a woman in Silicon Valley right now. I think it\u2019s an important set of conversations that\u2019s happening. I also want to take a longer-term view. As important as these conversations are, I hope we\u2019re able to have them in a concentrated way, fix the problems and move on from them. Because I worry about what happens to the next generation.You\u2019ve just got to keep at it.Advertisement"}

Taken together, they reveal that, even as some major Republican donors have warmed to Mr. Trump, his political operation is not abandoning the approach that carried it through much of the 2016 campaign, when it relied primarily on a stream of donations from small donors giving online.During the first three months of this year, Mr. Parscale\u2019s firm was paid $1.7 million for digital consulting and online advertising, according to Sunday\u2019s reports. Much of that was probably passed through to website and social media platforms, though the campaign also paid Facebook $4,700 for ads directly.An additional $2.3 million was spent on direct mail, which is typically used to solicit small and medium-size donations, while $210,000 went to a collection of eight fund-raising consultants, and $158,000 was spent on telemarketing.The investment in low-dollar fund-raising is already paying dividends. More than half of the total raised by the three committees this year came from donors who gave $200 or less, the reports show.To be sure, the Trump Victory committee, which was created to raise big checks from major donors, did raise $4.9 million from more than 60 donors who gave $20,000 or more each, including $250,000 checks from the Wisconsin industrialist Elizabeth Uihlein, the Alaska investor Robert B. Gillam and the Las Vegas restaurateur Craig Estey and his wife, Patricia.A third of the committees\u2019 $863,000 in legal fees went to two firms involved in the legal fight with the adult film star known as Stormy Daniels. Those firms \u2014 Harder LLP and Larocca, Hornik, Rosen, Greenberg & Blaha \u2014 were paid a combined $280,000. A campaign official said the payments were not related to Ms. Daniels.Another $376,000 was paid to Jones Day, the firm representing the campaign on election law and campaign finance compliance, as well as matters related to the investigation of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.Mr. Trump\u2019s committees also continued to pay his businesses for a variety of functions, including nearly $58,000 in rent and $59,000 in facility rental and catering services to the Trump International Hotel in Washington.The three Trump committees ended March with $44.3 million in the bank.Advertisement"}

His 1978 book \u201cTabula Rasa\u201d consists of 1,000 blank pages. \u201cEcce Kosti,\u201d from 1996, is a collection of favorable reviews of his work.\u201cThe two values most important to me as a writer are audacity and comedy,\u201d said Mr. Kostelanetz, who grew up in Manhattan and Scarsdale, attended Brown and Columbia Universities, and enjoyed early success writing journalism and criticism.Richard Kostelanez moved into a loft on Wooster Street in SoHo in 1974, when the neighborhood was an artist haven.\u201cIt was such an artistic hot house,\u201d he recalled. \u201cIt was a like a college campus. Everybody knew everybody else.\u201dThe SoHo art scene became edged out by gentrification, a transformation he chronicled in his 2003 book \u201cSoHo: The Rise and Fall of an Artists\u2019 Colony.\u201d And Mr. Kostelanetz\u2019s loft \u2014 Wordship \u2014 became packed to capacity with books.He set his sights on newer artist neighborhoods along the L Train line in Brooklyn, and in 2010 found his current building: a nearly windowless fortress with roughly 7,000 square feet of space.\u201cIt was a Serbian-owned knitting factory \u2014 there were 30 or 40 women on sewing machines,\u201d when he was first shown it, he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had people walk right up to it and tell me on their cellphones, \u2018I can\u2019t find it.\u2019\u201dMr. Kostelanetz renovated the building to accommodate his two loves: books and swimming. He installed countless bookshelves and an infinity pool that allows him to swim naked after midnight before he goes to bed. This helps him stay in shape for summers spent on Rockaway Beach, where he is friendly with the lifeguards who work at Beach 60th Street.Less collegial are his feelings about the literary and publishing establishment that he has long faulted for being clique-ish and failing to adequately recognize him.Also for posterity, Mr. Kostelanetz has been buying back copies of his own books for sale online, to consolidate an inventory of his work. He has made longtime associates trustees of his estate, in the hope of turning his building and its contents into a museum after he dies.\u201cI\u2019d like to leave something behind,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully, they\u2019ll be much better selling me than I have been.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s first Congressional hearing is here.\u2022 Sprint and T-Mobile have restarted merger talks.\u2022 Wall Street continues to wade into the gun control debate.\u2022 The raid on Michael Cohen\u2019s office and residence raises a number of issues.\u2022 The C.B.O. is still underestimating how bad the deficit is going to be.Congressional hearings focusing on corporate missteps often reveal little, in part because lawmakers lack the expertise and the executives taking questions are good at stone-walling.Still, Tuesday\u2019s hearing turned out to be a serious attempt to grapple with the growing influence of a powerful company that is entwined in the lives of millions of Americans.Lawmakers, it became clear, no longer see Facebook and other large tech companies as mostly benign forces for innovation. In his responses, Mr. Zuckerberg was competent but notably did not reveal much that was new about how Facebook will respond to its enormous challenges.On balance, the hearing probably leaves Facebook and its peers on the back foot in three important ways.A Senate with a Republican majority may be less likely to pass legislation, but if the Democrats gain control, top senators from that party might push for new laws ahead of a potential run in 2020. Some of the most penetrating questions on Tuesday came from Kamala Harris, Democrat of California, and Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey.The fact that Facebook\u2019s stock rose through the hearing should not be taken as a sign that the company is in the clear.\u2014 Peter EavisInvestors certainly liked Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony on Capitol Hill Tuesday.Facebook\u2019s shares rose 4.5 percent on the day. It was the strongest single-day performance for the stock since April 2016.After being down as much as 24 percent this year, Facebook is steadily clawing back ground. Tuesday\u2019s gain left it down only 11.4 percent in 2018.\u2014 Matt PhillipsAmong the dominant themes of the hearing, and the past few weeks, has been whether Facebook needs to be regulated. In fact, Mr. Zuckerberg said he open to Facebook being regulated during his first interview after the Cambridge Analytica scandal.But some lawmakers expressed skepticism toward regulation during the hearing. Senator Dan Sullivan, Republican of Alaska, raised an important point about the impact of regulation: That it often benefits the biggest companies, at the expense smaller firms and startups.Here\u2019s Senator Sullivan\u2019s question to Mr. Zuckerberg:\u201cRegulations can also cement the dominant power. Do you think that that\u2019s a risk, given your influence, that if we regulate we\u2019re actually going to regulate you into a position of cemented authority?\u201dIn other words, if the government decides to crack down on Facebook, could that end up holding back the next Facebook?That\u2019s the question that Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina hit on and its a sensitive one for Facebook.On Tuesday, Mr.Graham asked Mr. Zuckerberg to name Facebook\u2019s biggest competitor. Mr. Zuckerberg responded that Facebook has a lot of competitors.Mr. Graham asked: \u201cIs there an alternative to Facebook?\u201dMr. Zuckerberg: \u201cWell, we provide a number of diff...\u201dMr. Graham: \u201cYou don\u2019t think that you have a monopoly?\u201dMr. Zuckerberg: \u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t feel like that to me.\u201dThe gap in knowledge about how Facebook\u2019s business works was on display at times during Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony.The company has faced questions about the possibility of creating a paid service that would allow users to opt-out of sharing their data or seeing advertisements.Mr. Zuckerberg insisted on Tuesday that there would always be a free version of Facebook, so that anyone in the world can afford to be part of its online community.At that point, Sentor Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican, asked Mr. Zuckerberg how he could sustain a business without charging anything for it.\u201cSir, we run ads,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg explained.Mr. Hatch replied: \u201cI see.\u201d\u2014 Alan RappeportSenator John Thune of South Dakota, the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, called Facebook and its role in society \u201cextraordinary\u201d and began the hearing by explaining why Facebook is being singled out and why Mr. Zuckerberg was asked to appear alone.He said the Cambridge Analytica situation underscored how Facebook can be used for nefarious reasons, saying it appeared \u201cto be the result of people exploiting the tools you created to manipulate users\u2019 information.\u201dIn an indication that he may support legislation for internet companies, Mr. Thune said, \u201cIn the past, many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have been willing to defer to tech companies\u2019 efforts to regulate themselves. But this may be changing.\u201dSenator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, who chairs the Judiciary Committee, said the tech industry \u201chas a responsibility\u201d to protect its users and said \u201cthe status quo no longer works.\u201d\u2014 Cecilia KangMr. Zuckerberg is the only technology chief in the room, but it is clear that members of Congress are treating him as a stand-in for the entirety of Silicon Valley.Mr. Grassley called the entire tech industry to account, saying \u201cthe tech industry has an obligation to\u2026restore the public\u2019s trust.\u201d Mr. Nelson put it even more bluntly: \u201cIf you and other social media companies do not get your act in order, none of us are going to have any privacy.\u201dIn his opening statement, Mr. Zuckerberg, who is 33, made a point to remind Congress that he was young when this all began.\u201cI started Facebook when I was in college,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. This is a recurring theme for Mr. Zuckerberg\u2014in many recent interviews, he has referred to starting Facebook in his Harvard dorm room. And perhaps it\u2019s wise to keep bringing up the fact that Mr. Zuckerberg is much younger than most of the business executives who come before Congress.But the strategy could also backfire. After all, Mr. Zuckerberg is a long way from his dorm room\u2014on paper, he has been a billionaire for more than a decade\u2014and by reminding lawmakers of his youth, he could also lead them to question whether he\u2019s mature enough to handle such enormous responsibilities and whether Silicon Valley needs more adult supervision in the way of additional federal regulation.\u2014 Kevin Roose\u2022 Privacy, and whether 2 billion Facebook users can consider their data safe.\u2022 The F.T.C.\u2019s 2011 consent decree with the company, and whether it was violated in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. (Facebook says not.)More from the column:The problem is that Mr. Zuckerberg has been apologizing for years for all sorts of breaches of trust with his \u201ccommunity.\u201d And guess what? After each mea culpa, the Facebook community has grown.The bank works with \u201cjust a handful of manufacturers,\u201d with whom it has had \u201cintense conversations over the last few months,\u201d Ms. Finucane said. Their reactions to the new policy have been \u201cmixed,\u201d she said.\u2014 Tiffany HsuLet\u2019s recap the tortured history of the telecom merger that hasn\u2019t quite been able to cross the finish line (which I\u2019ve covered multiple times over the years):But there\u2019s little surprise that the companies wouldn\u2019t give up on a deal. Mr. Son pursued Sprint in the first place with the idea of merging it with T-Mobile, creating a stronger competitor to Verizon and AT&T.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedOnce that determination is made, Mr. Cohen can argue that privileged materials should be returned because they are protected.Despite President Trump\u2019s tweet that \u201cthe attorney-client privilege is dead,\u201d the protection remains in place. But there is an important way around the privilege that the Justice Department may pursue. Under a doctrine called the crime-fraud exception, communications between a client and lawyer designed to assist the client to engage in a pending or future crime are not protected by the privilege.This is a slow process, likely to drag out for months. But don\u2019t be surprised to see the Justice Department claiming that communications with Mr. Cohen were made for a criminal or fraudulent purpose \u2013 whatever that might be.\u2014 Peter J. Henning(For non-lawyers: Mr. Conway\u2019s link points to the Justice Department\u2019s policies for conducting searches of lawyers.)Goldman Sachs economists point out that the C.B.O.\u2019s projections only extrapolate discretionary spending increases through 2019 fiscal year, whereas the bank\u2019s analysis points to more spending through 2021 fiscal year, raising the Goldman\u2019s deficit projections higher.Elsewhere, Jefferies economists noted that the analysis from the C.B.O. doesn\u2019t take into account the Federal Reserve\u2019s gradual reduction of the amount of government bonds it is holding, which means that the Treasury has to replace the Fed as a buyer.All else equal, the disappearance of a buyer like the Fed \u2014 which can create as much money as it needs \u2014 along with surging supply of Treasury borrowing needed to cover deepening deficits should add up one thing: Sharply higher interest rates.\u2014 Matt Phillips\u2022 \u201cSome of Novogratz\u2019s fellow hedge funders have questioned his grasp of the finer details of his trading strategies. \u2018He acts like a visionary, but at heart he\u2019s still a salesman,\u2019 one manager told me.\u201d\u2022 Novogratz is said to consider himself \u201chalfway between center-left and progressive,\u201d and \u201cDuring my lunch with him at the Mercer Kitchen, he told me, \u2018I\u2019ve always said I\u2019d run for office if I had a five-year period in my life where really I felt, like, Hey, my behavior is laudable.\u2019\u201dPublic negotiations between the corporate siblings have intensified. Viacom\u2019s counterproposal \u2014 0.68 of a CBS share for every Viacom share, or $14.7 billion; CBS had offered 0.55, or $11.9 billion \u2014 is likely to be rejected.Price may be less of a sticking point, however, than CBS\u2019s insistence on keeping its chief operating officer, Joe Ianniello, in the No. 2 spot after a merger. That\u2019s the job Viacom wants for its C.E.O., Bob Bakish. Michael has heard that this is a serious disagreement, with little movement toward a compromise as yet.\u2022 Canvas Ventures and Kirsten Green\u2019s Forerunner Ventures tied for first place on The Information\u2019s V.C. Diversity Index. Tied for last: Tiger Global Management and Slow Ventures.\u2022 The number of women in senior positions at U.S. venture firms rose to 14.2 percent last year, from 10.7 percent. The percentage of Hispanic decision makers rose to 2.3 percent from 1.9 percent, while that of black senior leaders stayed roughly flat at just over 1 percent.On April 14 at 5 p.m., hear from Chobani\u2019s founder and C.E.O., Hamdi Ulukaya, who has resurrected economies in two communities and made headlines for his leadership practices.

The chef and sous-chef had walked out because of the amount of business. It doesn\u2019t stop.\u201dA tight labor market and an explosion of new restaurants have made finding and keeping help ever more difficult across the country.In 2017, the National Restaurant Association reports, 37 percent of its members said labor recruitment was their top challenge, up from 15 percent two years ago. With low profit margins leaving little room to do what most businesses do in tight labor markets \u2014 increase wages \u2014 restaurant owners are having to find other ways to attract and hold onto workers.They are offering incentives, like repaying culinary-school tuition for their chefs. They are hiring former prisoners as kitchen assistants, and snapping up employees whom competitors have fired. They are trying to retain employees with tequila-tasting seminars, flexible schedules and a faster pipeline up the ranks.\u201cI think the assumption is, the industry has to continue to evolve in terms of the work force it is trying to appeal to,\u201d said Gordon Lambourne, a spokesman for the National Restaurant Association Educational Foundation. \u201cPeople want flexibility, they want some growth defined for them.\u201dThe growth in dining out is clear. The nation added 15,145 restaurants, a net increase of 2.5 percent, just between the third quarters of 2016 and 2017, according to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics.In February, the last month for which data is available, food service accounted for about a quarter of all net job growth here, a 5 percent increase over the previous year, according to the Department of Labor.Restaurant industry experts say the recent crackdown on undocumented workers has sent a further chill through the business. Dishwashers and other low-wage restaurant workers have long been recruited from the nation\u2019s undocumented work force, but many restaurateurs are wary now of going to that well.\u201cOur industry is very much in need of a temporary visa program for the low-skilled, essential workers,\u201d said Shannon Meade, the National Restaurant Association\u2019s director of labor and work force policy. While visas are available for seasonal work, she added, \u201ca year-round program would go a long way to addressing our hiring and retention issue.\u201dThe labor shortage has at times altered the nature of restaurants, as well as the quality of service. \u201cIn some cases I believe it has changed the direction certain restaurants had originally planned on,\u2019\u2019 said Mr. Albisu, the Taco Bamba owner. \u201cThere is less polish.\u201dMany diners complain about restaurants where the food is expensive but the service is lacking. Water glasses are left unfilled. Guests stand waiting for attention at a host stand, and servers with little knowledge of the menu merely smile sheepishly as sophisticated customers ask questions.The more experienced workers, she said, are attracted to the increasing number of Washington restaurants with high-profile chefs, leaving midlevel establishments like hers struggling with inexperienced and often fickle help. One woman seeking a position at the bar, she said, \u201ccould not name a single varietal of wine.\u201dMr. Albisu said pride long ago succumbed to desperation. \u201cI can name two dozen people who left my company to start a new place who came back looking for their old jobs back,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the old days we would say, \u2018Hell, no.\u2019 Now we say, \u2018Sure.\u2019 We chefs call each other and say: \u2018Have you fired anyone we can repurpose? I know he can\u2019t plate, but maybe he can just grill.\u2019\u201dSo chefs and restaurant owners are casting their recruitment nets more widely.\u201cWhat we need to start doing better than ever is breaking down the stereotypes of who typically gets these jobs,\u201d Mr. Meyer, the founder of Union Square Hospitality Group, said during a recent panel discussion in Washington. \u201cWe are holding job fairs right now with organizations we were not even thinking about five years ago,\u201d he said, including those that assist people with learning disabilities, older workers and former prisoners.Still, he said the group could do more. \u201cWe can only fit so many students in our cramped classroom in the basement of a homeless shelter,\u201d he said.The National Restaurant Association has begun several programs for high school students and adults who have trouble getting work, including apprenticeships through the Department of Labor and a new initiative that helps place veterans into food service.He even outsourced the unpleasant duty of deep-cleaning the kitchen that usually fell to 20- to 30-something line cooks. \u201cI think millennials are really focused on quality of life,\u201d he said.He has also tried to clean up the kitchen in other ways. \u201cYou can\u2019t come to work and scream at people,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I was a younger chef, that was how I interacted with my team. We have a lot more positive training methods now.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t win them over with a paycheck,\u201d he said. \u201cPay is important, but of more importance is respect and admiration and learning.

Even Brain Waves.", "Date": "2018-04-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBasicsA friend will help you move, goes an old saying, while a good friend will help you move a body. And why not? Moral qualms aside, that good friend would likely agree the victim was an intolerable jerk who had it coming and, jeez, you shouldn\u2019t have done this but where do you keep the shovel?New research suggests the roots of friendship extend even deeper than previously suspected. Scientists have found that the brains of close friends respond in remarkably similar ways as they view a series of short videos: the same ebbs and swells of attention and distraction, the same peaking of reward processing here, boredom alerts there.\u201cI was struck by the exceptional magnitude of similarity among friends,\u201d said Carolyn Parkinson, a cognitive scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. The results \u201cwere more persuasive than I would have thought.\u201d Dr. Parkinson and her colleagues, Thalia Wheatley and Adam M. Kleinbaum of Dartmouth College, reported their results in Nature Communications.\u201cI think it\u2019s an incredibly ingenious paper,\u201d said Nicholas Christakis, author of \u201cConnected: The Power of Our Social Networks and How They Shape Our World\u201d and a biosociologist at Yale University. \u201cIt suggests that friends resemble each other not just superficially, but in the very structures of their brains.\u201dThe findings offer tantalizing evidence for the vague sense we have that friendship is more than shared interests or checking off the right boxes on a Facebook profile. It\u2019s about something we call good chemistry.\u201cOur results suggest that friends might be similar in how they pay attention to and process the world around them,\u201d Dr. Parkinson said. \u201cThat shared processing could make people click more easily and have the sort of seamless social interaction that can feel so rewarding.\u201dKevin N. Ochsner, a cognitive neuroscientist at Columbia University who studies social networks, said the new report is \u201ccool,\u201d \u201cprovocative\u201d and \u201craises more questions than it answers.\u201d It could well be picking up traces of \u201can ineffable shared reality\u201d between friends.Dr. Ochsner offered his own story as evidence of the primacy of chemistry over mere biography. \u201cMy wife-to-be and I were both neuroscientists in the field, we were on dating websites, but we were never matched up,\u201d he said.\u201cThen we happened to meet as colleagues and in two minutes we knew we had the kind of chemistry that breeds a relationship.\u201dDr. Parkinson \u2014 who is 31, wears large horn-rimmed glasses and has the wholesome look of a young Sally Field \u2014 described herself as introverted but said, \u201cI\u2019ve been fortunate with my friends.\u201dScientists want to know what, exactly, makes friendship so healthy and social isolation so harmful, and they\u2019re gathering provocative, if not yet definitive, clues.Researchers have also been intrigued by evidence of friendship among nonhuman animals, and not just in obvious candidates like primates, dolphins and elephants.Yet when it comes to the depth and complexity of bonds, humans have no peers. Dr. Parkinson and her co-workers previously had shown that people are keenly and automatically aware of how all the players in their social sphere fit together, and the scientists wanted to know why some players in a given network are close friends and others mere nodding acquaintances.Inspired by the research of Uri Hasson of Princeton, they decided to explore subjects\u2019 neural reactions to everyday, naturalistic stimuli \u2014 which these days means watching videos.The researchers started with a defined social network: an entire class of 279 graduate students at an unnamed university widely known among neuroscientists to have been the Dartmouth School of Business.The students, who all knew one another and in many cases lived in dorms together, were asked to fill out questionnaires. Which of their fellow students did they socialize with \u2014 share meals and go to a movie with, invite into their homes? From that survey the researchers mapped out a social network of varying degrees of connectivity: friends, friends of friends, third-degree friends, friends of Kevin Bacon.The students were then asked to participate in a brain scanning study and 42 agreed. As an fMRI device tracked blood flow in their brains, the students watched a series of video clips of varying lengths, an experience that Dr. Parkinson likened to channel surfing with somebody else in control of the remote.They watched astronaut Chris Hadfield demonstrate how water behaves like a goopy gel in low gravity. They watched a sedately sentimental scene from a Jewish wedding between two people who happened to be gay men.They watched the author Eric Schlosser warn of the dangers of allowing a few fast-food giants to control our food supply. They watched what my good friend Judy Gradwohl and I agreed, on reviewing the clips together later, was one of the worst music videos ever produced, about a man with an obviously fake facial deformity who is bullied at work and snubbed by his attractive female colleague but who eventually wins her heart when the bullies turn on her and he, Phony Elephant Man, steps in and beats them up.The students watched pratfall comedy clips and an Australian mockumentary so subtle that certain viewers confessed they didn\u2019t realize it was a spoof but liked it nonetheless.Analyzing the scans of the students, Dr. Parkinson and her colleagues found strong concordance between blood flow patterns \u2014 a measure of neural activity \u2014 and the degree of friendship among the various participants, even after controlling for other factors that might explain similarities in neural responses, like ethnicity, religion or family income.The researchers identified particularly revealing regions of pattern concordance among friends, notably in the nucleus accumbens, in the lower forebrain, which is key to reward processing, and in the superior parietal lobule, located toward the top and the back of the brain \u2014 roughly at the position of a man bun \u2014 where the brain decides how to allocate attention to the external environment.Using the results, the researchers were able to train a computer algorithm to predict, at a rate well above chance, the social distance between two people based on the relative similarity of their neural response patterns.Dr. Parkinson emphasized that the study was a \u201cfirst pass, a proof of concept,\u201d and that she and her colleagues still don\u2019t know what the neural response patterns mean: what attitudes, opinions, impulses or mental thumb-twiddling the scans may be detecting.They plan next to try the experiment in reverse: to scan incoming students who don\u2019t yet know one another and see whether those with the most congruent neural patterns end up becoming good friends.Alexander Nehamas, a professor of philosophy at Princeton University and author of a meditative book, \u201cOn Friendship,\u201d appreciated the design of the study and its use of video clips to ferret out the signature of friendship.\u201cThe aesthetic choices we make, the things we like, the taste we have in art, plays, TV, furniture \u2014 when you put them together they are absolutely essential components of our character, an indication of who we are,\u201d he said. We live \u201cimmersed in art.\u201dNot high art, not a night-at-the-opera art, but everyday art \u2014 buildings, billboards, clothing, the dishes at a restaurant, the percussive rhythms of subways on train tracks.\u201cWatching TV clips is much more accurate to our everyday life than the times we go to a museum,\u201d he said, and therefore potentially more revealing of who we are and what we hope to find in a friend.So if you happened to catch \u201cThe Cute Show: Sloths!,\u201d about a self-proclaimed \u201csloth sanctuary\u201d in Costa Rica, and if your first thought wasn\u2019t ooh, how adorable those little smiley sloths are, but rather, sloths are not pets to be cuddled and don\u2019t bathe the algae off their fur \u2014 haven\u2019t you heard of mutualism? \u2014 give me a call.We\u2019ll be biosnob soul mates for life.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dozens Suffocate in Syria as Government Is Accused of Chemical Attack", "Date": "2018-04-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRescue workers in Syria reported finding at least 42 people dead in their homes from apparent suffocation, and antigovernment activists circulated videos of lifeless men, women and children sprawled out on floors and in stairwells, many with white foam coming from their mouths and nostrils.A stream of patients with burning eyes and breathing problems were rushed to clinics after the attack at dusk on Saturday, medical and rescue groups said.The attack appeared to break the will of Douma\u2019s rebels, who agreed on Sunday to a deal with the government to hand the area over and be bused to another area outside government control in the country\u2019s north. Thousands of fighters and tens of thousands of their relatives are expected to leave soon.The latest atrocity in Syria\u2019s agonizing seven-year civil war drew immediate condemnation from the United States and the European Union, but Mr. Assad\u2019s allies in Moscow and Tehran dismissed allegations of a chemical attack as \u201cbogus.\u201dThe British Foreign Office called for an urgent investigation and said that if the use of chemical weapons proved to be true, \u201cit is further proof of Assad\u2019s brutality.\u201dIn posts on Twitter on Sunday, Mr. Trump condemned the attack, blaming Iran and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia for supporting the Syrian government and warning of consequences. White House officials did not rule out a military response.Mr. Trump also took a jab at former President Barack Obama, who declined to respond militarily to evidence that the Syrian government had gassed its own people in 2013.State news media in Syria denied that government forces had used chemical weapons and accused the Islamist rebel group that controls Douma, the Army of Islam, of fabricating the videos to solicit international support as defeat loomed.The Russian Foreign and Defense Ministries also denied that chemical weapons had been used.It was not possible to independently verify the reports because Douma is surrounded by Syrian government forces, which prevent access by journalists, aid workers and investigators.The attack occurred near the end of a monthslong push by the Syrian government to retake a group of towns east of Damascus known as Eastern Ghouta. The towns have been held by rebels seeking to topple Mr. Assad since the early years of the Syrian war, and the rebels have often shelled Damascus, killing civilians.The Syrian government and its allies \u2014 the Russian military and militias backed by Iran \u2014 have surrounded and bombarded the area, killing more than 1,600 people and forcing tens of thousands to flee, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the conflict from Britain through contacts in Syria.Douma is the last remaining town in the area still controlled by rebels, and the Syrian government has vowed to retake it.A day earlier, after the government began a new offensive against the area, Hussein Mortada, a Lebanese reporter who supports the Syrian government, released a video of himself on a hill near Douma as columns of smoke from government attacks rose in the background.\u201cThese are appetizers,\u201d he said. \u201cThe story is bigger than a ground invasion. There is something they will see today if the story continues. They will feel something very strong.\u201dThe intensity of the shelling and airstrikes caused many residents to seek safety in basements, which could have made them more vulnerable to poisonous gases.Then, after dark, a government helicopter dropped exploding barrels that dispersed an unknown chemical substance that affected many more people, Mr. Aadam said. The continued assaults made it hard for rescue workers to look for victims, he said, meaning that it was difficult to establish a comprehensive death toll.As of Sunday morning, rescue workers were \u201cgoing into homes and finding people dead,\u201d he said.One person was dead on arrival at a clinic, six others died after they got there, and rescue workers reported finding more than 42 dead in their homes, the statement said. The bodies could not be evacuated because of strong odors and a lack of protective equipment.\u201cThe reported symptoms indicate that the victims suffocated from the exposure to toxic chemicals,\u201d the statement said.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which did not confirm the use of chemical agents, said that 56 people, including women and children, had been killed in the past 24 hours, including 21 who suffocated in the basements of buildings that had collapsed on them. About 500 others were wounded in the bombardment, and 70 had breathing troubles, the group said.\u201cThe United States calls on Russia to end this unmitigated support immediately and work with the international community to prevent further, barbaric chemical weapons attacks,\u201d Ms. Nauert said.Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian of France on Sunday said reports of the chemical attack were extremely worrying and called for the United Nations Security Council to meet quickly to examine the situation.The Russian Foreign Ministry dismissed the reports as fake.\u201cThe spread of bogus stories about the use of chlorine and other poisonous substances by government forces continues,\u201d the ministry said in a statement. \u201cThe aim of such deceitful speculation, lacking any kind of grounding, is to shield terrorists,\u201d it added, \u201cand to attempt to justify possible external uses of force.\u201dBahram Qasemi, the spokesman for Iran\u2019s Foreign Ministry, said on Sunday that reports of the gas attack were not based on facts and were an \u201can excuse\u201d by the United States and Western countries to take military action against Damascus, the official Iranian news agency IRNA reported.Instead, the United States and Russia reached an agreement to have Syria surrender its chemical weapons stockpiles and dismantle its capabilities to make new ones.The agreement was celebrated at the time, but multiple chemical attacks since then have been blamed on the Syrian government, raising questions about how effective the agreement was.An earlier version of this article misstated the surname of a State Department spokeswoman in two instances. She is Heather Nauert, not Nauret.Hwaida Saad contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Deceived and Betrayed\u2019 by Nanny\u2019s Family, Krims Want References Law", "Date": "2018-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Celia Ortega saw Marina Krim, pregnant with her third child, at a children\u2019s dance class on the Upper West Side in April 2010, prosecutors said she approached Ms. Krim, saying she had a sister who was an \u201cexperienced nanny.\u201dMs. Krim interviewed Yoselyn Ortega, who provided two references. One was her nephew\u2019s wife, whose three children she cared for in Dallas for a few months in 2006. The other was Yaquelin Severino, who unbeknown to Ms. Krim and her husband, Kevin, was also a relative of Ms. Ortega\u2019s and had no children at the time. The Krims tried to reach both women, but only corresponded with Ms. Severino, who gave Ms. Ortega a glowing review, falsely saying in an email she was wonderful with her son, Adrian. The next month, the Krims hired Ms. Ortega.\u201cWhat she did is not a crime in the penal law,\u201d Stuart Silberg, a Manhattan prosecutor said in his closing remarks in State Supreme Court in Manhattan on Monday, referring to Ms. Severino. \u201cMaybe it should be. We\u2019ll never know what would have happened if she never sent that false email.\u201dIn a Facebook post that followed Wednesday\u2019s verdict, Mr. Krim said he and his wife were \u201cdeceived and betrayed by the defendant\u2019s family, who remain wholly unaccountable for their role in the murders of our children.\u201dMs. Severino and Celia Ortega did not respond to email messages and telephone calls on Thursday.Assemblyman Steve Otis, a Westchester Democrat, said he is in the process of drafting legislation that would make it a crime for child care applicants to falsify information on their resumes.\u201cThe horrific case of the Krim family and what they experienced highlighted something familiar to everybody: the task of hiring caregivers,\u201d Mr. Otis said in a recent interview. \u201cUnder the current law, there isn\u2019t a legal duty to protect children.\u201dAccording to testimony during the trial, Ms. Ortega\u2019s family did not tell the Krims that she had scant experience caring for children \u2014 she had abandoned her own son when he was 4 leaving him with her sister in the Dominican Republic. She also had a long history of depression, paranoia and delusion, they testified.It is not uncommon for parents to make child care decisions based on feedback from their peers, and hire caretakers \u2014 nannies or babysitters \u2014 who are paid off the books, in cash, parents and experts in the industry said. In New York City, parents face soaring costs and challenges finding high-quality, affordable care for their children, and typically rely on recommendations from others.Agencies and licensed child care centers tend to be much more expensive, an issue that extends beyond New York. While there are local and federal programs that provide subsidies to low-income parents to assist with child care, the system in America lacks the robust infrastructure that exists in countries like Denmark and Switzerland, experts said, where such services are partially government funded.\u201cPlaces like Britain and Denmark combine paid family leave for parents with newborns, along with public preschool,\u201d said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education and public policy at the University of California, Berkeley. He noted that New York State is \u201cahead of the game, recently expanding paid leave. But we\u2019re a half-century behind Europe in these societies\u2019 commitment to young families.\u201dRegulation of child care in the country also varies from state to state and by type of care, but in-home providers are among the least monitored, experts said.\u201cThis is a totally unregulated kind of child care,\u201d said Julia Wrigley, a sociology professor at the City University of New York, and the author of \u201cOther People\u2019s Children,\u201d about cultural differences in education. \u201cIt\u2019s in the employer\u2019s home. The people are not really vetted until they are already in the home.\u201dThings had gone relatively smoothly for the first 18 months of Ms. Ortega\u2019s employment at the Krim household. She was only asked to work about 20 hours a week, usually in the afternoons, as Ms. Krim was a stay-at-home mother. She was rarely left with the children alone for very long. She earned at least $500 a week and helped pick up and drop off the children.In April 2012 things began to change. Ms. Ortega had a bitter fight with her sister Miladys Garcia and was kicked out of the family apartment on Riverside Drive. She moved into an apartment in the Bronx belonging to other family members. In June, she brought her teenage son back from the Dominican Republic to live with her.In that time, Ms. Ortega became more and more depressed, her family testified. She began to talk cryptically about feeling she was being followed by shadows, hearing voices and seeing a \u201cblack man,\u201d relatives testified. She told her sisters to pray for her and to take care of Jesus, as if she were going away.She also had conflicts with Ms. Krim. She chafed at doing housework, even after asking for additional hours, and declined an offer from one of Ms. Krim\u2019s friends for a part-time job. After that refusal, Ms. Krim chastised Ms. Ortega in front of her children\u2019s school, an exchange prosecutors said infuriated the nanny.By late October, Ms. Ortega moved back into the family apartment on Riverside Drive. Three days before the murders, Ms. Ortega sought help from a psychologist, but neither she nor her relatives ever informed the Krim family of her declining mental state.On Oct. 25, 2012, after taking her middle child, Nessie, to swim class, Ms. Krim returned to her Upper West Side apartment after 5 p.m. and found her two other children dead in a bathtub and Ms. Ortega shoving a large knife into her own neck.The case shocked parents throughout the city who rely on others to help care for their children. Christa D. Nader, the president of Kith & Kin, a household staffing agency, said after the murders she recognized \u201ca noticeable level of distrust\u201d among some parents.Ms. Nader said she was a nanny at the time of the murders and recounted being in a park . There were other nannies with children they were caring for. She recalled the sorrow in their faces, the tears and the constant \u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t understand how someone could do that.\u201d\u201cWe had this shared horror,\u201d she said. \u201cOur city relies on nannies, relies on these quality folks to be the hands, feet, mouths and voices of parents, and something like that was beyond imagination.\u201dAdvertisement"}

On a whiteboard were the words \u201cOUTRAGE\u201d and \u201cMAKE HAY\u201d \u2014 capitalized, underlined and surrounded by lines jutting in all directions like a cartoon \u201cBOOM!\u201dSeated in a wide circle of folding chairs, members of the group excitedly discussed what they could do next.The scandal swirling around Facebook and Cambridge Analytica has begun to usher in a new era for this once-ignored community of privacy researchers and developers. After years of largely disregarding their warnings about exactly what companies like Facebook were doing \u2014 that is, collecting enormous amounts of information on its users and making it available to third parties with little to no oversight \u2014 the general public suddenly seemed to care about what they were saying.In their own lives, privacy experts are now fielding a spike in calls from their relatives asking them for advice about protecting their personal data. Engineers are discussing new privacy projects with them. Even teenagers are paying attention to what they have to say.And for the first time, many privacy experts think internet users will be more willing to put up with a little more inconvenience in return for a lot more privacy.\u201cThis is the first blink of awakening of the world to a danger that\u2019s been present for a long time, which is that we are exposed,\u201d Mr. Searls said. \u201cCambridge Analytica is old, old news to privacy folks.\u201dJohn Scott-Railton, who researches digital rights and privacy at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, said he recently thought back to all the PowerPoint presentations and papers he had given and seen that cautioned about how third parties might access and abuse user data.\u201cIt didn\u2019t stick until now,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s changed, or at least people nod along when we talk about it.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re having the conversation now that we should have had over a decade ago,\u201d Ms. Singh Guliani said.But this Facebook scandal seems to be enduring even in the new frenetic news cycle.\u201cThis has kept the national attention for what: three or four weeks now?\u201d said Allie Bohm, policy counsel at Public Knowledge, a nonprofit in Washington that promotes an open internet. \u201cIt really feels like, hey, we could get some stuff done.\u201dOne reason it has always been hard to get consumers interested in security and privacy is that the harms were vague and hard to understand. With Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, the harms are identifiable and frightening, said Ashkan Soltani, an independent researcher specializing in privacy and a former chief technologist of the Federal Trade Commission.\u201cMuch like a car accident, the harms on social media are low-probablility events with extremely variable outcomes,\u201d he said. \u201c \u2018So what if my boss saw me doing a keg stand?\u2019 But all of a sudden the \u2018so what if\u2019 becomes more serious \u2014 \u2018I get denied insurance or my information is used by a nation state actor to manipulate me.\u2019 \u201dCambridge Analytica\u2019s work, which included using Facebook data to build psychological profiles of voters, tapped into an anxiety many Americans already had over the outcome of the 2016 presidential election.Privacy experts said this shift in public opinion was what they had been waiting for, because it is the only way to bring about change. Facebook will not willingly change its policies without pressure from shareholders or regulators, they added.Historically, public opinion is \u201cthe crucible\u201d for era-defining industry change, said Shoshana Zuboff, a professor at Harvard Business School and the author of a forthcoming book about tech platforms and power.\u201cIf you go back to the rapaciousness and lawlessness of Gilded Age capitalism, it was the slow burn of public opinion that gradually gathered force and ultimately became the driving force that provided cover for dramatic new legislative and regulatory efforts,\u201d she said. \u201cPublic opinion gave the Gilded Age a beginning, a middle and an end.\u201dFor Rohit Ghai, president of the cybersecurity firm RSA, whose SecurID technology has become an industry standard for companies protecting access to their internal systems, the change is evident even inside his home in San Jose, Calif.He previously tried to talk to his 13-year-old daughter about data privacy and social media \u2014 even providing examples of how much the tech companies know about people and what they can do with that information. She shrugged him off.Then the Cambridge Analytica revelations happened. For once, Mr. Ghai said, his teenager came to talk to him.\u201cShe just asked me about Mark Zuckerberg,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a sign.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A God Among Vegetables", "Date": "2018-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn Britain, where I live, asparagus is a god among vegetables. It is greeted with real reverence in spring, as if nothing worth eating has been available for months. With a deep sigh of relief at the end of a long winter of roots, cabbages and more roots, we finally spot those fresh green shoots, and everybody is happy.This may come across as hyperbole, but after more than 20 years living in Britain, I am afraid I have finally caught the bug.The short season \u2014 not much longer than eight weeks \u2014 and the notion that this delicacy is something \u201cwe\u201d do really well, give asparagus special status here. Yes, tomatoes grow in Britain, but they\u2019ll never be as good as Italian ones, and we all know it. British Brassicas and root vegetables are also excellent, but they are staples for most of the year, breeding a sense of familiarity that often sounds a bit like contempt.So now I, too, get giddy when the first bundles of local asparagus appear at my local greengrocer in April. I, too, grab them with both hands and throw them into a pot as fast as I can. I, too, start lecturing anyone who will listen about the splendor of our local hero.To celebrate its distinctiveness, I tend to pair asparagus with the classics: eggs, butter, olive oil, cheese, cream, onions, garlic, potatoes. Texture comes from fried bread crumbs or nuts, the most natural for me being mild almonds, which leave the right amount of space for the taste of asparagus. For flavor, acidity is a must. Sometimes tomatoes work, but citrus and vinegar are always my first choice. Recently, I have been using lots of capers because they bring with them both the acidity and the umami notes that benefit asparagus so much.I also feature it in relatively simple recipes, like roasted asparagus with almonds and capers. This dish offers amazing value in the kitchen. With about 20 minutes and hardly any work, you can put on the table a dish that I would happily serve for a fancy dinner party or in any of my restaurants. If I want to spend a bit more time and bulk up the dish, I serve a similarly flavored asparagus \u2014 this time getting my umami kick from anchovies rather than capers \u2014 with mashed potatoes. Cooking the potatoes with mint and lemon is my way of infusing them with delicate background notes that asparagus loves to play with. They are definitely there, but not so loud as to overwhelm.cookingcookingAdvertisement"}

Mr. Nelson was a bit of a joker and, at 31, a few years older than the other soldiers. He was a big brother figure, well liked, especially by Mr. McCoy.\u201cWe used to talk about hanging out in Philly when we got home,\u201d he said. \u201cWe never got that chance.\u201dWhen Mr. McCoy, now 35, found his friend\u2019s name etched among the 5,200 others on four standing black granite slabs positioned like open books, he broke down.On the bus ride home from the memorial with a group of other veterans on a 90-day post-traumatic stress treatment program, Mr. McCoy turned to one of the few things that has helped him manage the emotional aftershocks of war: his camera.Mr. McCoy has spent the past few years exploring such vulnerability through his lens as he struggles to come to terms with his own war experience. When he learned upon returning from Iraq that he had post-traumatic stress disorder, he initially rejected the diagnosis. He didn\u2019t want to be labeled \u201cweak.\u201d Like many who have incurred invisible psychological war wounds, he believed those who lost life or limb had suffered far worse. He just had to \u201csuck it up and move on.\u201d That worked for a while after he was medically retired in 2008 and took a job in human resources as a civilian working for the Army and Navy.\u201cI thought I was O.K.,\u201d he said during a phone interview from his home in Washington, D.C. \u201cI could play golf and do normal things.\u201d But despite receiving treatment, Mr. McCoy struggled with anxiety, had difficulty sleeping, and was hospitalized several times with panic attacks. Sometimes he couldn\u2019t get out of bed to go to work and, once, to the concern of onlookers, he berated a woman who kept standing too closely behind him at a grocery store. He felt isolated in a civilian world absent the bonds of brotherhood and trust that define military life, especially on deployment.\u201cI used to be part of a team,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were from all parts of the country and all races and socio-economic backgrounds, but we all had the same mission to serve and protect. We may not have liked each other, but we trusted each other and had enough respect to get the job done.\u201dWithout that sense of camaraderie and belonging, Mr. McCoy became withdrawn and vulnerable to a familiar downward spiral into alcohol, drugs, or the suicidal despair that has afflicted so many veterans. Instead he turned to photography.While undertaking treatment last year, Mr. McCoy made a series of black and white pictures of other veterans attending the program, including the shot of the two men sleeping on the bus, and another of his own reflection in the black marble memorial with Pfc. Albert M. Nelson\u2019s name.\u201cI\u2019ll never forget the silence on that bus on the way to the memorial,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was heavy, like we were going downrange.\u201dHaving a fellow veteran photographing them allowed his subjects to relax, Mr. McCoy said.\u201cThey feel a little safer knowing I\u2019ve experienced some of the same things they have.\u201dHe hopes his images can add to the conversation about trauma and help reduce the stigma surrounding mental health generally, even as he continues his own journey in the shadow of war.\u201cI take it day by day,\u201d he said, noting that his experiences during and after war aren\u2019t exceptional. \u201cWe aren\u2019t heroes. We\u2019re just guys who signed up to do a job. And now I hope to use photography as a tool to inspire.\u201dAdvertisement"}

For some of those waiting, the soup \u2014 lucid and almost delicate in flavor \u2014 is simply, profoundly a taste of home.For the rest, it\u2019s a ticket to elsewhere \u2014 perhaps too great a burden of expectation for an everyday dish meant to nourish, not set off fireworks.The chef, Richard Ho, 33, grew up in the San Gabriel Valley east of Los Angeles, in an area once known as Xiao (Little) Taipei. An economics major at the University of California at Berkeley, he spent eight years working the front of the house at the Blue Ribbon Sushi restaurants in New York, which may explain his remarkable tranquillity as he corrals the crowd.He learned to cook as part of the natural rhythm of life, in the kitchen with his parents, Taiwanese immigrants who gently bickered over ingredients. (His mother\u2019s roots are in mainland China; his father\u2019s family has lived in Taiwan for generations.)Here, he starts with collagen-heavy cow hooves and beef shin bones with tendon attached, leaving them to simmer for a day and a night, commingling with the Chinese culinary trinity of garlic, scallions and ginger. The only salt comes from two kinds of soy sauce, both dark but one aged longer, until it approaches syrup.Sweetness leaches from rock sugar, goji berries, star anise, cloves, cinnamon and licorice \u2014 the scents alone stir the palate \u2014 and is held in check by heat, conjured by doubanjiang, dried red chiles and Sichuan peppercorns for a low-level buzz. (These last ingredients are a legacy of refugees from Sichuan Province who fled to Taiwan after Mao\u2019s victory on the mainland.)In another pot, beef shank relaxes in rice wine, soy sauce and the same heady mix of aromatics. Once combined, the two stocks are given a few hours to sort out their differences and become one. The panels of beef emerge beautifully tender, the connecting stitches of fat visible to the eye but dissembling immediately on the tongue. Knottier tendon is available for those who want more of a fight.The soup is notably holistic, as if refusing to take sides, neither frankly carnal nor purely herbaceous but somewhere more intriguingly in between. You may order it extra rich, with a last-minute spoonful of liquefied marrow added just before serving, although I didn\u2019t notice much difference beyond a gloss on the lips. Another variation is spicy, the broth turned incarnadine from hot sauce, which proves to be more accent mark than armament, contouring the mouth instead of searing it.One more choice: Two types of wheat noodles in wide flat bands or thick cords. The thick ones are closer to the Taiwanese ideal of QQ, chewy-chewy. (Mr. Ho said diplomatically, \u201cMom likes one; Dad likes the other.\u201d)Alongside the soup comes a ramekin of suan cai, pickled mustard greens that Mr. Ho saut\u00e9s with a little chile and sugar (\u201cthat\u2019s how grandma used to do it\u201d). You could nibble it between spoonfuls, but it\u2019s better just tossed in, for crunch and a tang that draws out the meaty depths.When I visited, the menu offered just two small sides: slightly oversweetened cucumbers and creamy house-made tofu paired with a nicely funky century egg under curlicues of bonito flakes \u2014 an ingredient absorbed into Taiwanese cooking during half a century of Japanese occupation.Then, one evening, another dish materialized: lu rou fan, braised minced pork over rice, here made with skin-on Berkshire pork belly melted over eight hours with five-spice, dried orange peels, rice wine and dark and darker soy sauce, in a pot filled with Taiwanese beer instead of water.It, too, was a humble, everyday dish, intended first and foremost to nourish. And I would happily have waited for it on a crowded sidewalk in ice or in rain, however long it took.Advertisement"}

Melty chunks of that funky, earthy cheese running all over the creamy rice had epic appeal, despite the nettles. I\u2019ve had an aversion to those ever since I was stung as a kid trampling through the English countryside one summer vacation. That includes cooking them. Any recipe that begins with instructions to don thick rubber gloves for protection is just not very inviting.So I asked Ms. Rogers: Could the risotto be made with a less ferocious green that\u2019s also easier to find if you\u2019re not running around British fields in your shorts?Spinach, she said immediately, particularly mature, crinkly leaves with a rich mineral taste. That\u2019s what she uses outside nettle season, which lasts only a few weeks in spring.Ms. Rogers then gave me a risotto reminder. Contrary to popular belief, you don\u2019t need to stir risotto continuously as it cooks. Once you\u2019re attuned to the rhythm of adding the broth, she told me, you can stir intermittently; just stay close by.\u201cIn the past 30 years, we\u2019ve seen ups and downs, but there\u2019s been a continuous ethos to use the best ingredients and to keep within a strong tradition,\u201d Ms. Rogers said. \u201cYou have to keep growing.

{"Headline": "Inside Cambridge Analytica\u2019s Virtual Currency Plans", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe offering was part of a broader, but still very private push that the firm was making into the nascent world of cryptocurrencies over the last year.The goal of Cambridge Analytica\u2019s own coin offering? Raise money that would pay for the creation of a system to help people store and sell their online personal data to advertisers, Brittany Kaiser, a former Cambridge Analytica employee, said in an interview. The idea was to protect information from more or less what the firm did when it obtained the personal data of up to 87 million Facebook users.\u201cWho knows more about the usage of personal data than Cambridge Analytica?\u201d Ms. Kaiser said. \u201cSo why not build a platform that reconstructs the way that works?\u201dThe effort was overseen by Cambridge Analytica\u2019s British chief executive, Alexander Nix, who was forced out of the company in March after he was caught on tape bragging about his company\u2019s approach to political work in other countries, including the use of shell companies and strategies designed to entrap opponents. The Facebook data revelations and Mr. Nix\u2019s comments appear to have put the virtual currency work, which was still in the early stages, on hold.\u201cThere are only a handful of more controversial areas it could have expanded its business into,\u201d said Tim Swanson, a consultant to companies in the industry, who was briefed on the Cambridge Analytica coin offering.A spokesman for Cambridge Analytica did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Cambridge Analytica boasts that its \u201cpsychographic profiles\u201d of voters and consumers allow for more persuasive and precisely targeted advertising. In marketing material sent to investors, the firm said Ms. Kaiser was \u201chelping blockchain companies in using predictive modeling to target investors for token sales.\u201dJill Carlson, a consultant who has worked with several blockchain companies, attended meetings where Cambridge Analytica pitched its services to virtual currency companies, including one that Mr. Nix attended.Ms. Carlson said the Cambridge Analytica employees had bragged about their success in helping get President Trump elected and their ability to carefully target advertising campaigns using data from social networks like Facebook.She also remembers they spoke about an array of potential campaigns. The most unusual idea involved sending virtual currencies to people in far-flung regions of Mexico. The payments would give people incentive to fill out surveys and get data that could then be used to help design campaigns for Mexican political candidates.Ms. Carlson said the pitch was contrary to the ideas of openness and transparency that drew her to virtual currency projects like Bitcoin.\u201cThe way that Cambridge Analytica was talking about it, they were viewing it as a means of being able to basically inflict government control and private corporate control over individuals, which just takes the whole initial premise of this technology and turns it on its head in this very dystopian way,\u201d she said.Cambridge Analytica did win over some clients. Last summer, Ms. Kaiser\u2019s team began working with Dragon Coin, a new virtual currency that was designed to be used by gamblers. The coin was supposed to make it easier for people to get their money to casinos in Macau, an island that is technically a part of China with some independent political structures.But documents sent in September to potential investors by Dragon Coin\u2019s co-founder Paul Moynan listed Mr. Wan as the sponsor of the initial coin offering and included his picture. Ms. Kaiser was included in the email. A separate Dragon Coin document that Mr. Moynan sent out at the same time listed Mr. Wan as one of a few high-profile supporters of the project.When reached recently, Mr. Moynan initially said that his email address had been hacked and that he did not recognize the documents. He later said the documents were a \u201chypothetical wish list\u201d of a \u201cjunior staff\u201d member.\u201cWe will be conducting an internal investigation, as unfinished draft documents would never have been indicative of actual agreed partnerships,\u201d he said.Ms. Kaiser said that her work on the Dragon Coin event in Macau had been done in a personal capacity, and that the Dragon Coin team had told her that Mr. Wan was not involved with the project.Dragon Coin claimed it raised more than $300 million from investors last fall. That total has been hard to verify. Like many coin offerings, Dragon Coin has failed to live up to its promises.The document sent to investors in September said Dragon Coin had secured a partnership with Visa to release a debit card that would work on the Visa network. A spokeswoman for Visa said that there was no partnership and that no Dragon card had been approved, as is necessary for a card to be issued.The setbacks did not stop Cambridge Analytica from plunging further into the virtual currency realm. The company\u2019s New York office continued reaching out to potential investors and partners, emails show. And in January, Ms. Kaiser hosted a side conference dedicated to blockchain projects, known as CryptoHQ, at the World Economic Forum\u2019s annual conference in Davos, Switzerland. Mr. Nix spoke on a panel at the event.He said that the technology would be helpful in solving the very problems that Cambridge Analytica has since become the emblem of \u2014 the abuse of online personal data.\u201cWe\u2019re going to see a new type of economy emerging where people can start to take ownership of their data and monetize on their data,\u201d Mr. Nix said, according to a tweet from the CryptoHQ account. \u201cAnd that is only possible through the blockchain.\u201dThe virtual currency that Cambridge Analytica was designing was aimed at exactly this problem, and would have also helped the company raise money from investors.Nathaniel Popper reported from San Francisco, and Nicholas Confessore from New York.Advertisement"}

By then, debt held by the public will almost match the size of the nation\u2019s economy, reaching 96 percent of gross domestic product, a higher level than any point since just after World War II and well past the level that economists say could court a crisis.The new C.B.O. projection is the first since President Trump signed a tax cut that is expected to cost the government nearly $1.9 trillion over 11 years, then signed legislation to significantly boost military and domestic spending over the next two years. The figures are sobering, even in a political climate where deficit concerns appear to be receding.This fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, the budget deficit is expected to total $804 billion, up from $665 billion last fiscal year, according to the C.B.O. projections.

The company, he says, will block app developers from gaining access to the data of users who have been inactive for three months; restrict the ability of users to inadvertently share information about others in their networks; and adopt stricter permissions guidelines and search features.Democrats are expected to grill Mr. Zuckerberg about the privacy scandals, and how the social network is guarding against possible interference in this fall\u2019s midterm elections. Republicans are expected to be more reticent about privacy regulations, and may use the hearings to raise suspicions of political bias on the social network.More from The Information:\u201cOverall, there has never been a time where we have seen so much focus on diversity.

James Bond.Supported byRachel Weisz is glowing.That\u2019s not unusual.I know that if you ask the hazel-eyed, raven-haired 48-year-old how she gets more beautiful every year, defying Hollywood\u2019s propensity to push actresses in their 40s through a trap door, she will shyly demur.But my editors want to know. So as we sit at a long wooden table in her kitchen in the East Village of Manhattan, in an apartment with wraparound windows and elegant threadbare Oriental rugs and a green-eyed cat named Solomon and James Bond padding around in a green sweatshirt, jeans and socks, I ask again:\u201cDon\u2019t you have some secret to share with the readers of The New York Times, like an avocado face mask or acupuncture?\u201dThe actress explains that she used to have a moon face, but as she got older, she lost her chubbiness and found her cheekbones. But then she takes pity on me, a supposedly trained observer, and pulls up the loose gray sweater she\u2019s wearing to reveal her secret.\u201cI\u2019ll be showing soon,\u201d she says, with a radiant smile. \u201cDaniel and I are so happy. We\u2019re going to have a little human. We can\u2019t wait to meet him or her. It\u2019s all such a mystery.\u201dShe already has an 11-year-old, Henry, with her former partner, the director Darren Aronofsky. And Mr. Craig, 50, has a 25-year-old daughter, Ella, with the actress Fiona Loudon.Ms. Weisz (pronounced \u201cVice\u201d) likes to say that happiness writes white, meaning it\u2019s anathema to vibrant drama. But it seems quite cozy in life.She and Mr. Craig, who have been married for seven years, share a similar quality on screen. It\u2019s hard to look away from them. That\u2019s true in person, as well. As the two stand at opposite counters, Ms. Weisz offering me tea and Mr. Craig proferring a cappuccino, it\u2019s tough to know which way to turn.\u201cDaniel makes a great cappuccino,\u201d she says, so I choose that.Baby news aside, the real reason I am below 14th Street is to discuss hot lesbian sex.Ms. Weisz\u2019s character, a photographer named Ronit now living in New York, comes back for her father\u2019s funeral and gets ensorcelled by her old love, Esti, who is now married to the rabbi\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Dovid, played by Alessandro Nivola. The movie focuses both on this taboo triangle and the fraught father-daughter relationship in a closed society where women are not in charge of their choices, wearing wigs and often segregated from men \u2014 a world Ronit denounces as \u201cmedieval.\u201d \u201cMy character time-travels in a way,\u201d Ms. Weisz says. \u201cShe\u2019s going back to her childhood but it\u2019s also time travel because she\u2019s going to live amongst a community where the mores haven\u2019t changed for hundreds of years. They\u2019re not part of modern life. They don\u2019t have the internet or TV and all that stuff. And I grew up down the road from this place. It\u2019s four stops north of Golders Green, which was my stop, so I would see these people sometimes on the way to school. It\u2019s like the \u201950s, but it\u2019s happening right now.\u201d\u201cThey met in their late 30s, early 40s, got married and they were like, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re both from Central Europe\u2019 and she converted to marry him,\u201d Ms. Weisz says.There was a flap over whether \u201cBlue Is the Warmest Color\u201d was a lascivious product of the male gaze. But so far \u201cDisobedience\u201d \u2014 Ms. Weisz selected the director Sebastian Lelio, whom she described as \u201ca straight Chilean lapsed Catholic\u201d \u2014 has been praised for avoiding this trap.I ask Ms. Weisz what it felt like to do her first love scene with a woman.Ms. Weisz said that, as a producer, she agreed with Mr. Lelio\u2019s decision to cut out a close-up of her character\u2019s orgasm. \u201cIt was too many orgasms,\u201d she says. \u201cEsti\u2019s was more important, and it robbed her of that.\u201dShe had met Ms. McAdams on a one-day shoot on a Terrence Malick movie, which Ms. Weisz got cut from in the end.\u201cWe worked in a very similar way, in that neither of us liked to sit and analyze it,\u201d she says. \u201cWe were just like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it and see what happens.\u2019 And she\u2019s very touching and tender and soulful as Esti and as a person.\u201dMs. Weisz was drawn to doing the film, an adaptation of Naomi Alderman\u2019s novel, not because of the lesbian plotline, she says, but because she wanted to explore a relationship between two women where they were not defined by men, where there was no \u201chistory of ownership.\u201d\u201cI just thought, \u2018Perfect: a relationship between two women where it has been a friendship since childhood and there\u2019s love and sexuality and yearning and longing and things to do with freedom.\u2019\u201dShe says she read a lot of lesbian literature when she was looking for a movie to make.\u201cThere\u2019s a cycle of pulp fiction novels from the \u201950s called \u2018The Beebo Brinker Chronicles\u2019 by Ann Bannon,\u201d Ms. Weisz says. \u201c\u2018Journey to a Woman\u2019 is my favorite. And I met her and she\u2019s completely fascinating. She\u2019s a professor of linguistics. And she was a gay woman living in a 1950s heterosexual marriage, and she started to write these pulp fiction lesbian novels with an avatar in the book that was her lesbian self. It was mostly in her imagination. And she came down to Greenwich Village and there were lesbian bars where she researched.\u201cI also read a French lesbian novel called \u2018The Illusionist\u2019 by Fran\u00e7oise Mallet-Joris about a girl who has a love affair with her dad\u2019s older mistress. Very dark but great.\u201dDid Ms. Weisz do any research for the love scene with lesbian friends?\u201cNooooo,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t ever ask people how they have sex. Sebastian storyboarded it, so it was all his idea to have just faces and spittle and wetness and the other woman\u2019s face. He wasn\u2019t interested in nudity. He was interested in one woman\u2019s face in pleasure in the frame and the other woman outside the frame so you have to imagine where her fingers and tongue are and what\u2019s going on.\u201dSince it\u2019s a film focused on a father-daughter relationship, I note that the late Mike Nichols, who directed Ms. Weisz and Mr. Craig in \u201cBetrayal\u201d on Broadway in 2013, once told me that the father-son relationship was the most central in drama because, as Joseph Campbell said, \u201cif you are a boy, every enemy is potentially psychologically associated with the father image.\u201dMs. Weisz says: \u201cI would say that\u2019s because the great playwrights of the 20th century are men. It\u2019s just to do with the canon of great white men writers. I don\u2019t think, in essence, that they are more important than father-daughter relationships or mother-daughter, just less represented.\u201dMs. Weisz seems to float above Hollywood\u2019s tortured relationship with women. She says she has not had any Me Too experiences and after her kick-start in \u201cThe Mummy\u201d franchise, she has managed to find sultry and strong female roles in a series of indie films and a few big-budget ones.She has started her own production company, LC6, to look for more projects to tell stories about women. \u201cI really enjoy all the thousands of movies I\u2019ve seen about men,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean, there are some great masterpieces. But there\u2019s just a dearth of ones about women. I love women. Women are just really fascinating and different to men.\u201dWe talk about how strange it is that the old crass Hollywood moguls, who could treat actresses abominably, still produced movies with juicy parts for women in all stages of life, and that the supposedly more enlightened Hollywood suits that followed \u2014 male and female studio chiefs \u2014 reduced women\u2019s roles mostly to wives, girlfriends and hookers.\u201cI think what happened was, women\u2019s appetites were taken away from them,\u201d Ms. Weisz says. \u201cAs women got the pill, suddenly it\u2019s like, \u2018Let\u2019s not let them be free in the stories.\u2019 Once we had Barbara Stanwyck running around making trouble.

That\u2019s what makes you a human. That\u2019s what makes you, in stories, believable and relatable. I can\u2019t bear just really good, idealized characters.\u201cContradictory characters or illogical things about women are often taken out, and they\u2019re simplified to either all good or bad and they\u2019re never allowed to be just layered and complex.\u201dShe cited the example of her Oscar-winning turn in \u201cThe Constant Gardener\u201d (2005) as Tessa Quayle, a human-rights activist.\u201cThat character was doing good things, but she was a pain in the ass and difficult,\u201d Ms. Weisz says. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t like a sweet person.\u201dShe is skeptical about how soon structural changes will be made to the industry. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any cause for celebration quite yet,\u201d she says. \u201cI think it\u2019s a long road and a damn serious one, don\u2019t you? And I doubt it will be fixed in my lifetime.\u201dOne story she isn\u2019t interested in making is Jane Bond. As she told The Telegraph, Ian Fleming \u201cdevoted an awful lot of time to writing this particular character, who is particularly male and relates in a particular way to women. Why not create your own story rather than jumping onto the shoulders and being compared to all these other male predecessors?\u201dShe reiterated that to me, saying, \u201cLet\u2019s find our own characters.\u201d\u201cHe just meant \u2018I can\u2019t think about this today,\u2019 having just done one,\u201d she says. \u201cHe was just tired. He needed a really long nap and a glass of wine. It would be like if you asked someone who just had a baby, \u2018Do you want another one that day?\u2019 They\u2019d just go, \u2018NO!\u2019\u201dI ask Ms. Weisz if she still loves being married.\u201cI\u2019m very happy being married, very, very happy,\u201d she says. She muses that some other movie star pairs seem to know how to make their \u201ccoupledom\u201d part of their brand. \u201cI really take my hat off to them,\u201d she says. \u201cBut Daniel and I are really similar. We just literally don\u2019t know how to do that. We\u2019re just really crap at talking about our private lives.\u201dI doubt either of them is interested in pushing their brand, since they have never had accounts on Instagram or Facebook or Twitter. They both prefer talking about books and poetry and music to social media.Ms. Weisz has said if she were a record, she\u2019d be a Beethoven piano concerto. She also loves David Bowie, Lou Reed and Patti Smith.\u201cPatti Smith came to a screening of \u2018Disobedience,\u2019\u201d Ms. Weisz says. \u201cShe\u2019s lovely, so warm and generous. She got up and said, \u2018I just want to talk about the spitting in the mouth. That was so beautiful to me. I didn\u2019t care what gender either of you were. It was just love, beautiful love.\u2019 Patti\u2019s like a girl\u2019s girl. She likes women.\u201dOne is a \u201cPaper Moon\u201d-style comedy set in wartime England called \u201cCrooked Heart,\u201d based on a book by Lissa Evans. It is the story of a pair of grifters who pretend to be a mother and son. \u201cIt\u2019s the opposite of a noble war story,\u201d Ms. Weisz says. \u201cThey\u2019re running around, her and this little boy, with made-up collection boxes for made-up charities, and it\u2019s funny.\u201dShe is also planning on producing and starring in a movie about Dr. James Barry, a woman in 19th-century Cape Town who disguised herself as a man to become a doctor. She lived as a man her whole life, rising to be the chief medical officer in the city, which was then a British colony. She was a dandy who got into a lot of duels. She got embroiled in a scandal when she was having an affair with the governor and someone saw them partly disrobed and thought they were two men. So it was known as \u201cThe Sodomy Scandal.\u201dShe seemed to glow even brighter at the prospect. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Goldman\u2019s Gains in Trading Raise a Familiar Dilemma: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Tuesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 A \u2018Geneva Convention\u2019 for cyberwar?\u2022 Did Goldman\u2019s trading business perform too well?\u2022 The U.S.-China fight has pushed deeper into tech.Goldman Sachs\u2019s strong first-quarter earnings raise a familiar dilemma for the bank.The results got a significant fillip from trading, a business Goldman must do well in, but not so well that investors think the bank is too dependent on it. And a breakdown of first-quarter revenue shows the dominance of trading. Revenue from trading in stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities and derivatives totaled $4.39 billion during the first three months of the year. That works out at 44 percent of total revenue, well above the 37 percent share that trading had in 2017.Stock and bond markets are unpredictable, even in relatively good times, so the helpful trading conditions this quarter may not last. What can Goldman\u2019s senior executives do to persuade investors that the bank is a lot more than a trading shop? They can point to the fact that David M. Solomon is in line to succeed Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman\u2019s current C.E.O. Mr. Solomon ascent took place in the bank\u2019s powerful investment banking division, not its trading operations.Goldman\u2019s leaders can continue to talk about the steps the bank is taking to widen its client base and diversify into other businesses that might have more stable revenue, like its relatively new consumer lending operations. But such businesses are going to take time to make a meaningful contribution.And it\u2019s important to remember that other major businesses at Goldman are also volatile. Investing and lending, which mostly involves making longer-term investments in companies, and whose revenue can be unpredictable, made up 21 percent of total revenue in the first quarter, the second largest contribution.Despite the bumper results in trading along with investing and lending, Goldman\u2019s shares slid slightly on Tuesday, suggesting investors are waiting on longer-term trends than one quarter\u2019s results.But the volatility of revenue is not the only reason investors are often skeptical about Wall Street firms. The huge amounts that they pay out in compensation is also a concern. When revenue rises, so does pay. As a result, money that could have fallen to the bottom line at other types of companies instead gets paid out to traders and bankers. Compensation at Goldman Sachs made up 45 percent of non-interest revenue in the first quarter, up from 44 percent the first quarter of 2017.\u2014 Peter EavisHere are the numbers:The move comes amid an outcry prompted by the arrests of two African-American men at a Starbucks location in Philadelphia last week.The two men were arrested after asking to use the restroom in the shop. An employee refused their request, because the men had not bought anything, according to officials. The men sat down and were asked to leave, and an employee eventually called the police. The prosecutor\u2019s office in Philadelphia reviewed the case and declined to pursue charges against the men because of \u201ca lack of evidence that a crime was committed,\u201d according to a spokesman.Some may be optimistic that the $1.5 trillion tax cut will extend the business cycle.The strategists at Morgan Stanley are not among them.\u201cWhile there\u2019s a fair amount of debate about how much this fiscal expansion extended the economic cycle, for markets our analysis suggests we\u2019re closer to the end of the day than the beginning. Hence, there\u2019s less reason to behave like it\u2019s \u2018morning in America\u2019 than \u2018happy hour in America.\u2019\u201dKey points\u2022 Morgan Stanley argues that while the tax cuts will help lift growth in the near term, its benefits are already priced into the markets.\u2022 The new tax law creates economic cliffs, as many key provisions in the law are not permanent and end in just a few years.\u2022 The tax cuts may make it more difficult for the government to turn to fiscal stimulus to fight the next downturn.In conclusion\u201cWhile this policy supports growth in the near term, it may worsen the next downturn while limiting the fiscal reaction to it. Even if those concerns are unfounded, we think much of fiscal stimulus\u2019 \u2018good news\u2019 is already in the price of key markets.\u201dThe streaming video company added 7.41 million subscribers during the first quarter. Its profit jumped 62 percent, and sales grew 40 percent.Netflix also said it plans to spend $10 billion on content and marketing this year.Shares are up 8.6 percent Tuesday and 75 percent this year. That easily beats the S.&P. 500, which has gained just 0.2 percent this year. It also tops the performance of its fellow FANG stocks. Facebook is off 4.5 percent this year, Google-parent Alphabet is up about 3 percent, and Amazon has risen 28 percent.Stephen Ju, an analyst over at Credit Suisse, writes in a note titled \u201cGetting Closer and Closer to Achieving Escape Velocity\u201d:\u201cNetflix continues to reap the benefits of its programming win streak, as it wields its large content acquisition budget as a weapon to put greater distance between itself and its competitors (especially as Disney prepares to exit the platform). And we find it hard to argue with the accelerated pace of subscriber additions as the conceptual proof of its capital allocation decision, and we also expect the Street to continue to underwrite the investments.\u201dTwitter is having an even better day.The stock is up 87 percent over that period.The NYT\u2019s David Sanger says the impetus came largely from Microsoft\u2019s president, Brad Smith, \u201cwho has been arguing for several years that the world needs a \u2018digital Geneva Convention\u2019 that sets norms of behavior for cyberspace just as the Geneva Conventions set rules for the conduct of war in the physical world.\u201dAlso striking: Who hasn\u2019t yet signed, including Google, Apple and Amazon.More from Michael:Ms. Massenet and Mr. Brown are counting on Ms. Massenet\u2019s Net-a-Porter experience and contacts to help Imaginary Ventures stand out. The firm has already invested in companies like Glossier and Everlane, an upstart clothing brand.Mr. Ballmer said of the latest report, \u201cPublic companies owe this level of transparency to shareholders; I think citizens, as America\u2019s shareholders, deserve the same.\u201dAs more financial firms move to pressure gun makers and sellers into self-regulation, the advocacy group (backed by Mike Bloomberg) plans to ask them to press for more policy positions and operational changes.Among them: Requiring background checks for all gun sales; more funding for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; having gun makers require sellers to adopt a code of conduct; and adopting smart-gun tech.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Knowledge Gap Hinders Ability of Congress to Regulate Silicon Valley", "Date": "2018-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cI think we need to be careful,\u201d cautioned Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican. \u201cI think there are a number of different ideas, but I don\u2019t think anything has coalesced in terms of a consensus.\u201dFor the public, watching the many bursts of fireworks from Congress and the quick after-fizzle can be dizzying. But Representative Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey, the ranking Democrat on the House committee responsible for internet regulation, warned voters not to expect much.\u201cI hate to be such a pessimist, but I don\u2019t believe the Republicans will end up doing anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI just don\u2019t have any faith in their willingness to regulate to protect privacy in the context of Facebook.\u201dBeyond the typical political gridlock that has stymied action in Congress, technology and the companies that sell access to it are particularly protected.Inaction does not reflect a lack of will so much as a failure of expertise.\u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen an issue where everybody seemed to be on the same sheet of music,\u201d Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said Thursday.If Congress does not follow through with new rules for internet companies, \u201cwe\u2019ll look like a bunch of idiots,\u201d Mr. Graham added.Avoiding that dunce cap will be difficult. Lawmakers will confront Silicon Valley\u2019s powerful new lobbying establishment. Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple now hold the biggest corporate lobbying budgets in Washington and spent a combined $49.7 million in 2017 on direct lobbying, which does not include their outside lobbying trade groups, up 24 percent from the previous year. They have hired top privacy experts into their lobbying troops to defeat privacy and other internet laws.Facebook has said it would embrace some regulation, with Mr. Zuckerberg saying this week that rules for internet companies were \u201cinevitable.\u201d But he also indicated that it would have to be the \u201cright\u201d regulations, and he was not willing to commit on the spot to several ideas posed by lawmakers.The hearings spurred new momentum for the introduction of privacy laws. On Thursday, Senators Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, and John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, introduced legislation that would allow consumers to opt out of getting tracked on a site. The bill would also mandate simpler privacy policies.One new bill would restrict data collection of students using classroom technology, and another would require companies to get permission before collecting and sharing user data. That would move the United States closer to rules about to take effect next month in Europe. An earlier bill would mandate more disclosure on Facebook advertising purchases.Nevertheless, the creation of any regulations in coming months is doubtful. Most lawmakers said in the hearings that they were concerned about privacy and foreign interference on social media during the 2016 election. But several Republicans also expressed anxiety over regulations that could slow the growth of Silicon Valley, a beacon for the American economy.\u201cThese are tough ones. Privacy versus innovation versus security versus freedom \u2014 these are always tough questions,\u201d said Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona. He said he would most likely support the political ad disclosures bill but added, \u201cWhen we step in, are we always late?\u201dThis week, Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, introduced the Consent Act, which would require companies to get permission before tracking and sharing data. But even he pointed to Washington\u2019s short attention span. Companies like Facebook, he said, would try to stand in Congress\u2019s way.\u201cThey will try to make it more complex than it is,\u201d he said.\u201cThe question is timing,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal added, pointing to the difficult midterm elections in November and the desire by many legislators to do as little as possible until then. \u201cThis session, everybody says, is over as far as serious legislating is concerned.\u201dMr. Graham, who said regulations were necessary, also acknowledged the pitfalls of moving too fast.\u201cI\u2019d hate to be the senator that killed an effort to have reasonable regulation,\u201d Mr. Graham said. But, he conceded, \u201cYou really need to know what you are signing up for.\u201dBeyond the short term, the hearings may have laid the foundation for broader privacy regulations in coming years, analysts said. The most likely action to follow Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s grilling is the passage of a bill that requires financial disclosures of political advertising on social media, a law similar to broadcast television and radio political ad disclosures.Narrow regulatory ideas could gain momentum that prevent online location tracking, strengthen privacy protections for children and teens and require stronger disclosures for data breaches. But the government\u2019s light hand on Silicon Valley will continue for some time even as the European Union prepares to enact comprehensive privacy rules that limit data collection and push companies to ask permission before sharing information about users.Even if seats in the House and Senate shift after the midterm elections, any privacy laws would be at least a couple of years away, said Paul Gallant, a technology policy analyst at the Cowen Group.\u201cIf Democrats win the House in November, the chances of legislation would rise, although a likely Republican Senate would still make passage an uphill battle,\u201d Mr. Gallant said.A big problem is the lack of technological expertise in Congress, and the informational imbalance with the tech companies\u2019 lobbyists.In 2011, tech lobbyists blanketed the Senate Judiciary Committee after former Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, introduced a geolocation privacy bill.Internet firms brought in engineers and deployed their outside lobbying groups to warn lawmakers that Mr. Franken\u2019s bill was dangerous and technically flawed, said Alvaro Bedoya, a former staff member for Mr. Franken who is now the executive director of the Georgetown Center for Privacy and Technology.Another obstacle to action is a disagreement on regulatory priorities.Indeed, Mr. Graham identified a grab bag of problems that he wanted addressed with Facebook, most of which are not being addressed by any current legislative proposals.He mentioned terrorism content, Facebook\u2019s \u201cmonopoly\u201d and political bias as regulatory targets. At Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s hearings on Tuesday and Wednesday, other lawmakers brought up data breaches, foreign interference and censorship, particularly of the pro-Trump internet personalities Diamond and Silk.\u201cI want somebody to look at how they set these machines up, not just for Facebook, but other people, to make sure that the algorithms are not being politically motivated,\u201d Mr. Graham said.The lack of technological knowledge was glaring. Members mostly comprised lawyers or former business people, and many are just getting acquainted with social media, artificial intelligence, autonomous self-driving cars, drones and other technologies that they are charged to oversee.Diversity in government has become a platform issue for Brianna Wu, a former software designer who is running for the 8th House district in Massachusetts.Ms. Wu watched Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s hearings and was struck by the basic lack of knowledge members had in how the site works, such as the business model of ad-supported websites and how messaging apps like Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp works. Before the hearings, many of the members brought in technology experts from academic institutions to prepare them for Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s appearance.\u201cMost people can understand why guns are a threat,\u201d she said. \u201cWith technology, people don\u2019t understand fundamentally what the threat is. That is a threat to democracy.\u201dA photo caption with an earlier version of this article misidentified a member of the Senate attending the hearing. It was Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, not Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana.videovideoAdvertisement"}

The HuffPost Arabi journalist who interviewed him, Moataz Wadnan, was also taken into custody.In a statement, Amnesty International denounced Mr. Geneina\u2019s trial and sentencing as \u201canother example of the shameless silencing of anyone who is critical of the Egyptian authorities.\u201dNathan Brown, an Egypt scholar at George Washington University, said in an email that the issue might not be \u201ccriticism per se, but the threat to provide information that would be highly embarrassing to the military as an institution and to el-Sisi personally.\u201d\u201cHe is not merely being discredited; he is being muzzled and punished,\u201d Mr. Brown said of Mr. Geneina.During the election campaign, Mr. Sisi\u2019s supporters made a concerted effort to mobilize voters \u2014 using incentives like free groceries and small cash payments \u2014 widely taken as a sign of the president\u2019s desire for a strong mandate to usher in constitutional changes that could extend his term in office.There has been little talk of such changes since then, but Egyptian officials have signaled they intend to continue with an uncompromising approach that brooks little dissent.A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, Ahmed Abu Zeid, accused Unesco of \u201cdisregard for the rule of law\u201d in bestowing the award on a prisoner. Human rights groups say the journalist is typical of thousands of Egyptians held for months, often years, without trial in brimming prisons.More recent investigations targeting journalists have further chilled free speech.After signing up for Mr. Anan\u2019s short-lived election campaign in January, Mr. Geneina was badly beaten outside his home by men he described as government thugs. The police said the men had gotten into a fight with Mr. Geneina over a traffic accident.Follow Declan Walsh on Twitter: @declanwalshNour Youssef contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mark Zuckerberg Testimony: Senators Question Facebook\u2019s Commitment to Privacy", "Date": "2018-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFacebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, began the first of two marathon hearings in Washington on Tuesday afternoon, answering tough questions on the company\u2019s mishandling of data.This was Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s first appearance before Congress, prompted by the revelation that Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm linked to the Trump campaign, harvested the data of an estimated 87 million Facebook users to psychologically profile voters during the 2016 election.Lawmakers grilled the 33-year-old executive on the proliferation of so-called fake news on Facebook, Russian interference during the 2016 presidential election and censorship of conservative media. Among the highlights:\u2022 Senators warned that they are skeptical that the company can regulate itself and threatened to enact privacy rules and other regulations. They said they weren\u2019t sure if they could trust a company that has repeatedly violated its privacy promises.\u2022 There were glimmers of a partisan divide: Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, asked about Facebook\u2019s handling of conservative media, including content related to Glenn Beck and a Fox News personality; Democrats probed Mr. Zuckerberg on how quickly Facebook responded to Russian meddling.\u2022 Mr. Zuckerberg, surrounded by his top legal and policy executives, appeared well-coached. He answered questions directly and without defensiveness as he tried to reiterate the mission of the social network to better connect the world.Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, zeroed in on the issue at the heart of Facebook\u2019s troubles, asking Mr. Zuckerberg whether he would be comfortable sharing the name of the hotel he stayed in last night or if he would be comfortable sharing the names of the people he has messaged this week.\u201cNo. I would probably not choose to do that publicly here,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.\u201cI think that may be what this is all about,\u201d Mr. Durbin said. \u201cYour right to privacy. The limits of your right to privacy. And how much you give away in modern America in the name of, quote, connecting people around the world.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg said Facebook would be \u201cinvestigating many apps, tens of thousands of apps, and if we find any suspicious activity, we\u2019re going to conduct a full audit of those apps to understand how they\u2019re using their data and if they\u2019re doing anything improper. If we find that they\u2019re doing anything improper, we\u2019ll ban them from Facebook and we will tell everyone affected.\u201d\u2014 Matthew RosenbergSenator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California, zeroed in on whether Facebook deceived consumers. She pressed Mr. Zuckerberg on whether the company made a decision not to inform users about the Cambridge Analytica episode when they learned in 2015 that data was sold by a researcher to the political consulting firm.\u201cI\u2019m talking about notification of users. And this relates to the issue of transparency and the issue of trust: informing users of what you know in terms of how their personal information was misused,\u201d Ms. Harris said.Mr. Zuckerberg did not admit that the company explicitly decided to withhold that information from consumers, but he said the company made a mistake in not informing users.The question was key to the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s investigation of Facebook\u2019s violation of a 2011 consent decree. If the company withheld information, which would be a deceptive act, the company could face record fines for violating its promises to the agency.The tough questions by Ms. Harris, were closely watched because she is from the San Francisco Bay Area and is seen as a rising political star within the Democratic Party.\u2014 Cecilia KangSenator Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, pressed Mr. Zuckerberg on Russia\u2019s exploitation of the platform during the 2016 presidential election.Mr. Zuckerberg admitted that the company\u2019s effort to find and stop the Russian meddling was \u201cslow,\u201d and called that failure \u201cone of my greatest regrets.\u201d He said Facebook was tracking known Russian hacking groups in real time but took much longer to recognize the inflammatory posts of the Internet Research Agency, a private company with Kremlin ties.\u201cThere are people in Russia whose job is to exploit our systems,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cThis is an arms race.\u201dBut the Facebook founder said the company deployed new artificial intelligence tools to detect malicious activity in elections in France, Italy and a special Senate race in Alabama. He said he believed the new technology would help protect the integrity of elections around the world from manipulation via Facebook.\u2014 Scott ShaneSenator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, questioned Mr. Zuckerberg over discriminatory uses of Facebook\u2019s advertising platform to target ads to users by race, and tools that law enforcement officials have reportedly used to surveil activists of color.Mr. Booker\u2019s questioning is notable given that he and Mr. Zuckerberg have a history of friendly collaboration dating back to 2010, when Mr. Zuckerberg donated $100 million to the public school system in Newark, where Mr. Booker was mayor at the time.Mr. Booker has long been seen as a tech-friendly lawmaker, and he has known Mr. Zuckerberg for longer than most lawmakers. His tough stance today is a sign of how dramatically the political winds around Facebook have shifted.Early impressions of Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony were positive. In his first appearance before Congress, he appeared confident and answered questions directly. At first he was grim-faced, looked tired and serious. But he warmed up after an hour and offered humor about the company\u2019s motto. He insisted on continuing questions when offered a break, eliciting smiles and laughter from staff sitting behind him.\u201cThis is a different Mark Zuckerberg than the Street was fearing,\u201d said Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer and head of technology research for GBH Insights in New York. \u201cIt\u2019s a defining 48 hours that will determine the future of Facebook and so far he has passed with flying colors and the Street is relieved.\u201dInvestors appeared pleased: Facebook\u2019s stock closed up nearly 4.5 percent.Not all lawmakers left appeased by Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony.\u201cI was unsatisfied,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut. \u201cMore of the apology tour,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich we have heard before.\u201dMr. Blumenthal said it was clear to him that Facebook could not and would not fully regulate itself and that Congress needed to provide a solution.\u201cThe old saying: There ought to be a law. There has to be a law. Unless there\u2019s a law, their business model is going to continue to maximize profit over privacy,\u201d he said.Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the majority whip, asked if Facebook\u2019s motto is still \u201cmove fast and break things.\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said it has been revised.\u201cI don\u2019t know when we changed it,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg replied, \u201cbut the mantra is currently \u2018move fast with stable infrastructure,\u2019 which is a much less sexy mantra.\u201d He appeared to be joking, eliciting laughs from the executives sitting behind him.Mr. Zuckerberg said that Facebook was working with Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election and potential ties to the Trump campaign.Replying to Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, Mr. Zuckerberg initially seemed to confirm that Facebook had been served with subpoenas along the way, before saying he was not certain.\u201cI want to be careful here because our work with the special counsel is confidential,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I want to make sure that in an open session I\u2019m not revealing something that\u2019s confidential.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg said he had not personally spoken with investigators from Mr. Mueller\u2019s team, but that he thought others at the company had.Mr. Zuckerberg has a history of apologizing for the company\u2019s mistakes and promising to do better. Wired Magazine recently noted that Mr. Zuckerberg has a 14-year history of apologizing. That seems to have caused some consternation on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers prodded Mr. Zuckerberg about why, exactly, they should believe his promises now.\u201cAfter more than a decade of promises to do better, how is today\u2019s apology different and why should we trust Facebook to make the necessary changes to ensure user privacy and give people a clearer picture of your privacy policies?\u201d Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, asked.Mr. Zuckerberg referred again to his company\u2019s humble beginnings in his dorm room at Harvard.\u201cSo we have made a lot of mistakes in running the company. I think it\u2019s pretty much impossible, I believe, to start a company in your dorm room and then grow it to be at the scale that we\u2019re at now without making some mistakes.\u201dMr. Thune, the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, called Facebook and its role in society \u201cextraordinary\u201d and began the hearing by explaining why Facebook is being singled out and why Mr. Zuckerberg was asked to appear alone.He said the Cambridge Analytica situation underscored how Facebook can be used for nefarious reasons, saying it appeared \u201cto be the result of people exploiting the tools you created to manipulate users\u2019 information.\u201dIn an indication that he may support legislation for internet companies, Mr. Thune said, \u201cIn the past, many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have been willing to defer to tech companies\u2019 efforts to regulate themselves. But this may be changing.\u201dSenator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, who chairs the Judiciary Committee, said the tech industry \u201chas a responsibility\u201d to protect its users and said \u201cthe status quo no longer works.\u201d\u2014 Cecilia KangThat was the accusation that Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, was leveling at Mr. Zuckerberg when he grilled him for several minutes as to why the social network has been allegedly censoring content from conservative organizations and Trump supporters.Mr. Zuckerberg declined to answer whether Facebook is a neutral public forum or if it is expressing its own views of free speech, avoiding a complex legal question that Mr. Cruz was posing.However, Mr. Zuckerberg insisted that the company does not discriminate against Republican employees and that its definition for what kind of language should be kept off the platform was rooted in common sense.\u201cI am very committed to making sure that Facebook is a platform for all ideas,\u201d he said after Mr. Cruz ticked off several examples of potential liberal bias on the social network.Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, pressed Mr. Zuckerberg on whether Facebook is a monopoly, asking him to explain what other options customers have if they get frustrated with the social network.While Mr. Graham, the South Carolina Republican, tried compare his industry to the car business, where people can switch from Ford to Chevrolet if they want, Mr. Zuckerberg insisted that in his case, it\u2019s complicated. He noted that Facebook overlaps with companies like Google and Twitter and that he faces competition from a variety of popular apps.\u201cYou don\u2019t think you have a monopoly?\u201d Mr. Graham asked.Mr. Zuckerberg replied: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel that way to me.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Netanyahu\u2019s Reversal on Migrants Shows Influence of Hard-Line Allies", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisMr. Netanyahu announced the deal to great fanfare on Monday, only to suspend it a few hours later. On Tuesday, he canceled it completely and defended his abrupt reversal, saying he was responding to an outcry from members of his conservative Likud party as well as partners in his governing coalition who routinely refer to the migrants as \u201cinfiltrators\u201d and want all of them expelled.But the capitulation dented Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s image as a master political player.\u201cThis sort of zigzagging is not at all unusual,\u201d said Gadi Wolfsfeld, a professor of political communications at the Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya near Tel Aviv. \u201cBut for someone considered such a political genius to make such a miscalculation, that\u2019s the surprising part of the story.\u201d\u201cTo sign an agreement and the next day to renege on it, that\u2019s awful,\u201d Mr. Wolfsfeld said. \u201cI guess that means you can\u2019t sign anything with Israel.\u201dThe deal with the United Nations refugee agency might have given Israel a bit of relief from international criticism of the latest violence along the border with Gaza, where Israeli forces killed at least 16 Palestinians on Friday during a mass protest against Israel\u2019s longstanding blockade of the territory and in support of Palestinian claims to return to homes in what is now Israel.Instead, it proved to be an international embarrassment.As has often happened in the past, Mr. Netanyahu changed direction in the wake of harsh criticism from Naftali Bennett, the education minister and leader the Jewish Home party. While the far-right Jewish Home is in Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s coalition, it also competes with his Likud party for votes.Bezalel Smotrich, a Jewish Home legislator, said in a radio interview on Tuesday that he would be willing to topple the government over the migrant issue.\u201cWe want the state of Israel to remain a Jewish state,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this means sticking to the right migration policy.\u201dTal Schneider, the political correspondent for Globes, an Israeli financial newspaper, said of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s reversal: \u201cIt shows weakness.\u201dMr. Netanyahu said he had made the deal with the United Nations high commissioner for refugees because it seemed the only way to reduce the population of African migrants in Israel, who number at least 35,000. The migrants, mostly Eritreans and Sudanese who surreptitiously crossed the border from Egypt before it was sealed in 2012, cannot be returned to their own countries under international conventions for fear of persecution.The deal with the United Nations refugee agency was meant to replace a contentious Israeli plan to forcibly deport the migrants to Rwanda. That plan fell through because of legal obstacles and after Rwanda said it would accept only asylum seekers who left Israel voluntarily. Given the lack of options, Mr. Netanyahu apparently thought he would be able to sell the new plan to his supporters.\u201cEach year, I make thousands of decisions for the benefit of the state of Israel and its citizens. From time to time, a decision is taken that must be reconsidered,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said on Tuesday.\u201cDespite the growing legal obstacles and international difficulties, we will continue to act with determination to exhaust all the possibilities available to us to remove the infiltrators,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said, quickly falling back on the rhetoric of his base.The United Nations refugee agency said it regretted Israel\u2019s decision.\u201cU.N.H.C.R. continues to believe that a win-win agreement that would both benefit Israel and people needing asylum is in everyone\u2019s best interests. And we encourage the government of Israel to consider the matter further,\u201d the agency said.Mr. Netanyahu appears to have burned bridges with Rwanda. Until this week, the Israeli government had not named Rwanda as the main African destination for migrants deported from Israel, only referring obliquely to a secret agreement with a \u201cthird country.\u201dTo many in Israel, opposition to the United Nations plan makes little sense because all the migrants will remain in Israel, and in limbo, for the foreseeable future.Nick Cumming-Bruce contributed reporting from Geneva.Advertisement"}

And slay is ensuring each bride looks fierce and is ready to make the aisle her own personal runway.\u201dThe path to slaying does not include steering brides toward gyms and personal trainers so a dress will fit better, or insisting on an A-line silhouette, the style most often thrust at bigger brides. Instead, it usually involves finding the right undergarments. Also letting discriminating designers know they should take notice because business is booming.\u201cA lot of the discord in this business comes from designers who won\u2019t design above a certain size,\u201d Ms. Armstrong-Fowler said. \u201cBut they\u2019re becoming more aware that the average woman in America is a size 16. I\u2019ve had this conversation with a lot of designers: I say, if you\u2019re not designing above a 14 or 16, you\u2019re leaving behind an enormous part of the marketplace.\u201dMs. Miller, 34, recalls being wrenched into a size 6 before her 2017 wedding to get a sense of how the gown might look. \u201cI couldn\u2019t put my arms down,\u201d she said.Besides being demoralizing, the lack of inclusivity at bridal boutiques is mystifying, Ms. Chan said, because it\u2019s bad business. \u201cThis is a time when the consumer is spending more money than she\u2019ll ever spend in her life on a piece of clothing. So why aren\u2019t these brands giving them something to buy?\u201d she asked.That goes for jewelry designers, too.For Ms. Cole, the news of Ms. Liepold\u2019s recent public scuffle with her engagement photographer felt redeeming. \u201cI\u2019m glad she recognizes she should be proud of how she looks,\u201d she said. Ms. Cole was also not as immune to fat-shaming when she planned her wedding. \u201cIt felt like each shop I talked with was hellbent on crushing my self worth.\u201dMs. Liepold, and brides like Ms. Bralandingham of Los Angeles, a size 22, have become less susceptible.\u201cI look at it as a really great opportunity to change your life,\u201d Ms. Bralandingham, 39, said of the planning process that will lead to her 2019 destination wedding at Dollywood in Tennessee. \u201cNow\u2019s the time to curate your social media feed and curate your thoughts. I\u2019m planning my whole wedding around collaborating with people who validate me.\u201dMs. Miller offered advice for plus-size brides who are not quite there yet: \u201cDon\u2019t let insecurity be the boss of you.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Arizona Teachers Vote in Favor of Statewide Walkout", "Date": "2018-04-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe spread of the protests to Arizona from West Virginia, Oklahoma and Kentucky, all Republican-dominated states with weak public sector unions, signaled the depth of frustration from teachers and parents over years of education budget cuts.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that our educators are inspired by what they\u2019ve seen in West Virginia and Oklahoma and Kentucky,\u201d said Joe Thomas, president of the Arizona Education Association, the state\u2019s largest teachers\u2019 union. \u201cThey see educators rising up and lifting their voices for their students, and doing so in a way that can\u2019t be ignored.\u201dThe vote in Arizona followed weeks of protest across the state and promises from the governor to raise salaries. The Arizona Education Association and Arizona Educators United, a group of teachers who organized independently on Facebook, said that 78 percent of the teachers and school workers who cast ballots supported a walkout.The groups said the walkout would take place on April 26 if legislators and the governor did not meet their demands, not only for a raise for teachers but also one for school support staff. They also called for an end to tax cuts until Arizona\u2019s per-pupil spending reaches the national average.Unlike West Virginia and Oklahoma, Arizona has never before had a statewide teacher walkout, and has experienced only a handful of districtwide strikes over the past four decades.As in the other states where teachers have picketed, many districts in Arizona are facing teacher shortages in subjects like math, science and special education, with principals reporting that staff members are moving to deeper-pocketed states to earn up to $20,000 more per year, or to work in better-funded classrooms.Noah Karvelis, an elementary school music teacher and the founder of Arizona Educators United, said he was sympathetic to the disruption that widespread school closings would cause students and parents. But, he said, that should not forestall a walkout.\u201cIf we maintain the status quo, that is way worse than missing a couple of days of school,\u201d Mr. Karvelis said at a news conference outside the union headquarters in Phoenix. \u201cThe biggest disservice any of us could do for our students right now is to not act in this moment.\u201dBut many teachers rejected that plan, or said they distrusted Mr. Ducey, a first-term Republican.\u201cYou don\u2019t rob Peter to feed Paul,\u201d said Kassandra Dominguez, who teaches kindergarten and first grade in the Pendergast school district, near Phoenix. \u201cThat\u2019s so wrong, and I wouldn\u2019t want that money.\u201dAlternate proposals for raising school budgets include increasing an education sales tax from six-tenths of a cent to one cent, or closing corporate tax loopholes.Ms. Dominguez, 27, earns $38,250 per year, and says that because of low education budgets, she has had to pay out of pocket, or raise money from private donors, to buy her students science supplies, chairs and snacks. She voted in favor of a walkout. Her district had lost a total of $1.6 million over the past five years because of budget cuts, according to administrators, and the school board had come out in favor of the #RedForEd movement.In San Tan Valley, an exurban area an hour southeast of Phoenix, Mary Stavely, an elementary schoolteacher, said she had also voted in favor of a walkout. Ms. Stavely, 34, earns $36,800. Thirteen of 38 teachers at her school, Circle Cross Ranch K-8, are planning to resign at the end of this academic year, she said, because of factors like low pay and a lack of rental housing in the area.\u201cIt directly affects students\u201d when teacher turnover is high, Ms. Stavely said, because children \u201close morale and the connections that were made\u201d with caring adults. Ms. Stavely, a single mother, is currently living with her parents, and said she has considered looking for a higher-paying job. Still, she said she had spent her spring break going door to door to recruit parents to enroll their children at her public school. Arizona has aggressively expanded charter schools and private school vouchers in recent years, leading to enrollment declines \u2014 and potential budget cuts \u2014 for some traditional schools.More than 57,000 educators filled out a ballot in the Arizona walkout vote. There are approximately 90,000 certified teachers in the state, but only 20,000 members of the Arizona Education Association, the union. As in the other red states that have had recent teacher protests, union membership is optional for Arizona educators, and labor organizing is new for many of them.Among those who oppose a walkout is Jim Segar, 64, a colleague of Ms. Stavely\u2019s at Circle Cross Ranch K-8 and a physical education teacher.Mr. Segar said the proposal from Mr. Ducey was the best teachers could realistically hope for. \u201cYou can\u2019t get everything at once after years of neglect,\u201d he said. \u201cI think people would be crazy to walk or strike now.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Thousands of Indian Women Find Their American Dreams in Jeopardy", "Date": "2018-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLIVERMORE, Calif. \u2014 For seven years, Deepika Jalakam sat at home. Bored, unfulfilled and dependent on her husband for every dime, she struggled with the notion that her professional life was doomed in the land of opportunity.So when the employment card arrived in the mail in 2015, Ms. Jalakam did what she often does when good fortune comes her way: She placed it before the gods in the Hindu shrine mounted in her kitchen cabinet, blessed it with a dab of red \u201ckum kum\u201d powder and recited a prayer of gratitude.Within weeks, Ms. Jalakam, who has a degree in biotechnology, landed a job as an analyst at an insurance company. The next year, she and her husband, Vinay Kumar, a software engineer, bought a house. In 2017, the finances of the Indian immigrant couple were secure enough that they decided to have a second child.\u201cWe were happily working and feeling settled down with the life we wanted. Suddenly, this announcement came and there is instability,\u201d said Ms. Jalakam, 32, who now finds herself worrying about everything from day-to-day spending to vacation plans.Across the country, thousands of Indian families are caught in a similar dilemma because of the outsized role that they play in the H-1B visa program.The annual visa scramble began this week, with applications delivered by the truckload to government processing centers. The petitions represent tens of thousands of foreigners vying for the opportunity to work in the United States for three years or longer.Many are Indian software engineers and computer programmers recruited by American technology companies that say they cannot find enough talent in this country. Among the applicants are Indian math and science teachers headed for rural schools, as well as physicians and other professionals.But the H-1B program has spawned controversy. During his campaign, President Trump invited Americans displaced by H-1B workers to his rallies. Since taking office, he has ordered the program\u2019s overhaul, and his administration has taken steps to tighten scrutiny of applications.Still, demand for the visas continues unabated. In 2018, for the sixth consecutive year, the federal government was so flooded with petitions it stopped accepting them within a week. On Friday, officials announced they had reached their annual cap within five days and would resort again to a computer lottery to select the targeted 85,000 recipients. Universities and research organizations are exempt from the cap.Nearly 365,000 H-1B petitions were approved in the 2017 fiscal year. This number includes first-time applications subject to the cap and renewals, which are not capped. Three-quarters of them went to Indian nationals.Their success has been a mixed blessing. Tens of thousands of Indians on the temporary visas were later sponsored by their employers to remain permanently in the United States, but their families are in limbo, stuck in a ballooning backlog of green cards that are approved but cannot yet be issued.While skilled workers from most countries receive permanent residency a year or two after applying, Indians must wait a decade or longer because of their large numbers. The delays have meant that until recently thousands of women, many highly educated, remained at home while their husbands worked.Children must also wait. If their family\u2019s green card is not approved before they turn 21, the children are no longer eligible for legal residency as dependents and must leave the country, though they may have spent much of their lives in the United States. The much-debated legal protection for so-called Dreamers, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, applies to children who entered the country illegally, not to the offspring of legal immigrants.\u201cI felt like I was free from a cage to fly in any direction I want,\u201d Ms. Jalakam said of her work authorization that year.Last fall\u2019s announcement that the temporary work program would soon be scrapped has energized Indian women. Many who had sunk money into property and other investments with earnings from their jobs took to Twitter, using #standwithh4ead and #saveh4ead to raise awareness of their plight.\u201cWe\u2019re determined to save our jobs,\u201d said Jansi Kumar of Seattle, a founder of a Facebook page started in December, \u201cSave H4EAD,\u201d which has attracted nearly 5,000 followers. In early February, about 500 Indians descended on Capitol Hill to press for a solution to the green card backlog. At a rally, they hoisted posters that read, \u201cLegal Immigrants Matter Too\u201d and \u201c#H4EAD Let Spouses Work.\u201dOn the other hand, a group of information technology workers who lost their jobs to imported workers has filed suit to overturn the spousal work authorization program. The Department of Homeland Security, the federal agency which oversees the program, said it was completing an economic analysis and was likely to render its decision in June.L. Francis Cissna, director of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, the Department of Homeland Security agency that issues the permits, said the Trump administration\u2019s priority was to protect American workers. \u201cThe reason there is a lot of concern about Americans being displaced is because it is happening,\u201d he said in a recent interview.\u201cTheir valued, long-term employees will choose to leave their companies for other employment opportunities in countries that allow these workers and their families to raise their standard of living,\u201d the council warned.Doug Rand, former assistant director for entrepreneurship in the Obama administration, said Indian immigrants have long been \u201cessential for American technological innovation\u201d and offering work permits to spouses makes sense. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for these outrageous backlogs, they would be Americans already,\u201d he said.The backlog that is creating the problem is a byproduct of immigration laws drafted decades ago.In 1965, Congress established that no country could receive more than 7 percent of green cards issued in a year. In 1990, it determined that only 140,000 employment-based green cards could be granted annually, and each family member requires a separate card.Then the rise of the tech sector created a surge in demand for workers. Indians had the skills that American companies prized, so employers turned to the nonimmigrant H-1B visa to import them. Down the road, companies chose to sponsor many of the visa holders for green cards, which because of the annual caps created the current backlog.In June 2015, the latest year for which official data is available, about 300,000 Indians, including spouses and children, were waiting for their permanent residency cards. Indians in the green-card process since 2008 are only now receiving them.\u201cNo one should be stuck waiting more than 10 years for a green card. It hurts employers and employees and their families,\u201d said Stephen Yale-Loehr, a professor of immigration law at Cornell Law School. \u201cIndians are being held hostage by our broken immigration system.\u201dSome families have had to wait so long that they fear their children will reach adulthood and be forced to leave. Lakshmi Vishnubhotla, who has worked for 10 years as a teacher in Marion County, S.C., is currently sponsored for an H-1B by the school district. He was named teacher of the year for the district in 2015-16.Mr. Vishnubhotla\u2019s green card application, which includes his family, was approved in 2012. They are still waiting for the cards to be issued. Given that the wait time is 10 years, and getting longer, he is worried. In seven years, his 14-year-old daughter, Sivani, will be considered an adult. His son, Sarvan, will turn 21 in nine years. At that time, they will no longer be eligible for green cards as Mr. Vishnubhotla\u2019s dependents and could be forced to return to India.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to split our family,\u201d Mr. Vishnubhotla said.Teachers who arrived after him, including some whom he trained from Jamaica, Venezuela and elsewhere, already have permanent residency.Jigar Madlani, a software engineer in Parsippany, N.J., came on an H-1B and hisgreen card was approved in 2013. But none of the family\u2019s cards have been issued, and he fears his wife, Heta, will soon lose her ability to work.Armed with an H-4EAD permit, she was hired in late 2015 as a case manager for New Jersey\u2019s 211 line, handling calls from drug addicts, homeless families, victims of domestic violence and others in crisis seeking help.\u201cI had no identity in this country. I got it, and now they want to take it away from me,\u201d Ms. Madlani said.Back in California, Ms. Jalakam dreads returning to the days when she filled her time tutoring students in math and taking online technology courses.\u201cI would see a woman all dressed up as an executive and wonder, \u2018Will I ever be like that?\u2019\u201d recalled Ms. Jalakam, whose family\u2019s green card was approved in 2010 but is still unissued.Now that she has a well-paying job, Ms. Jalakam\u2019s main fear is losing it. She was pregnant with their second child when the administration announced plans to rescind the work authorizations. She began fretting about how they would afford their $4,800 monthly mortgage.She found like-minded women on the \u201cSaveH4EAD\u201d Facebook page, and felt better, she said. \u201cI realized there are strong-willed women like me who really want to work.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They could also upload lists of consumers bought from third-party marketing firms known as data brokers.By this time, targeting ads to people based on their interests had become a common online-advertising practice, and marketers and researchers were beginning to tap into big data analysis to push that practice further.In 2013, a researcher working for the consulting firm Cambridge Analytica released a personality quiz that people could take on Facebook, with the results indicating how open, conscientiousness, extroverted, agreeable or neurotic they were. The researcher compared the quiz results with what those who took it had liked on Facebook, ultimately determining which interests corresponded with which personality traits.Around 2014, Facebook\u2019s ad program began to evolve dramatically, allowing advertisers to pinpoint people even more precisely than before. By then, more than 1.2 billion people on average used the social network every day.In 2014, the company also introduced what it called Lookalike Audiences, a feature that allowed organizations that uploaded customer lists to also target people who had profiles similar to those customers.Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, has said the company would offer all of its users the same privacy required under the European law, regardless of where they live.Source: eMarketer (online advertising spending).Advertisement"}

It\u2019s based on whole milk and a specific brand of processed American cheese: Land O\u2019 Lakes Extra Melt.For Mr. Hernandez, it wasn\u2019t much of a leap. Mexicans have corn tortillas; Southerners eat cornbread. Mexicans render pork fat and save the lard; Southerners cook bacon and save the grease. Mexicans make barbacoa; Southerners call it barbecue.Too much emphasis is placed these days on culinary authenticity, he continued. \u201cIn Mexico, we eat what we like and don\u2019t worry about what is authentic to this cuisine or that,\u201d he said. \u201cYou make do, and you make it taste good.\u201dMr. Hernandez, who learned to cook from his grandmother, first came to America when he was a teenager with his rock band Fascinaci\u00f3n. They tried to land a recording contract in Houston. It didn\u2019t go so well.After a decade of working in factories and Tex-Mex restaurants while trying to break into the music business, he moved to Atlanta. He said that despite his chunky gold jewelry, pierced ear and long rocker hair, he got a job at a restaurant owned by Mike Klank, a low-key son of the South.He and Mr. Klank, to whom the book is dedicated, are now partners in the seven-restaurant Taqueria del Sol chain. Mr. Hernandez sells plenty of carnitas folded into flour tortillas, and bowls of green pork chili. But the menu also has his own Southern-Mexican mash-ups like tacos stuffed with fried chicken and lime jalape\u00f1o mayonnaise, or Memphis-style smoked pork with spicy cabbage slaw.Mr. Klank has helped Mr. Hernandez understand the Southern palate. They toured Atlanta\u2019s meat-and-three restaurants, and sampled the dry-rub barbecue from Memphis, Mr. Klank\u2019s hometown.Instead, Mr. Hernandez approached them the way his family used to cook lamb\u2019s quarters, the greens called quelites in Spanish. He put them in a pot with chicken stock, tomatoes and garlic, and added a hit of chile de arbol. The dish is a mainstay at the restaurants, and the recipe is in his book.So is his take on pork roast, a Southern Sunday supper staple. A pork loin with a little cap of fat is rubbed with onion and garlic, both in granulated form, then roasted fast in a very hot oven whose residual heat is used to roast a couple of jalape\u00f1os. The chopped peppers are then folded into gravy made from a classic French roux and homemade stock.The result is a decidedly Southern dish, punched up with the flavors he grew up eating in his hometown, Monterrey. Like most of his recipes, it\u2019s thrifty, practical and delicious.\u201cMy food doesn\u2019t require an arm and a leg, and you don\u2019t have to spend six hours in the kitchen,\u201d he said.That\u2019s not to say they aren\u2019t specific. Mr. Hernandez is, if nothing else, very specific. He prefers lemon juice to lime juice in his guacamole because lime is too acidic and \u201ccooks\u201d the avocado. And he blisters jalape\u00f1o in oil for the dip because it takes away the green taste of the pepper, which he thinks interferes with the flavor of the avocado \u2014 which, by the way, has to be Hass.\u201cThis is the way I cook,\u201d he said. \u201cEither you like it or not. I don\u2019t care.\u201dThe point is to not fuss too much. \u201cIf you have something good and you want to make it better,\u201d he advised, \u201cbe careful.

{"Headline": "Teachers Get Baseball Bats to Confront Shooters in Pennsylvania District", "Date": "2018-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA school district in Erie, Pa., has supplied teachers and other school employees with miniature baseball bats to use as a last resort if confronted with an active shooter.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be sitting ducks,\u201d William Hall, superintendent of the Millcreek Township School District, said on Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re not just going to go hide.\u201dThe 18-inch wood bats are also meant to be \u201csymbolic,\u201d he said, to remind people that the old policy of simply turning off the lights, shutting the door and hiding, is not enough. Now, he says, one option is fighting back.\u201cPart of that response is to assess your environment for anything that could be used as a potential weapon or to defend yourself,\u201d he added.The 600 bats each cost $3, Mr. Hall said, and are akin to a ballpark souvenir.They are no match, of course, for a gunman toting a semiautomatic weapon.Even so, Mr. Hall said, \u201cI think a bat could disarm a pistol with a nice swing.\u201dJon Cacchione, the president of the Millcreek teachers\u2019 union, says it\u2019s better than doing nothing.\u201cIs this going to make the difference if we have an active shooter? I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, but the bats, along with the other changes the district is employing, are \u201can improvement of what we had before.\u201dThe Millcreek school district\u2019s decision to use bats has been panned on Facebook and Twitter, prompting comments ranging from angry to incredulous.\u201cIs this a late April fools joke?\u201d someone asked.Others suggested that conceal and carry was a better solution.\u201cBest to just arm teachers and staff with guns,\u201d one woman wrote.Bonnie Fagan, 56, a Pennsylvania PTA board member whose son graduated from the high school in Millcreek Township said she was \u201csurprised and disappointed to hear money was spent on something along those lines.\u201dMr. Hall defended his decision.\u201cI think what happens is, after Parkland, things die down and you almost fall back into a false sense of security until it happens again,\u201d Mr. Hall said. \u201cIf you have to take a few bumps and bruises because people think it\u2019s silly, I\u2019m O.K. with that.\u201dMatthew Exley, director of the Millcreek Township Office of Emergency Management, said in an email on Wednesday that neither his organization nor the Millcreek Township Police Department was involved in the decision by the Millcreek Township School District to provide bats to teachers.All 470 of the district\u2019s teachers received the bats on April 2, as did teacher\u2019s aides, administrators and building staff, Mr. Cacchione said.The idea came from an anonymous response to the district\u2019s online survey distributed about a month after the Parkland, Fla., shooting that killed 17 people, Mr. Hall explained. The survey, which included only one question, asked whether or not parents approved of having an armed presence in schools who would act as \u201c\u2018first responder(s)\u2019 to an active shooter situation.\u201dThe bats are meant to be used only during a \u201chard lockdown situation,\u201d Mr. Hall said, and are locked up in the district\u2019s buildings and classrooms so they don\u2019t fall into the wrong hands.It\u2019s part of a larger effort to improve school safety, Mr. Hill said, that includes installing a concrete barrier between a parking lot and a walkway, instituting regular police patrols at each of the district\u2019s 10 schools and securing building entrances.The Parkland shooting has led school officials and lawmakers across the country to make changes. Last month, the superintendent of the Blue Mountain School District in Schuylkill County, Pa., announced that every classroom had been equipped with a five-gallon bucket of river stone.And while Mr. Cacchione said that bats aren\u2019t going to stop an active shooter, \u201cwe\u2019re going to keep working at this until we get what\u2019s best.\u201dAdvertisement"}

President Trump\u2019s narrow victory appears to have been fashioned, at least in part, by a covert appeal to the insecurity, religious fervor or racism of voters willing to rely on social media for information about the world.Those who financed and carried out this ugly propaganda campaign were careful to avoid having their names associated with such lies and distortions. They were also unwilling to openly argue and defend their ideas.The future of our democracy depends on an electorate informed by truth and transparency. Thanks to The Times and other courageous media outlets for exposing this threat to our freedom. The challenge now is to get the word out to those influenced by Cambridge Analytica.STEPHEN DYCUS, NEW YORKTo the Editor:The left and the liberal media are up to their old tricks, this time using the Cambridge Analytica imbroglio to once again advance the narrative that Donald Trump cheated and didn\u2019t win fair and square, and in essence \u201cstole\u201d the election from Hillary Clinton by using Cambridge\u2019s capabilities to surgically target individual voters and \u201cbrainwash\u201d them into voting against her. It\u2019s getting silly now.This is just the latest denigration of Trump voters, who have been repeatedly maligned as ignorant and unsophisticated.

They weren\u2019t bullied into doing so by their husbands, sons or bosses, and they weren\u2019t brainwashed into doing so by Cambridge, Facebook and the Russians.Hillary Clinton lost because she was a flawed candidate with flawed ethics and flawed judgment who ran a flawed campaign. It wasn\u2019t Russia\u2019s, Cambridge Analytica\u2019s or Facebook\u2019s fault that she lost. It was her own. And it\u2019s long past time we all accept that fact.Advertisement"}

Had it not been for the efforts of a few winemakers, most notably the Mastroberardino estate, it might be forgotten today.Here are the three bottles I suggest:Many different fianos are available, but most seem to be made in small quantities, so chances are you may not find these exact bottles or, if you do, the same vintages. Don\u2019t worry about the vintage. In fact, though I have the \u201915 Picariello, it may be that the 2016s will be available by the time you shop.

{"Headline": "Want to See the Starting Pitcher? Don\u2019t Arrive Late", "Date": "2018-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn BaseballMickey Callaway said something Wednesday morning that might have sent a shiver through all fans of pitching as we know it.\u201cIf you look at the numbers,\u201d said Callaway, the Mets\u2019 new manager, \u201cit always is in your favor to bring in a new pitcher every inning, really \u2014 unless it\u2019s just your best, best guy and you want to keep him out there. But it always makes sense, numbers-wise, to bring in a different guy so the hitters are facing different pitchers every at-bat. There\u2019s an advantage to that.\u201dNoah Syndergaard is the Mets\u2019 best, best guy. But even Syndergaard, the mighty Thor, could not venture past the fourth inning against the Philadelphia Phillies at windswept Citi Field on Wednesday afternoon. Syndergaard whiffed six of his first nine hitters, but on second viewing, the Phillies handled him better.So, in the bottom of the fourth, in a tie game with Syndergaard having thrown 92 pitches, Callaway removed him for a pinch-hitter.\u201cTo be honest, after four innings I had no idea I was at 90 pitches,\u201d Syndergaard said. \u201cIt was like, wham, I was already there, 90 pitches. I\u2019m like, \u2018All right, well, that\u2019s fun.\u2019\u201dThe Mets went on to win, 4-2, taking the lead for good after the Phillies lifted their own top starter, Aaron Nola, who had worked five innings and thrown 87 pitches. The teams combined to use eight relievers, and the Mets\u2019 foursome \u2014 Robert Gsellman, Hansel Robles, AJ Ramos and Jeurys Familia \u2014 struck out eight in five scoreless innings.This is baseball in 2018. The last two World Series have matched teams heavily influenced by analytics \u2014 the Chicago Cubs and the Cleveland Indians in 2016, the Houston Astros and the Los Angeles Dodgers last season. The Moneyball revolution that began in the early 2000s is no longer revolutionary. It is everywhere.Philadelphia fans \u2014 at least those who could find Wednesday\u2019s Facebook-only broadcast \u2014 cannot be happy. The Phillies will stage their home opener on Thursday, and even the presence of Doug Pederson, the coach of the Super Bowl-winning Eagles who will throw out the first pitch, may not save Kapler from an earful.\u201cLook, my focus is on getting our team ready to play our first home series,\u201d Kapler said. \u201cThis is not about me, this is about our players. Our players are very, very exciting. Our club is a good, deep, interesting club.\u201dSo far, though, Kapler\u2019s moves have been the most interesting thing about the Phillies, and not in a good way. He relies heavily on data, but several strategies have backfired, despite the research behind them.After lifting his starter on Wednesday \u2014 \u201cThe thought process was, as it always is: keep Nola safe, healthy and strong,\u201d he said \u2014 Kapler called for Drew Hutchison, a journeyman right-hander whose slider had impressed him all spring.With two out and two on in the sixth, Kapler expected Hutchison\u2019s slider to induce weak contact from the Mets\u2019 No. 9 hitter, Amed Rosario. He put right fielder Nick Williams in an extremely shallow position to keep a hit from falling in front of him \u2014 but instead, Rosario drove the slider well over Williams\u2019s head. It bounced to the wall for a two-run triple.Kapler is convinced that, in time, his moves will start to work. For now, though, he is left to insist that data-driven baseball will eventually pay off.\u201cWe have to be patient and trust that we\u2019re trying to look at a very large sample size to evaluate if our strategies are working effectively,\u201d Kapler said. \u201cI can\u2019t express enough confidence that our strategies will pay dividends, but I understand that in the short term, they haven\u2019t \u2014 and that can be disappointing. I get it.\u201dThe Phillies\u2019 pitchers will probably improve their current 5.56 earned run average, especially once their injured or rusty free-agent signees \u2014 Jake Arrieta, Tommy Hunter and Pat Neshek \u2014 join the roster. Likewise, the Mets\u2019 pitchers will probably not continue to strike out 61 batters every five games, and their bullpen will not be this sharp every day.The larger question is what these trends mean for baseball. Statistics can be fascinating and revealing, challenging long-held assumptions and leading to more rational decisions. But when teams ask less of their players, we seem less likely to witness true greatness.Consider the fifth inning on Wednesday, when Nola faced Yoenis Cespedes with one out and the bases empty. It should not have been strange that he was allowed to do this. But now, with managers so nervous about letting pitchers face hitters three times in one game, it seemed almost quaint.Cespedes had homered off Nola\u2019s curveball in the first inning, but this time, Nola struck him out with that very same pitch. Two batters later he was done for the day, and it seemed disturbingly normal.Advertisement"}

There was a college student who was about to graduate, and a longtime Waffle House employee.Friends and relatives of the victims were still trying to make sense of the tragedy on Monday. Here is a look at their lives.Mr. Perez grew up in Buda, Tex., just outside of Austin. After graduating from Hays High School in 2016, he moved to Nashville to work with one of his two older brothers in an appliance store.

{"Headline": "Zuckerberg Was Called Out Over Myanmar Violence. Here\u2019s His Apology.", "Date": "2018-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLast week, after frustrated activists from Myanmar sent an open letter to Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, they got something unexpected: a reply.Facebook is a dominant source of information in Myanmar, and civil society groups have accused it of being a kind of absentee landlord, with few moderators and systems in place to keep extremists from using Facebook posts to incite violence.In his email, Mr. Zuckerberg said Facebook had added \u201cdozens\u201d of Burmese language content reviewers to monitor reports of hate speech and had \u201cincreased the number of people across the company on Myanmar-related issues,\u201d including a product team working on building tools to try to help stem the violence there.The disagreement centers on a chain letter that spread on Facebook Messenger in Myanmar in September. The messages warned Buddhist communities of an imminent Muslim attack. Meanwhile, Muslim populations received a separate message cautioning them of violence from militant Buddhist groups.Civil society groups say the messages paralyzed major cities in Myanmar and raised fears of a violent clash. Such incitement and scaremongering have become far too typical on Facebook, according to the groups, which say Facebook has repeatedly failed to follow through on promises to devote more resources to the issues.Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s personal email did not quell the activists\u2019 frustration. The groups say the biggest obstruction to their attempts to push back against a torrent of dangerous hate speech is not their lack of resources but Facebook itself. They said Facebook had a history of pledging to do more to help quell ethnic violence in Myanmar but had not fulfilled its promises.\u201cIt\u2019s great that he\u2019s engaging personally with this, but the stuff he\u2019s talking about is really not that much different from what they\u2019ve been saying for the past few years,\u201d said Jes Petersen, the chief executive of Phandeeyar, an innovation lab in Myanmar that has worked with Facebook to produce localized versions of its community standards.A Facebook spokeswoman, Debbie Frost, confirmed the authenticity of Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s email, and said Facebook was planning to continue engaging with the activists.Years after civil society groups first began flagging hate speech in Myanmar, the company still has no permanent office or staff in the country and seems to be struggling to give its platform sufficient oversight. In Germany, where hate speech laws require vigilant attention from content reviewers, Facebook has hired about 1,200 moderators. In order to achieve the same ratio of users to moderators in Myanmar, Facebook would need to have around 800 reviewers in the country, Mr. Petersen calculated.\u201cDozens of content reviewers is not going to cut it,\u201d he said.The civil society groups have already responded to Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s reply, asking for hard data about Facebook\u2019s efforts in the region, including how many Burmese-speaking reviewers the company has, how many accounts the company has taken down in Myanmar and how long, on average, it takes for Facebook to respond to reports of hate speech.\u201cA lot of what they\u2019ve been doing is cosmetic \u2014 it\u2019s not the tangible improvement we\u2019re looking for,\u201d said Victoire Rio, a social media analyst in Myanmar who was named in Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s reply.Mr. Petersen said he hoped Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s appeal would spur actual change and not just expressions of worry. \u201cI wonder how he spent those sleepless nights \u2014 because we didn\u2019t see that much change,\u201d he said.Here is the full text of Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s email to the civil society groups, followed by the groups\u2019 response:Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s emailDear Htaike Htaike, Jes, Victoire, Phyu Phyu and Thant,I wanted to personally respond to your open letter. Thank you for writing it and I apologize for not being sufficiently clear about the important role that your organizations play in helping us understand and respond to Myanmar-related issues, including the September incident you referred to.In making my remarks, my intention was to highlight how we\u2019re building artificial intelligence to help us better identify abusive, hateful or false content even before it is flagged by our community.These improvements in technology and tools are the kinds of solutions that your organizations have called on us to implement and we are committed to doing even more. For example, we are rolling out improvements to our reporting mechanism in Messenger to make it easier to find and simpler for people to report conversations.In addition to improving our technology and tools, we have added dozens more Burmese language reviewers to handle reports from users across all our services. We have also increased the number of people across the company on Myanmar-related issues and we now we have a special product team working to better understand the specific local challenges and build the right tools to help keep people there safe.There are several other improvements we have made or are making, and I have directed my teams to ensure we are doing all we can to get your feedback and keep you informed.We are grateful for your support as we map out our ongoing work in Myanmar, and we are committed to working with you to find more ways to be responsive to these important issues.MarkThe civil society groups\u2019 response. The half-dozen signatories of the response include Phandeeyar, a leading technology hub in the country; the Myanmar ICT for Development Organization, which monitors online hate speech; and the Center for Social Integrity.Dear Mark,Thank you for responding to our letter from your personal email account. It means a lot.We also appreciate your reiteration of the steps Facebook has taken and intends to take to improve your performance in Myanmar.This doesn\u2019t change our core belief that your proposed improvements are nowhere near enough to ensure that Myanmar users are provided with the same standards of care as users in the U.S. or Europe.When things go wrong in Myanmar, the consequences can be really serious \u2014 potentially disastrous. You have yourself publicly acknowledged the risk of the platform being abused towards real harm.Like many discussions we have had with your policy team previously, your email focuses on inputs. We care about performance, progress and positive outcomes.In the spirit of transparency, we would greatly appreciate if you could provide us with the following indicators, starting with the month of March 2018:\u25a0 How many reports of abuse have you received?\u25a0 What % of reported abuses did your team ultimately remove due to violations of the community standards?\u25a0 How many accounts were behind flagging the reports received?\u25a0 What was the average time it took for your review team to provide a final response to users of the reports they have raised? What % of the reports received took more than 48 hours to receive a review?\u25a0 Do you have a target for review times? Data from our own monitoring suggests that you might have an internal standard for review \u2014 with most reported posts being reviewed shortly after the 48 hrs mark. Is this accurate?\u25a0 How many fake accounts did you identify and remove?\u25a0 How many accounts did you subject to a temporary ban? How many did you ban from the platform?Improved performance comes with investments and we would also like to ask for more clarifications around these. Most importantly, we would like to know:\u25a0 How many Myanmar speaking reviewers did you have, in total, as of March 2018? How many do you expect to have by the end of the year? We are specifically interested in reviewers working on the Facebook service and looking for full-time equivalents figure.\u25a0 What mechanisms do you have in place for stopping repeat offenders in Myanmar? We know for a fact that fake accounts remain a key issue and that individuals who were found to violate the community standards on a number of occasions continue to have a presence on the platform.\u25a0 What steps have you taken to date to address the duplicate posts issue we raised in the briefing we provided your team in December 2017?We\u2019re enclosing our December briefing for your reference, as it further elaborates on the challenges we have been trying to work through with Facebook.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Redstones\u2019 Voting Power Leaves Moonves and CBS Few Options: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Friday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Lending in the first quarter is set to disappoint.\u2022 JPMorgan reported record revenue and profit.\u2022 Why is President Trump considering rejoining the TPP?\u2022 What the U.S.P.S. inquiry means for Amazon.Chief executives with Mr. Moonves\u2019s record don\u2019t often find themselves in this position, but he is there because of CBS and Viacom\u2019s unique corporate governance structure: namely, the super-voting powers of the Redstone family\u2019s vehicle, National Amusements.Let\u2019s recap the kind of power that National Amusements has over the corporate siblings, thanks to its dual classes of stock:\u2022 Despite owning just over 10 percent of the outstanding shares at CBS and just under 10 percent at Viacom, the Redstones have about 80 percent of the voting power at both companies.\u2022 With that kind of power, National Amusements could replace the board at either company at any point in time.It is that power that allows Shari Redstone to compel CBS and Viacom to explore a merger for the second time.CBS said in a statement Wednesday: \u201cThe industry and the marketplace know Leslie Moonves\u2019 record and we think it speaks for itself.\u201d Viacom declined to comment.Thanks to the dual-class stock structure \u2014 something CBS and Viacom share with the likes of Facebook, Alphabet and The New York Times Company \u2014 there\u2019s little that regular shareholders, or management of either company, can do.Legal experts say that National Amusements has fiduciary duties to shareholders of each company, but that the Redstones unquestionably have the power to replace board members.\u201cYou can stack the board,\u201d said John Coffee of Columbia Law School, though he added that \u201cit might be poor form to stuff the board\u201d before pushing through a merger or C.E.O. change.Charles Elson, director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware, said that companies controlled by a dual-class structure can sometimes opt for other shareholders to have a voice. But that isn\u2019t a requirement.Professor Elson said that Ms. Redstone has the ability to force through a deal or a board change. But, he added, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t mean that these things go without litigation.\u201d\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedTax cuts, bank deregulation and a recovering global economy were expected to unleash a surge of bank lending that could stoke an even stronger expansion. But lending in the first quarter is set to disappoint, at least going by the results of the four big banks that reported Friday.JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and PNC Financial had a combined $2.78 trillion of loans at the end of the first quarter, up 3 percent from $2.7 billion at the end of the same period a year ago. How does that growth rate stack up? It\u2019s more or less in line with the 2.9 percent increase in loans the banks notched up last year, but it is well below the 4.6 percent and the 4.4 percent rates that they together achieved in 2016 and 2015.Each quarter, much attention is paid to the performance of the big banks\u2019 Wall Street operations. But activities like trading are only remotely related to the real economy. As a result, to assess whether banks are assisting the wider economy, it makes more sense to look at trends in their lending, which directly finances consumer spending, home purchases and corporate investments.Investors may have been disappointed at the first-quarter lending numbers. Despite the four banks\u2019 strong profits, their stock prices on Friday slid.The unexceptional first-quarter loan growth may, of course, give way to bigger increases later this year as confidence builds. And beneath the aggregated loan totals are some numbers that suggest things could improve. Citigroup\u2019s loans grew 7.1 percent in the first quarter, compared with the year-ago period. The increase was driven by a 13 percent surge in corporate lending, much of which took place in Europe and Asia. And the first-quarter total for the four banks was held back by a 1.1 percent decline at Wells Fargo, which is operating under a strict regulatory edict.\u2014 Peter Eavis\u201cWe\u2019ve got a deal\u201d already, said Steven Ciobo, Australia\u2019s trade minister, who added, \u201cI can\u2019t see that all being thrown open to appease the United States.\u201dShares of the biggest banks are faring worse than the broader stock indexes.The KBW Bank Index, made up of 24 of the largest banks, is off nearly 1 percent while the S.&P. 500 is essentially flat in early trading.JPMorgan was down 1.1 percent, Citigroup was off 1.5 percent, and Wells Fargo fell 2.3 percent.The declines come despite JPMorgan announcing record profits and Citi reporting its highest earnings since 2015.Following widespread missteps at the bank, the Fed in February told Wells Fargo that, until sufficient improvements were made, it could not increase the amount of assets it holds. Some analysts said the cap need not stop the bank from making more loans, because it could sell securities and then use that money to do more lending. But loans did not grow in the first quarter. At the end of March, Wells Fargo had $947 billion of loans, down from $958 billion a year earlier, and also down from $957 billion at the end of 2017.But the decline is not large, and it\u2019s not clear how much the Fed\u2019s cap is to blame. Wells Fargo\u2019s loans had not been growing strongly in recent quarters.And here are Wells Fargo\u2019s numbers:\u2022 Wells Fargo\u2019s profit rose to $5.94 billion.\u2022 Earnings per share came in at $1.12 a share. Analysts had expected earnings of $1.06 a share, according to Thomson Reuters.\u2022 Revenues fell to $21.9 billion from $22.3 billion in the first-quarter 2017.\u2022 Costs rose 3% to $14.24 billion from $13.79 billion a year ago.\u2014 Peter EavisJPMorgan reported record revenue and profit for the first three months of this year.Here are the numbers:\u2022 The bank reported earnings of $8.71 billion, up 35 percent from a year ago.\u2022 That comes to $2.37 a share. Analysts had expected earnings of $2.28 a share, according to Thomson Reuters.\u2022 Revenue increased to $28.5 billion, up 10 percent.\u2022 Return on equity, a measure of profitability, hit 15 percent, up from 11 percent a year ago.\u2022 Trading revenues rose to $6.57 billion, up 13 percent from the first quarter of 2017.\u2022 Equities trading revenue rose 26 percent to $2.02 billion.\u2022 Bond-trading revenue rose 8 percent to $4.55 billion.\u2022 Earnings rose to $4.6 billion, up from $4.1 billion a year ago.\u2022 Earnings per share came in at $1.68. Analysts expected $1.61 a share, according to Thomson Reuters.\u2022 Revenue increased to $18.9 billion for the quarter, up 3% from a year earlier.\u2022 Revenue from fixed-income trading fell 7 percent to $3.4 billion.\u2022 Equity trading revenue jumped 38% to $1.1 billion.\u2022 Fees from investment banking fell 10 percent to $1.1 billion.One way to gauge the crosswinds blowing through financial markets and the global economy is by examining the results of JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo, which report their first-quarter earnings today.\u2022 Are trade tensions reducing demand for credit?\u2022 How concerned should we be with the volatility in the stock and bond markets?\u2022 Are regular Americans borrowing more, potentially boosting the U.S. economy?\u2022 How much will deregulation help the banks?\u201cI, maybe a bit na\u00efvely, believed that there was a need for someone in high elected office to be more open-minded and willing to not only govern from the middle but to try to shame everyone else into going to the middle.\u201dAlas, his company agreed to buy most of 21st Century Fox for $52.4 billion, and that was that.One intriguing possibility: Elliott pushing to be involved in a sale of some or all of the business through its private equity team, Evergreen Coast Capital.The deals flyaroundAdvertisement"}

On a follow-up trip the next year, Ms. DiDonato encountered Joseph Wilson, an inmate and aspiring composer who had been at the recital. He said he had been overwhelmed by the performance, she recalled in a recent interview at the Metropolitan Opera, where she will sing the title role in the company premiere of \u201cCendrillon\u201d \u2014 Massenet\u2019s frothy, romantic, rarely done Cinderella adaptation \u2014 starting on April 12.Mr. Wilson had been inspired to write an opera, Ms. DiDonato said. With the help of the Carnegie program, he soon completed preliminary work on his first large-scale piece, \u201cTabula Rasa.\u201d Last October, Ms. DiDonato returned to Sing Sing a third time to join him in presenting some of it in front of 300 inmates.\u201cIt\u2019s about a murderer; he\u2019s asking someone for forgiveness,\u201d she said. Her character denies his request. \u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary. In concert, about two-thirds of the way through, his character begs for forgiveness again, and then drops to his knees, but my character keeps saying no. Finally, he collapses over his knees and cradles his head in his hands.\u201d\u201cMy character, after a flame with a Roman soldier in woods,\u201d she said, \u201cruns to Norma\u2019s hut, drops to her knees and begs her friend for forgiveness. And I did the same gesture I had done for five weeks of rehearsal: I collapsed on my knees and cradled my head \u2014 the same physical gesture Joe had done. Now you go on and tell me how opera\u2019s irrelevant to normal people.\u201dThe art form, she added, is \u201cthe opposite of elitist.\u201dThere was a time when calling an opera star accessible might have counted as a criticism. Operatic characters \u2014 an aloof pantheon of gods, monarchs, priests and countesses \u2014 are generally more outsize than approachable; their exponents have traditionally been measured on a scale of perceived regality and remoteness.But with the art form struggling for audiences, major companies, once content to keep stars shrouded in mystery, now see it as essential to bring people in for a closer look. Facebook and YouTube provide behind-the-scenes glimpses of rehearsals, coachings and costume fittings. You can now tweet at Tosca.Such a world is tailor-made for Ms. DiDonato, 49, opera\u2019s Miss Congeniality. \u201cThe key isn\u2019t changing what we do,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s making sure that we go to where the people are.\u201dHer can-do spirit is the subject of lore: At one London performance of Rossini\u2019s \u201cIl Barbiere di Siviglia,\u201d in 2009, she fractured her fibula, then soldiered on in a wheelchair. Cinderella, that fabled optimist, is an ideal role for her. Born Joyce Flaherty on the edge of Kansas City to an Irish-American family of seven children, Ms. DiDonato had an unlikely ascent to celebrity, and a rough time finding management after her time in the Houston Grand Opera\u2019s young artist program.In fact, finding her way to the stage in the first place had been a struggle. Ms. DiDonato said that her final year at Wichita State University, where she studied to be a high school music teacher and graduated in 1992, was riddled with self-doubt.\u201cI saw the need for committed, devoted teachers,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the stage was calling me, and I loved it, and it felt really good. As a good Catholic Midwestern girl, that was bad. If something felt good, it must be bad.\u201dShe approached her father, a longtime classical music lover, for advice: \u201cHe said, \u2018Joyce, there\u2019s more than one way to teach people, more than one way to connect.\u2019 \u201dShe embraced the public-facing side of singing. For a while, she recorded her thoughts on Yankeediva several times a month as she recorded the Handel opera \u201cAriodante,\u201d sang for the celebrated mezzo Marilyn Horne\u2019s 75th birthday gala, combated isolation on the road and mourned the loss of her father. She aimed Opera Rocks, her e-newsletter, at curious high school students who might feel lonely in their interest in high culture.Opera, she said, is about \u201cbringing truth and beauty and astonishment to people, while reminding everyone who feels ignored or shunned or diminished that, actually, there\u2019s something bigger out there.\u201dMs. DiDonato has the earnest zeal of a self-help enthusiast. She said her main teachings these days \u201crarely come from the opera field\u201d and run to mindfulness lessons from Eckhart Tolle, Byron Katie and Joseph Campbell. Her views are liberal but mild; other than railing in 2011 against cuts to arts programs made by Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback, she\u2019s kept mostly quiet about more incendiary political topics.\u201cI monitor myself carefully,\u201d she said. \u201cI wish to provoke because I\u2019m a citizen. But I never, ever want to impose so much in social media or offstage that the audience feels like it\u2019s seeing \u2018Joyce\u2019 onstage. People have paid to see \u2018Cendrillon.\u2019 They haven\u2019t paid to see me.\u201dExcept, well, they have. The Met would never have put on this Massenet rarity if not for her, and fans are drawn to her personality, curiosity and dazzling voice as much as to the music she sings. For two decades Ms. DiDonato has taken on a strikingly mixed bag of mezzo repertoire, seesawing between centuries and styles. Her voice, adept at elastic runs and flowery embellishments, is also soulful and sincere. S he can glide up into the soprano stratosphere when she chooses.Pick any season of her early career for a sense of this unusual versatility: In 2002-3, for example, she darted from \u201cDead Man Walking,\u201d by the American composer Jake Heggie, to other works including Mozart\u2019s \u201cLe Nozze di Figaro\u201d; Janacek\u2019s \u201cThe Cunning Little Vixen\u201d; and Rossini\u2019s \u201cIl Barbiere di Siviglia\u201d and \u201cLa Cenerentola,\u201d that composer\u2019s Cinderella opera.She is perhaps now most widely associated with Baroque and bel canto opera \u2014 her skookum approach to the aria \u201cTanti affetti\u201d from Rossini\u2019s \u201cLa Donna del Lago,\u201d with its dizzying runs and leaps up and down the staff, has made her rendition a cult favorite \u2014 but she is no less at ease with the gentle lines of the American songbook.That gift for understated lyricism has made \u201cCendrillon,\u201d a lesser-known work from 1899 that shows its composer\u2019s knack for comedy, one of Ms. DiDonato\u2019s calling cards over the past decade. She opened the director Laurent Pelly\u2019s brightly colored production at Santa Fe Opera in 2006, and it has traveled with her to London, Barcelona and now the Met, which the company is presenting for the first time in its history with a cast that also includes Alice Coote, Kathleen Kim, Stephanie Blythe and Laurent Naouri, conducted by Bertrand de Billy.\u201cThe beautiful thing about Cinderella is that she\u2019s somebody who believes in goodness,\u201d Ms. DiDonato said. \u201cShe stays true to herself in a very quiet way.\u201dThe character\u2019s authenticity was what first attracted her to the role. The show has not changed much for her over the years she has performed it. Yet in preparing for her latest run at the Met, she discovered new power in its unpretentious optimism. During a recent rehearsal, she and Mr. Pelly were startled to find themselves in tears.\u201cI think what\u2019s happening in the world right now is so dark and heavy,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re struck with this innocence, this freshness, there\u2019s this nuclear sensation of being hit. I think we\u2019re all drinking it in, unaware of how much we needed it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He was looking out of the corner of his eyes and flapping his hands in front of them. It was self-stimulatory behavior, or stimming, common in kids on the autism spectrum, and he did it intensely.Putting him in his crib at nap time during this stage was hard. I would stay by his side and sing to him, often for 30 minutes or more, because it was the only way to distract him from flapping and get him to fall asleep.One day, my energy was flagging. Instead of sticking around to sing at nap time I quietly left the room. Maybe he would flap himself to sleep? It seemed worth trying. I went back to check on him 10 minutes later and there he was, awake and waving his hand. And I thought, there is no one on earth who knows how I feel, exhausted and scared, watching my child flap and flap in the dark.But I was wrong. There are people like me around, stumbling through caring for a child who isn\u2019t \u201cneurotypical,\u201d and it\u2019s comforting to know they exist. They helped me learn to accept him, stimming included. Other parents\u2019 frustrations, questions, honest and sometimes funny tales \u2014 all provide a balm on hard days.For me, user-created Facebook groups for special-needs parents function like a very convenient support group you can check in with as your time-crunched life permits. People share recommendations and advice. They vent about schools, health insurance and daily life. I am not even that active in these groups, but it\u2019s reassuring to hear from other parents, even just online.I asked some parents in a couple of my Facebook groups for their thoughts about what the social network means to them, particularly with the latest news and the calls to delete it. Here\u2019s some of what I heard:\u201cThis group makes me feel less alone.\u201d\u201cI felt rescued by a connection made here.\u201d\u201cI did delete Facebook and found myself sort of unraveling. I feel so alone without it. I\u2019m actually tearing up as I type this.\u201dIt\u2019s useful, too, that they know the details about providing this specific type of medical care at home. \u201cWhen I have a feeding tube question in the middle of the night, it\u2019s really helpful that there might be another mom awake, maybe in Australia, who knows the answer,\u201d she noted. The kids themselves can get lonely as the only person in their circle with a feeding tube. It has become common for parents to reach out on Facebook, asking for pictures, so that their children can see that they are not alone.It\u2019s not that I care about my personal privacy. I\u2019m boring. It is about what Facebook is allowing to happen with the data it has on millions of boring people like me.But if things don\u2019t get fixed, there is something every boring person still on Facebook should start thinking about doing, in particular those who have formed vital support groups. Recognize the powerful thing you have created. Start figuring out the best replacement where your group can congregate \u2014 a lifeboat, if you will. Once that lifeboat is in place, take a stand, band together and jump ship.It\u2019s not that we need Facebook. We just need one another.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Can Facebook Develop a Conscience?", "Date": "2018-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMr. Cohen is the author of \u201cThe Know-It-Alls: The Rise of Silicon Valley as a Political Powerhouse and Social Wrecking Ball.\u201dThat the questioning of Mark Zuckerberg on Tuesday by two full Senate committees was considered a triumph for Mr. Zuckerberg \u2014 he made $3 billion personally as Facebook stock shot up during his testimony \u2014 shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. This was an unfair fight between a man who knew intimately the project being debated and a lot of people who didn\u2019t.The occasion for his Senate hearing, and his appearance in the House on Wednesday, was a data breach that allowed a British political consulting firm working for the Trump campaign to gain access to 87 million Facebook profiles, but as the questioning unfolded Mr. Zuckerberg behaved as if he were the only competent one in the room.When Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, asked, \u201cWould you agree that users should be able to access all of their information?\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg seemed confused: \u201cSenator, we have already a \u2018download your information\u2019 tool that allows people to see and to take out all of the information that Facebook \u2014 that they\u2019ve put into Facebook or that Facebook knows about them. So, yes, I agree with that. We already have that.\u201dSimilarly, when Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, asked, \u201cAre you going to go back to work on giving me a greater right to erase my data?\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg again appeared perplexed, saying, \u201cSenator, you can already delete all the data that\u2019s there.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg has been winning these unfair fights going on 15 years now. The idea that he\u2019s the Computer Guy and we are the helpless office workers in his way exemplifies the attitude of Facebook and Silicon Valley more broadly.The allegation that Mr. Zuckerberg stole the idea was fought in court and ended in a settlement that netted the Winklevosses and Mr. Narenda cash and company stock worth tens of millions of dollars. Mr. Zuckerberg plowed ahead under a new paradigm, later defined by Matt Welsh, Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s computer science professor at Harvard, as \u201cNerds win.\u201dIn the past, Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s talents could only be a tool for richer and better-connected peers like the Winklevosses, who would provide the money and define the purpose of the project. By the mid-2000s, however, Mr. Zuckerberg could turn the tables.At the time of the talk, Mr. Zuckerberg estimated that Google had 250 million page views a day, with thousands of machines and 5,000 employees, while Facebook had significantly more page views (400 million), hundreds of machines and just barely 50 employees.By then, Larry Page and Sergey Brin had already given up control of Google as the price for venture capital to keep the project running, agreeing to an outside chief executive, as investors had insisted. To this day, Mr. Zuckerberg retains majority control over Facebook and remains its chief executive \u2014 his decisions about regulation, privacy and transparency can mean happiness or misery for the more than two billion citizens of Facebook nation \u2014 majestic powers that are enshrined when you check the right box on the terms of service agreement.Peter Thiel, the first outside investor in Facebook and a longtime adviser to Mr. Zuckerberg, sees a founder-led tech start-up as something like an independent cell that can help drive social change. \u201cA start-up,\u201d he writes in his book, \u201cZero to One,\u201d \u201cis the largest endeavor over which you can have definite mastery. You can have agency not just over your own life, but over a small and important part of the world.\u201dIn these extraordinary times, we are learning how society changes when it is in the hands of power-drunk engineers. Products and services are delivered much more reliably and efficiently. We are able to communicate quickly, directly, widely. But there are serious problems, too, and they are far more serious than even critics realized at first.To start, these Silicon Valley titans are in denial about history. They pride themselves on not bending to what has come before. Is there racism and sexism in the United States? Didn\u2019t happen on my watch! Computers don\u2019t see sex or color. When pressed by the few senators of color about Facebook\u2019s complicity in running real estate ads aimed exclusively at white people, which would violate the Fair Housing Act, Mr. Zuckerberg defined this as a particularly compelling challenge for artificial intelligence software.Ads can no longer be explicitly targeted to racial groups, he said, though, of course, the rub is that there are plenty of surrogates for race that advertisers can presumably still use. This led to the absurd observation from Mr. Zuckerberg, in response to a question from Senator Mazie Hirono, Democrat of Hawaii, that \u201cmost of the enforcement today is still that our community flags issues for us when that comes up.\u201d How the community can identify when a real estate ad is appearing only to white people remains a mystery.Notably, there was no declaration from Mr. Zuckerberg about the pain of racial inequality, nor an apology for Facebook\u2019s role in perpetuating it. To Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, he simply said, \u201cI\u2019m not happy with where we are.\u201d There is an unhealthy detachment \u2014 a virtualness \u2014 to the destruction caused by Silicon Valley innovations. One can\u2019t help thinking that the ability to reset or reboot a computer has infiltrated companies\u2019 calculations about the cost of disruption and destruction.Despite the length of Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s Senate appearance, there was no serious reckoning with what happened in the 2016 election. Instead, there was an insistent focus on the future, which for Mr. Zuckerberg was synonymous with one phrase, \u201cA.I.\u201d In five to 10 years, he promised, artificial intelligence will clean up the mess that is Facebook in 2018.The problems with Facebook emerge from its lack of a human touch, but Mr. Zuckerberg doubles down on software. On Wednesday, Representative David McKinley, a West Virginia Republican, displayed recent Facebook ads offering opioids for sale without a prescription and addressed Mr. Zuckerberg directly. \u201cFacebook is actually enabling an illegal activity, and in so doing you are hurting people,\u201d he said. \u201cWould you agree with that statement?\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s response was to concede things were bad but to hold out the promise of the future. \u201cWe need to build more A.I. tools that can proactively find that content,\u201d he said.As long as the discussion was about software \u2014 how it works, how it can be improved, how users interact with it \u2014 Mr. Zuckerberg holds the upper hand. When the discussion is about values, he is as confused as the rest of us, and takes refuge in the belief that society is nothing more than a series of market-based online interactions, as captured, absorbed and understood by engineers.Government regulation, in this scheme, is a product of a corrupt, inefficient political system; self-regulation, on the other hand, is a product of people voting with their actions and brilliant engineers devising solutions to meet their needs. A smug interpretation that Mr. Zuckerberg outwitted dopey legislators only plays into the Silicon Valley view that being called before Congress to answer questions is a bug of our democracy, instead of a vital feature.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Says Cambridge Analytica Harvested Data of Up to 87 Million Users", "Date": "2018-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMark Zuckerberg, the company\u2019s chief executive, also announced that Facebook would offer all of its users the same tools and controls required under European privacy rules. The European rules, which go into effect next month, give people more control over how companies use their digital data.Facebook had not previously disclosed how many accounts had been harvested by Cambridge Analytica, the firm connected to the Trump campaign. It has also been reluctant to disclose how it was used by Russian-backed actors to influence the 2016 presidential election.Among Facebook\u2019s acknowledgments on Wednesday was the disclosure of a vulnerability in its search and account recovery functions that it said could have exposed \u201cmost\u201d of its 2 billion users to having their public profile information harvested.The new effort to appear more transparent about the data leaks \u2014 including a rare question-and-answer session with Mr. Zuckerberg and reporters \u2014 came just before Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s expected testimony next week on Capitol Hill, where he will most likely face criticism over how the company collects and shares the personal data of its users. Sheryl Sandberg, Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s top deputy, has several national television interviews scheduled for later this week.The company said that on Monday it would start telling users whether their information may have been shared with Cambridge Analytica.Andy Stone, a spokesman for Facebook in Washington, said the 87 million figure was an estimate of the total number of users whose data could have been acquired by Cambridge Analytica. He said that the estimate was calculated by adding up all the friends of the people who had logged into the Facebook app from which Cambridge Analytica collected profile data.\u201cWe wanted to put out the maximum number of people who could have been affected,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg told reporters.It remains unclear exactly how many users had their personal information accessed by Cambridge Analytica. The firm said Wednesday that it had licensed data for no more than 30 million users of the social network.The company also said it would limit the types of data that can be harvested by software used by outside businesses. The changes mean that users will have to give permission before an app can collect information beyond their names and addresses.The company also said it would no longer allow outsiders to use apps to gather information about the religious or political views of its users. And it will stop using third-party data from companies such as Experian and Acxiom to help supplement its own data for ad targeting.\u201cIt\u2019s clear now that we didn\u2019t focus enough on preventing abuse,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t take a broad enough view of what our responsibility is. That was a huge mistake, and it was my mistake.\u201dThe Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether Facebook violated a 2011 agreement meant to protect users\u2019 privacy. User data is crucial to the company\u2019s business, because it is used to deliver advertising to users.Mr. Zuckerberg is scheduled to testify about the company\u2019s handling of sensitive user data before the Senate\u2019s Commerce and Judiciary committees on Tuesday and the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday.\u201cThis hearing will be an important opportunity to shed light on critical consumer data privacy issues,\u201d said Representatives Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon, and Frank Pallone, Democrat of New Jersey, of the House committee.Senator Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said, \u201cWith all of the data exchanged over Facebook and other platforms, users deserve to know how their information is shared and secured.\u201dFacebook\u2019s problems stretch back before the reports about Cambridge Analytica, to earlier investigations into how Russian actors infiltrated the platform by placing ads and posts to influence the 2016 election. Mr. Zuckerberg initially dismissed the idea of foreign interference on Facebook as a \u201ccrazy idea.\u201dSince then, the company has been the focus of investigations by law enforcement and congressional committees that are delving into the Russian influence campaign. Facebook now acknowledges that its platform was used to sway voters.All those troubles have prompted investors to flee the company, and its stock has fallen sharply in recent weeks.In response, the company has put its executives front and center.And Ms. Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer and the second most recognizable face at the company, is set to be interviewed this week by Fox News, \u201cPBS NewsHour,\u201d NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show and Bloomberg. Ms. Sandberg will be interviewed remotely from California.Facebook said its new openness was meant to show that it takes the intense criticism over its handling of user data seriously.In Washington, Facebook employees and public relations firms retained by the company have talked to regulators and congressional staff members about new privacy measures, including updates to policies that are intended to make them easier to understand.On Wednesday, Mr. Zuckerberg provided a preview of what he will tell Congress next week. He said Facebook was \u201can idealistic and optimistic company.\u201dBut he acknowledged that the company had committed serious errors by not ensuring that robust safeguards were in place for users.Asked if he should still be leading the company, he said, \u201cYes. Life is about learning from the mistakes and learning what you need to go forward.\u201dTerrell McSweeny, a Democratic member of the Federal Trade Commission, said that Mr. Zuckerberg has a big task ahead of him in Washington.\u201cI think it is important for Zuckerberg to clearly explain how Facebook plans to earn back consumer trust,\u201d Ms. McSweeny said. \u201cConsumers need reassurance that their data are not being misused.\u201dAn earlier version of this article attributed incorrectly an estimate that 50 million Facebook users\u2019 personal information may have been improperly shared during the 2016 election. The estimate was based on documents and former Cambridge Analytica employees and associates. It did not come from Facebook.Matthew Rosenberg contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

We spoke with him about his priorities in the coming months, and then asked him questions posed by our readers. His responses have been condensed and lightly edited.NYT: What\u2019s the first issue you\u2019ll focus on?ENG: The big thing is really communication. Riders feel like they haven\u2019t been heard. They also want real-time communication from us, not only with our daily service but also on incidents, the status of the incident and the actual cause of the incident. We also need to make sure we have people in our key hubs who can talk to our customers and give them the answers that they need.NYT: You commute to Queens from Smithtown on the L.I.R.R. What are other problems you\u2019ve personally experienced that you\u2019d like to fix?ENG: Cleanliness. That means doing better with the appearance of our stations, with the cleanliness of the trains and the bathrooms. Also, crowded cars. That might mean schedule adjustments, and it might be taking a look at how many trains can run and how many cars we can put on the train.John Sadocha of East Norwich asks: I commute five days per week, and the L.I.R.R. is the worst part of my day.

{"Headline": "A Cousin of the Martini, the Alaska, Strikes Gold", "Date": "2018-04-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySometimes you want a martini. And sometimes you want something like a martini, but are not sure exactly what.That second, uncertain feeling appears to be benefiting an old cocktail. The Alaska is a gin drink, like the martini, but instead of dry vermouth, it calls for yellow Chartreuse, the intensely herbal French liqueur, and sometimes orange bitters. Over the last year or so, it has shown up on bar menus in San Francisco, Chicago, Minneapolis, Houston, Boston and New York.\u201cI feel like, when you\u2019re putting a menu together, there\u2019s not a lot in the way of martini variations,\u201d said Mr. Waugh, the director of bar operations. \u201cA lot of people look to the Alaska as one of the more approachable variations. It\u2019s just obscure enough, but not too obscure.\u201dThe Alaska is roughly a century old, first appearing in cocktail manuals in the 1910s. How the drink got its name is not known, but Alaska was a hot news topic then, becoming a United States territory in 1912. Also, the drink is golden, like the ore famously mined there during many rushes.Never terribly renowned, the Alaska nonetheless became one of the \u201cforgotten classics\u201d celebrated by young cocktail bartenders in the early years of the recent cocktail revival. Its chief attractions were its two main ingredients, gin and yellow Chartreuse, liquors that the new generation of mixologists strenuously championed.She did this two ways: by stocking more than 90 gins, and by mixing the spirit into a host of cocktails, both celebrated and less so, like the Alaska. \u201cI think people sometimes think gin is useless unless it ends up in a martini or gin and tonic.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fun to see how different bottles of yellow Chartreuse play differently, depending on how they aged over the years,\u201d said Micah Melton, the beverage director of the Aviary and the Office.\u201cUsing Old Tom, the Alaska \u2014 which I\u2019d always thought of as a nice, sharp, boozy variant of the martini \u2014 had a softness, harmony and complexity that was truly surprising,\u201d he said.At Our Fathers, there may be one more reason people order the Alaska, and it has nothing to do with how it tastes. \u201cIt\u2019s the second cocktail on the list,\u201d Ms. Quigley said. \u201cIt\u2019s alphabetical.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where to Find Bangkok\u2019s Best Street Food While You Can", "Date": "2018-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPursuitsWill the city ban its famed street food offerings? It\u2019s unclear. In the meantime, a quest to find the best fishball noodle stands and much more. It was a few minutes after 6 p.m., and Lim Lao Sa, a fishball noodle stand tucked into an alleyway near the Chao Phraya River in Bangkok, had just opened. Rain was falling, hard. A series of deftly arranged tarps sheltered patrons sitting on red plastic stools at a handful of tables. Water drizzled off the tarp edges, down the concrete walls and past exposed wiring. Fluorescent bulbs cast harsh shadows. Lim Lao Sa\u2019s owners \u2014 a brother and sister who\u2019d inherited the 60-year-old business from their father \u2014 bickered vigorously. In fact, given all of this \u2014 the setting, the food, the feeling that Lim Lao Sa could be washed away in an instant, by a bad mood or even worse weather \u2014 I decided that Lim Lao Sa was the platonic ideal of street food. And it was precisely why I\u2019d come to Bangkok. I wasn\u2019t going to take a chance. If Bangkok\u2019s ad hoc restaurants were threatened \u2014 not only by clean-sidewalk-loving governments but, just as seriously, by gentrification and changing tastes \u2014 I had to go before it was too late. In July, I flew to Bangkok for a week of eating nothing but street food.Pretty much immediately, I learned that street food was a term with many definitions. Now, Ms. Songvisava said, profit margins rule. \u201cThey just buy everything from the factory, use industrial processed food,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of seasoning and MSG involved to produce the food because people doesn\u2019t complain.\u201d \u201cThis is like a good five to 10 kilometers from where the original was,\u201d said Ms. Nualkhair. \u201cSo the people who used to eat these guys\u2019 food wouldn\u2019t come here on a regular basis with this special trip.\u201d Only a few vendors in all of Bangkok, she estimated, cooked well enough that people would follow them to new locations. That picture grew more complex over the next few days. In the mornings, I\u2019d leave Vincent\u2019s apartment in search of coffee \u2014 and more often than not would return with a baggie of sticky rice and skewers of sweet, fatty grilled pork from the moo-ping cart stationed outside his front door. (Vincent lives near a university, so there\u2019s a steady flow of hungry, frugal students. Some things never change.) For Mr. Turner, street food was not necessarily defined by mobility. \u201cThe necessity,\u201d he said, \u201cis that it\u2019s convenient, at a price that people are willing to pay.\u201dHis definition \u2014 which will no doubt enrage certain corners of the internet \u2014 opened up what I could consider street food to include Bangkok\u2019s shophouse restaurants: boxy, frill-free dining rooms where the cooking is done up front, in a kitchen that\u2019s often little more than an elaborate, sedentary cart. Such was the case at Sai Kaew, the duck noodle shop Mr. Turner brought me to.\u201cIn the beginning, I worked full-time in an office like most Thais,\u201d said Sai Kaew\u2019s owner, Ruengchai Chartmongkoljaroen. Thirty years ago, however, he quit his job to push a cart. He set up 10 tables on sidewalk space he\u2019d rented in front of a building, walked his cart in circles to attract attention, and of course worked on his recipes, developing the condiment that became his calling card: light, crunchy, slippery boiled duck intestines, or sai kaew. (Excellent with a slather of his vibrant green hot sauce, and a worthy foil for the sweetly rich duck.) The price for a bowl in 1987: 10 baht, or about 40 cents at the time.\u201cDay 1, we opened from 12 p.m. to 2 a.m.,\u201d he said. \u201cWe sold half a duck.\u201dBusiness improved, but even so, he pushed the cart for 16 years before parking it at this shophouse, where on a good day he and his two daughters, who\u2019ve learned the business from childhood will go through \u201c50 big ducks.\u201d Though his duck noodles are now well known, the price remains right: Lunch for two was 160 baht, or less than $5.Even Pritipal Singh Sirikumar, whose stand selling crisp, yummy samosas was founded by his father some 50 years ago, dreamed of moving from his open-air nook \u2014 about the size of a couch \u2014 at the corner of a Chinatown soi. He said it would be to have his own shophouse. \u201cThen we can put in tables and chairs. We can serve more customers. I will serve lassi.\u201dMr. Sirikumar\u2019s sentiments were echoed by people like Pongsuang Kunprasop, known as Note, a friend I hadn\u2019t seen in a decade but who refused to eat street food with me. \u201cBeen sharing sidewalks with rats and cockroach at night for all my life,\u201d he wrote in an email.Over the course of a week, I did not see much vermin, nor did I fall ill. (I did carry charcoal pills, a gift from Ms. Songvisava and Mr. Jones, said to counteract food poisoning.) But I also came to appreciate the appeal of air-conditioning, and to understand that the romance attached to the cart, by Thais as well as Westerners, does not always mesh with reality. \u201cPrecariousness is the new status quo,\u201d Ms. Nualkhair of Bangkok Glutton wrote via Facebook. \u201cThe uncertainty alone is enough to move ppl out of town.\u201dAt the same time, street food is a long way from its demise. For every tale I heard of police clearing vendors away, I found a bamee moodaeng stall making its own noodles or heard the late-morning call of a wandering vendor selling curries and fermented rice noodles. However endangered street food is, pursuing it remains an eye-opening way to discover a city like Bangkok. One morning, Rattama Pongponrat, known as Pom, an ebullient culinary consultant and former curator at Museum Siam, led me on a daylong binge, from a breakfast of toast with coconut jam to a sidewalk stand selling noodles with atypically thick slices of offal. There was fried chicken piled atop metal tables. There was glorious mango ice cream from a dinky corner shop. And there was Ms. Pongponrat, overjoyed at it all. When the sun was high, we strode through the shaded alleyways of Chinatown, past tropical fruits pickled in chilies, batter-fried squid roe with a spicy-sweet sauce \u2014 until, finally, we burst out onto a bridge where Ms. Pongponrat had hoped to find one particular vendor. Instead, the bridge had been entirely cleared.\u201cOh, my God, it\u2019s all gone!\u201d Ms. Pongponrat shouted. \u201cI never knew it was a bridge. I\u2019ve never seen this before in my life.\u201d She began swearing, then looked up at a well-tended four-story building, yellow with green shutters, the crisp style at once Chinese and Neo-Classical. \u201cWhat a beautiful building,\u201d she said in wonder. Then we plunged back into the fray to find another snack.Chinatown is an excellent place to begin, for its density of talented vendors and for the official protection they enjoy (at least for the moment). Yaowarat Road is the heart of its street-food zone \u2014 think rolled rice noodles with crispy pork belly, or sweet boiled lotus root on crushed ice \u2014 but if you wander a little farther afield, you\u2019ll encounter the fishball-noodle stand Lim Lao Sa (on Song Wat Road near Trok Saphan Yuan), Natthapon Coconut Ice Cream (on Phraeng Phuthon Road), and the high-end drinking-food restaurant Err (394/35 Maha Rat Road; errbkk.com). For a stroll through not-yet-gentrified Bangkok, take the Sky Train to Udom Suk station and head down Sukhumvit Road soi 103, through numerous vendors crowding the sidewalk. (Try them!) To the left, in the marketplace, is a bamee moodaeng stall that makes its own excellent noodles, and a few blocks northeast is Sai Kaew, the duck noodle soup shop.To see another way street food is evolving, check out Talad Ruam Sab, known as the Lunch Market, across Asok Road (Sukhumvit soi 21) from Srinakharinwirot University. There you\u2019ll find dozens of tiny stalls serving everything from sweet braised pig\u2019s leg to fiery crab curry with fermented rice noodles. Bring friends, stake out space at a communal table, and order promiscuously.Finally, there is the Michelin guide, whose Bangkok edition includes 28 street-food vendors (all in shophouses, technically). Find it online at guide.michelin.com/th/en/bangkok.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the organization that announced it would ban street food vendors.

Poles are de-boogered. Seats are left sparkling.Welcome to the New York City Transit Corona Maintenance Facility, where subway cars come to be deep-cleaned.\u201cYou see that shine coming through?\u201d asked Corey Skinner, a cleaner, on a recent morning while scrubbing rust off the doors of a 7 train. \u201cWe call that bright work. We take a lot of pride in that.\u201dI recently traveled to the transit depot to answer a question that has been on my mind since my very first subway ride: How does the M.T.A. clean the subway cars?The process, I found out, demands tenacity, a full body suit and gallons upon gallons of Fabuloso.Mr. Skinner, 47, walked us through the steps. We watched as he wiped windows, scraped gum, erased graffiti and cleaned dancers\u2019 footprints off the ceiling \u2014 with care and special tools.\u201cThe doors are like wood,\u201d he said as he carefully polished them with a Doodlebug scrub brush and a Chicopee wipe. \u201cYou got to get into the grain of the door, so it pulls up all the rust and corrosion.\u201dOur eyes began to water.\u201cThat\u2019s the bleach,\u201d he said.

We even grabbed a polished pole, without worry, for the first time.It takes three and a half hours for a cleaner, working alone, to get a subway car this clean, Mr. Skinner told us.It\u2019s solitary work, done overnight, he said, and it can sometimes feel like a Sisyphean task.\u201cI take the 7 train to work, so a lot of times I see what I\u2019m about to get,\u201d he said.The train he was polishing was almost ready. Before it returned to the city\u2019s greasy tangle of tracks, he took a moment to walk us though the cars and admire his handiwork.\u201cI love that smell,\u201d he said.Here\u2019s what else is happening:You\u2019ll also be getting a wash: on again off again showers are on tap today.The rain continues through tomorrow afternoon, when the sun will finally reappear and bump the mercury up to 61.You now know how to clean a subway car, but what about your apartment?With spring in the air, it\u2019s time to rotate your mattress, empty out your refrigerator and face those really tough decluttering decisions.

{"Headline": "In a Proudly Diverse Australia, White People Still Run Almost Everything", "Date": "2018-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 Australia prides itself on its fairness and multiculturalism. But wander through Sydney\u2019s corporate towers or Canberra\u2019s halls of Parliament, and you\u2019ll notice that Australia\u2019s power structure is overwhelmingly white, nowhere near as diverse as the country at large.That gap between self-image and reality is the focus of a new report released early Wednesday by the Australian Human Rights Commission, which scrutinized the backgrounds of more than 2,400 senior leaders across business, government and academia.It found, in simple terms, that white Australians with European roots still run nearly everything.\u201cAlthough those who have non-European and Indigenous backgrounds make up an estimated 24 percent of the Australian population, such backgrounds account for only 5 percent of senior leaders,\u201d the report states. \u201cPut another way, about 95 percent of senior leaders in Australia have an Anglo-Celtic or European background.\u201dThe report \u2014 the government\u2019s most comprehensive study of Australia\u2019s multicultural identity to date \u2014 reveals a country opening to the world but still resisting equality. Even with an immigration system that prioritizes the highly skilled, and even as the children of immigrants outperform, on average, the children of Australian-born parents in school, Australia\u2019s racial and ethnic realities remain stuck in place.The Australian government, in particular, looks much as it did in the 1960s, before the end of the White Australia policy, which restricted nonwhite immigration.Among Australia\u2019s federal and state government department heads, the homogeneity is even more pronounced: 99 percent of the leadership is Anglo-Celtic or European.\u201cThe statistics are frankly dismal,\u201d said Tim Soutphommasane, Australia\u2019s race discrimination commissioner and the lead author of the report. \u201cThese are not what you\u2019d expect from one of the world\u2019s greatest multicultural countries.\u201dDr. Soutphommasane, a political philosopher with a Ph.D from the University of Oxford who was born in France and raised in Sydney, said the new report goes beyond a 2016 study that first tried to assess multiculturalism in the country. Researchers went beyond the chief executive level, for example, to look at those who might be on the rise in Australian corporations.Dr. Soutphommasane (pronounced Soot-pom-ma-sarn) said he had hoped that would show greater diversity. But the second corporate tier was nearly as homogeneous as the first.\u201cTime alone isn\u2019t going to lead to significant change,\u201d he said.Rather, the report says, Australia needs to confront the fact that its promise of egalitarianism faces barriers like prejudice.Australia could start by collecting data more rigorously, Dr. Soutphommasane and other scholars argue. It has already mandated more reporting around gender, and race and ethnicity could follow. Such questions could be incorporated into the census, and employers could be required to report diversity statistics, much as American companies with more than 100 employees do.Many of those who have broken through Australia\u2019s barriers to reach senior positions argue that more also needs to be done at human and institutional levels.Dr. Anne Aly, one of few members of Parliament from a non-European background (she was born in Egypt), said that Australia\u2019s political leaders needed to become more comfortable with being challenged about their biases and cultural blind spots \u2014 and with the fact that Australia is more a part of Asia than Europe.She added that political parties and the Australian news media needed to be more inclusive of non-European voices, and not just on issues like immigration or crime.\u201cYou get pushed into these conversations about language and immigration and population levels because they\u2019re the only conversations we\u2019re included in \u2014 the problem conversations,\u201d she said.Without diversity in broader discussions, she added, \u201cWhat you end up with are policies that marginalize and exclude a significant part of the population.\u201dSome business leaders argue for a less confrontational approach.Vivek Bhatia, the chief executive of the Australia and New Zealand operations of QBE Insurance, said he sees measuring diversity in positions of power as just the first stage of a evolution.\u201cDiversity is being invited to the party,\u201d he said. \u201cInclusiveness is being asked to dance.\u201dDr. Soutphommasane said that progress could ultimately depend on deeper connections and conversations.Part of the reason there has been so little progress in Australia, he said, is that the country \u2014 like many others \u2014 is still learning to talk about differences, biases and how to incorporate multiculturalism into its national identity.\u201cThe default for many Australians is still colorblindness,\u201d he said, \u201can insistence that we don\u2019t see ethnic or racial difference and moreover we should not point out ethnic or racial difference \u2014 and that stifles examination and prevents Australians from taking more muscular action on multiculturalism.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t quite have the language or sophistication to talk about this with tact and sensitivity,\u201d he added.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New Restaurant, Frenchette, Stands Up for Natural Wines", "Date": "2018-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe PourFrenchette, in TriBeCa, has been one of the most eagerly anticipated restaurants in New York this spring, and why not?It\u2019s easy to imagine a wine list for this crowd: vintage Champagne and high-end Burgundy for moneyed customers, a few rare bottles to demonstrate the reach and influence of the sommelier, some big names in Bordeaux and Napa Valley for the trophy and status hunters, and a nod to the Loire Valley for those who have been to the Paris wine bars.In short, a list just like those at dozens of other popular restaurants, with bottles that are the wine drinkers\u2019 equivalent of comfort foods \u2014 akin to a menu of hamburgers, salmon and boneless chicken breasts.Many of the 300 bottles or so on the list may indeed be distinctive and excellent, but they are also relentlessly obscure, with characteristics that some people may find surprising, and occasionally even appalling.Rather than lard the list with expensive wines, as so many high-end restaurants do, Frenchette has devoted much of its lineup to the extremely reasonable $50- to $85-a-bottle range. That is still a lot to pay for wine, perhaps, but well below the Manhattan destination-restaurant norm, in which the wine list is often used as a cash cow to subsidize other parts of the operation.But Mr. Riera will have a lot of explaining to do, introducing producers and regions that will largely be unknown to people, no matter how well versed they may be in Burgundy, Barolo or Napa Valley.\u201cI did that on purpose,\u201d Mr. Riera said. \u201cIt\u2019s meant to stimulate a conversation about wine and go from there.\u201dThe idea, he said, is to eliminate preconceptions that people may have about how a wine ought to taste, creating the potential for discovery and surprise.\u201cIt\u2019s the same thing I did at Wildair and Contra,\u201d he said. \u201cI was able to delve deeper in this list, expand in areas where I couldn\u2019t before due to size and budget restrictions.\u201dIt\u2019s an idealistic notion. When you don\u2019t know exactly what to expect from a wine, you can experience it at an exhilarating level of intensity.It reminds me a bit of dining at one of the temples of molecular gastronomy, like the now departed WD-50, where the chef Wylie Dufresne famously served an oyster flattened into something resembling a marble tile. To eat it was like mystery evolving into delight, as flavors long taken for granted were rediscovered, as if for the first time.\u201cWe\u2019ve worked with Jorge before, and we\u2019ve been big fans of his as a natural wine Yoda,\u201d Mr. Hanson said. \u201cPersonally, my best wine experiences are just sitting with him and drinking whatever he\u2019s pouring.\u201dFor Frenchette, the decision to focus on natural wines had little to do with marketing or the bottom line, its principals say, and all to do with food and atmosphere.\u201cIf we\u2019re going to cook traditional food, slightly more contemporary, lightened up just a touch, it would pair better with a more contemporary, which is really to say a more ancient, approach to winemaking,\u201d Mr. Nasr said. \u201cI think it makes sense, and maybe people can get on board with a sense of discovery. It\u2019s supposed to be fun and provocative to a degree, but in a pleasurable way.\u201dIn both the food and the wine, Mr. Nasr said, the intent was to create a feeling of lightness: slightly smaller portions, clarity and precision, that will not leave guests waking up the next morning feeling hung over from either the food or the wine.As for the prices, Mr. Nasr said it was a conscious decision to rein them in, particularly for the wine.\u201cWe\u2019re not building a trophy restaurant,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been a cook pretty much my whole life, and $200 bottles are not something I really purchase.\u201dMr. Hanson said the selection of less expensive, lower-alcohol wines encourages a progression over the course of a meal, \u201ca cocktail, maybe a couple of $50 bottles rather than one $200 power bomb.\u201dBut more often, Mr. Riera has selected producers who, whether because of an independent streak or because their wines don\u2019t conform to a perceived norm, work outside the appellation system. On this list, Cornas and St.-Aubin are the exceptions to the more frequent Vins de France, a catchall category that has gained credibility as more producers have come to rely on the reputation of their own names rather than their regions. He also has more wines from Auvergne, a mountainous region in central France not known for viticulture, than I have ever seen anywhere.\u201cThey\u2019re all family farms, working by hand, no herbicides or pesticides, low yields, minimal sulfur or none,\u201d Mr. Riera said. \u201cFarming is the most important thing, and I think what the vines produce, beautiful, positive mineral energy. It\u2019s just a nutritious drink, the way wine should be.\u201dIn a small grace note, Arnaud Erhart, the proprietor of the influential 360 restaurant, is working the floor at Frenchette. He closed 360 in 2007 and, with his wife, Tania Puell, moved to Vieques, P.R., to run a diving business. Vieques was badly hit by Hurricane Maria last year, and the area is still recovering. So Mr. Erhart, who said he still has to pay his bills there, will be at Frenchette for the foreseeable future.It\u2019s a long way from Red Hook for Mr. Erhart and for natural wines.An earlier version of this article misidentified a wine region in Spain.

But Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s comments suggest he still doesn\u2019t get it: What matters is not whether internet companies \u201cdeserve\u201d our private information but why we as consumers do not have meaningful ways to protect that data from being siphoned for sale in the first place.The American government has done little to help us in this regard. The Federal Trade Commission merely requires internet companies to have a privacy policy available for consumers to see. A company can change that policy whenever it wants as long as it says it is doing so. As a result, internet companies have been taking our personal property \u2014 our private information \u2014 while hiding this fact behind lengthy and coercive legalese and cumbersome \u201copt out\u201d processes.The European Union, however, is handling the problem differently. Starting in May, its General Data Protection Regulation will go into effect in its 28 member nations. The regulation is powerful in its simplicity: It ensures that consumers own their private information and thus have the right to control its usage and that internet companies have an obligation to give consumers the tools to exercise that control.The European rules, for instance, require companies to provide a plain-language description of their information-gathering practices, including how the data is used, as well as have users explicitly \u201copt in\u201d to having their information collected. The rules also give consumers the right to see what information about them is being held, and the ability to have that information erased.Why don\u2019t we have similar protections in the United States? We almost did. In 2016, the Federal Communications Commission imposed similar requirements on the companies that provide internet service, forcing them to offer an explicit \u201copt in\u201d for having personal data collected, and to protect the information that was collected.This didn\u2019t last. Internet service providers like Comcast and AT&T and companies that use their connections, like Facebook and Google, lobbied members of Congress. Congress passed a law this year, signed by President Trump, that not only repealed the protections but also prohibited the F.C.C. from ever again imposing such safeguards. The same coalition of corporate interests succeeded in discouraging California from passing a state privacy law similar to the 2016 F.C.C. requirements.Fortunately, the European Union\u2019s law should indirectly help Americans somewhat. In only a few weeks, Facebook, Google and all the other internet companies that collect our private information will have to allow European customers the protections these companies have fought to deny Americans. In an interconnected world where digital code doesn\u2019t respect the geographical or national borders, this will surely have a positive global impact.Internet companies are preparing for a future in which regardless of where a website is based, if it is visited by even a single European Union citizen and if it seeks to collect that person\u2019s data, it must provide that person the protections of the General Data Protection Regulation. Hopefully, this experience will show these companies that protecting privacy is simply the responsible thing to do, not the end of their business.The United States government has a lot of explaining to do. Why is it that American internet companies such as Facebook and Google are required to provide privacy protections when doing business with European consumers but are free to not provide such protections for Americans? Why is it that Americans\u2019 best privacy hope is the secondary effect of interconnected networks rather than privacy protections designed for Americans? Why shouldn\u2019t Americans also be given meaningful tools to protect their privacy?Congress is now considering bipartisan legislation that responds to the problem of Russian targeted political advertising on social media by adding the requirement, long applied to broadcast advertising, that those websites disclose who is paying for their advertisements. But as well intentioned as that step may be, it addresses only a symptom of the problem of the extensive surveillance of Americans, not the root of the problem.The New World must learn from the Old World. The internet economy has made our personal data a corporate commodity. The United States government must return control of that information to its owners.Tom Wheeler, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission from 2013 to 2017, is a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution and a fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School.Advertisement"}

Amazon has 560,000 employees, and the company added 130,000 jobs in 2017 alone. For context, that means that Amazon added more than a Facebook\u2019s worth of employees during every quarter last year.The company also disclosed, for the first time, the number of Prime subscribers it has: more than 100 million. Those members bought five billion items in 2017, making it the company\u2019s biggest year on record.Other notable findings from Mr. Bezos\u2019 letter:\u25a0 Amazon doesn\u2019t allow PowerPoint slides during meetings. \u201cInstead, we write narratively structured six-page memos,\u201d then silently read them before meetings begin, Mr. Bezos wrote.\u25a0 Mr. Bezos spent a lot of time talking about his standards \u2014 specifically, high ones. \u201cI believe high standards are domain specific,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand that you have to learn high standards separately in every arena of interest.\u201d He continued: \u201cYou can consider yourself a person of high standards in general and still have debilitating blind spots.\u201d\u25a0 Mr. Bezos gave updates on Amazon\u2019s acquisition of Whole Foods, and said Amazon was working on ways to \u201crecognize Prime members\u201d at Whole Foods checkout counters, which sounds both exciting and extremely creepy.\u25a0 Mr. Bezos took inspiration from an unlikely source \u2014 a \u201chandstand coach\u201d who helped a friend of his learn how to do a full handstand. The coach, he wrote, warned his friend that realistically, she would need to spend six months practicing. The story taught him that \u201cto achieve high standards yourself or as part of a team, you need to form and proactively communicate realistic beliefs about how hard something is going to be.\u201dA few other tech stories of note this week:Advertisement"}

The actions have weighed on the stock prices of large international corporations, and if implemented, could hurt their bottom lines.But global companies mostly have not detailed the potential impact of Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policies. Will that now change? With first-quarter earnings imminent, and tensions with China escalating, shareholders may want companies to make specific disclosures. The companies may be tempted to say little. After all, Mr. Trump\u2019s trade restrictions have merely been threatened, and may not occur if deals are struck. But in the past, companies have refreshed their outlooks in the face of circumstantial economic and geopolitical events, like the Gulf War. And investors will likely press firms to estimate the impact of a trade war and describe the measures they will take to protect their businesses.Still, the prospect of a trade war raises questions about the adequacy of corporate disclosure. Those of G.M., contained in its latest annual report, seem quite detailed. They offer quite specific warnings about the risks of doing business in China, and the company even mentions the possibility of trade agreements falling apart. But financial reports from Boeing and Apple arguably have less on potential problems in China and trade disputes.Boeing\u2019s annual report did mention tariffs and embargoes as threats. But the report, released in February, also sounded a bullish note on the global economy that now almost sounds like it was from a different era:\u201cThe long-term outlook for the industry continues to remain positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel growth: economic growth and the increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization, and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries.\u201dWill such language remain in Boeing\u2019s reports?- Peter EavisFor years, investors had a singular focus on the Federal Reserve and its plans to raise rates.Any indication that the Fed could move more aggressively than expected to tighten monetary policies and stocks would pull back.Now the Fed has company in sending jitters through the market: Trade.A one-two punch from the White House and the Fed pushed stocks on Wall Street down Friday. The S.&P. 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average both finished off more than 2 percent.Markets began to slide at the start of trading after President Trump\u2019s threat on Thursday to heap fresh tariffs on China. Investors took little comfort in statements from the administration\u2019s top economic policymakers, Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary. Both men sought to tamp down the contentious back-and-forth between the two economic giants.Comments from Mr. Powell in the early Friday afternoon added to the unease. In a speech in Chicago, Mr. Powell highlighted the strength of the United States economic recovery and gave little indication that the Fed planned to deviate from its gradual path of lifting interest rates.On WABC Radio\u2019s \u201cBernie & Sid in the Morning\u201d show, Mr. Trump said:\u201cNow we could\u2014the easiest thing for me to do would be just to close my eyes and forget it.\u201d\u201cIf I did that, I\u2019m not doing my job.

And that\u2019s what I\u2019m all about. We have to do things that other people wouldn\u2019t do.\u201dThe president also took to Twitter to defend his approach to trade policy. Mr. Trump, in a tweet, criticized both China and the World Trade Organization, saying that the Chinese \u201cget tremendous perks and advantages, especially over the U.S. Does anybody think this is fair. We were badly represented. The WTO is unfair to U.S.\u201dThat followed another early morning tweet, in which Mr. Trump boasted that the new metals tariffs he has put into effect on China and other nations had not hurt American consumers as his critics predicted.More from what a representative for China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce said:\u201cWe feel America is very arrogant. They have taken a wrong action. The result is that they will hurt themselves.\u201dThe Chinese official said that the two sides can\u2019t negotiate under the current conditions. And in an interview with Bloomberg on Friday, Larry Kudlow \u2014 who has been national economic adviser for just under a week \u2014 said he could not predict when talks would begin. He added:Earlier this year, stocks sold off after the jobs report for January showed a 2.9 percent annual increase in wages, a relatively strong rise. Investors feared that a sustained increase in earnings could prompt consumers to buy more goods and services, pushing up prices in the process. Concerns receded after February\u2019s report showed a 2.6 percent jump in wages, and March\u2019s rise of 2.7 percent is not likely to stir up more worries.The March report contained data that could do even more to quell investors\u2019 nerves over inflation. While the report revised February\u2019s gain higher to 326,000 jobs from 313,000, it sharply reduced the January figure to 176,000 from 239,000. The January revision prompted Jim Vogel, of FTN Financial, to write:\u201cThat collapsed what had been an upward slope to the last two years of payroll growth and implicitly reduced the upward pressure on wages that so many are still certain will arrive this year.\u201d\u2014 Peter EavisThe headline numbers The takeaways\u2022 \u201cThat\u2019s something I get no credit for, by the way,\u201d he says. \u201cI have been for equal opportunity in gay marriage for the last 12 or 13 years.\u201d\u2022 \u201cSee this?\u201d he says. \u201cThese are front-stabbing knives.

{"Headline": "Modern Russian Dumplings That Nod to the Past", "Date": "2018-04-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHungry City10 PhotosLast June, Luda\u2019s Dumplings, a small pelmeni shop, pitched its yellow-and-white-striped awning on Shore Parkway in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, an overpass away from the waterfront, where leafy trees hush the grumble of cars.Inside, pelmeni are cooked to order, glossed with drops of clarified butter and tumbled into cardboard boxes. Each is crimped with a doily-like fringe, the skin thin enough that you can see the shadows of its interior. The dough is supple but sturdy, not a mere diaphanous veil but offering a bite of its own.The space, once an auto-leasing office, is trim and sunny, with white walls, a concrete floor and a patch of tin ceiling. There are no tables, just a few yellow stools along a marble counter. The atmosphere is distinctly minimalist and modern in a neighborhood where restaurants often unapologetically embrace the past.But the past has a hold here, too: The owners, Eugene Tulman, who immigrated to Brooklyn from Russia as a child, and Lawrence Rafalovich, who is American-born and of Ukrainian descent, named the shop in honor of Mr. Tulman\u2019s mother, Luda.Ms. Tulman grew up in Kazakhstan, where her family \u2014 descendants of the Volga Germans invited to settle in Russia in the 18th century by Catherine the Great \u2014 was relocated by Stalin\u2019s edict during World War II. When she arrived in Brooklyn in 1996, her neighbors quickly discovered her culinary skills and began ordering her pelmeni for parties.With the help of her husband and two sons, Ms. Tulman opened two restaurants (one now under a new name and ownership, the other shuttered) and ran factories that supplied pelmeni and crepes to the tristate area. But after her death in 2012, her younger son, Eugene, grew disenchanted with how far the factories\u2019 products had strayed from his mother\u2019s original cooking.At Luda\u2019s Dumplings, where he is the chef, Eugene pledged to follow his mother\u2019s precepts \u2014 always use the freshest ingredients; mix everything by hand \u2014 if not exactly her recipe. The dough, for example, is made with organic flour and is \u201cnot as soft\u201d as with traditional pelmeni, he said; growing up in Sheepshead Bay, a historically Italian neighborhood, he fell in love with pasta and wanted the dumplings to have a texture closer to al dente.Of the six fillings available, the most robust and wintry in spirit is Siberian-style beef and pork, here grass-fed Angus beef shoulder and pastured pork butt, ground in-house and evenly split so neither lords over the other. One pierce, and the juices run.In other versions, a mash of potato and Cheddar has surprising buoyancy, and spinach, melded with feta, Parmesan and mozzarella, retains its vivid green. But pulverized shrimp loses some of its briny character, muffled by Parmesan and ricotta inside a dough stained pink by beet juice.All are enhanced by a choice of three toppings per order, among them soul-brightening dill, mushrooms chopped and saut\u00e9ed until almost duxelles and slightly carnal, and roasted garlic minced so fine, it\u2019s undetectable to the eye but an insistent imprint on the tongue.Best are pickled jalape\u00f1o slices, which give a little jump to the meal. (Higher-end toppings, for a $1 premium, include a drape of melted mozzarella, snippets of bacon and a poached egg that when slashed unleashes its caldron of yolk.)Each order comes with two sauces, for dipping or pouring. For those who hew to tradition, there\u2019s the bracing simplicity of vinegar or the velvety soft landing of sour cream, perhaps even better mixed together.More maverick are variations of sour cream spiked with, by turns, raw garlic, Sriracha, chipotle, horseradish and pickled jalape\u00f1o, each with its own clarifying flare. \u201cI know my mom would yell at me if she saw some of these things,\u201d Mr. Tulman said.Old-school pelmeni molds, looking like panels of honeycomb, hang above the counter. But Mr. Tulman shapes his pelmeni on a machine visible in the next room, built in Russia and customized with extra rollers so as not to overheat the dough when it\u2019s compressed.For dessert, there are slightly damp farmer cheese pelmeni with cocoa-infused skins, nicely muddled with sour cherries and chocolate flakes that promptly wilt into sauce. A lighter finish comes with kompot, a decidedly sweet fruit punch. It\u2019s another nod to Luda, although Mr. Tulman allows that he\u2019s been \u201cexperimenting\u201d with the likes of pineapple and mango.\u201cThings in Russia we never had,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Officials did not say whether he had regained consciousness, as Yulia Skripal did last week.Russian officials have accused Britain of denying them access to Yulia Skripal. The British government \u2014 which contends that Moscow was most likely behind the attack on Ms. Skripal and her father, a former spy \u2014 said that the choice not to meet with Russian officials, at least not yet, was hers.\u201cWe have conveyed to Ms. Skripal the Russian Embassy\u2019s offer of consular assistance,\u201d the British Foreign Office said in a statement released Thursday night. \u201cMs. Skripal is now able to choose if and when to take up this offer, but to date she has not done so.\u201d\u201cYou heard her \u2014 the phone she\u2019s using is temporary, and at the end the line strangely cuts out,\u201d she said. \u201cI think they\u2019ve asked her to call me and give a specific statement.\u201dMs. Skripal also raised doubts about why Moscow would stage such an attack. \u201cWhat\u2019s Russia\u2019s gain from this?\u201d she said. \u201cGetting the World Cup boycotted? Earning new sanctions? And with elections two weeks away? Russia gains nothing from this politically.\u201d\u201cLook, there\u2019s Chichvarkin there with plenty of money,\u201d she said. \u201cAll those businessmen who have fled to France with huge sums. Why can\u2019t he just kill them all and get all the money back to Russia? Why don\u2019t they kill anyone in America? There\u2019s even more of them there than in England.\u201dTurning to Ms. Skripal during the broadcast, Walter Litvinenko delivered a blistering tirade against the British government.\u201cYou have to go to England and demand to see that girl,\u201d he said, referring to Yulia. \u201cShe will die there. They\u2019ll simply poison her, just like they poisoned my son three times in hospital. It\u2019s very dangerous to get involved with the British.\u201d Ms. Skripal was shown nodding her head as she appeared to stare at the floor.While not an enthusiastic promoter of various Russian theories, Ms. Skripal has nonetheless added her voice to claims that Britain is involved in a cover-up. That view gained more force earlier this week when the head of the Porton Down military laboratory in Britain acknowledged that his scientists had only identified the nerve agent, not pinpointed Russia as the place where it was made.Maria Zakharova, the Russian Foreign Ministry\u2019s spokeswoman, added further grist to Russia\u2019s conspiracy mill on Friday with a post on Facebook that suggested that the Skripals\u2019 pets \u2014 two guinea pigs and a cat \u2014 had been killed by the British and then cremated to destroy evidence relating to the nerve agent used against Yulia and Sergei Skripal.\u201cOur sources indicate that BBC television company was aware that pets remained in the house, but for some reason, it concealed this information,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt would be nice to have a clarification. P.S. I\u2019m not drawing any conclusions. This might be just a coincidence. But experiments with nerve agents in Porton Down were conducted specifically on guinea pigs.\u201dBritain\u2019s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said Friday that the house had been sealed after the police recognized that the Skripals had been poisoned with a nerve agent. Regrettably, \u201ctwo guinea pigs had sadly died\u201d by the time someone entered the home to see about the animals, the statement said, and \u201ca cat was also found in a distressed state and a decision was taken by a veterinary surgeon to euthanize the animal to alleviate its suffering.\u201dViktoria Skripal said she felt like a pawn in a great power standoff, hounded nonstop by Russian and foreign journalists. She said she had been interviewed recently by a Russian television crew that claimed to have been sent by Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry, but the ministry denied any involvement.\u201cI wake up every day at 7 a.m. to at least have time to cook breakfast and wash by 9 a.m., because from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. every day, the calls don\u2019t stop,\u201d she said.One theory widely shared on Russian social media is that the Skripals were the victims of a vengeance attack by the mother of Yulia\u2019s live-in boyfriend, who reportedly has ties to Russia\u2019s security apparatus. Viktoria Skripal said that she knew nothing about the boyfriend other than he lived with Yulia and that \u201che\u2019s close to all those structures, you understand.\u201dThe couple\u2019s apartment in the town of Podolsk, just south of Moscow, seemed to have been vacated. Mail had piled up in the letter box and nobody answered the door. Neighbors said he had moved out to his dacha.President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s government has insisted that Moscow had nothing to do with the poisoning, alternately questioning whether the Skripals were really poisoned, whether a nerve agent was involved, whether it was a Novichok, whether another country might have supplied it, and whether Britain itself might have carried out the attack.The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, an international body, is examining evidence in the case. Russia has demanded that it be allowed to take part in the investigation \u2014 a suggestion that Britain has called perverse.Matthew Luxmoore reported from Yaroslavl, and Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a from London.

(Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s suit and tie almost matched the suit and tie worn by John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee.)(At the time Mr. Kudlow was wearing a blue pinstripe suit, white pocket handkerchief, and had a blue scarf knotted like an ascot around his neck.)Mr. Zuckerberg \u201cknew people would be on the lookout\u201d for the answer, said Joseph Rosenfeld, a personal style adviser who specializes in the tech world in Silicon Valley and New York, and whose clients work at companies such as Apple, Intuit and Google.This was not, of course the first time Mr. Zuckerberg has worn a suit. It\u2019s just that it is seemingly possible to count on two hands the times he has done so: always on public occasions and (not counting his wedding) always when heads of state or other dignitaries are involved. He wore a suit, for example, to address the G8 summit in France in 2011; to the state dinner for Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2015; to interview Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Facebook the same year; and to testify in a Dallas courtroom during the Oculus intellectual property trial in 2017.Much was written about his wife\u2019s wedding dress after their wedding, but there was little about his dark suit. A Facebook spokeswoman declined to comment on his choice of suit for Congress. Mr. Rosenfeld said he had no idea of the maker or whether Mr. Zuckerberg was getting outside advice. A quick survey of my colleagues who work in Silicon Valley elicited only puzzlement. But over the years Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s suits have gotten skinnier, the ties narrower, the aesthetic less uncomfortable-kid-in-Dad\u2019s-borrowed-suit.Certainly Mr. Zuckerberg has publicly acknowledged, a few times, the very conscious way he uses clothes. Just because he is known for wearing the same thing every day doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t think about fashion or how what he wears gets interpreted. In fact, it is exactly the opposite.Which is to say, he wears the same thing because that way he thought about it once and never had to think about it again.Though the current situation does somewhat demonstrate the limits of that approach.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Gun Culture Is My Culture. And I Fear for What It Has Become.", "Date": "2018-04-02", "News": "FeatureIn the wake of mass shootings, a lifetime of gun ownership leads to unsettling questions.Supported byWe were both members of a Facebook group where people post pictures of firearms and buyers private-message to ask questions and make offers \u2014 sometimes cash, sometimes trade. I needed money to pay a buddy for an old \u201970s model Lark teardrop trailer, and that rifle wasn\u2019t doing anything but taking up space in the safe.What I was doing was perfectly legal. In North Carolina, long-gun transfers by private sellers require no background checks. Likewise, it\u2019s perfectly legal to sell a handgun privately so long as the buyer has a purchase permit or a concealed-carry license. But as I headed up the exit to the restaurant where we agreed to meet, I felt uneasy. I was within the law, but it didn\u2019t feel as if I should have been.He was backed into a space parallel to the dumpster, a black Ford F-250 with a covered bed, just as he described on Facebook Messenger. As I pulled in, he stepped out. He smiled, and I nodded.\u201cYou can just leave it in the seat so we don\u2019t make anybody nervous,\u201d he said as I rolled down my window. There were families in rocking chairs in front of the restaurant. Customers were walking to their cars to get back on the road.I climbed out of my truck so he could look the rifle over while I counted the money he\u2019d left on his seat. He was about my age, somewhere in his early to mid-30s, white guy with a thick beard. He spoke with a heavy Southern accent not much different from my own. Said he built houses for a living, and that was about all the small talk between us. He liked the rifle. I needed the cash. We shook hands, and off we went.Where I live in the mountains of North Carolina, I am not alone. With fewer than a dozen guns in the safe, I wouldn\u2019t even be considered a gun nut. Most of my friends have concealed-carry licenses and pistols on their person. If there are 10 of us in a room, there are most likely 10 loaded firearms, probably more, with a few of us keeping backups in ankle holsters. Rarely do we mention what we carry. We don\u2019t touch the guns or draw them from their holsters. They are unseen and unspoken of, but always there.I come from a country people whose culture was destroyed by bulldozers and buildings. My father\u2019s family settled in and around Charlotte in the late 1700s. As a child, I would ride around with my grandmother in her light blue Oldsmobile. Where Winn-Dixies and Food Lions stood, she remembered fields where she worked tobacco and picked cotton. I grew up in a tiny holdout spot of country where I ran through a pasture of chest-high field grass to fish a farm pond most evenings, where just a mile down the road my uncle still kept a kennel of hounds to run rabbit each fall.Guns were often a bridge between father and son. But my dad didn\u2019t keep a .38 Special on the bedside nightstand like my best friend\u2019s father down the street. I never walked into the house and found him cleaning and oiling a dozen pistols at the kitchen table the way I did with my next-door neighbor\u2019s dad. For my family, guns had always been a means of putting food on the table. My father never owned a handgun. He kept nothing for home defense.A teacher named Mr. Madison sent me and three other boys outside to look for stuff to put under a microscope \u2014 rocks, tree bark, empty snail shells, anything we could find. The school was located in a neighborhood three miles from downtown. A sewer line ran parallel and cut a wide trail through the woods between two residential streets. We were at the edge of the clearing. I saw someone walking up with a hood over his head. When he got close, he pulled the gun and jammed it into my temple.I can remember that it was a little snub-nosed revolver, a brushed-steel frame. I can remember what it felt like pressed into the side of my head, how my heart raced when I went for my wallet, how I couldn\u2019t breathe. I had $50 my grandmother sent me for my birthday. My mom was going to take me to a skateboard shop after school to buy a new deck. There have been times I wondered what might\u2019ve happened if it\u2019d been like every other day, if I hadn\u2019t had a dollar to my name. If my wallet had been empty, would he have just walked away or become so frustrated that he pulled the trigger? Luckily, I had the money, and he took the $50 and ran.When he was gone, the four of us rushed for the classroom and tried to tell Mr. Madison what happened, our words broken by shattered breath, him screaming: \u201cSlow down! Slow down!\u201d The rest of the day we recounted our story over and over to the principal. In the end, what happened was swept under the rug. My parents said the school was probably trying to keep the story off the news.When I was 14, I couldn\u2019t imagine the impact that robbery would have on the rest of my life. I couldn\u2019t foresee a grown man feeling uncomfortable when he was corralled by passers-by on the street, an unnerving anxiety turning him to stone when he was surrounded by strangers. I remember an afternoon in my early 30s at a therapist\u2019s office describing the years that followed that incident, and she speculated that I surrounded myself with the people I did as a form of protection. There\u2019s a part of me that thinks that\u2019s too easy an answer, that it\u2019s passing the buck instead of taking responsibility. But for those next few years, I ran around wild.I sat in the back of a police cruiser praying the officers wouldn\u2019t pop the trunk on the car parked in front of my truck, knowing my friend had a shotgun and a quarter pound of weed sitting on the spare. I rode in the passenger seat while a buddy rolled down the window and fired a pistol into the night, blowing off steam after a breakup, empty casings spitting against the windshield. I dropped to the ground as gunfire rang from a car at a bonfire party. I pushed friends behind the brick foundation of a house as a shootout erupted over pills. There were times when someone could have easily been shot and killed.The second and last time I had a gun put to my head it was by the police. After a drunken fight, I left a friend\u2019s apartment to walk five miles and sleep on the porch of a buddy\u2019s house across the river. I was walking down the side of Wilkinson Boulevard in Belmont. I was carrying a shoe box. I saw a police cruiser pass me and make a U-turn at a stoplight up ahead. When the Crown Vic came back, the driver jumped the median and next thing I knew there were multiple cars, lights flashing, officers ordering me to the ground.They had their guns drawn. There was a K-9 unit, and the German shepherd wouldn\u2019t quit barking. I was lying flat on my stomach, and one officer came forward and put his knee in my back, his service weapon pushed into the base of my skull. They let the dog close enough that I could feel him barking against my ear. They said I matched the description of someone who\u2019d burglarized some houses nearby. They asked what was in the shoe box, and I stuttered, \u201cPapers.\u201d They asked if they opened the box if there was anything inside that would hurt them. With my face in the grass and the officer\u2019s weight making it hard to breathe, I was so terrified that I couldn\u2019t mutter a single word. I just shook my head, and they opened that box to find nothing but a stack of notebook papers, a pile of half-assed stories I\u2019d written. They told me I could get up, and I stood there trembling while they apologized. They gave me a ride across the river and dropped me off at the Mecklenburg County line, told me they were sorry but they couldn\u2019t take me any farther.I keep a close-knit group of friends here, most of whom are at least 20 years my senior. Our generational difference is erased by a shared passion for wilderness and time spent in the field with gun in hand. This past Christmas, one of the men I hunt with, a man we call Son in Law, handed down a Model 94 Winchester to his grandson. The grandson would be the fourth generation to hunt with that rifle. A few weeks later, the boy took that .30-30 lever action into the field and killed his first deer with it \u2014 the same as his uncle, his grandfather and great-grandfather. Those types of things are rare now, even in places like Appalachia.I\u2019m the youngest member of my hunting camp \u2014 me 34, everyone else in their mid-to-late 60s, a few on up past 70. Among these men, there are centuries of experience gathered around the campfire each night. After more than 40 seasons wandering the same woods, they\u2019ve come to know the land intimately. They toss around names \u2014 the Owl Boxes, the U.F.O. Hole, the Refrigerator Stand \u2014 places they\u2019ve killed deer for decades. They tell stories about men who have died, hunters like Goat Man, who carried an onion in his pocket and plowed down trees in his beat-up Bronco; or Hawkeye, who ran moonshine and damn near drank a boy to death after the kid slapped a sack of weed on the poker table and declared, \u201cBoys, that\u2019s the shit that killed Elvis.\u201d The old men talk, and I listen.I killed my biggest deer to date on the 2nd of November from a tree one of those men sent me to. Fifteen feet up a hickory, I watched a tree line at the edge of a clear cut. I heard heavy footsteps and eased around the right side of the tree for a look, and there he stood. The buck walked to my left, and I slipped behind the trunk, shouldered the rifle and balanced the fore end on a tree step I\u2019d augured into the opposite side for a rest.He was broadside when I slid the cross hairs onto his shoulder. The clear cut, strewn with downed timber and studded with sawed stubs, was too rough to track and drag, so I didn\u2019t want to risk a shot for heart and lungs and have the deer run a hundred yards. I wanted to drop him where he stood. Pin his shoulders together and buckle him.Just before the deer strolled behind a cedar sapling, I touched the trigger, and the .308 blew apart the morning. A hundred and fifty grains of copper-jacketed lead hit just behind the shoulder and blood-shot the backside to pudding. The buck stooped forward and sprinted, back legs driving him over tangled ground. He made it 40 yards before he crashed. From my stand, I could just make out the white of his stomach through the brush. I watched his ribs rise with each breath, that breathing slowing, slowing, then gone.There is a sadness that only hunters know, a moment when lament overshadows any desire for celebration. Life is sustained by death, and though going to the field is an act of taking responsibility for that fact, the killing is not easy, nor should it be.I climbed down a half-hour later but didn\u2019t walk straight to the deer. Instead I went to the place where I shot him, a yard shy of that cedar sapling, and followed the blood trail to where he lay. He was a big-bodied eight-point that would feed me for a year. I knelt there and ran my hands across his coat. It took nearly an hour to drag him back to the trail, another half-mile from there to the truck.The 9-millimeter I always carry was loaded and concealed on my side. Until that moment I\u2019d never been pulled over while carrying a concealed weapon. I knew the protocol. I knew what I was legally obligated to say. But I was nervous as hell as the trooper stepped out of his cruiser, situated his campaign hat and approached the side of my truck.He was a young black man with braces on his teeth. He looked to be in his early 20s, had kind eyes and was built like a linebacker. He asked for my license and registration, and I told him I needed to inform him that I had a concealed-carry license and that there was a weapon on my person. He asked where the gun was located, and I told him roughly 4 o\u2019clock. He asked if I could get to my wallet, and I told him the pistol was pretty close to my back pocket. There was a moment of hesitation when he considered what to do next. Then he told me to move slowly as I took my wallet from my pocket.When the trooper had my license and registration, he went to his cruiser. In a few minutes, he came back to the window and issued me a warning for speeding. I asked if there was anything I could\u2019ve done differently to make him more comfortable when he first approached the truck. The trooper told me what I\u2019d said was fine. He said that some officers might have been uncomfortable with where the pistol was located, being holstered near my wallet, but that he felt we had a good rapport. Depending on the officer, some might have asked me to step out of the truck so they could remove the weapon. He smiled and told me: \u201cBut this is South Carolina. Most every car I pull over has a gun.\u201dAs I headed toward the mountains, all I could think about was Philando Castile, the young African-American man who had a permit to carry and was shot to death in his car in front of his girlfriend and her young daughter by a Minnesota policeman after notifying the officer that he had a weapon. All I could think about was how things might have been different if the situation was reversed and that young black state trooper with braces had been behind the wheel, a white trooper cautiously approaching the car. It was impossible not to think that if I were black, I\u2019d be too scared to carry a gun. It was impossible not to recognize how gun culture reeks of privilege.There were floor displays of AR-15s, and probably a hundred or more other rifles and shotguns for anyone to walk up and hold. I watched a kid about 8 or 9 pick up one of those ARs and shoulder it to the center of his chest. He held the gun awkwardly, cocked his head hard to the side, squeezed one eye closed to aim and dry-fired the weapon. I watched two men, presumably his father and grandfather, smile and laugh, then break out their cellphones to snap a few pictures.I remembered how when I was his age, I used to love going to the sporting-goods section of Walmart to look at fishing lures and camouflage clothes. I\u2019d walk over near the register and push the manual turntable on the curio display to look at all the rifles and shotguns. There were usually a few big game guns \u2014 a gray stock Remington 783 in .30-06, maybe a Marlin 336 lever action \u2014 a couple of pump shotguns, a single shot .410 or 20-gauge. There were always Ruger 10/22s and Marlin Model 60s, the .22LRs kids unwrapped when their grandfathers gave them their first rifles for a birthday or Christmas. There were always guns, but nothing like the assault weapons that line the shelves today.Maybe it\u2019s how I was raised and the types of firearms my family kept, but the idea of owning a rifle designed for engaging human targets out to 600 meters just never interested me. I keep a Savage 10 in .308 to hunt whitetail and hogs. I have a CZ 920 that\u2019s absolute hell on a dove field. I have a handful of .22 rifles that I use for plinking at the range and hunting squirrels and rabbits each winter. Then there are the weapons I keep for defense \u2014 the shotgun by the bed, the pistols \u2014 firearms whose sole purpose would be to take human life if I were left with no other choice. I\u2019ve witnessed how quickly a moment can turn to a matter of life and death. I live in a region where 911 calls might not bring blue lights for an hour. Whether it\u2019s preparation or paranoia, I plan for worst-case scenarios and trust no one but myself for my survival.My friends see no difference between the guns I own and their ARs. One or two of them rationalize assault weapons the same way I justify what sits by my bed. When I ask if those rifles are really the best option for home defense, they joke about the minute hand of the doomsday clock inching closer to midnight. They post Instagram photos of Sig Sauer MCXs and tac vests loaded with extra magazines, their bug-out bags by the door as they wait for the end of the world.But a majority defend their ARs the same way I defend the guns I use for plinking and hunting. They say they own them because they\u2019re fun at the range and affordable to shoot. They use the rifles for punching paper, a few for shooting coyotes. Every weekend they fire hundreds of rounds from custom rifles they\u2019ve spent thousands of dollars building. They add bump stocks and Echo Triggers to increase rates of fire and step as close to Title II of the federal Gun Control Act as legally possible without the red tape and paperwork. They fire bullets into Tannerite targets that blow pumpkins into the sky.None of them see a connection between the weapons they own and the shootings at Sandy Hook, San Bernardino, Aurora, Orlando, Las Vegas, Parkland. They see mug shots of James Holmes, Omar Mateen, Stephen Paddock, Nikolas Cruz \u2014 \u201ccrazier than a shithouse rat,\u201d they say. \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been that rifle, he\u2019d have done it with something else.\u201d They fear that what starts as an assault-weapons ban will snowball into an attack on everything in the safe. I don\u2019t believe that politicians are going to ban ordinary guns or overturn the Second Amendment, but I understand their reasoning because I understand what\u2019s at stake. I think about that boy picking up that AR in Cabela\u2019s, and I\u2019m torn between the culture I grew up with and how that culture has devolved. There are changes I know must come, changes to what types of firearms line the shelves and to the background checks and ownership requirements needed to carry one out the door. And there is an unrelenting fear of what could be lost \u2014 a subsistence culture already threatened by the loss of public land, rising costs and a widening rural-urban divide; the right of individuals to protect their own lives and the lives of their families.A few days after the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., in February, I sat down with a buddy over coffee at the firehouse where he works. The news was on in the background. I told him I\u2019d be fine with an assault-weapons ban. He cut a look in my direction as if I\u2019d absolutely lost my mind. I asked him why anyone needs to own an AR, an AK, an SKS. He said that the question is irrelevant, that the reason doesn\u2019t supersede the right. I could feel my blood pressure rising and my face getting warm. I could see in his eyes that he was equally agitated. Despite everything we have in common, despite the fact that he\u2019s my best friend and we were going squirrel hunting in a few days, the two of us fundamentally disagree. Someone came into the room and changed the subject, and I could sense that he was as thankful as I was. As sad as it is to say, the silence is easier. While the two of us sat there sipping coffee, there were kids on the television in the background, high school survivors who were willing to say what we are not, and I was ashamed.As we pulled into the parking lot, I thought about the last time we were there, back before Christmas. Ashley didn\u2019t grow up with guns as I did. She\u2019d never owned one before I gave her a shotgun to keep by the bed when I\u2019m away from home. For a year or so, she\u2019d been considering a pistol. She\u2019d held dozens of models but still hadn\u2019t decided on anything.We were at the back of the store looking in the glass case at 1911s. All of a sudden, her eyes got big and she raised her hands then ducked behind me and grabbed onto my arm. I turned and stared down the aisle where a kid who looked about 18 was aiming an AR-15 the salesman had handed him. The muzzle was pointed in our direction. Ashley was terrified. I\u2019ve been at the counter enough to know the predicament \u2014 wanting to shoulder a rifle to test the feel but having nowhere sensible to aim. The kid lowered the rifle and went back to talking to the salesman, neither seeming to notice us standing there, Ashley frozen behind me.On the way out, she just kept saying: \u201cHe was a kid. He looked like he should\u2019ve been in high school. What does a kid need a rifle like that for? What does anybody need a rifle like that for?\u201d And the truth was, I didn\u2019t have an answer. The truth is, there are guns I feel justified in owning and guns I feel belong on battlefields. I know the reasons my friends give for owning these weapons, and I know that their answers feel inadequate to me. I know that part of what they\u2019re missing or refusing to acknowledge is how fear ushered in this shift in gun culture over the past two decades.Fear is the factor no one wants to address \u2014 fear of criminals, fear of terrorists, fear of the government\u2019s turning tyrannical and, perhaps more than anything else, fear of one another. There\u2019s no simple solution like pulling fear off the shelf. It\u2019s an intangible thing. I recognize this, because I recognize my own and I recognize that despite all I know and believe I can\u2019t seem to overcome it. I\u2019m sure that part of why I carry is having a pistol put to my head when I was 14. I\u2019m sure that part of it is having hidden behind walls while shots were fired. Maybe it\u2019s a combination of those two things coupled with headlines and hysteria, the growing presence of mass shootings in American culture.I don\u2019t like being in places where I can\u2019t find the exits. I don\u2019t like crowds and being surrounded by more people than I can keep my eyes on. For the most part nowadays, I stay at the house. When I have to leave, I slide my holster into my waistband before I put on my boots. When a book tour sends me out of North Carolina, 36 states honor the concealed-carry license in my wallet. Unlike a lot of those who carry, I don\u2019t buy into that only-way-to-stop-a-bad-guy-with-a-gun-is-a-good-guy-with-a-gun bravado. I have no visions of being a hero. Instead, I find myself looking for where I\u2019d run, asking myself what I would get behind. The gun is the last resort. It\u2019s the final option when all else is exhausted.When Ashley and I left the store, we headed toward the Levi\u2019s outlet, where she planned to buy a new pair of jeans. The walkway narrowed, and the sidewalks were filled with people and noise. Even though I knew the risk was remote, my mind raced with all those questions of what I\u2019d do if someone suddenly opened fire. As we walked, I could feel the pistol holstered on my side, the weight of my gun tugging at my belt. The fear was lessened by knowing that there was a round chambered, that all it would take is the downward push of a safety and the short pull of a trigger for that bullet to breathe. I felt safer knowing that gun was there.David Joy is an author who lives in the mountains of North Carolina. His third novel, \u2018\u2018The Line That Held Us,\u2019\u2019 will be published by G.P.

{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Venture Capitalists Prepare for an I.P.O. Wave", "Date": "2018-04-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Jason Pressman spent Thursday morning cheering from the balcony of the New York Stock Exchange as shares of the software firm Zuora, which he backed in 2008, began trading.\u201cNot bad at all,\u201d Mr. Pressman said by phone on Thursday night, before heading to a celebratory dinner with about 60 people at a pricey Italian restaurant in Chelsea. Mr. Pressman, a venture capitalist at Shasta Ventures, said he had been up much of the night before but still expected to raise a few glasses. \u201cI\u2019m running a little bit on adrenaline.\u201dMr. Pressman and many other Silicon Valley venture capitalists expect the windfalls to continue. Many of these investors, who back tiny start-ups with the hope that they will someday go public or be sold for nine- or 10-figure sums, have enjoyed enormous paper gains in recent years. But few have cashed in, because their fast-rising companies, like Uber and Airbnb, have remained private.That finally may change. Investors, bankers and analysts said they expected a wave of initial public offerings to bring some of the most highly valued and recognizable start-ups to the public market over the next 18 to 24 months \u2014 and billions of dollars in returns to their executives and investors. The potential bonanza would follow years of waiting as a few dozen companies amassed valuations without precedent in the private market.The tide has turned, venture capitalists said. \u201cI talk to bankers all the time and they\u2019re like: \u2018Dude, we have stuff coming down the pike. There\u2019s a bunch of offerings teed up,\u2019\u201d said Rob Hayes, a general partner at First Round Capital, who led a $1.5 million funding round in Uber in 2010 that valued the company at $4 million. Uber is now worth $68 billion.A wave of tech I.P.O.s would have implications for Silicon Valley\u2019s start-up ecosystem. Once start-ups go public and their employees pocket some of the wealth, executives and engineers may leave with more resources to begin their own start-ups. That gives venture capitalists a fresh set of companies to invest in, renewing the cycles of innovation and experimentation that sit at the heart of Silicon Valley.The I.P.O.s will also earn the venture capitalists big returns \u2014 and bragging rights. According to an annual ranking of venture capitalists by CB Insights, a research firm that follows start-ups and venture capital, many of the top-ranked investors backed companies with 2017 I.P.O.s, including the software maker MuleSoft; Stitch Fix, a mail-order clothing service; and Snap. (While Snap has struggled on the stock market, investors bought in at far lower valuations.)Steve Anderson of Baseline Ventures, No. 2 on the list, also backed Stitch Fix. And Jeremy Liew of Lightspeed Ventures, who was No. 10, funded Snap, while his colleague Ravi Mhatre, No. 8, backed MuleSoft and Stitch Fix. (The list of top 20 venture capitalists is below.)\u201cEven though most firms have had fairly record numbers over the past four or five years, they\u2019ve been paper numbers,\u201d Mr. Gurley said. \u201cAt the end of day, cash-on-cash returns is what matters.\u201dWhile private capital has been so accessible that start-ups have been able to get ample funding without the headaches of an I.P.O., several factors are encouraging companies to go public now, investors and bankers said. Public investors are hungry to buy shares of fast-growing companies. Early employees are getting antsy to cash in their stakes. And some start-up executives are eager to prove themselves as public company chief executives after founders like Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter\u2019s Jack Dorsey have said going public improved their discipline and focus on profits.\u201cAt all levels, there are more and more companies who are thinking about should we go public this year or next?\u201d said Noah Wintroub, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s vice chairman of investment banking. \u201cYou\u2019ve got an environment now that\u2019s conducive to asking that question, and also a lot of companies that have scaled up to the point where they can go now.\u201dMatthew Kennedy, an I.P.O. analyst at Renaissance Capital, said nearly all private companies valued at more than $1 billion were strong candidates to go public in the next two years. He said he expected more immediate activity among midsize start-ups, such as Slack, the maker of corporate messaging software, which is valued at $5.1 billion, and DocuSign, an e-signature company valued at $3 billion that filed I.P.O. paperwork last month.Once this generation of start-ups goes public, investors said, it will ease the anxiety of the wealthy families, pension funds and university endowments that finance the venture capitalists\u2019 investment funds. Those so-called limited partners have been itching for their returns, venture capitalists said.\u201cThey\u2019re certainly eager for cash back,\u201d said Mr. Pressman, the Zuora investor. An I.P.O. boon would be good for the venture capitalists, too.\u201cFor sure,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the business to make money for our investors, but we make money when our investors do.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Charitable Giving by Corporations Is Also About Getting, a New Study Finds", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneThe same goes for the Walmart Foundation\u2019s contributions to reduce carbon emissions in China and to protect wilderness areas in the United States, or the Dow Chemical Foundation\u2019s contribution to Habitat for Humanity. These companies might be ruthless in their lines of work \u2014 fighting against environmental regulations or more stringent labor standards \u2014 but their foundations are in it to do good to the world.Sifting through the donations to charity from 1998 to 2015 by foundations set up by the largest companies in the United States \u2014 those in the Fortune 500 or the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index \u2014 Marianne Bertrand of the University of Chicago\u2019s Booth School of Business; Matilde Bombardini and Francesco Trebbi of the University of British Columbia; and Raymond Fisman of Boston University detected a pattern of contributions to 1,087 charities linked to 451 members of Congress.Turns out that the spending is a little more self-serving than companies would have us believe. Some of the charitable giving looks a lot like corporate lobbying. Because companies get a break for such giving, it amounts to political spending at taxpayers\u2019 expense. \u201cFirms deploy their charitable foundations as a form of tax-exempt influence seeking,\u201d the researchers write.Think of it like this: One way a company could please Senator Chuck Grassley, the Iowa Republican who leads the Judiciary Committee and is a member of the committees on finance, agriculture, the budget and taxation, would be to have a corporate political action committee donate directly to his campaign.But there is another way, one that often slips below the radar of campaign-finance watchdogs. Why not donate to the Partnership for a Drug-Free Iowa, where the senator has been an honorary advisory board member?A corporation could also give to the University of Northern Iowa Foundation, on whose board Mr. Grassley sat as a trustee. Over the period covered by the study, the foundations of AT&T, ConAgra Foods, General Electric, Goldman Sachs, Medtronic, Merck, Monsanto, Nationwide Insurance, Principal Financial Group and Rockwell Collins all contributed to one or the other.Mr. Grassley\u2019s office, when asked about the corporate contributions to causes linked to the senator, said: \u201cSenator Grassley receives many requests to support various nonprofit organizations. He lends his name to some, but declines most.\u201dThe researchers who conducted the new study don\u2019t claim that any specific charitable contribution was meant to manipulate the political process. But their work lays bare the extent to which corporate donations may respond to political, rather than charitable, motivations.The new research uncovers patterns in the aggregate data that suggest corporate donations are often dictated by recipients\u2019 political clout. For instance, a company foundation will donate more to charities in districts where the representatives have gained seats on a committee that is important to the company. And when the member of Congress leaves office, corporate donations to charities in his or her district will dip.Corporations\u2019 philanthropy often flows to the same areas as their political action committee contributions: Charities in districts where companies favor a particular candidate tend to get more corporate donations.A charity need not have been founded by a member of Congress to get corporate money. But it helps. A nonprofit is more than four times more likely to receive grants from a corporate foundation if a politician sits on its board. And corporate foundation grants are even more likely if the politician happens to sit on a committee being lobbied by the firm.The authors of the study examined only a subset of corporate philanthropy, money flowing through corporate foundations that must disclose the recipients of their largess. But the research suggests that the impact of corporate contributions could be much bigger than even critics of campaign-finance practices realize.The researchers estimate that over 7 percent of charitable donations by corporate foundations are intended to buy political leverage. Applied to $18 billion worth of corporate philanthropy in 2014, that would amount to $1.3 billion, almost four times as much as total political action committee contributions that year and 40 percent more than the corporations\u2019 lobbying expenditures.There are a couple of lessons here. For those who favor campaign-finance reform, perhaps the most urgent message is that there are many doors that corporate America can use to buy influence. But the research also highlights the way that companies interact with society.Corporations are likely to tally their foundations\u2019 charity as a decided plus on the dashboard of corporate social responsibility. But politically motivated charitable giving meant to undercut regulations, promote a tax cut or otherwise gain a break could actually reduce total welfare.As the researchers write, \u201cIf corporations\u2019 good deeds (in the form of charitable contributions) cater to politicians\u2019 interests, who as a result put the interests of business ahead of those of voters, the overall welfare effects are ambiguous \u2014 society benefits via increased charity, at the potentially high cost of distorting laws and regulation.\u201dNone of this would happen, of course, if politicians weren\u2019t so hungry for corporate money. \u201cCompanies wouldn\u2019t do this if it didn\u2019t pay off,\u201d Professor Bombardini told me. \u201cPoliticians get good publicity by channeling funds that are valuable to the community. Whatever makes you look good, you want to take credit for it.\u201dBut with a new wave of scandals engulfing some of the nation\u2019s corporate titans, it would behoove them to honestly assess the ultimate purpose of their charity.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook to Require Verified Identities for Future Political Ads", "Date": "2018-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For months, Facebook\u2019s critics \u2014 ranging from Silicon Valley executives to Washington politicians \u2014 have been urging the company to do a better job of identifying who is buying political ads and creating pages about hot-button topics on its social media sites.On Friday, just days before its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, is expected to testify before Congress, Facebook said it had started forcing people who want to buy political or \u201cissue\u201d ads to reveal their identities and verify where they are.In the coming months, Facebook will start verifying the identity and location of people who run pages \u2014 which everyone from sports teams and celebrities to partisan groups use to promote information \u2014 that have large followings, Mr. Zuckerberg said. The company would not specifically say what would make it ask a page\u2019s creator for an identity, though it said the number of followers would be one factor.Facebook will also soon start clearly labeling political ads and providing more information about them, like who paid for them.\u201cThese steps by themselves won\u2019t stop all people trying to game the system,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said in his post. \u201cBut they will make it a lot harder for anyone to do what the Russians did during the 2016 election and use fake accounts and pages to run ads.\u201dThe new policy for Facebook and for Instagram, which Facebook owns, covers only a part of what appears on those social media outlets. Most regular pages and accounts will still not require verification.Facebook\u2019s algorithms also tend to magnify the visibility of sensationalist posts because they tend to draw more clicks, reactions and comments.Effective immediately, people who want to run Facebook ads regarding political candidates or issues in the United States need to submit proof of a government-issued identification. They also have to have a mailing address in the United States, though some people think it would be easy for foreign agents to set up one.Facebook will mail a unique code for the advertiser to enter for verification, Andy Stone, a spokesman for Facebook, said. \u201cAdvertisers will also have to disclose what candidate, organization or business they represent,\u201d he said in an email.The program will be rolled out to the rest of the world in the coming months, the company said.\u201cWe\u2019re committed to getting this done in time for the critical months before the 2018 elections,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said in his post.Initially, Mr. Zuckerberg scoffed at the idea that misinformation on Facebook could have played a role in the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. But starting last fall, the company was faced with \u2014 and eventually acknowledged \u2014 a series of revelations that Russian agents bought ads or spread misinformation on its social media outlets.Facebook said that between 2015 and 2017, 11.4 million Americans saw ads from the Internet Research Agency and more than 126 million users were likely to have seen the unpaid posts from the group\u2019s Facebook pages.Law enforcement officials say Russian agents, looking to stir discord, posed as Americans with Facebook pages that represented a range of political viewpoints, from \u201cBlacktivist\u201d to \u201cHeart of Texas.\u201dThe misinformation issue affected many of the company\u2019s more than two billion users around the world. Just a day before Facebook announced its ad changes, civil society groups in Myanmar criticized Mr. Zuckerberg, arguing that he had mischaracterized his company\u2019s effectiveness at detecting and quashing messages encouraging violence in the country.Mr. Zuckerberg is set to testify before the Senate\u2019s Commerce and Judiciary Committees on Tuesday and the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday.He and Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, have gone on a charm offensive ahead of the hearings. Mr. Zuckerberg spent an hour taking questions from reporters on Wednesday, and Ms. Sandberg has sat for a series of broadcast interviews this week. Both executives signaled that they knew the company had a problem that would not be easily fixed.They added that Facebook was also hoping its users would report political ads that didn\u2019t have proper disclosures.Facebook will also begin adding \u201cpolitical ad\u201d labels to such posts and will allow users to see who was behind political ads, the basic demographic information about who saw those ads and other ads run by those people, Mr. Goldman and Mr. Himel said. Facebook began testing its verifications over the past several days, \u201cand people will begin seeing the label and additional information in the U.S. later this spring,\u201d they said.Testing of the political ad disclosures has already begun in Canada and will roll out globally this summer, the company said.Facebook\u2019s move on Friday would address those issue ads. Most of the Russian ads focused on \u201cdivisive political issues like guns, L.G.B.T. rights, immigration and racial issues,\u201d Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, said in a statement.\u201cThat\u2019s why today\u2019s announcement by Facebook is so important,\u201d he added.Rachel Cohen, a spokeswoman for Mr. Warner, said on Friday that his office had met with Facebook officials regarding the bill several times and that they hadn\u2019t supported it.Another co-sponsor of the bill, Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, applauded Facebook on Friday for voluntarily complying with the bill\u2019s proposals, but added in a statement that \u201ca patchwork of voluntary measures from tech companies isn\u2019t going to cut it.\u201dFacebook\u2019s political-ad disclosures would in some ways do more than what is expected of television networks because the company would allow users to see all of the ads run by a group, said Travis Ridout, a Washington State University professor and co-director of the Wesleyan Media Project, which tracks political advertising.Still, Facebook\u2019s verification plans don\u2019t seem foolproof, Mr. Ridout said. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly a great step to take and helps to solve the problem of foreign influence,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I would not be surprised if people get creative and find ways around those requirements.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "WhatsApp Co-Founder Leaving Facebook Amid User Data Disputes", "Date": "2018-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When Jan Koum, a founder of the messaging app WhatsApp, sold the service to Facebook in 2014, he explained how deeply he cared about the privacy of communication. Growing up in the Soviet Union during the 1980s \u2014 when surveillance was a fact of life \u2014 had made him realize the importance of being able to speak freely, he wrote.Now, instead of changing his values, Mr. Koum is leaving Facebook.But according to a company executive, who asked not to be identified because the details of Mr. Koum\u2019s departure were confidential, Mr. Koum had grown increasingly concerned about Facebook\u2019s position on user data in recent years. Mr. Koum was perturbed by the amount of information that Facebook collected on people and had wanted stronger protections for that data, the person said. Mr. Koum had discussed leaving the company since late last year, the person added.Mr. Koum and Mr. Acton, who met at Yahoo while doing a security audit for the company, founded WhatsApp in 2009. Originally, the service was a way for people to tell friends and family whether they were available to text and talk. But it soon morphed into a general and free way of sending messages without the help of the services run by cellular network operators like Verizon and AT&T.In the spring of 2016, Mr. Koum and WhatsApp revealed that it was adding end-to-end encryption to every form of communication on the company\u2019s service, which was by then used by more than 1 billion people across the globe. That meant that even company employees could not see messages, phone calls, photos or videos sent across the WhatsApp network, and the company had no way of complying with any court order demanding access to those communications.Though Mr. Koum joined the board of Facebook after his company was acquired, WhatsApp continued to operate independently in many ways. Its staff remained small, and they worked from their own office in Mountain View, Calif., away from Facebook\u2019s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. The Mountain View building carried the names of neither Facebook nor WhatsApp on the outside.While WhatsApp does not carry advertising, the company has worked over the past two years to create ways for businesses to communicate with customers via its service.In 2016, WhatsApp said it would start disclosing the phone numbers and analytics data of its users to Facebook. A year later, the European Commission fined Facebook 110 million euros, or about $122 million, for misleading the commission during its acquisition of WhatsApp, saying that Facebook incorrectly claimed that it was impossible to combine user data collected by the two companies.Last November, Mr. Acton left WhatsApp and later became the executive chairman of the Signal Foundation, the nonprofit that has run the encrypted communication app Signal.By then, Mr. Koum had also shared his unease over Facebook\u2019s data and privacy policies with others, according to the company executive who has spoken with Mr. Koum. While Mr. Koum personally got along with Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, he felt the company\u2019s board simply paid lip service to privacy and security concerns he raised, according to the executive.In particular, the executive said, Mr. Koum was tired from fighting back against pressure from the board throughout 2017 to allow advertisements on WhatsApp.Facebook did not intend to announce Mr. Koum\u2019s departure until later this week, the person added. Facebook will hold its annual developer conference in San Jose, Calif., on Tuesday and Wednesday and it wanted to first get past the event. But The Post\u2019s report foiled those plans, the executive said.\u201cJan and Brian\u2019s departures mean that Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram are all controlled even more tightly by a single person \u2014 Mark Zuckerberg,\u201d said Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook manager who is now an adviser at The Center for Humane Technology. \u201cThis centralized control is bad for the users of all of these products.\u201dMr. Koum\u2019s departure was a blow to those at WhatsApp, according to one engineer at the messaging service, who asked not to be identified for fear of retaliation. There had been a certain level of pride within WhatsApp\u2019s team over the dedication to privacy and the departure of their co-founder had left many wondering whether Facebook would now open WhatsApp to tracking user data and, eventually, to ads on its service.Mr. Zuckerberg said in a comment on Mr. Koum\u2019s Facebook post that he would miss working with Mr. Koum.\u201cI\u2019m grateful for everything you\u2019ve done to help connect the world, and for everything you\u2019ve taught me, including about encryption and its ability to take power from centralized systems and put it back in people\u2019s hands,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg wrote. \u201cThose values will always be at the heart of WhatsApp.\u201dNellie Bowles contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Special Elections in New York on Tuesday Will Decide 11 Races", "Date": "2018-04-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial elections in New York on Tuesday will present voters with nearly a dozen state legislative races from Buffalo to Long Island, and could prove decisive in the Democrats\u2019 yearslong quest to capture all levers of state government.The most critical races to the future of Democrats and Republicans are the two for State Senate, one in Westchester County and the other in the Bronx. Democrats have long enjoyed a comfortable margin in the 150-seat Assembly, but control of the Senate has mostly eluded them, because of a power-sharing arrangement between Republicans and eight renegade Democrats.Despite a technical majority in the Senate, Democrats have taken a back seat to Republicans in the upper chamber, watching as the collaboration between Republicans and the so-called Independent Democratic Conference stymied legislation on issues like childhood sexual abuse and voting rights.But this month, a reconciliation was reached between the two Democratic factions. The agreement will most likely allow the Democratic Party to recapture the Senate \u2014 that is, as long as the two vacancies that were in Democratic hands remain that way after the special election.In the 32nd District in the South Bronx, the Senate seat vacated by Rub\u00e9n D\u00edaz Sr. will almost surely be captured by a Democrat because of the party\u2019s overwhelming advantage in voter rolls. (Mr. D\u00edaz left after winning a seat on the New York City Council.) Luis R. Sep\u00falveda, a Democratic assemblyman, will face Patrick Delices, a Republican who formerly taught Caribbean studies at Hunter College.In an illustration of the race\u2019s importance, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, stumped for Ms. Mayer in Mamaroneck on Sunday morning to help get out the vote.\u201cThe Westchester seat is the one where the most money and attention are being spent,\u201d said Geoff Berman, executive director of the state\u2019s Democratic Party. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing all sorts of phone banks and organizing canvassing trips from around the state to help Shelley.\u201dThe big challenge with special elections, of course, is voter turnout. Unlike the November elections, special elections can escape the notice of all but the most avid followers of politics. In the past year, more Democrats have become involved in local politics than any time in recent memory. \u201cThe Democratic base is a lot more energized since the election of President Trump,\u201d said George Picoulas, a lecturer in political science at Pace University.In the Assembly, where Democrats have a nearly three-to-one advantage over Republicans, the nine elections on Tuesday could afford Republicans the opportunity to make inroads and the Democrats to solidify their grip. Five of the nine seats were held by Republicans, including all three on Long Island and two upstate.Two fresh vacancies in the Assembly, resulting from two certainties of life in Albany \u2014 death and indictment \u2014 will be decided in the November election.On Long Island, the outcome of the special elections is far less certain.Another seat in Suffolk was also under Republican control. Chad A. Lupinacci stepped down after winning the race for Huntington town supervisor. Republicans have held the seat in the 10th District for decades, despite the Democratic advantage in voter registration.In the 17th District in Nassau County, another Republican, Thomas McKevitt, left for the County Legislature. The Republican nominee is John Mikulin, a 30-year-old lawyer, while the Democratic challenger is 25-year-old Matthew Malin, who works for the county\u2019s Board of Elections.Democrats will also vie for Assembly seats relinquished by Republicans upstate. In the 107th District east of Albany, the seat opened after Steven McLaughlin, a Republican, won his race for Rensselaer County executive.Republicans have tapped Jake Ashby, a former Army captain who was elected to the Rensselaer County Legislature only last fall. The Democratic nominee is Cindy Doran, a retired teacher who has served in the same Legislature since 2013.To the west of Albany, a three-way race is underway in the 102nd District, where Peter Lopez, a Republican, resigned to work for the Environmental Protection Agency.If elected, Mr. Bohen said he will caucus with Democrats in Albany. But Mr. Burke, who helped pass measures like a ban on gay conversion therapy in Erie County, is skeptical. Mr. Bohen has received the blessing of Michael P. Kearns, who vacated the seat after being elected Erie County clerk. Mr. Kearns, a registered Democrat, was first elected in 2012, but on the Republican line.Advertisement"}

Mr. Fritz and his sister agreed to sell the house for around $600,000.With his portion of the proceeds, Mr. Fritz, a percussionist and D.J., hoped to rent a new home with enough space for his music gear and decades of family furniture, heirlooms and antiques.He knew that he wanted to remain near the area where his family had been for so long. His first approach was to canvass his friends.\u201cI put the word out and asked them if they had any leads at all to send me,\u201d Mr. Fritz said. He posted a note on Instagram and Facebook, where his friend list had topped out at 5,000, forcing him to open a second account.People responded in droves. Some mentioned Facebook\u2019s Gypsy Housing groups, where people post listings. \u201cI joined every Gypsy Housing thing I could find,\u201d he said.The apartment had been on the market for weeks, possibly because of its distance from a subway stop, Ms. Clark said. \u201cGary needed a lot of space because he was downsizing from a house,\u201d she said. \u201cI was surprised that one person could use all that space.\u201dMr. Fritz liked it. \u201cEven if I couldn\u2019t set up my music the way I wanted to, I had room to put all the stuff I needed to move,\u201d he said.But his timetable was unclear. The closing for the house sale was postponed several times, and without cash in hand from the sale, he couldn\u2019t proceed with his move.In the meantime, he teamed up with Ms. Clark to hunt for a place. She started with apartments in the low $2,000s.\u201cThey were pretty decent spaces,\u201d Mr. Fritz said. \u201cSome of these buildings were brand-spanking new. If you ended up with a headache, you ended up with a brand-new headache rather than a recycled headache.\u201d But not all were big enough for his needs.Ground-floor or back units with yards were especially appealing, as he had tended a thriving garden behind his family house. \u201cI\u2019d go in my garden and come back inside and cook up a meal,\u201d he said, adding that the overflow went to neighbors. \u201cEveryone used to eat out of my yard.\u201dMs. Clark urged him to increase his budget and to hunt farther afield.A duplex on Pacific Street in Crown Heights, for $2,300, had three bedrooms covering 1,200 square feet, plus a backyard. But because Mr. Fritz was an independent contractor, the landlord was hesitant.\u201cNot everyone was willing to take a chance on him,\u201d Ms. Clark said. \u201cSome landlords prefer someone with a 9-to-5 job, a set salary and pay stubs.\u201dAnother duplex in Bedford-Stuyvesant was the best of all. It had three bedrooms, three bathrooms, a cavernous finished basement and a backyard. The rent was $2,990.At 2,500 square feet, it felt like a house \u201cwithout all the maintenance hassle,\u201d Ms. Clark said. \u201cIt is just massive. That apartment was for Gary.\u201dAfter viewing it, he said, \u201cI looked up to the heavens and whispered to my daughter and my mom, \u2018This one gets my vote.\u2019\u201dThe rent was on the high side, but Mr. Fritz decided the price was worth it.

Can you change that?\u201d Bustling and built for governing, Colombia\u2019s capital isn\u2019t a colonial jewel of the Caribbean like Cartagena, or a hot spot like Medell\u00edn \u2014 Pablo Escobar\u2019s former home base. Instead, Bogotanos seem to talk about their city the way the Milanese sometimes talk about Milan: as somewhere they love to live and work, but may hesitate to send an extranjero, or foreigner, to taste their country\u2019s richness. Safety is still a concern. Armed guards with bomb- and drug-sniffing dogs are standard at most public parking garages. Regardless, I was enamored enough with what I saw to extend my stay from six to seven days. Here\u2019s a starter kit on ways to experience beautiful, complicated Bogot\u00e1. If this is Colombia\u2019s ugly stepchild, I can\u2019t wait to see the rest. Before arriving in Bogot\u00e1, I heard two things: that I absolutely had to go to Andr\u00e9s Carne de Res, and that it\u2019s a rip-off and I\u2019d be a walking clich\u00e9 if I did. Both sides seemed to agree that it would likely be the gaudiest restaurant I\u2019d ever see in my life \u2014 which, of course, meant I had to go. Home to the world\u2019s largest collection of pre-Hispanic gold artifacts, this museum offers free tours in English or Spanish. You\u2019ll learn about the spiritual lives of Colombia\u2019s indigenous tribes, who believed that gold contained the energy of the sun and assigned it no monetary value. I got, dare I say it, bored looking at all those static, shiny objects. But after talking to Mr. Rodriguez, I had a much better sense of the museum\u2019s significance. \u201cIt\u2019s the story of how the Spaniards came all the way through the jungle looking for El Dorado, a city of gold \u2014 and there was some truth to that \u2014 but they came for the money, and they destroyed these highly spiritually evolved people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a story of greed. That\u2019s the story of how Bogot\u00e1 became a Spanish town.\u201d Some fruits in Colombian markets can be found elsewhere, but the freshness and variety here is unparalleled. Among my favorites were pitahaya amarilla, or yellow dragon fruit; granadilla, a relative of passion fruit; cherimoya, filled with white flesh wrapped around inedible black seeds; mangostino, a purple bulb containing sweet wedges that look like garlic; and uchuva, which look like orange cherries, grow in pods, and taste like heaven. Towering above all of them, though, is the lulo: tart and kiwi-like. It\u2019s often chopped up and mixed with water, lime and sugar for a drink called a lulada that is so thick you have to eat it with a spoon. I dream about it daily.

{"Headline": "Teacher Walkouts: What to Know and What to Expect", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUpdated April 26.The two states are the newest front for the nationwide teacher protest movement that began in February in West Virginia, and quickly spread to Oklahoma and Kentucky. Teachers \u2014 and many parents \u2014 in all of these states say taxes are too low to adequately fund schools.In West Virginia, teachers won a $2,000 raise after their statewide walkout.In Kentucky, legislators met teachers\u2019 demand that they override Gov. Matt Bevin\u2019s veto of the state budget, which Mr. Bevin said was not austere enough.Teachers, parents and students have noticed the impact of low budgets on the classroom, whether it is a four-day school week in rural Oklahoma and Colorado, or 15-year old social studies and science textbooks in Phoenix. When educators saw West Virginia teachers win a raise in March after a daring statewide walkout, they realized more radical tactics might work in their states, too.Other movements have also energized teachers. Some have been inspired by #MeToo, the March for Our Lives and protests against President Trump and his lightning-rod secretary of education, Betsy DeVos.In Colorado, teachers can legally strike in some circumstances. Last week, Republicans in the State Senate introduced a bill that would allow school districts to seek an injunction against an impending strike. Teachers who went on strike anyhow would be subject to fines or jail, and schools would be prevented from paying teachers for days in which they participated in a demonstration. The measure has little chance of becoming law, since Democrats control both the state House of Representatives and the governor\u2019s mansion.Teacher strikes are considered unlawful in Arizona, as they are in Oklahoma, Kentucky and West Virginia. Rank-and-file teachers in these states don\u2019t hesitate to use the term \u201cstrike\u201d to describe their actions, but union leaders prefer the term \u201cwalkout.\u201d They point out that teachers aren\u2019t striking against their managers \u2014 principals, administrators or local school boards \u2014 but are instead protesting state policies. Many teachers have used sick days or personal days to attend protests and rallies.It is unlikely that teachers participating in this movement would lose their jobs en masse; all of these states have teacher shortages because of pay and other factors. During the wave of teacher strikes in the 1960s and 1970s, union leaders like Albert Shanker sometimes did go to jail, but it would be surprising to see that happen now.You may have noticed that the majority of the teachers photographed at these protests are female.Today, two women \u2014 Lily Eskelsen Garc\u00eda and Randi Weingarten \u2014 lead the two national teachers\u2019 unions, and state affiliates in West Virginia, Oklahoma and Kentucky are also led by women. Even so, many of the most visible grass-roots leaders of this new protest movement are young men who started Facebook pages to help organize protests, rallies and walkouts.Unlike West Virginia and Oklahoma, Arizona has never before had a statewide teacher walkout. The state is typically skeptical of organized labor, though in recent weeks, thousands of parents have joined teachers at \u201cwalk-in\u201d protests outside schools on Wednesday mornings.This is a movement that began on Facebook with rank-and-file teachers in conservative states, who moved faster and more aggressively than their union leaders in demanding action from lawmakers. In all these states, union membership is optional for most teachers. That said, the state and national unions stepped in quickly with crucial organizing and lobbying muscle, and coordinated closely with grass-roots leaders.The biggest issue in Chicago, however, was the school reform agenda of Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who was pushing to evaluate teachers using student test scores. Education policy changes aren\u2019t the focus of the current movement, which is more about salaries and school funding for basic needs like textbooks and foreign language classes.The public employee protests at the Wisconsin State Capitol in 2011 began after Gov. Scott Walker introduced a plan to roll back collective bargaining and cut pensions. In that case, the teachers lost, and both policies became law.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Make Facebook More Accountable", "Date": "2018-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMr. Penn served as chief strategy officer for Microsoft from 2014 to 2016.Facebook is in a pickle. Its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, who is scheduled to testify before Congress this week regarding the privacy of users\u2019 personal data, is on a mea culpa tour. In media interviews, he has said that he is even open to some regulation. Here, then, is one idea that could fix a lot of the emerging problems with Facebook and other internet mega-platforms as they find themselves in congressional cross hairs.Dating back to 1912, America has had legislation regulating media ownership. At first the primary concerns were about public safety, but they evolved into concerns about the diversity of media ownership and the character of media operators. As late as 2013, the Federal Communications Commission did not allow broadcast stations to have more than 25 percent foreign ownership. The airwaves were considered a public good, with restrictions on its use and operations considered appropriate.But despite its government roots and public funding, the internet has been treated like a private commercial network. Now is the time to reconsider that approach, especially in light of the central role tech platforms play in hosting public debate, providing news and disseminating political ads.Facebook and other major platforms are driven by algorithms designed to increase clicks. If you don\u2019t like President Trump, you will be served more and more anti-Trump articles as the algorithm tries to maximize your engagement, which in turn increases potential ad dollars. Revenue tied to sensational but phony news articles proved good for the bottom line. Until, that is, people started to complain, prompting fact-checking schemes, which in turn generated complaints about the political biases of those fact-checkers. In our ideologically diverse world, it\u2019s impossible for any single news distributor to fact-check and rank the news with complete objectivity.Historically, editors and not algorithms made news judgments at TV networks, radio stations, newspapers and magazines. The biases of different editors were balanced by rules that limited the power, reach and ownership of any single outlet, thus ensuring diversity of content.Now, suppose we looked at the internet not as the private preserve of a few huge corporations, but as a public good to be treated no differently from how we treated the licensing of radio and TV stations. We could create new rules intended to force the major internet companies like Facebook and Google to choose one of two paths. They could be fully responsible for all the content on their networks, subject to libel laws (which they are not now). Or they could operate more like broadband providers that license \u201cchannels\u201d to media companies that are responsible for their own content, in the way that cable TV companies agree to carry selected channels. My guess is that they would choose the latter.To stay in news distribution and yet avoid greater liability, they could step back from the editorial ranking business and adopt a system similar to what the government helped create with TV and radio. Following this approach, Facebook and Google, because of their unique market power in social and search, would each create a limited number of promoted but ideologically diverse news channels that could be auctioned off to responsible publishers, who would in turn agree to stringent fact-checking and content-responsibility rules. Violations of the rules would cost them their status as a certified channel.Users then would select which channels they wanted in their feeds or allow the internet platforms to pick a selection of those channels on the basis of expressed ideology or interests \u2014 political, sports or celebrity news, liberal versus conservative. Search results from the certified channels would be listed first, and posting of items from these sources would carry special status and priority over nonlicensed sources. The revenue model would also be shifted from individual articles that draw clicks to channels that would have to meet standards and could pay annual licensing fees to the platforms. The channels would make money by selling ads or charging for premium content.Some things wouldn\u2019t need to change. Unlicensed publishers and websites would still operate the way they do now but would not have the same priority and visibility. Facebook and the other big platforms would also continue to monitor individual users\u2019 posts for offensive or violent content. They could, however, focus more on identifying masked and fraudulent accounts. Much fake news comes from fake accounts, after all. As a prod, Congress should consider increasing fines against platforms that fail to verify the identities of social media accounts.These measures would treat the internet like the public good it is and should remain. They would also return much of the editorial job of curating and ranking content to editors and media organizations. The big internet companies could voluntarily adopt the new system without facing significant new regulation.But if the major platforms continue to try to serve as full-blown news distributors without accepting the full responsibilities of publishers, Congress should intervene to preserve information diversity and accountability in our marketplace of ideas.Mark Penn is the author, with Meredith Fineman, of \u201cMicrotrends Squared.\u201d He served as chief strategy officer for Microsoft from 2014 to 2016, and was a pollster and strategist for Bill and Hillary Clinton from 1995 to 2008.Advertisement"}

She has traveled over the last two years to medical libraries to photograph speculums, forceps (another early design), syringes, nipple shields and fetoscopes from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. She expected to find torture-like instruments \u2014 and some were used to experiment on enslaved and poor women \u2014 but, instead, she found a common historical thread.\u201cI thought I was going to look at some really gruesome tools, but I think I was surprised that a lot of them don\u2019t look that different,\u201d Ms. Beal said. \u201cThey do resemble a lot of the tools used today.\u201dThe idea for the project started percolating five years ago when Ms. Beal\u2019s friends began having children. She grew interested in pregnancy and childbirth, and was particularly curious about the tools and devices used by doctors. Historically, labor and delivery relied on midwives in the home until the practice was shifted to hospitals, where male doctors predominated, something that informs the series, Ms. Beal said. \u201cTraditionally, women helped other women give birth and have done that forever,\u201d Ms. Beal explained. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t until forceps developed around the 1600s that doctors started to take over that practice from midwives.\u201d Hospital births subsequently became standard in the 20th century.Before visiting libraries at Harvard, Yale, Duke and Brown, Ms. Beal browsed through the online archives and notified the librarians of what she was interested in. Librarians carted out the objects for her to photograph, but half the time she didn\u2019t know what to expect.\u201cI went through their catalog and chose everything having to do with [obstetrics and gynecology] and labor and delivery,\u201d she said. \u201cI never knew what was going to be on the carts each day. Some of them had never been looked at since they were donated.\u201dMs. Beal used a tripod, a digital camera and a pop-up tent. Wearing rubber gloves, she set up each object off the cart and arranged them for the photograph. \u201cIt was very surgical in that way,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I was looking through the camera and then, there it is, that \u2018aha\u2019 moment.\u201d The photographs are now being printed onto Plexiglas plates, in reference to medical slides.\u201cI want them to be historically based, I wanted them to be grounded in the content of the work,\u201d she said. \u201cIn some ways I\u2019m looking at them as these objects through the camera, but their background is equally important.\u201dMany of the instruments were developed before doctors made the connection between germs and infections. So, instead of metal, materials like wood, leather, horn or ivory were used.  But gynecology \u201chas a problematic history,\u201d Ms. Beal said.  Ms. Beal said she tried to distance herself from these stories.  \u201cIt\u2019s done a lot of good,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s based in some really terrible practices.\u201d  Ms. Beal, an artist and adjunct professor based in Providence, R.I., frequently finds the thread between historical research women\u2019s lives when it comes to her art.

{"Headline": "To Beat Trump, Build a Better Biden", "Date": "2018-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf the election were held today, Joe Biden would crush President Trump. Almost any other Democrat \u2014 including one named Generic Democrat \u2014 would also beat the man who runs an administration of kooks, quacks, criminals, drunks, wife beaters and grifters.Sadly, there remains a sizable constituency for incompetency on this scale \u2014 the look-the-other-way evangelicals, the get-yours-while-you-can corporate class, the ditch-your-principles Republican officeholders. They\u2019re with Stupid, no matter how much Trump debases the office.Surprisingly, the Democrats are thinking big for once. The ideas being tossed around are risky enough to be called bold: a guaranteed-jobs program, universal health care, a public option for banking, free community college.But the best-known carriers of that message have problems. Nancy Pelosi is toxic in many a targeted red-to-blue district. Chuck Schumer sounds too much like a party hack. The presidential contenders all have weaknesses.If you were to go into a lab and create a perfect candidate for 2020, along with a popular policy prescription for this anxious decade, what would that look like? It would be a big-hearted, progressive person whose appeal crosses class lines. It would be someone very much like Biden \u2014 a younger Biden. Let\u2019s ignore the age issue for now.Your candidate would need to be ethically clean \u2014 no Wall Street speeches, no foundations that serve as backdoor ways to do well while doing good, no sexual misconduct. This is vital, because Trump has filled the swamp with odious creatures, taking their cues from him.It might help if your candidate was not from the political class. Oprah? She\u2019s not interested, so she says. Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook showed some promise until we all realized that social media had been weaponized to destroy democracy. The entrepreneur Mark Cuban? Haven\u2019t we had enough of a reality show star playing at being president?This gets you to the bench of elected officials. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, the junior senator from New York, is a whirlwind of Big Ideas of late. She just unveiled a financial first step for paycheck-to-paycheck Americans: a plan to require every post office to offer basic banking services \u2014 an alternative to predatory payday loans.She is coldbloodedly #MeToo, having shoved her former colleague Al Franken and the Clintons under the bus. And she has gotten ahead of the one-note socialist Senator Bernie Sanders on the idea of a job guarantee for everyone who wants to work. The problem there is cost (up to a half-trillion dollars, by some estimates) and the bureaucratic nightmare it could create. Gillibrand is swinging for the fences, even if she did the least well of major Democrats against Trump in recent polling.Much of the party\u2019s energy is coming from the Sanders wing; Sanders himself will be 79 on Election Day 2020 and he is not getting any less cranky. But don\u2019t overlook the enthusiasm generated by the Texas Senate candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke or Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana. They\u2019ve stood up for the basic right of health care, and against the wrong of more tax cuts for the rich \u2014 foundational positions favored by a majority of the country.Another prospect is the Senate\u2019s resident vegan, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey. He\u2019s got some Wall Street problems and is less populist than the mood of the country. But he has terrific political skills; he wouldn\u2019t need a slogan like Stronger Together.In the same class is the rookie Senator Kamala Harris of California. She\u2019s sharp, dynamic, with the right balance of ego and intellect. But how would a California liberal play in Scranton, Pa.?Trump will be 74. He\u2019s old and he\u2019s angry, and will get only older and angrier. Build a better Biden, from our political lab, and you win. But maybe the current Biden is built to last, with just enough septuagenarian strut to end the dark age of Trump. \u2610Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tokyo in Texas: Distinctive Japanese Food Is Thriving in Austin", "Date": "2018-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAUSTIN, Tex. \u2014 Tyson Cole got hooked on the original Japanese version of \u201cIron Chef\u201d in the early 1990s, after taking a job as a dishwasher and server at a sushi restaurant here in his adopted hometown.\u201cI\u2019d never had food like that in my entire life,\u201d recalled Mr. Cole, 47, who is now one of the city\u2019s premier chefs. \u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine anything more interesting.\u201dOr less typical of Austin. The sun-baked city he had settled into in his early 20s was synonymous with Tex-Mex and barbecue.And now, some kitchens are taking the next step: integrating Japanese cooking with the traditional foods of Texas.Takuya Matsumoto and Tatsu Aikawa, chefs and business partners who opened Kemuri Tatsu-ya last year, are the leading lights of this new hybrid cuisine. Mr. Matsumoto, who is better known as Tako, calls the restaurant\u2019s marriage of Texas smokehouse and Japanese bar food \u201ca pretty good representation of us as Japanese Texans. It\u2019s not that much different than Tex-Mex, really.\u201dWhile Mr. Cole\u2019s restaurants in Austin, Houston and Dallas are based, albeit loosely, on the fundamentals of the Japanese sushi tradition, the menu at Loro is dominated by meat cooked in a hardwood smoker and paired with Asian-inspired sauces and sides. The space is designed in part to resemble a classic Texas dance hall. (Loro is the sixth restaurant operated by Hai Hospitality, Mr. Cole\u2019s company, with a seventh, Uchi Denver, scheduled to open this summer.)Mr. Cole said the inspiration for Loro flowed from his belief that the signature cuisines of Japan and Texas are naturally compatible. \u201cSlicing the meat to order, serving it directly to the customer,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s so similar to what we do with sushi.\u201dMr. Franklin said, with a smile, that the restaurant will test Mr. Cole\u2019s theory that Texas barbecue is, as Mr. Franklin put it, \u201cthe overcooked, red-meat version of sushi.\u201dMr. Franklin, a 40-year-old former rock guitarist, is a partner in Loro as well as its resident barbecue expert. He led a recent tour of the space on South Lamar Boulevard, not far from the original Uchi, along with James Dumapit, 33, an Uchi and Uchiko veteran and Loro\u2019s chef de cuisine.\u201cWe\u2019re definitely not going to stray too far from the central Texas tradition,\u201d Mr. Dumapit said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to rub yellow curry over brisket, for example, because Aaron does brisket obviously very well.\u201dThe credibility that Mr. Franklin provides Loro is fairly obvious. More complicated is the role that Mr. Cole, a white man born in Florida, has played in making Japanese food fashionable in this trend-conscious city.Spurred by a passion for sushi that he acquired without leaving the state of Texas, Mr. Cole rose through the kitchens of Japanese-run restaurants in Austin, slowed but undeterred by the fact that he is not Japanese.\u201cYou cannot make sushi because you are white,\u201d Mr. Cole said he was told by the first boss he asked for permission to cut fish. A compromise was ultimately reached: Mr. Cole would roll sushi behind the kitchen\u2019s closed door, where diners couldn\u2019t see him.After a year and a half, he was allowed to make sushi in front of customers. \u201cBut only at lunchtime,\u201d he said. \u201cMy tip jar was full every day.\u201dMr. Fuse demanded that Mr. Cole learn to speak, read and write Japanese as part of his culinary training. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be where I am today if not for him,\u201d Mr. Cole said of his mentor.Mr. Fuse is held in high esteem by Austin chefs. Both Takehiro Asazu, of Kom\u00e9, and Kazu Fukumoto, of Fukumoto Sushi, apprenticed under Mr. Fuse, who is known around town as Smokey.He is also known to be reclusive. Mr. Fuse did not respond to repeated requests for an interview. Mr. Aikawa, a former pupil, relayed the chef\u2019s response: \u201cIt\u2019s not my style. I\u2019m a ninja.\u201dMusashino, which moved to the city\u2019s West Campus neighborhood in 2016 after 22 years at its original location, is where Mr. Cole developed the convention-busting style that lives on at Uchi. Mr. Cole\u2019s signature dishes \u2014 like smoked yellowtail and Asian pear, or maguro and goat cheese \u2014 are often built on nontraditional pairings.Kayo Asazu, 42, who owns Kom\u00e9 with her husband, Mr. Asazu, 44, says Mr. Cole made experimentation a distinguishing element of Japanese food in Austin.Amanda Turner, 31, grew up in Dallas, \u201cwatching anime, wishing to go to Japan.\u201d She said she felt she had \u201chit the jackpot\u201d when she landed a job at Uchi while she was still in culinary school.When she returns to Austin, Ms. Turner said, she hopes to open a Japanese restaurant of her own. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of precedent for white men to take possession of another culture\u2019s food,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m a black woman. I\u2019d like to change that.\u201dMr. Aikawa and Mr. Matsumoto, of Kemuri Tatsu-ya, don\u2019t face those kinds of questions around cultural appropriation and Japanese food. Both chefs were raised in Austin\u2019s tight-knit Japanese-American community \u2014 Mr. Aikawa, 36, was born in Tokyo, and Mr. Matsumoto, 38, is the son of Japanese immigrants \u2014 and gravitated to restaurant work to supplement their income as hip-hop D.J.s.\u201cI don\u2019t want to run a restaurant where I\u2019m charging, like, $1,000 a person,\u201d he said.Instead, he moved back to Austin to open Ramen Tatsu-ya with Mr. Matsumoto in 2012. They apply the discipline of the sushi bar to the broth-making in their ramen shop. It spawned a second location in 2015.In recent years, the two chefs have become more comfortable with their natural instinct to blend the foods of Texas and Japan. On trips to Lockhart, a Texas barbecue mecca, Mr. Aikawa would bring his own rice and return with brisket to feed his staff.When the ramen entrepreneurs started brainstorming for a restaurant they planned to open inside a former barbecue joint in East Austin, they asked themselves, Mr. Aikawa said, \u201cWhat if there was a Japanese guy in Texas 100 years ago? What would he be cooking at a roadhouse?\u201dThe answer is Kemuri Tatsu-ya. The restaurant and bar, decorated with Texas flags, taxidermy and vintage signs in Japanese, is as much of a mashup as the food and drink. The menu includes sake, sochu and local craft beer; smoked fish collar, eel and gochujang-rubbed pork ribs; two types of brisket ramen; and beef tongue and chorizo tamales made with sticky rice.Kemuri\u2019s success \u2014 its owners have leases on two new Austin restaurant spaces \u2014 suggests that the city\u2019s diners are plenty ready for whatever Loro has in store.One might expect Mr. Franklin, the barbecue maven, to be wary of taking liberties with smoked meat, considering the stringently traditional fare on which he built his reputation. The only sides on Franklin Barbecue\u2019s menu (coleslaw, potato salad, pinto beans) are absent from Loro\u2019s, supplanted by dishes like coconut-scented rice and papaya salad.At Franklin Barbecue, he said, \u201cthere would be anarchy in the streets if we changed anything or tried to get fancy.\u201dBut Mr. Franklin is also a product of Austin\u2019s cross-cultural forces. He appears energized by the opportunity to recast his smoked meats with shishito salsa verde and house-made hoisin.Though the meat at Loro is \u201csuper traditional, just salt and pepper,\u201d Mr. Franklin added, there is freedom for his partners \u201cto do what they do, making really rad sides and sauces. We just meet in the middle.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "When the Downstairs Neighbors Become Best Friends", "Date": "2018-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRentersWhen Zach Tan Strein, Corey Eisenberg and Alex Faoro signed the lease on a three-bedroom apartment on the border of Bedford-Stuyvesant and Bushwick, Brooklyn, last June, they didn\u2019t give much thought to who their downstairs neighbors would be.But within a few months, the residents of the five-bedroom duplex below became the defining element of their living experience \u2014 in a good way.\u201cWe have an open-door policy and basically share our spaces. We\u2019re all like roommates,\u201d Mr. Strein said. The setup is all the more serendipitous as the downstairs apartment was largely an agglomeration of subletters who found rooms on the Facebook group Gypsy Housing. They could hardly have been expected to become fast friends with each other, let alone the people upstairs.But become fast friends they did, after Mr. Eisenberg learned that the downstairs apartment had a washer and dryer. He decided to offer his services as a handyman in exchange for laundry rights.\u201cAnd then me and Vanessa started talking,\u201d Mr. Eisenberg said, referring to Vanessa Lopez, who shares the downstairs apartment with Tomas Virgadula, Christine Barringer, Helena Deda and a fifth roommate, who asked that his name not be used. Niko, Ms. Lopez\u2019s Bichon mix also lives with them. \u201cI think we have the same personality trait, where we\u2019ll talk to anyone who will talk to us.\u201dThe alliance was cemented by Mr. Faoro\u2019s Jura Impressa coffee maker, which was soon drawing the downstairs crew upstairs on a regular basis. And as they are the only two apartments in the building, it quickly seemed unnecessary to lock \u2014 or often even to shut \u2014 their doors.On a recent evening, Mr. Strein had prepared a dinner of spaghetti with tomato sauce and roasted broccoli, carrots, green beans and sweet potato wedges for his roommates in the open kitchen upstairs \u2014 one of the few requirements he and his roommates had when looking for a place.\u201cI also liked that it was unrenovated,\u201d Mr. Eisenberg said. \u201cIf I\u2019m looking at a place, I don\u2019t care if the paint is chipped or floors scratched because I\u2019ll fix it.\u201dMr. Virgadula, who moved to Brooklyn in 2011 to pursue an acting career, said that the apartment downstairs, which rents for $4,100 a month, was the first he had seen with a foyer.\u201cWhen I walked in for the first time, I was like, \u2018What is this space called?\u2019 Every other place I\u2019ve lived, you just walk straight into the kitchen,\u201d he said.The expansiveness of their shared living space \u2014 and the big backyard \u2014 has allowed the housemates to hold large gatherings: at a Chinese New Year party, for example, friends helped them make, and consume, 800 dumplings.It has also proved an ideal space for letting loose creative energies. Ms. Barringer, a seamstress and freelance costume technician, has ample space to work, as does Mr. Eisenberg, who does commercial design and fabrication, in addition to his own papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 projects.A few Saturdays ago, Mr. Strein, who interned at Dickson\u2019s, a butcher in Chelsea Market, used leftover beef tallow to make candles in the backyard. The following Saturday, he invited roommates to dye garments in a vat of natural black walnut dye he had prepared.Things have not been entirely rosy. On Christmas morning, Mr. Eisenberg discovered a bedbug in the apartment. He ran downstairs to tell Ms. Lopez, the only other person home. They decided to wait until the next day to tell the others, but immediately ran to Home Depot and started a massive cleaning.\u201cI was not about to live with bedbugs,\u201d Mr. Eisenberg said.With the help of an exterminator, they managed to wipe out the infestation in six weeks.\u201cIt brought us closer together,\u201d Mr. Faoro said.It also had the unintended consequence of flushing out the one roommate, an unpleasant downstairs tenant, whom none of them liked. (He opted to leave because he didn\u2019t want to deal with the bedbugs or the extermination.)Ms. Deda, who had become friends with Ms. Lopez while working at a nearby kava bar, had heard so many positive things about the house and its friendly, communal vibe that she moved in during the infestation.\u201cI was very tired of the situations I\u2019d been living in. The apartments I\u2019d had before, it felt like people are always trying to take advantage of you,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I went on Google and looked up \u2018bedbugs.\u2019 Of course, it gave me the worst situations, but I trusted Vanessa that it was not that bad.\u201dBefore moving into the house last June, Ms. Lopez said she had started to despair of ever finding a shared living situation where she could be happy. But she had lived in a studio when she first moved to New York and hated living alone.\u201cI\u2019d rather live with roommates, but it turned into a toxic situation so much of the time,\u201d she said. \u201cThis was the first house I moved into with strangers, and it\u2019s the best house I\u2019ve ever lived in.\u201dRelations are so good in the building, in fact, that there is even a cross-floor romance: Mr. Faoro and Ms. Deda recently started dating.\u201cI called that from day one,\u201d Mr. Eisenberg said, recalling how the first time Mr. Faoro saw Ms. Deda, he asked, \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201dKnow a renter with an interesting story?

{"Headline": "\u2018They Want to Block Our Future\u2019: Thousands Protest Russia\u2019s Internet Censorship", "Date": "2018-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 A demonstration in Moscow against the Russian government\u2019s effort to block the messaging app Telegram quickly morphed on Monday into a protest against President Vladimir V. Putin, with thousands of participants chanting against the Kremlin\u2019s increasingly restrictive bent.The key demand of the rally, with the hashtag #DigitalResistance, was that the Russian internet remain free from government censorship.The crowd responded with a resounding \u201cYes!\u201d to both questions.\u201cTelegram is just the first step,\u201d Mr. Smirnov continued. \u201cIf they block Telegram, it will be worse later. They will block everything. They want to block our future and the future of our children.\u201dThe rally comes two weeks after Roskomnadzor, the official internet watchdog, began its bumbling effort to shut down Telegram by blocking what the regulator said was some 18 million I.P. addresses.The F.S.B., the K.G.B.\u2019s successor agency, went to court to obtain the order to block the app after Pavel V. Durov, Telegram\u2019s inventor, a Russian who lives in exile, declined to provide the security agency with the means to decrypt messages. The F.S.B. said it needed to be able to read the messages to thwart terrorist attacks.\u201cWe do not consider this situation to be acceptable,\u201d Yandex said in a statement. \u201cThe Russian market can develop only in conditions of open competition.\u201dThe effort has provoked anger and frustration far beyond the habitual supporters of the political opposition, especially in the business sector, where the collateral damage continues to hurt the bottom line. There has been a flood of complaints on Twitter and elsewhere that the government \u201cbroke the internet.\u201d\u201cA large number of people are aware of the situation and they are not O.K. with it,\u201d said Nikita Likhachev, editor in chief of TJournal, an online publication covering internet culture, technology and politics.With no public accountability, nobody has any real sense of the scope of the shutdown, he said. \u201cThe whole point about the internet being broken in Russia is that we don\u2019t know what is happening and whether it can be fixed at all,\u201d Mr. Likhachev said.Countless people who play online games or use specialized services and tend to be apolitical, Mr. Likhachev said, have suddenly realized how much the government can affect their daily lives. \u201cThey have started asking questions about what is happening,\u201d he said.At the rally, which was peaceful, one hand-painted sign reflected that mood: \u201cThings are so bad that even introverts are here.\u201dNo arrests were reported.Various speakers and demonstrators said they had never been to any public demonstration before.Alexander Gornik, 34, a software entrepreneur, said many of the tools that his employees use for work, like Slack, Pipedrive and Tralier, were now inaccessible. To make high-quality software that can compete globally, Russia needs to be connected to the world, he said.\u201cThis is not just about Telegram, it is an attempt to isolate the Russian segment of the internet,\u201d Mr. Gornik said.Despite all the attention paid to Russian hacking and other expertise on the internet, the programmers at the government regulatory agency have not been capable of handling the complicated process of shutting down an app with international reach.\u201cRussia is at a crossroads \u2014 full-scale censorship has not yet been introduced,\u201d he wrote in one post. \u201cIf action is not taken, Russia will lose Telegram and other popular services.\u201dUnder sunny skies in the early afternoon, he posted again, writing: \u201cThousands of young and progressive people are at this moment speaking out in Moscow in defense of the internet. This is unprecedented.\u201dIn recent months, the Putin administration, particularly the Foreign Ministry, has repeatedly accused the West of \u201cRussophobia\u201d for sanctions and the general sour mood toward Russia.One rally organizer turned that accusation on its head, telling the demonstrators that it was various politicians and bureaucrats who were shutting down the internet who were really afraid of the Russian people. He began shouting the names of some of them followed by \u201cRussophobe,\u201d and the entire crowd chanted with him.There was no immediate government reaction to the protest.Many of the demonstrators carried paper airplanes, the symbol of Telegram, which whipped around above the heads of the crowd.The turnout of many thousands was particularly notable in that Monday was the start of a weeklong holiday, when Muscovites depart the city in droves for the country or abroad. A second rally is planned for Tuesday in St. Petersburg.Polina Oleinik, 17, and Polina Bulakh, 16, both students, said it was the first demonstration that they had ever attended.\u201cYoung people between the ages of 15 and 30 are very upset about this,\u201d Ms. Oleinik said. \u201cRussia must be a democratic country free of censorship. That is why we came.\u201dSophia Kishkovsky contributed reportingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sister of Korean \u2018Nut Rage\u2019 Heiress Accused of Throwing Her Own Tantrum", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCho Hyun-min, 35, is a younger sister of Cho Hyun-ah, a Korean Air vice president whose 2014 tantrum over how macadamia nuts had been served to her in first class made the company a target of ridicule and outrage, in South Korea and elsewhere. Both women are daughters of Cho Yang-ho, the airline\u2019s chairman.In the \u201cnut rage\u201d incident, Cho Hyun-ah used abusive language, threw documents and even made flight attendants kneel and beg for forgiveness for serving the nuts without first asking her \u2014 and in an unopened package, rather than on a plate. Still not satisfied, Ms. Cho ordered the Korean Air plane back to its gate while it was taxiing at New York\u2019s Kennedy International Airport so she could have the chief flight attendant removed.During the furor in South Korea over the \u201cnut rage\u201d episode, Cho Hyun-min, then a Korean Air executive in charge of corporate communications, sent a Twitter message to her sister, vowing \u201crevenge\u201d against unspecified enemies of the family, according to investigators. She later apologized for what she called her \u201cimmature\u201d behavior.In the latest incident, Cho Hyun-min, who now oversees marketing at the airline, was accused in news reports of throwing a cup of water at an executive for an advertising company during a meeting last month. The incident was cited as an example of what South Koreans call \u201cgapjil\u201d \u2014 the abuse of underlings and subcontractors by executives who behave like feudal lords.On Friday, Korean Air officials declined to comment on the police investigation. But they said Ms. Cho had raised her voice after becoming displeased with answers she got from the advertising executive, and that she threw water on the floor, not at the man\u2019s face.Korean Air also released a copy of a text message it said Ms. Cho sent to the executive, apologizing for her behavior. The executive accepted her apology in a text message, vowing to work harder to produce a better advertising campaign for Korean Air, according to the company.\u201cI apologize with my head down for my foolish and reckless behavior,\u201d Ms. Cho wrote on her Facebook page on Thursday, after South Korean news media began reporting the episode.The police said their investigation was preliminary and that they would decide later whether the case merited a full-fledged investigation and criminal charges.Over the years, a handful of chaebol families have developed reputations for running their corporate empires like the military dictators who set the stage for their success in the decades after the Korean War.South Koreans covet jobs at chaebol companies, which are among the most lucrative in the country. But there is also deep resentment of the families who run the conglomerates, especially the children of the founding tycoons, who are widely considered greedy and arrogant.\u201cWhat did I do wrong?\u201d Cho Hyun-ah asked a fellow executive when the \u201cnut rage\u201d incident became an issue, according to prosecutors.Ms. Cho later apologized repeatedly for her misconduct, and her father was forced to fire her. She recently made a comeback, however, landing a management post at a Korean Air-owned hotel business.South Korea often brims with schadenfreude when a chaebol scion is publicly humiliated. This week, some visitors to the website of President Moon Jae-in\u2019s office demanded that Korean Air be barred from using \u201cKorean\u201d in its name.Advertisement"}

Even for a Times reporter\u2019s book, a positive review is never guaranteed. In fact, as with any book, there\u2019s no guarantee it will be reviewed at all.\u201cWe\u2019re judging on the book\u2019s merits or newsworthiness,\u201d said Pamela Paul, the editor of The New York Times Book Review. \u201cNot only in our own assessment as editors and critics here, but also in what we think will be of interest and relevance to Times readers.\u201dOnce a book has been selected, the next task is finding a reviewer \u2014 and the editors of the Review take very seriously the mandate not to assign a review to anyone who has any personal affiliation with a book\u2019s author. \u201cYou can disagree with a reviewer\u2019s assessment, but you shouldn\u2019t distrust it,\u201d Ms. Paul said. \u201cSo, for that reason, conflict of interest and fact-checking are two of the most important things that we worry about here.\u201dIf a book was written by a Times employee, that means The Times\u2019s daily critics \u2014 Dwight Garner, Parul Sehgal and Jennifer Szalai, all of whom are full-time employees at the paper \u2014 cannot review it; nor can anyone from a directly competing news organization. Beyond that, Ms. Paul said, the editors apply the same standards they would to any other book. A reviewer cannot review a book by anyone with whom he or she shares an agent, publisher or editor; anyone the reviewer has blurbed, or been blurbed by; anyone, even, with whom the reviewer has shared a contentious moment on a panel or at a conference. Friends are out, as are enemies.The ubiquity of social media has complicated these assessments. \u201cIf you\u2019re following someone on Twitter or if you\u2019re \u2018Facebook friends,\u2019 I think that we have all been disabused of the notion that that actually constitutes a friendship,\u201d Ms. Paul said. Those relationships aren\u2019t necessarily seen as a conflict of interest that would preclude a review.Of course, the literary world is a small one \u2014 as are the fields represented by many of the books the Review covers. \u201cIn certain areas, everyone knows everyone,\u201d Ms. Paul said, citing politics, science and even British literature. (\u201cIt\u2019s an island nation,\u201d she added.)It can be difficult to find a reviewer who has never been in the same room as a book\u2019s author; and on a case-by-case basis, some passing familiarity can be acceptable. A handshake at a party is fine; a sexual relationship \u2014 even years ago, as at least one prospective reviewer has tried to emphasize \u2014 is not.In the case of \u201cChasing Hillary,\u201d Ms. Chozick, the author, had never met Ms. Alter, the reviewer, who is a radio host and a national correspondent at Time magazine. In choosing her, Ms. Paul sought a reviewer who could \u201cunderstand the political landscape but who would also be able to assess the book as a memoir,\u201d she said.Without exception, the reviewer must be able to answer \u201cyes\u201d to the question: \u201cIf need be, would you feel free to criticize the book?\u201dAnd criticize they do. Though it wasn\u2019t the case this time, Times employees have received plenty of negative reviews in the past. The Books desk doesn\u2019t edit opinions, nor does it kill and reassign a review if it comes back negative.\u201cThere have been instances where writers, both in the newsroom and on the opinion side, have had very negative assessments in the Book Review,\u201d Ms. Paul said. \u201cYou just hope that you don\u2019t run into that person in the elevator.\u201dAdvertisement"}

YouTube, which opened a revenue-sharing program more than a decade ago, has long been accused by angry creators of demonetizing videos for arbitrary and inscrutable reasons.Those complaints gave rise to violence last week, when Nasim Najafi Aghdam, a YouTube creator who had been angered by the platform\u2019s revenue-sharing policies, shot and injured three employees at YouTube\u2019s headquarters in San Bruno, Calif., and then killed herself.But some of these features are still not widely available, and many influencers say that Facebook\u2019s charm campaign amounts to too little, too late.Mr. Hamilton, he of the hot-pepper thong video, said, \u201cI did 1.8 billion views last year. I made no money from Facebook. Not even a dollar.\u201d\u201cI understand where they\u2019re coming from,\u201d said Mr. Shaba. \u201cFacebook was turning into a viral media dumpster, and they wanted to eliminate that. Still, I\u2019d still prefer that over seeing a million wedding pictures.\u201d\u201cA good video can be the catalyst for a meaningful connection,\u201d Mr. Lax said. \u201cThink of a good Facebook video like a Mother\u2019s Day card. It doesn\u2019t stop someone from sharing her feelings with her mom \u2014 it gives her a jumping-off point.\u201dWhile waiting for Facebook to invite them into a revenue-sharing program, some influencers struck deals with viral publishers such as Diply and LittleThings, which paid the creators to share links on their pages. Those publishers paid top influencers around $500 per link, often with multiple links being posted per day, according to a person who reached such deals.\u201cPeople are saying that their feeds are getting stale, and they\u2019re missing the diversity of content they felt they had selected,\u201d Gretchen Tibbits, the president of LittleThings, told me. \u201cPeople carefully curated their feeds, and Facebook took that away.\u201dMs. Simo, the Facebook executive, said in a statement that \u201cour branded content policies prohibit Pages and Profiles from accepting payment to share content they did not have a hand in creating, since the spirit behind branded content is to have a collaboration between brands and creators to produce content.\u201dIn Facebook\u2019s defense, it\u2019s hard to feel entirely sympathetic for the people who built huge followings with videos like \u201cSweater Pill Hacks\u201d and \u201cTinder Girl Gets High Off Fake Weed,\u201d only to have them pushed out of sight. Facebook is attempting to clean up its platform, and some creators did clutter the site with clickbait and spammy links. But all of this jockeying raises a larger question about how well Facebook truly knows its users, and how much it can steer their media preferences without veering into paternalism.Right now, the social network is working to improve what Mr. Zuckerberg has called the \u201clong-term well-being\u201d of its users. But what if what many Facebook users really want \u2014 as measured by their clicks and eyeballs \u2014 are prank videos, D.I.Y. hacks, and sensational headlines?Mr. Shaba, the co-founder of The Pun Guys, said that he had been trying to produce more high-quality content that would have a better chance of getting boosted by Facebook\u2019s algorithms. But he said that he hadn\u2019t yet cracked the code.\u201cOur fans are messaging us being like, \u2018You guys don\u2019t post videos anymore,\u2019\u201d Mr. Shaba said. \u201cWe have. You just aren\u2019t seeing them.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cute Shoes Are Useless, and Other Lessons From Three Months Traveling the World", "Date": "2018-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe 52 Places TravelerWe invited readers to ask her questions about the journey and traveling alone, particularly as a woman. Here\u2019s a selection, and her responses.Oh Allyson, just answering this question is giving me anxiety shivers! Time management is not my friend.I have some help with travel arrangements from The Times (and data scientists from Kayak, the travel aggregation site, who crafted an initial itinerary for me), so that\u2019s taken a burden off. I try to make sure I have three days of activities in a place, and a full day of writing, plus two mornings for editing and fact-checking. That isn\u2019t always possible so I\u2019m often squeezing writing and social media into whatever spare moment I have.I have two sacred times for myself: a weekly therapy call (this job is stressful!) and dinner. I\u2019m willing to pull an all-nighter as long as I can have an hour of eating good food and sipping wine very slowly.Most important, if I\u2019m somewhere incredibly beautiful, I pause to take a mental image and be grateful. Who knows when I\u2019ll be back to any of these places. That\u2019s precious time, too, and I don\u2019t want to waste it.Glad you asked, because I think about packing constantly! I\u2019ll go over more of this in a separate packing article to come, but I\u2019ve sent back maybe four shipments of stuff and the majority has been clothes. Cute dresses, cute shoes, cute jacket \u2014 all of it is gone.What I\u2019ve needed are items (mostly black) that can act as a uniform, layers to keep me warm, fast-drying underwear and a bra that won\u2019t dig into me on the plane. Toiletries, I\u2019m still carting around too many. I also joke that half the weight of my bag is tampons, but those aren\u2019t going anywhere.(For future breakfasts, I\u2019m looking forward to France and Italy, always, and China. Love egg and tomato and any breakfast foods with a kick of soy sauce.)So I was pretty stressed out when I got there. But the first thing I encountered was a bunch of women dancing around and singing by baggage claim. And through that encounter, I met everyone I hung out with on that trip. People were dealing with so much trauma and loss and yet I was welcomed into homes, onto farms, at parties.I hope everyone gets a chance to experience the warmth of Puerto Rico as I did.The healthy part, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m succeeding at. So. Many. Carbs! So. Little. Exercise.My mind, I have a better handle on. I\u2019ve cried a few times, and felt quite overwhelmed, but that\u2019s what phone calls to my therapist in New York City are for.I definitely encountered tons of uncomfortable sexualized situations when I was in my late teens and 20s and traveling solo. Either I\u2019m getting too old to get hit on or sadly, I\u2019ve gotten used to it. So far, nothing overt has happened, other than some construction workers in Chile relentlessly asking about my marital status. I let it slide because it just didn\u2019t seem worth the energy expenditure.When you say \u201cyoung,\u201d I\u2019m assuming you mean young enough to handle slightly rugged lodging. I\u2019d stay in hostels. They have a community around them, and you can form a buddy system with other solo female travelers. Hotels make it harder to have those kinds of interactions.When you\u2019re out, keep yourself on a two-drink regimen, for your sake and your buddy\u2019s, be mindful of being slipped drugs, and always have the club or restaurant call you a taxi home, unless you\u2019re ride-sharing and feel O.K. with that.About off-the-path destinations, I think the safest thing you can do is always make sure someone knows where you are: the innkeeper, plus a parent or a close friend who will know to sound the alarm if you go off the grid for too long.Safety is a huge concern for women (and often people of color and other minority groups), and I\u2019m not sure everyone gets that. Trust your gut and be as cautious as you feel like you need to be, even if people make fun of you.The worst trouble I\u2019ve gotten into while traveling has been when I\u2019ve tried to act like a local. Hang out with locals, but remember you\u2019re always a potential target.And try to have fun. It\u2019s possible, I promise!Hardest: Definitely safety concerns. There\u2019s a patina of anxiety that coats me every time I go out in an urban environment \u2014 especially since I\u2019m doing so much work with a phone and a camera that are ripe for getting snatched. It\u2019s infinitely better to walk around with someone else, not just for the warmth of companionship, but also to have the chance to relax into my environment a bit.Easiest: Not having to compromise and be on anyone else\u2019s schedule (except for my editor\u2019s). That probably says something about why I\u2019m still single!Hi Alyn, if you are the older woman in question, I say mazel! Happy to have a fellow adventuress on the road.Tour groups and activities like cooking classes are great ways to make friends while maintaining the independence of traveling alone. Europe by bicycle is my favorite way to see the countryside, and all the trips I\u2019ve taken have included active seniors.This time around, I\u2019ve hired private guides for wilderness hikes, both for the company and a fail-safe should anything go wrong.Also, say hi to the 30- and 40-somethings you meet. Chances are we think you\u2019re very cool.As an Asian woman who blends in easily in many eastern and Southeast Asian countries and has traveled to many of them, I always worry about how I\u2019m perceived and treated by locals. - Emily LHi Emily! I\u2019m half Chinese, but I don\u2019t read as \u201cAsian\u201d in China, so I can\u2019t speak to your experience of being able to blend. Chinese people can spot the pale, not-so-skinny American in me right away. I have, however, seen my dad encounter confusion and surprise that he doesn\u2019t speak the language. He\u2019s a scientist and is antisocial (sorry, Dad, it\u2019s true!), so he mostly runs off, which seems like a fine enough policy to me.The phenomenon of young white women writing about travel being easy doesn\u2019t seem as noticeable to me as young white men doing it. As you\u2019ve seen, a good deal of the questions here are women asking about safety while traveling solo. It\u2019s a pervasive concern and every time I don\u2019t see it mentioned in another writer\u2019s article, I feel a bit of a disconnect \u2014 as I\u2019m sure some people from other backgrounds feel while reading my work.I, for one, would love to experience what it\u2019s like to pass as an Asian local, to not be immediately marked as a tourist, to fly under the radar and observe subcultures unnoticed. Think of it as a blessing. Maybe you\u2019ll get some weird looks when people figure things out, but by that time, you\u2019ll be at an underground karaoke party.The bigger issue here seems to be that you aren\u2019t finding writing out there that jibes with your experience. It sounds like you want to change that. I\u2019d definitely be a reader.Well, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re not asking about the dating scene, because I\u2019ve sadly had no time for that!The easiest time I\u2019ve had making friends was on the adventure travel circuit of Chile, or any time I\u2019ve taken a tour. Activities are bonding; you\u2019ll likely find other single folks with similar interests. And the line, \u201cHey, so I\u2019m traveling the world by myself, where are you from?\u201d seems to work wonders at starting conversations.So far I\u2019ve been lucky in that the only language I\u2019ve been required to speak, other than English, has been Spanish. I\u2019m pretty rusty, but it\u2019s a language I started studying in first grade, as a requirement of New Mexico public schools \u2014 and I improved a lot over the course of my travels in Latin America. I\u2019ll be O.K. in places with French and Italian, too.Most places, I\u2019ve befriended native speakers who know English and have been happy to volunteer as interpreters.In my first instance of trying to talk to someone who spoke zero English, we spoke into Google Translate on my phone.Not that I know of, but political situations around the world change all the time, and quickly. I was vacationing in Delhi when the 2008 Mumbai attacks happened, and I was visiting a friend during several bombings in Kabul over Thanksgiving in 2012. Danger is real, but I\u2019ve got a pretty great support network at The Times to help me keep an eye on it.Definitely not. But the word \u201cessence\u201d is interesting here. If we think of it as the diffuse aroma of a perfume, perhaps a scent you remember deep in your brain, then it may be possible.So if I can give you, the reader, a detail to hang onto or tell a story that compels you travel to that place, or travel anywhere, then I\u2019ve done my job.A note to readers who are not subscribers: This article from the Reader Center does not count toward your monthly free article limit.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "AT&T Chief Attacks Lawsuit to Block Time Warner Merger", "Date": "2018-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHe called the blockbuster merger a \u201cvision deal\u201d that would allow AT&T to better match up against Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google, which he referred to as \u201cF.A.A.N.G.\u201d\u201cThe F.A.A.N.G. are all focused on premium video,\u201d Mr. Stephenson said, comparing the proposed merger to the businesses of tech giants. \u201cAll of them are vertically integrated.\u201dThe trial is expected to wrap up in coming days after rebuttal arguments by the Justice Department and closing statements by both sides. Judge Richard J. Leon of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, who is presiding over the case, is expected to make a decision on the suit as early as the end of May.In cross-examination of Mr. Stephenson, the Justice Department\u2019s lead litigator, Craig Conrath, picked apart the portrayal of AT&T as under siege by Silicon Valley. Mr. Conrath said the key difference between AT&T and tech companies is that AT&T is in a powerful position as the company that provides broadband access to the internet \u2014 a service that Netflix and Amazon don\u2019t offer.Mr. Conrath also presented a friendly email from June 2017 between Mr. Stephenson and Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, in which Mr. Zuckerberg offered to help build AT&T\u2019s ad platform. Mr. Conrath questioned the offer of \u201ccooperation,\u201d suggesting there was less of a rivalry between the companies than Mr. Stephenson had said.Mr. Stephenson dismissed the significance of the email with Mr. Zuckerberg. Mr. Zuckerberg was following up on a casual meeting the executives had during an annual media industry gathering of executives in Sun Valley, Idaho, he said.The key disadvantage that AT&T and Time Warner face is their slow start in behavioral advertising and marketing, Mr. Stephenson said. Both companies do not collect or analyze the habits of television and web users in the same way that Comcast does with cable subscribers and that Google and Facebook do on their platforms.Mr. Stephenson said Netflix, Amazon, Google and Facebook are all investing in premium video content to collect increasing amounts of data on users who would spend longer times on their sites and visit more often.The AT&T chief spent much of his time talking about the history of the company. He spoke directly to Judge Leon to explain the company\u2019s evolution from a phone company to one that seeks to make money from advertising and subscriptions for consumers who will watch much of their videos on mobile devices.Mr. Stephenson attacked the Justice Department\u2019s underlying theory that the company would threaten to withhold Time Warner content to raise prices on other cable and satellite distributors.

{"Headline": "Nature Fixes, Sports Betting, Teacher Walkouts and Guns: Our Favorite Student Comments of the Week", "Date": "2018-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCurrent Events ConversationBut while we have you, we want to mention something we\u2019ve noticed.Please note: All student comments have been lightly edited for length, but otherwise appear exactly as they were originally submitted._________I grew up in a rural town where owning and shootings guns for recreational reasons is the norm for plenty of residents. I don\u2019t think anybody here has been killed by one of the hundred guns in our community; regardless of how easy they are to obtain in my State. Honestly, I don\u2019t think guns are the issue here, but mental health is. If you are mentally sick enough to want to go into a school and shoot children with their entire lives ahead of them, a gun law banning all AR-15s isn\u2019t going to stop you. There are so many ways you can obtain one illegally or just find a replacement.Having a family and a community that has taught me respect for firearms has drilled into my brain the guns aren\u2019t the cause for all these deaths, it\u2019s the people behind those guns. If you had the choice, would you get rid of all terrorists in the world or just limit what they can do? I don\u2019t know about you, but I would take the first choice. Plenty of legislation has been circling around the media lately, but not one seems to really tickle my fancy. The opinions of what we should do are so split between Congressmen and the people. For example, I read that idea about repealing the 2nd Amendment. I think that\u2019s completely preposterous. On the other hand, I see that the 2nd Amendment is perfect and things should stay the way it is. Though I agree more with that second half, I think a minor tweak is in order. I am behind making it harder for monsters to get guns, but still possible for everyone else to.I would certainly agree with Robert Leonards assertions that a more efficient system of background checks than those currently in place would help to cut down on mass shootings, as well as that a ban on AR-15s and other similar rifles would never pass through Congress into law. I\u2019m particularly interested in the gun debate because its results will heavily impact the way I will live the rest of my life. I definitely plan on purchasing at least an AR-15 and a 9mm handgun at some point in my life and am not fond of the idea of that right being taken away from me before I get the chance to buy my own guns. I think the government\u2019s respect of our individual rights should be their top priority, but they should also do their best to protect the people without jeopardising out personal liberties. I think the government needs to strike a balance between the two sides that will appease, at least to some degree, both sides of the argument. I really do not think that introducing more guns into society will increase or decrease violence using firearms, I would have no problem with more people owning guns as a method of protection and recreation. I truly think that the only way to reduce the rate of murders using firearms would be a more effective background check and mental healthcare system would be a better alternative to much stricter gun control or even repealing the Second Amendment.I definitely believe stricter gun control is needed. To be honest, I want to call for strict ban on guns, but I know that is too ideal. The Second Amendment was written hundreds years ago, when our population was not significantly less than today and when the government was not well-organized like today. Thus, I cannot understand why unrestricted distribution of guns is necessary in the modern world. The Second Amendment says it is for the self-protection, but is it not clear that guns are more often used for crimes and violations? Also, why on earth is machine gun needed by a civilian?There was another shooting in California today, causing 3 injuries; this is only two months after the Stoneman Douglas High School Shooting. I still remember a parent of the victim of this school shooting crying out \u201chow?\u201d to President Trump. He questioned \u201chow can nothing have changed after Columbine? after Sandy Hook?\u201d Why have nothing changed until now that the high schoolers have to stand up to cry for \u201cmore gun control.\u201dSchool cannot be a place where I have to carry a gun. Nor do I want to see my teachers carrying a gun \u201cin case of emergency.\u201d I want to remember high school as a somewhat stressful, yet welcoming, lively place with fun friends and kind teachers, not as a possible battlefield. Did we not all learned that \u201cviolence cannot solve violence\u201d in kindergarten? Now, how can distributing more guns can solve gun deaths?; it will cause even more gun accidents and violences.The sentence-long second amendment is a relic from a time when the U.S.\u2019s population was less than one percent of what it is today. Thusly, as opposed two hundred fifty years ago, defending ourselves against the government and forming a militia is completely out of the question. Whether you believe this is a good thing or not is largely irrelevant, as it\u2019s our reality and it won\u2019t change without aid from another country\u2019s nuclear weapons. What we\u2019re now left with is an antiquated rule that indirectly prioritizes the wants of child murdering psychopaths.While I understand the importance of the gun culture in rural America as mentioned by Robert Leonard in the fourth excerpt, there are sacrifices that need to be made for the safety of the citizens of our country, and if that means making it harder for people to obtain handguns and banning semi-automatic rifles outright, then they should be willing to make that exchange in the consideration of over 300 million people\u2019s lives. Leonard stated, \u201c...gun control has never stopped criminals from getting guns, and never will.\u201d And though it\u2019s true that any amount of gun control will never completely eliminate the possibility of illegal firearms coming into the possession of dangerous Americans, it doesn\u2019t mean that we should capitulate to the terrorists by maintaining the facility of legally purchasing them.*Part 1*As a person raised in republican household with guns, I most definitely support the second amendment and the right to own guns. But as a centrist (person whose political beliefs are literally right down the middle) my beliefs towards gun reform would seem vastly liberal to some of the rural americans of Iowa that Mr. Leonard mentions. But enough about political labels, I\u2019d rather discuss what needs to be done to protect our citizens from lunatics with guns.There should universal background checks for any purchase of any type of firearm. Along with this the minimum age for the purchase of any firearm, whether it be a handgun or any type of rifle. To go with these new changes, the waiting period before one may receive the firearm they purchased should be no less than one week. But this firearm should only be allowed to purchased after a universal background check and an extensive psychological evaluation. Furthermore, AR-15s and anything like an AR-15 should only be sold to a person if they have undergone the aforementioned checks and evaluations plus a significant amount of training and a final evaluation ending in a special license that must be renewed every year for continued legal use.*Part 2*So after all these changes are in place we should live in a safer and more controlled environment. I agree with the liberal leaning articles written by John Paul Stevens and Steve Israel, that more reform needs to come speedily and that with marches and midterm elections we can help get representatives that actually care about our safety. Furthermore I agree with Brad S. Karp and H. Christopher Boehning that the government should stop shielding gun producing companies and gun selling companies from wrong doing with the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. But ultimately I agree with the more republican belief that the shooter is more to blame than the gun they are wielding._________I personally think Hovnanian\u2019s exhibit is a fantastic idea, however, I personally would not visit the exhibit. I feel like although the exhibit is nicely crafted, it suggests to people visiting that nature need not be explored, as it can be simulated by humanity at will. It\u2019s immersive, sure, but I think that a similar feeling could be achieved just watching some nature walk videos on Youtube, or playing a videogame in a natural setting. I usually get my \u201cnature fix\u201d through a daily walk, from my highschool back to my house. I live in an area which contains a large diversity of plants from neighbor to neighbor, and it\u2019s interesting to see all the biodiversity in one area. What I enjoy the most about nature, though, is the fact that it changes, often unpredictably. Sometimes an area might suddenly fill with beautiful violet flowers, or sometimes a bird might stop right in front of you to eat a worm. You never know what you might discover next. Simply observing these patterns has really allowed me to open my mind, they\u2019ve given me countless ideas for designs when I create art. I think observing something so beautiful that we have no control over opens our minds to inspiration. That\u2019s why I\u2019d much rather the nature-deprived people of today go to a real park, than Hovnanian\u2019s exhibit. Though I appreciate Hovnanian\u2019s efforts in constructing such an exhibit, I believe that no amount of human effort put into creating simulations could match the eons of creation that nature took.Personally I have never been a nature girl. I like the outdoors when it comes to lounging around in the sun and spending my days at the beach, but hiking and camping has never been my thing. I would much rather enjoy a day in the sun hearing the waves crashing, then a night filled with hiking to a camp site and setting up a tent before dark not to mention those pesky mosquitoes. I\u2019ve been camping several times with my family and it can be relaxing to unplug, but also stressful planning for meals and getting there with all the proper equipment. I think Ms. Hovnanian has a very good idea about creating an environment that can surround you with a relaxing atmosphere to unplug from your busy lives. I would definitely be willing to try her immersion room. I think this room would be good for people who would like to escape into a calm and tranquil atmosphere, but not deep into the woods. I would love to see the effects of how it made me feel and experiencing a different form of \u201cnature\u201d.I am constantly outside, but in a suburban environment that\u2019s not always enough for your \u201cnature fix.\u201d Personally, camping and boating are the two things that truly satisfy my need to see nature. Every year me and my friends get out in the woods and pretty much rough it for a couple days. Bringing only small amounts of food, water, and clothing makes it a challenge to live and sleep comfortably. For me, life is all about escaping that comfort zone that so many of us live our entire lives in. Like Rachel says, I also think it is very healthy to \u201cnot do much of anything in nature.\u201d Taking in all the scenery and enjoying the silence is a good way to relieve yourself of the stress and anxiety that comes with living in a city.Hovnanian suggests that nature can enhance our imaginations; I would add that the benefits of nature pervade our entire beings, heightening our emotional, spiritual, and even physical health. I get my nature fix by taking late night walks with my dog. Staring into a vast expanse of darkness scattered with a sea of luminous stars, I begin digging through all of the emotions, the delusions, the daily routines, the expectations, the distractions. Only then am I free to be firmly ground in reality. Anyone who knows me well knows that I would trade my phone for the NDD immersion room any day.Having the chance to view pictures of the \u201cNDD Immersion Room\u201d from a silly laptop was a magical experience itself. It all seems like an unreal experience, and I give credit to Rachel Lee Hovnanian: the inventor of this nature room. Being a Boy Scout, I can personally relate to this kind of magic nature has created. Whether it be camping on the beach, the woods or even in the mountains I often like to go on a walk - a walk without my phone. Without the worry of catching a call, beating my opponents in clash royale or looking up some overdramatic celebrity news, I can connect with the real world. A world much like the \u201cNDD Immersion Room\u201d, but actually real. A world where you can actually touch these huge trees and not just imagine their presence. A world where you can actually see a grasshopper eye to eye, not in a locked glass box. I love the idea of the nature room, I truly do, it\u2019s just not enough nature for me. It\u2019s a nature walk for me that connects me with nature, not being locked in a room surrounded by tree wallpaper and living life locked inside of a box.I spent my summers in my dirty converse shoes, among the trees, arms and legs (and sometimes hair) covered in tree sap. I built hammocks in my giant willow trees and read for hours as the (slightly structurally unsound) branches swayed with the breeze. When I was little the outdoors were a place of great imagination and exploration. The first time I climbed up this massive pine tree near my house, I gazed at the endless sky and I was filled with both contentment and wonder. Many summers my sister and I used to pretend we were warrior cats inspired by a book series she was reading at the time. We collected moss and dandelions to create little homes for ourselves outdoors and pretended to fight the villains of the novel. I now get my nature fix haphazardly and spontaneously. On the first really good day of spring, I\u2019ll look out my window towards my swing set and find myself seconds later bounding towards it. Over spring break, I went with friends to the mountains to explore random trails and ended up climbing up the side of the mountain with them. Nature has always been an invitation to dream and to wonder. It has been the setting of my favorite memories, and been at the root of my own evolution. Although now I am older and have found less time spend outside, I still find myself stealing little moments where I can hide away in the glorious refuge of the outdoors._________Yes, I am included in the epidemic of vaping devices affecting teenagers today. Why? Ask our Gen X parents, who smoked cigarettes. Or our baby boomer grandparents, who smoked cigarettes as well. It seems that teenagers always gravitate towards trying new things that their peers are doing. Although I don\u2019t own a vaping device myself, almost all of my friends do. If you walk into the girls bathroom at any given time you will see 5+ girls crowded in a stall, all vaping together. In the bathroom near the cafeteria, the handicapped stall is widely regarded as the \u201cvaping stall.\u201d Someone even wrote, \u201cVape gods only!\u201d on the wall. The issue here is no teenager will regard it as an issue. Almost everyone I know vapes regularly, or has at least tried it. However, I only know a handful of people who have smoked cigarettes. Many kids don\u2019t know the detrimental effects that vape devices have on your health, and frankly, many of them don\u2019t care, because they think cigarettes are much worse. Though I applaud the efforts of Cape Elizabeth High School to help kids who are struggling with addiction, I honestly don\u2019t think that will make a difference. If teens are already vaping, they aren\u2019t going to stop. Instead, we should focus on teaching kids not to vape in the first place. There is such a stigma around cigarettes that many teens view it as \u201cgross\u201d or \u201ctrashy\u201d if someone smokes them. There should be the same stigma around vaping so that kids won\u2019t be tempted to try it in the first place.I do not vape but my school has a major problem with it. There are always several students that are skipping class and they are vaping. There has always been students smoking at the school but vaping is now doing it none stop. The schools consonsinquenes are not doing anything. Students will get caught and they will just take and gather in a different spot to continue to vape. The school has only suspended the students for a short period of time and they still just take and find another way to bring the vape right back in to the school. The schools need to make the punishment harsh by suspending the students they catch vaping, confiscate the vape, and make the students do something like community service or even clean the school just because they were vaping. Other students need to speak up if they see someone vaping and report it. The vapes are so popular because students think that by vaping it makes them cooler.Of course I knew about the health effects of vaping but that doesn\u2019t stop us. I\u2019m not surprised with anything in this article and I am sure that everyone at my school who vapes will say the same. So the question from all staff and parents is why do we do it? Well let\u2019s be honest, every generation has their \u201cdrug\u201d or addiction. Schools have tried to crack down on this problem but at the end of the day, there are so many people vaping that I believe that ending the vaping in schools is a lost cause. School if stressful and we practically drive ourselves crazy going through the same routine without anyway to escape from it. For many people vaping is their escape. You can practically get a three minute buzz from hitting a \u201cflash drive\u201d without your teacher catching you. I agree with Kate Zernike with the fact that we vape because students want to \u201crebel\u201d or break loose but let\u2019s accept the fact that vaping has is being used to cope with our strenuous school routine.Personally, I do not see the allure in vaping but see it as a serious health concern in schools and teens. I know people in my school that vape and see it as an uprising problem. I understand that students are stressed and see vaping as a safer option to smoking or drugs, but it is in a way more dangerous because of this. Kids think it\u2019s safer so they are more inclined to do it and to do it frequently. Dr. Mark L. Rubinstein says that due to the lack of research, people can\u2019t identify the risks like they can with smoking, which has had years of research, but the little research that has been done shows scary results. This causes people to falsely assume that it is safer just because there haven\u2019t been extensive studies like cigarettes. It\u2019s concerning that e-cigarette companies direct their sales toward the youth, knowing that they don\u2019t know the side effects. There needs to be more regulation on what these companies can do so we can prevent youth addiction.I kind of laughed at this article. It\u2019s interesting to see how adults perceive this issue and our reasoning. \u201cIt\u2019s the one risky thing that you can do in your life \u2014 with little consequence, in their mind \u2014 to show that you\u2019re a little bit of a rebel.\u201d I can\u2019t speak for everyone, but I can speak for my friends and I, who have our juul\u2019s shoved up our sleeves and write on bathroom walls \u201cvape gods only\u201d, that we are completely aware and completely unconcerned with the consequences. We are not addicted however to the nicotine, we are addicted to any and everything that is a breath of fresh are, anything that makes us feel little less like clones to our school system. We roam the roads at 4 in the morning stealing traffic cones and 79 cent drink signs from gas stations all while sucking so hard on a mango pod that your whole body gets pins and needles from the nicotine. We get so bored in class we see how many hits it takes to not be able to walk straight. We do everything our parents told us not to because we might as well have raised ourselves. We do everything our teachers tell us not to because we could run our high school better than any of the oblivious adults that sit behind their desks. The more time I spend in a classroom listening to people being \u201cprofound\u201d the more I want to go 80 out of the parking lot with my head out the sunroof screaming to let all the prisoners know that we escaped. Instead I breathe in mint vapor and doze off to the sound of my teachers voice.The smoke may disappear within seconds but the issue of vaping in schools is a constant struggle. At first it shocked me how many people at my high school vaped, but I quickly became desensitized to it. I began noticing people all around me vaping - the shocking part wasn\u2019t that they were vaping, rather that they would do it right underneath the teacher\u2019s nose. Take a quick glance to the back corner of the classroom and you will most likely find someone trying to stealthily vape while the teacher is preoccupied.Abolishing the issue of vaping by threatening to suspend or expel students may work in some cases because most students (first-timers) fear ruining their records. However, there is a population of students who have developed an addiction to vaping and punishments may result in students rebelling and vaping more. Administrators should seek to help students with addictions and teach them about the health consequences.Just like how the vice principal in the article hadn\u2019t noticed the students at his school vaping until he was directly addressed with a student who admitted to it, there is no easy way to completely solve this issue but we have to be more aware of what is happening right under our noses.Before reading this article, I did not even know what vaping was. I do not feel that vaping is a problem at my school. I have never heard of a situation where a student at my school got suspended for this particular problem. May I also add that suspension is the worst resolution to the problem. The immense psychological issue that correlates to vaping is much too extraordinary to be resolved under suspension. I do, however, like the implementation of therapy as a solution to vaping in schools, it is much more effective than suspension. I also want to bring up the Idea of exposure to the education of these vaping sources as a solution. I believe that a potential cause of the growth of vapers is peer pressure and more specifically gearing to pressure to engage in an unknown substance. If I, for example, had to be given vaping product by peers, I would be ignorant to the potential dangers in the substances. My ignorance could have led to peer influence by which my peer could have presented the substance to me as something harmless and I may have indulged in the substance as a result of my ignorance. The message that I want to reflect is that teens need that kind of education before the problem get uncontrollable so that they don\u2019t fall under their own ignorance.I know a fair number of people who vape, young and old. I have never been supportive of any ideas of smoking whether it is under the facade of a \u201cmore safe\u201d technological device or not. I think that the variety in how much money people spend on cigarettes over E-cigarettes is not large, but I do know some people who vaping has helped reduce their smoking habits. Even with Ashley Gould, the chief administrative officer of Juul saying: \u201cOur product is not only not for kids,\u201d does not feel genuine. Gould may genuinely not want legal trouble, but creating a curriculum that includes mindfulness exercises is not enough to solve this issue.The accessibility of E-cigarettes and the easy ability to carry and hide from the size of Juuls, add nicotine into the mix and you got a problem o your hands. The problem is that E-cigarettes are much better at creating addicts than stopping them. Making E-cigarettes less accessible and spreading views that do not encourage E-cigarette use may help, but just as cigarettes are a cultural problem E-cigarettes will need to be resolved similarly._________I do think the ban on sports betting should be overturned. If people are willing to risk their money on sports betting than they should be perfectly free to do so. It is their own money that they are gambling so they should be allowed to use it on sports betting if they feel they can make even more money. However, I do feel like limits should be placed on how frequent one can make bets in a day. Furthermore, I don\u2019t agree with Mr. Belsky\u2019s quote that March Madness pools are the gateway drugs to serious sports gambling. Although some people who participate in bracket pools or Super Bowl betting may become more interested in the concept of sports betting, for the most part this does not lead to people become serious sports gamblers. People generally have the ability to draw a line between casual sports betting and serious sports betting to the point where they become addicted. If sports betting is made legal I think this could lead to more casual sports fans deciding to bet on their favorite sports teams more often. It could also give those who are not very interested in sports a rooting interest in certain games that they placed bets on. However, some people might turn to sports betting as a consistent source of income which is a negative effect of legalizing sports betting. While sports betting can yield you money, these are gambles that people are making based off events in the future making it difficult to rely on sports betting as consistent income.The act of betting on sports is not immoral in my opinion, although it can lead to other more serious issues, such as point shaving and game fixing. I do not agree with the 1992 federal law banning sports betting in most of the country, as I believe the individuals right to privately and honestly wager on something they love trumps the concern of illegal activity.The March Madness tournament games have been astounding this year, the underdogs giving a good fight for the win. Now if someone asked me about March Madness games any other year than 2018, I would know nothing about the results, statistics or even the game predictions. I just didn\u2019t care enough about the game to make a bracket, and creating one this year reversed my opinion about basketball. With my bracket, I would tune into the games, talk about future predictions with my friends and research the statistics of every participating team. I became a basketball enthusiast in the matter of one tournament. Sports betting is exactly the kind of enjoyable situation I experienced, however there is actually money involved. Making a bracket and keeping up with it does not harm at all, however when money is thrown into the situation, that is when things get ugly. With sports betting comes addiction, and as the article states cheaters. Cheaters who will do anything to win their brackets and win that big money prize. If it was not for sports betting, sports could actually be enjoyed without the constant fear of losing money. Sports betting simply ruins basketball and any other sport it intoxicates.I believe that the ban on sports betting should be overturned. If people want to bet their money on sporting events, they should be free to do so. Although I do believe that there should be some restrictions; for example, one must be at least 18 years old in order to place a bet. I strongly disagree with Belsky\u2019s claim that a March Madness Pool is a \u201cgateway drug\u201d into \u201cmore serious sports gambling.\u201d Yes, the thrill of winning and seeing some of your picks go your way can be quite exciting, but it doesn\u2019t inspire people to take part in actual gambling. Millions of Americans participate in March Madness pools, and the vast majority don\u2019t end up as actual gamblers.If sports betting is made legal, then I think that the whole issue will become much less taboo. You may see more everyday people betting, and unfortunately in some cases, this may lead to the development of an addiction. While some people may be concerned about gamblers influencing the outcome of certain events, I feel that this is less likely since athletes are paid far better than they were in 1919, when the famous \u201cBlack Sox\u201d scandal occurred. I hope that the Supreme Court overturns the ban, but states need to have addiction treatment resources in place. This is the main adverse effect of overturning the ban, but if states have the adequate resources to combat addiction, then the overturn of this ban could be quite positiveI am into college basketball myself, unfortunately I did not make a 2018 D1 bracket. I still am not fully aware of what the law of legalizing sports betting would entail, but I think I am leaning a little more towards the legalization of it. Although I would still consider myself 50/50. I do not agree with Mr.belsky that madness pools are \u201cthe gateway drugs of serious sports gambling\u201d. Basketball is a part of our culture and is something a large amount of the population enjoys, regardless of who they are. If sports betting is made legal, I think it will give basketball a little bit of a boost when it comes to awareness. As I said, plenty of Americans are entertained by watching and participating in the sport themselves, but if this was legalized, awareness for the sport could be raised immensely. Sports are a part of our culture. I do think this is a case that the Supreme Court needs to handle because it is something that is a part of American tradition and has provided entertainment nationwide for decades.I am a believer that there is little harm in sports betting and that the Supreme Court decision should be overturned. Personally, I have made small bets on big games like the Super Bowl for as long as I can remember. Regulating it will allow for more money to be won, or lost. The only difference between sports betting and gambling of other kinds is that the game can be rigged. However, I find that that situation would be extremely unlikely due to the constant media involvement and if the regulations were effective. Sports betting takes place now even though it is illegal, it is just under the table. By making it legal the government would be able to take taxes out of the winnings and gain something from it.Super Bowl Squares and March Madness brackets are something that millions of people do, even when they know very little about the sport. I disagree with Mr. Belsky, I don\u2019t think that betting during those national events is a \u201cgateway drug\u201d. Almost everybody that I know participates in at least one of the two events, and I don\u2019t know anybody that bets on the average seasonal game. I think the term \u201cgateway drug\u201d is very extreme for such an event that brings pleasure and enjoyment to so many people. I would call them more of a bonding experience than anything. It becomes the go to conversation and can create friendships and friendly competition in schools and workplaces. I am a strong believer that the court case should be overturned and sports betting should be legalized.This year is the first year I started getting into sports betting. I joined a fantasy football league with my friends and won first place and got $100. I also entered a super bowl square sheet with my dad. I won $50 and my dad won $100. I also entered a march madness bracket and placed third in my bracket. I entered all of these for the excitement and also to have something cool to do with my friends. I think there is nothing wrong with sports betting as long as it is minimal and you don\u2019t become addicted to it. If you blow $1,000 on sports betting then you might need a little help. The joy of competing with your friends is exciting. If you participate every year with your friends, I believe that is okay. I do believe sports betting should be legalized. There is nothing wrong with it, as long as it is not a huge amount of money._________Homework therapist. WOW! I would love something like that! But you know what? If I will rely on private tutor that will help me do my homework, and calm me down anytime I feel stressed, first of all my family will be a bankrupt (while this tutoring might not even help, like in the story with SAT mentioned in the article), and second of all this tutor will need to move to my house, because I will need to be next to him all the time.But what happens next? Next I will get really addicted to always being helped with my stress, I won\u2019t be able to deal with it myself, and there will be stress in life. Although right now we all think this is the most stressful time in our lives that\u2019s not true. Life will be tough, and if we don\u2019t learn how to deal with it right now, it going to be a disaster.This is however, my own opinion, and a homework therapist is not going to help me. But the article gives a good example of how beneficial for some people this solution might be.Ms. Ansbro is one of many students who worked with Dr. Levy-Warren (a \u201chomework therapist\u201d) and gained a lot from her lessons. Without Dr. Levy, Mellora Ansbro probably would not have applied to graduate school and wouldn\u2019t know what to do next.This shows how individual the problem is.While some students need to just power through it, some students need to listen to music and some students need a private tutor. But the \u201cneed\u201d of tutor should be severe and you should have a good explanation of why you need it.You bet I need a homework therapist. Absolutely surprising but studies have actually shown that teenagers cannot survive off of zero to three hours of sleep a night. Crazy, right? When seven thirty to three thirty are devoted to sitting in desks and four thirty to seven thirty are devoted to physical activity and eight to to three am are devoted to homework, where is the time left to sleep? I signed up for my strenuous school schedule in hopes of receiving a scholarship for college because my family is not made of money. Unlike the people in the article receiving the \u201chomework therapy\u201d my parents cannot afford to send me to a private high school, let alone a private college.You would also think that if the students are so busy with so much homework, they wouldn\u2019t have the time for hour-long sessions devoted to talking about their homework instead of actually doing it. Although I would love to learn how to manage my homework more properly, nothing can be more efficient than what I do now: plug and chug.So, maybe after all I won\u2019t be needing that homework therapy: my session can be taken by a teacher who needs to learn the limits of teenagers as well as the already rigorous schedules thrown at them before hours of ultimately useless homework is thrown at them.I think that Jocelyn is totally right. My family isn\u2019t made of money either and I have to take harder classes in order to hopefully get a scholarship. I think that teachers should be the ones taking these sessions as well. While I understand that honors and AP classes are supposed to be challenging, 3 hours of homework from just one class is absolutely ridiculous.I\u2019ve always been skeptical of homework therapists, application counselors, and everything of the sort. However, this doubt comes from my own personality. I prefer to work alone no matter the task- school projects, essay writing, homework. It feels too chaotic to have someone else adding their own ideas and thought processes to something that\u2019s already bothersome.But my view of school advisors changed when I started meeting with a college counselor once a month. Like any high school student, I am very anxious about college and doing just the right thing for applications. Nonetheless, this college counselor helped me sort out my current goals and how to achieve them. It took a load of stress off of me to know that someone accomplished in this field was guiding me through the process.Homework therapists can seem excessive, since the whole point of homework is for an individual to learn and display their own thoughts. But when you think about the new amounts of pressure students have from school as well as extracurriculars, these therapists can seem like a necessity. As the article states, tutoring is a 100 billion dollar industry, and homework therapists are just a new addition. From these facts it\u2019s obvious that students do feel more comfortable with a pro in a specific subject or just have someone working with them. So even though I\u2019m not completely sold on the idea of homework therapists, I can\u2019t knock it till I\u2019ve tried it.Everyday, I dread going to school because of the homework, projects, and tests they assign. It causes me to stay up late every night and stresses me out to the point that I have mental breakdowns. I don\u2019t really have a way to deal with the stress. I usually just power through it, put on some music, and sometimes I just have to stop working on my assignments and go to bed. It works for me, but I still get stressed very easily.A homework therapist is not necessary. The parents in New York paying $200 to $600 just to have someone nudge their kids to finish an assignment is ludicrous. As the article mentions, the therapists also help with SAT prep and subject tutoring, but I think it\u2019s ridiculous that parents pay so much money for something their kids can go to their teacher and ask for help with. My brother got a tutor for SAT prep the second time he took it, but he ended up getting the same score so it was pretty pointless spending so much money on it when there are free websites that offer specialized practice tests with tips on taking the SAT.The article also mentions how some homework therapists will tell their teenagers to create Spotify playlists to express their mood or hand out scented putty to calm them down. This coddles these teenagers way too much. It\u2019s important to be calm when in stressful situations, but we need to learn to deal with our own problems and not someone treating us like we\u2019re five years old and handing us a ball of Play-Doh or a coloring book.There are so many times where I feel overwhelmed with homework or studying. Sometimes I have to do both for one class, not to mention the homework I have for my 3 other core classes and 2 academic electives. I manage my time pretty well but I still feel like it is impossible to get everything done. Especially towards the end of the year, around testing time. Reviewing, homework, new lessons, studying, tests, there\u2019s so much going on and it\u2019s very stressful. To help sometimes I ask my friends for help, if we can work on something together or if they can help me understand something better and complete it faster it helps a lot. For a lot of students grades are the cause of stress. We\u2019re taught that if if you don\u2019t do your homework then you don\u2019t understand the lesson, you not only get a zero for homework but you,\u201d also get one on the test, if you don\u2019t pass the test then you won\u2019t pass the EOC, if you don\u2019t pass the EOC then you don\u2019t pass the class, equaling a low GPA, which means you don\u2019t get into college. At least, that\u2019s what stresses me out.__________I would definitely, unofficially, characterize myself as a germaphobe. I hold doors open with my shoe, avoid touching handrails, and immediately wash my hands after coming home from any public place. However, I don\u2019t always think about more \u201cinnocent\u201d ways bacteria are spread, like through my phone. The article states that a cell phone contains 10 times more bacteria than the average toilet seat. Yikes. This definitely makes sense, though. Usually, a person has their phone 24/7, wherever they go, placing it on random surfaces, and then making contact with it. As for diseases in bath toys, we probably shouldn\u2019t be using any bathroom object for more than a couple months- toys and razors alike. I have never used a loofah after reading a terrifying article about how quickly mold can grow in them.So unless we come up with a disease repelling rubber duck, we should probably put a time limit on the use of a particular squeaky bacteria breeding ground.I tend to worry about keeping germs off of myself. I have serious allergies and I usually get sick pretty easily, to limit my infections I try to stay clean frequently. But I stayed oblivious to the the sanitation of the objects around me. When I eat or use the bathroom, I make sure I wash my hands, but little consideration was made when I use my phone that has been with me and my adventures for the last 5-6 years. I can imagine that device is a planet of microorganisms suffering from overpopulation. No wonder my allergies are so bad, I just went from washing up a few minutes ago to cleaning my kitchen with a filthy cloth, to typing on a microbe infested keyboard while maintaining he habit of scratching my hair and face. It is obvious that just keeping myself sanitized isn\u2019t enough. To stay healthy I should consider keeping the stuff I use and interact with in my house sanitized.Germs are literally everywhere. There\u2019s no way to avoid them. So why are people so scared of them? I grew up not worrying that much about germs. Yes, I washed my hands before I ate and I never put my hands in my mouth. Okay, I swear I\u2019m not disgusting, my mom just realized that, as kids, there was going to be no way we could avoid all the germs that we are susceptible to throughout the day and wasn\u2019t a control freak about it. I mean, I wasn\u2019t more sick than the average kid.According to the article, there were over 350 different species of germs found 14 dirty kitchen sponges. Even to someone who isn\u2019t a germaphobe, that sounds gross. The sponges we use to clean our dishes that we eat off of are completely covered in germs. Worse than that, there is, on average 200 times more more fecal bacteria on a cutting board than a toilet seat. Now that\u2019s disgusting!Although I grew up being less weary about germs than the average person, I still like to be healthy. After reading this article, I feel the need to wash my hands.What doesn\u2019t kill you makes you stronger, and that about sums up my thoughts on germs. The thought of germs never passes my mind on a normal day, and in the rare occasion that it does I just imagine my immune system becoming stronger. My personal belief is that everyday germs can help strengthen my immune system. Why would I waste my time worrying about some microscopic germs when I could put that time into changing the world. Germs aren\u2019t my enemies, their my friends.I think its a great thing that nowadays we are much more aware of the negative affects of germs on our body, knowing how to prevent germs and where to find them. That our innocent little rubber duckies as stated in the article have the capacity to make us sick for days, week even. Growing up my mom was very aware of germs, being diagnosed type 1 diabetic at a very young age made me prone to infections, so she was always on the lookout, clorox wipe in hand. On the other hand was my dad, who thought \u201cHey if God made dirt then dirt don\u2019t hurt.\u201d So as I got older I fell somewhere between the spectrum at a solid, \u201cI know germs exist but I\u2019ll pass on the rubber gloves, thanks\u201d range. But knowing it can have a great impact on my health definitely keeps me alert, the flu to me is scarier than the boogie monster and the tickle monster combined.The thought of germs being basically everywhere has always lurked in the back of my mind, but I\u2019ve never really had that universal fear of them in everyday life. I follow the average American when it comes to clearing germs such as washing my hands well, taking showers, using hand sanitizer, and other simple things. However, I don\u2019t believe it needs to be taken too far. Reports showing hundreds or thousands of types of bacteria on daily, frequently used items, in my opinion are not truly helping anyone. Stated in the article, a microbiologist found that cellphones contain 10 times more bacteria than a toilet seat. Now, that definitely sounds intimidating, but how is it necessarily helping?. I mean, maybe people are more aware and use soap and hand sanitizer more often, but other people might genuinely become scared. It does seem like a scary thing, especially when there are so many people around us getting sick, but at the same time just because you have a phone doesn\u2019t mean you are going to get sick, which is why I feel like some of these studies, though true, exaggerate the harm of germs and bacteria. I am all for keeping clean and staying away from germs, and I don\u2019t think there is anything wrong with being a \u201cgermaphobe.\u201d However, at the same time I wish not all would try to influence some people to a point where fear comes from daily items.__________Teachers build the foundations of our lives. Without them, life would just be blank. Today teachers are very underappreciated, they provide us with knowledge that will eventually help us build a life for ourselves, of course they deserve better pay.Most teachers that I have met are passionate about helping their students learn and grow throughout their time at school. Some teachers even go above and beyond to make sure that their students are receiving the best education that they can.My Latin teacher is making his own latin textbooks from scratch because he feels that the worn-down and heavily outdated textbooks that we have now, don\u2019t provide us with enough information to fully understand and benefit from the course. He also spends most of his summer break planning for his classes for the following school year, instead of going to the beach and relaxing. One day during lunch, he even made my friends and I tea. He\u2019s a teacher who cares, and he\u2019s also a teacher who gets paid very poorly. Teachers like him deserve more, they deserve a higher pay.Public schools also deserve more money, as long as it goes to a good cause. I think that public schools should receive more funds that go to new textbooks, or more classrooms. Not to new gyms that don\u2019t even fit the entire school. No school needs two gyms. I think that the funds need to be specifically aimed towards benefiting student\u2019s education.I think teachers should be paid more. I think they should be paid more, because they do a lot for the kids and for their future. Teachers have an average pay of $55,000 a year, and that is too low for what they do. I think it should be raised to $62,000 a year, because they have to deal with annoying kids, overwhelming papers to grade, and give kids better paying jobs than what they have. In conclusion, i think they should be paid more, because they deserve it.In a world where our government spent twenty seven million dollars teaching Moroccans how to make pottery, five thousand dollars to produce a film about a pretty good fiddler, and sixty six thousand dollars to determine what bugs do near light-bulbs, I think it is terrible that we somehow can\u2019t find the adequate funds to pay some of the hardest working and most important people to our future. I believe in small government, however I also believe in public education and I think that one of the most essential duties of government is to provide a good education system for their citizens, and that is simply not possible when teacher pay remains stagnant. The teachers walking out in Oklahoma and Kentucky are courageous and I applaud their efforts and wish them to the best of luck.Of course teachers should be paid more. Eventually, if their salary keeps decreasing, who\u2019s going to even WANT to be a teacher, anymore? People will eventually start to quit and look for better jobs, and nobody will want to become a teacher. I believe that teachers should at LEAST make a more significant amount above standard minimum wage.As for public schooling - yes, I do believe that we need more funding. It\u2019s depressing to come to school everyday, and see just how unfunded we are. My school has actually started limiting copies, so now, most of my work is online - rarely ever on paper. I\u2019m also in the band program at my school, and our conversations often correlate back to how poorly funded we are. Lots of our instruments and sound systems need replacing, we\u2019re in need of some new uniforms and repairs, and we also need props for our marching shows, and money to pay for expenses - but, that\u2019s all a distant dream. The most we ever get is money for the buses, and maybe a new speaker, and a new flute.So, in short - yes. Teachers deserve a high raise in pay, and public schools need to be funded better.Teachers are the backbone of this country. Public education has taken so many young minds and turned them into amazing thinkers, just like the lady in the video said, \u201cthey need top dollar.\u201d Right now, their funding is not cutting it. I firmly believe that educators in this country are criminally underpaid and under rewarded. These teachers are creating a newer generation of complex and understanding thinkers and we\u2019ve decided to brutally underpay them for doing so. This problem NEEDS to be fixed. If we don\u2019t value teachers for what they\u2019re actually worth, there\u2019s no hope for our future generations.The article mentions the need for political action in the upcoming election in November and I couldn\u2019t agree more. The most effective route to take with this problem is strong political activism and change. Both voting for senators that will actually make a change and continuing to protest will greatly help their cause. It is also mentioned in the article that teachers in Oklahoma make $7,000 dollars less than the average teacher in America. This is just abysmal, teachers should be making the 20% extra that they are trying so hard to achieve. Our nation has to have a higher standard of pay. For years we have taken public educators for granted but that stops now.Teachers need better pay, and simply schools need more funding. I have known a few teachers that have moved out of state, because of how low the pay is, but the problem is there really is not anywhere that teachers are getting paid enough. It is interesting to me that these recent movement have gained so much strength with lawmakers and even their unions that are not taking action for rights. Although West Virginia is what got teachers thinking they can make change, it is the use and coordination of the internet, specifically Facebook, that has allowed these protests to be so effective.It also interests me how political it is becoming. Supporting learning is something that is universal, but not only are Republican states getting hard hit for their budget cuts, but Democrats are trying to capitalize on it. Just as teachers should try to be unbiased; lawmakers so invest in education. It still fills me with awe that something that so closely correlated with economic success, lack of crime, and health, things that would lead to less spending in other area of government.Imagine a scenario where we didn\u2019t acclaim athletes for their countless trophies or models for their unrealistically proportioned bodies. Where the price to watch a football game is pocket change and the store hands out magazines like food samples. Who is the new power, magnet of media, and ruler of revenue? The teacher.Now, at first, this situation may be bizzare, imagining your Math teacher as the new Lebron James or the Spelling Bee as big as the Super Bowl. But, ask yourself, why adults who kick/throw/hit a ball, or real-life action figures, rolling in more bread annually, than a baker, much less a teacher, would see in their life?Honestly, I\u2019m surprised there needs to be a debate about raising a teacher\u2019s salary from the abysmal $40-$50k range. Just consider their line of work: mentoring future generations, who are currently irritating kids. As in any job, the quality of educators vary, but employing a merit system would reward teachers who already engage students, plus convince others to improve their methods. However, the current system has caused schools to sacrifice salary/supplies for years, building a \u201cmartyr mentality\u201d, according to Mr. Karvelis. Unfortunately, this mindset compels many people considering teaching to search instead for a more lucrative profession. Meanwhile, government expenses surge in other areas deemed more important to our future. As mentioned in the article, politicians must realize that this issue isn\u2019t partisan, it\u2019s just common sense._________Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Might Happen to Amazon\u2019s Profit if It Paid Its Workers More?", "Date": "2018-04-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Good Monday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 What might happen to Amazon\u2019s bottom line if it paid its workers more?\u2022 Sears shares jumped after ESL called on the Sears to sell the Kenmore brand.\u2022 Walmart is said to be close to gaining a majority stake in Flipkart.\u2022 Mike Bloomberg opened his wallet for climate change.\u2022 Learn more about \u201ctransshipping,\u201d one of President Trump\u2019s big trade bugbears.What might happen to Amazon\u2019s bottom line if it paid its workers more? This question may become more pressing if labor shortages start to force companies to up their pay to attract and retain employees.Amazon does not disclose its total compensation expense, so it\u2019s not possible for outsiders to accurately compute what would happen to profits if it raised pay.But the disclosure of median pay provides a little insight. Under S.E.C. rules, public companies must now disclose the median pay figure for all their employees. In annual filings, that number is then compared with the pay of the chief executive. In Amazon\u2019s case, the $1,681,840 that Jeff Bezos earned in 2017 was 59 times that of the median employee, a lower ratio than exists at other large public companies.One way to get a rough proxy for a company\u2019s overall compensation expense is to multiply its median pay number by its total number of employees. For Amazon, that would produce a purely hypothetical compensation expense of $16.1 billion (566,000 employees times $28,466.)Increasing Amazon\u2019s median pay number by 10 percent would bump the $28,466 up to $31,313, and the putative compensation expense would rise to $17.7 billion. Such an increase would have cut Amazon\u2019s $3.8 billion of pretax income in 2017 by 42 percent to $2.2 billion. A 20 percent raise would have slashed those earnings by 85 percent.How does Amazon stack up against Walmart? The C.E.O. of Walmart, Doug McMillion, made $22.8 million in the company\u2019s latest fiscal year. That sum was 1,188 times as large as the median employee\u2019s pay of $19,177 (a number that excludes some foreign employees.)At Walmart, increasing the hypothetical compensation expense would have less of an impact on earnings. A 10 percent increase would reduce Walmart\u2019s latest annual pretax profits by 28 percent, while a 20 percent pay increase would lower profits by 56 percent.There are two ways to view such numbers. One is that retail is a cutthroat business and wages cannot rise by much if a company is going to be healthily profitable. The other is that large retailers have used their heft to lower as many of their costs as possible, including wages.\u2014 Peter Eavis\u2022 Net profit jumped 73% to $9.4 billion in the first quarter, up from $5.4 billion a year ago.\u2022 Earnings per share came in at $13.33 per share, beating analyst estimates of $9.28 per share.\u2022 The company reported a $3 billion, or about $3.40 a share, gain on equity securities in the first quarter.\u2022 Sales rose to $31.1 billion, beating the consensus estimate of $30.3 billion.Shares of Alphabet bounced around after hours. The stock rose as much as 2.2 percent but is now down slightly.Critics\u2019 cornerRobert Cryan of Breakingviews writes:\u201cThe tech group\u2019s $9.4 billion of earnings in the first quarter came with new noise after it adjusted the way it accounts for investments like ride-hailing app Uber, moved some smart-home appliances into Google and started stressing \u201cimpressions\u201d over clicks. Investors wanting concrete measurements are getting squishy ones instead.\u201dShares of Sears Holding are up about 4 percent in recent trading on Mr. Lampert\u2019s latest attempt to save the troubled retailer.In a letter to the Sears board, Mr. Lampert, whose ESL Investments hedge fund owns a controlling stake in the company, said ESL would also be willing to buy the retailer\u2019s home-services and its appliance-parts units.Mr. Lampert offered to pay Sears $500 million for the home-services and appliance-parts units, but did not mention a price for the Kenmore brand or the real estate. He noted that the company had been trying to sell the assets for nearly two years, but had failed to find other buyers.Mr. Lampert is Sears\u2019s chief executive. Any deal involving Sears and Mr. Lampert is complicated by his dual roles running both the retailer and the hedge fund, which is also a major Sears lender.Mr. Lampert said in his letter that he would recuse himself from any board discussions about his proposal. Any deal would need to be approved by a majority of Sears shareholders not affiliated with ESL, the letter said.\u2014 Michael CorkeryMargrethe Vestager, the European Union\u2019s competition commissioner, said in a statement:\u201cThe way people listen to music has changed significantly in recent years, with more and more Europeans using music streaming services. Our investigation aims to ensure that music fans will continue to enjoy attractive music streaming offers and won\u2019t face less choice as a result of this proposed merger.\u201dThe European Commission is concerned that Shazam\u2019s strong position in music recognition would enable Apple to \u201cobtain access to commercially sensitive data about customers of its competitors.\u201d\u201cAccess to such data could allow Apple to directly target its competitors\u2019 customers and encourage them to switch to Apple Music. As a result, competing music streaming services could be put at a competitive disadvantage.\u201dThe European Commission has until Sept. 4 to finish its investigation.Apple reached a deal to buy Shazam for roughly $400 million in December.Why it\u2019s important: Both Walmart and Amazon have hungrily watched India, where the e-commerce market trails only the U.S. and China in terms of size but where foreign retailers have struggled. But don\u2019t expect Amazon, Flipkart\u2019s biggest rival, to give up.What the parties said about the deal\u2022 Michael Polk, Newell\u2019s C.E.O.: \u201cThis agreement will enable the Company to now focus exclusively on the execution of our transformation plans and our efforts to strengthen our financial and operational performance.\u201d\u2022 Mr. Icahn: \u201cI am pleased that we were able to facilitate peace between the company and Starboard. Given that the company has so many more pressing priorities, this is clearly the best outcome for all shareholders.\u201d\u2022 Jeff Smith, Starboard\u2019s C.E.O.: \u201cWe are confident this newly reconstituted board will bring a refreshed sense of urgency, oversight, and accountability to Newell.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la MercedThe former N.Y.C. mayor has shown he has no problem speaking out on his personal causes, even if they\u2019re in opposition to President Trump\u2019s policies. And he\u2019s willing to put his own money to work as well.Mike Schroepfer, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, will appear on Thursday before the British government committee investigating fake news and social media following the Cambridge Analytica scandal. (No Mark Zuckerberg this time.)The issue: Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks appear rooted in personal animus, clouding what others feel are legitimate criticisms. Matt Stoller of the Open Markets Institute told the NYT, \u201cWhat he\u2019s doing is a threat to democracy, but so is Amazon.\u201dThe problem: Customers often aren\u2019t notified when money is transferred; customers are subjected to phishing attacks that drain money from their accounts; buyers have no protections if sellers don\u2019t provide paid-for goods.Why it matters: Banks want their share of digital payments, and 18 so far have signed up with Zelle.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mark Zuckerberg Meets With Top Lawmakers Before Hearings", "Date": "2018-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, tried to get ahead of a week of intense scrutiny for him and his company by visiting several top lawmakers in Washington on Monday and reiterating how sorry he was for the social network\u2019s failings.The prospect that Mr. Zuckerberg, a 33-year-old billionaire, will be taken to task on Capitol Hill has created intense interest and a media circus. On Monday, he was trailed by more than a dozen television cameras and numerous reporters when he exited the office of Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida and a Senate Commerce Committee leader. Mr. Zuckerberg said nothing as he strode out of an Senate office elevator, accompanied by Joel Kaplan, Facebook\u2019s vice president for global public policy, who is based in Washington, and Brian Rice, a leading Democratic lobbyist for the social network, among others.Mr. Nelson, who met with Mr. Zuckerberg for an hour, said the chief executive was taking the situation \u201cseriously.\u201dBut when asked whether the meeting helped assuage his concerns about Facebook\u2019s privacy violations, Mr. Nelson said, \u201cCount me as skeptical.\u201d He also said it was to be determined whether Facebook would be able to stave off more foreign disruption in the American midterm elections this fall.\u201cI think he\u2019s trying,\u201d Mr. Nelson said of Mr. Zuckerberg, \u201cbut I think if we don\u2019t get our arms around this, none of us is going to have any privacy anymore.\u201dStaff for Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, said Mr. Zuckerberg and the senator were scheduled to meet on Monday. In addition, Mr. Zuckerberg met with the Judiciary Committee leaders, Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, and Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, according to a person briefed on the visits, who asked not to be named because the information was not public.Senator Grassley did not respond to a request for comment. Mr. Thune\u2019s and Ms. Feinstein\u2019s offices confirmed the meetings with Mr. Zuckerberg but declined to elaborate.\u201cWe didn\u2019t take a broad enough view of our responsibility, and that was a big mistake,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said in prepared testimony. \u201cIt was my mistake, and I\u2019m sorry. I started Facebook, I run it, and I\u2019m responsible for what happens here.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg added that Facebook must do more to protect its users\u2019 personal information and summarized some of the measures the Silicon Valley company is taking to lock down the data privacy of its more than 2.2 billion members. Those include blocking app developers from gaining access to the data of users who have been inactive for three months, restricting the ability of users to inadvertently share information about others in their networks and adopting stricter permissions guidelines and search features.In recent days, Facebook also suspended two data analytics companies for inappropriately gathering data from their platform. AggregateIQ, a Canadian firm associated with Cambridge Analytica, was suspended on Friday, Facebook said. The company was accused of using data inappropriately harvested from Facebook to support the \u201cVote Leave\u201d campaign for Britain to exit the European Union.Facebook also said it had suspended CubeYou for inappropriately harvesting data, using tactics similar those of Cambridge Analytica. The company collected information on Facebook users through quizzes. CNBC, which earlier reported the firm\u2019s suspension, said people had been misled into believing the quizzes would be used for nonprofit academic research; instead, the data was sold to marketers.\u201cOur apps and activity on Facebook have been subject to regular audits and reviews with the company,\u201d a CubeYou spokeswoman said. She added that the company was in compliance with Facebook\u2019s data policy and rules and that CubeYou\u2019s terms informed users that their data would be used for academic and business research purposes.Yet even as Facebook suspended data firms and took other actions over data privacy, worries about what can be posted on the social network continued. Facebook confirmed on Monday that it had removed a popular Facebook page with nearly 700,000 followers that was associated with the Black Lives Matter movement after it was discovered to be inauthentic.The commission\u2019s goal, Mr. Zuckerberg wrote, \u201cis both to get the ideas of leading academics on how to address these issues as well as to hold us accountable for making sure we protect the integrity of these elections on Facebook.\u201dThe researchers chosen to participate will have access to privacy-protected sets of Facebook data, but only after being vetted by a review board, external privacy experts, and Facebook\u2019s privacy and research review teams. The company said it would not review or approve the researchers\u2019 findings before they are published.Financing for the project is being provided by, among others, the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, the Charles Koch Foundation and the Omidyar Network.\u201cBut there is much more to do \u2014 and we don\u2019t have all the answers,\u201d they said.Cecilia Kang reported from Washington, Tiffany Hsu from New York and Sheera Frenkel from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Twitter, Facebook, Slack: Using Every Tool to Hear What Readers Think", "Date": "2018-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech We\u2019re UsingHow do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Hanna Ingber, editorial director of The Times\u2019s Reader Center, discussed the tech she\u2019s using.We use a variety of tools to listen to our readers and respond to them. We need that variety because readers are talking about our coverage on so many different platforms \u2014 our own site, Twitter, Facebook and more. Plus, there are readers contacting us directly by email and phone. We even received a letter in the mail \u2014 which I promptly Instagrammed.Twitter can be very useful for quickly knowing how readers are reacting to our coverage, but it\u2019s also very noisy. The social media dashboard Tweetdeck makes a big difference. I set up columns that help me sort through the high volume of tweets and find the ones that are most important to me. For example, I have a column that shows me every time a tweet mentioning The New York Times is getting a lot of attention.Facebook is also crucial to our work. We can use it to get feedback on our coverage and reach out to our readers, asking them about the news or their communities.We also use email, and the comments system on our site. Plus, our colleagues send us interesting or useful feedback they spot through our Reader Center Slack group.And then there\u2019s text message. My brother-in-law happens to be very good at spotting criticism of our coverage that is bubbling up on Twitter and probably will deserve our attention. On the weekends, when I am less active on Twitter, he\u2019s my early warning system.What could be better?Many of our colleagues wish they had a better sense of what our readers are saying about their coverage. There is a lot of feedback to keep up with and sort through. We\u2019d love to have a tool that would enable us to aggregate reader feedback (emails, social media posts, comments and more) in a faster and more systematic way.You\u2019ve invested time in coming up with creative ways to use social media. What are some of your favorite uses of social media sites like Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat or Instagram? Twitter is also an indispensable tool for journalists and just about anyone else to be part of a conversation about the news as it\u2019s unfolding.While journalists are on Twitter, the bulk of our readers are on Facebook. At The Times, we regularly use Facebook to reach our readers and ask them to participate in our coverage.I also prefer Facebook for its sense of community. Facebook groups tend to be closed, so people are writing posts to a segment of people. Perhaps because the posts are not for the wider public, there seems to be a lot less posturing on Facebook than on Twitter.Do you have a personal favorite Facebook group?My guilty pleasure is scrolling through the Maplewood Moms* Facebook group. (I live in a neighboring New Jersey town.) Local parents post questions that are incredibly relevant to my life, like how to get your toddler to brush his teeth. There are discussions on managing a commute and bedtimes, and horror stories of lactation rooms that don\u2019t lock.Even though I don\u2019t know all of the mothers, or even most of them, I feel a sense of shared values and experiences. We can so easily relate to one another, battling toddler meltdowns and long waits at the pediatrician\u2019s office. And this leads to an online environment that feels both intimate and supportive.What other tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life?I tried the Apple Watch and could barely figure it out. So I\u2019ll say my phone (an iPhone 7 with a maroon and purple case).My entire life exists on my phone. For nonwork purposes, I love that I have a camera and video recorder with me wherever I am \u2014 crucial for a parent of young children.I do my banking, listen to podcasts, read, and jot down funny things my 4-year-old, Isaac, says. And I wrote out these answers on my phone (in the Notes app) while getting my hair cut.Smartphones now also make for easy house stalking. I love going to a dinner party and then checking out the person\u2019s home on Zillow. My husband and I often play a game to guess how much we think the house sold for. (Life in the suburbs is underrated.)In our own home, our kids love using our Amazon Echo. Isaac asks it all sorts of important life questions (like \u201cAlexa, do you like bubbles?\u201d). He also orders up his favorite songs, then he and his little brother dance around the kitchen.I wish there were a feature on my phone that could make it quickly obvious to others what I am doing on it. I grew up watching my parents read the newspaper over breakfast. I wish that when I was reading the news, my kids could tell. Instead, they just see my head in my phone. That is the major reason I still get the Sunday paper.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Workers of Silicon Valley, It\u2019s Time to Organize", "Date": "2018-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftDear tech workers,Long year, huh?I get it. Your industry is under siege. Whether you work at an established giant like Facebook or Google, a private company like Uber or Palantir, or a lesser-known start-up, it feels like you\u2019re being attacked from a thousand directions. People are comparing your companies to Big Tobacco, and Congress is accusing your executives of undermining democracy, poisoning users\u2019 brains and censoring content.All of a sudden, Silicon Valley \u2014 once the golden child of American industry \u2014 has become a villain.Some of the backlash probably feels excessive. After all, the tech industry still creates useful things and employs lots of decent and ethical people. But I\u2019ve talked to a number of tech workers recently, and I\u2019ve seen you wrestling with your consciences. Some of you have stopped wearing your company T-shirts around town, fearing dirty looks from strangers. Others have taken extended vacations after a particularly shameful scandal, or asked for a transfer within a company. More than a few of you have had awkward conversations with your parents.Here\u2019s the thing, though. You don\u2019t have to keep your concerns bottled up.You are your employers\u2019 most valuable assets, and your bosses are desperate to keep you happy. As tech companies take on increasingly vital roles in global commerce and culture, you have the power to shape the way they operate and the ethical standards they uphold.If you want change, all you have to do is organize and speak up.In most industries, rank-and-file workers don\u2019t have much say. The power of organized labor in America has been shrinking since the 1980s, and other than a few notable teachers\u2019 strikes this year, large-scale collective action is rare these days.\u201cTech workers are the only point of leverage on these big companies,\u201d said Maciej Ceg\u0142owski, the founder of the social bookmarking service Pinboard.Mr. Ceg\u0142owski, who has started an advocacy organization called Tech Solidarity, said that the typical instruments used to rein in corporate misbehavior \u2014 customer boycotts, shareholder activism and outside regulation \u2014 aren\u2019t likely to work on the largest Silicon Valley companies.Instead, change at these companies will need to come from the inside.\u201cEven a couple hundred employees working in concert could bring a site like Google to its knees,\u201d Mr. Ceg\u0142owski said.But these are just warm-up skirmishes. For maximum impact, tech workers will need to scrutinize not just their employers\u2019 government ties, but their products, business models, and basic standards. And they\u2019ll need to do it in public.Without Ms. Fowler\u2019s brave disclosure \u2014 and her colleagues\u2019 willingness to back her up after she went public \u2014 it\u2019s entirely possible that Mr. Kalanick would still be Uber\u2019s chief executive and the company would still be run by boorish bros.Typically, when workers speak out or organize, it\u2019s because they want higher wages, better working conditions or stronger job security. Those aren\u2019t your problems. You probably work manageable hours in tastefully decorated buildings with free food, ergonomic desk furniture and plentiful amenities. Your compensation is generous. And you\u2019re in little danger of being fired or retaliated against, especially if you\u2019re part of a large group.And that\u2019s before we even get to the thorny ethical debates surrounding technologies like artificial intelligence, in which companies\u2019 goals \u2014 amass huge amounts of data to help train increasingly sophisticated machine learning models \u2014 may be at odds with what\u2019s good for society.That leaves an opening for you.\u201cIt\u2019s not clear where the pressure\u2019s going to come from otherwise,\u201d said Leslie Berlin, a Stanford historian who has studied Silicon Valley\u2019s labor culture.These groups are still small, and none has produced concrete results yet. But they are early signs that greater political consciousness is stirring in the industry.In a tech-dominated world, when the decisions made by a handful of Silicon Valley executives have the ability to reshape nations and transform billions of lives, there\u2019s no better time to stand up. Together, you can encourage your employers to behave in ethical and humane ways, and blow the whistle publicly when they fall short.Organizing yourselves to push for change isn\u2019t just a viable option \u2014 it might be the only way out of this mess.Godspeed,KevinAn earlier version of this column misstated when Tech Action began meeting in New York.

The company\u2019s faltering response to the Russian interference on its network has continued to draw criticism since the 2016 election. Then last month, Facebook found itself in the midst of a new firestorm, after reports that Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm, had misused the data of up to 87 million Facebook users, most of them in the United States.Since Facebook provided Congress with the 1.8 million figure, some have questioned whether the number fully captures the reach of these pages. In calculating the total, Facebook did not add up the followers for each of the 120 pages. Instead, if a person followed, say, three Russia-linked pages, Facebook counted that person only once, not three times.Since 120 pages were associated with the Internet Research Agency, Mr. Albright said the total of followers for all the pages was probably significantly larger than 1.8 million. He said he believed that the number might have been as high as 10 million. He could not analyze data for all 120 pages because Facebook made a change last year that prevented him and others from using a data analytics tool, called CrowdTangle, owned by Facebook.Other popular groups set up by the Internet Research Agency included Army of Jesus and Stop All Invaders.\u201cWe stand behind the figures we submitted to the U.S. government: Approximately 1.8 million people followed at least one Facebook page associated with the Internet Research Agency,\u201d Matt Steinfeld, a Facebook spokesman, said in an email. As for Mr. Albright\u2019s analysis, Mr. Steinfeld said, \u201cThe CrowdTangle data that this researcher\u2019s analysis relied upon did not account for any people who followed more than one page. Our submitted figures removed this duplication.\u201dFacebook\u2019s method would arrive at a lower total than counting the followers of each page.Mr. Steinfeld said in the email: \u201cWe provided our best estimate for the number of people reached on Facebook or Instagram. We did not calculate the volume of people who followed at least one Instagram account associated with the Internet Research Agency.\u201d\u201cWe need to know a lot more information,\u201d Mr. Albright said. \u201cMy biggest concern in all this is that information\u2019s been withheld that has great significance to the bigger picture.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Broadcast of Mets Game Runs Into Glitches and Complaints", "Date": "2018-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the Mets and Phillies faced off at Citi Field on Wednesday, they also played the role of guinea pigs in a new Major League Baseball experiment, participating in its first digital-only national broadcast.The game was shown on Facebook, which partnered with M.L.B. to exclusively produce and broadcast 25 games this season as part of baseball\u2019s efforts to appeal to a younger audience and tap into fans\u2019 online discussions.The Mets-Phillies game was the first of the 25 games set to be aired on Facebook \u2014 one per week \u2014 and the early feedback was largely negative. Fans quickly voiced their displeasure with the newfangled broadcast and its glitches, and not just because they couldn\u2019t watch their teams as they normally would: the Mets on SportsNet New York and the Phillies on Comcast SportsNet Philadelphia.Several viewers complained that the onscreen scoreboard and statistics banner blocked too much of the screen, as did the comments bar on the side. And in the fifth inning, as the broadcast showed a montage of the Mets\u2019 oft-injured captain David Wright, the feed froze.Much like any new way of viewing sports, this debut broadcast appealed to some fans and estranged others.\u201cI\u2019m standing in my kitchen watching on my cellphone because it wasn\u2019t working well on my TV,\u201d Mike Schulman, a high school teacher on Long Island, said by telephone during the ninth inning of the Mets\u2019 4-2 victory. \u201cIt worked but it was lagging. The image got really pixelated at points. It worked fine on my cellphone and laptop.\u201dSome lag time could be attributed to the speed of viewers\u2019 internet connections or cellphone data, but the glitch in the fifth inning on Facebook Watch, as the platform\u2019s video service is called, was a widespread technical problem. It was quickly fixed.\u201cWe\u2019re still in the early days of having live sports on Facebook Watch and are learning with every broadcast we have on the platform,\u201d a Facebook spokesman said in a statement. \u201cFortunately, we have a great partner in Major League Baseball innovating on our platform and listening to feedback from fans to adjust the broadcast in real time.\u201dM.L.B. added in a statement, \u201cToday marked a historic and important step as we experiment with new platforms for fans to watch games. Our fans provided great feedback throughout their experiences today, which will continue to help us as we present these social-first broadcasts on Facebook each week.\u201dThe viewing experience for the Mets-Phillies game was certainly different. Instead of the traditional commercial breaks in between half-innings, there were short segments about players and teams, and interviews with Mets pitcher Matt Harvey and the comedian Jim Breuer, a Mets fan. At times during game action, a viewer\u2019s comment would be highlighted on a banner across the top of the screen.\u201cI know they\u2019re trying to bring in a new audience, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the best way to bring them in,\u201d Schulman said.After receiving many complaints, producers of the stream told viewers how to hide the comments bar via the comment section, as well as on the broadcast itself. They also reduced the size of the onscreen graphics, which were originally designed for cellphone screens.Of the big four professionals sports leagues in the United States, M.L.B. has the audience that skews the oldest. A study by Magna Global, a marketing research company, found that the average age of television viewers of M.L.B. in 2016 was 57.Schulman considers himself to be part of the target audience for M.L.B.; he is 30 years old and a die-hard fan of the Mets. His television wasn\u2019t compatible with the Facebook app, but he figured out how to use a different streaming device.Although he and his 60-year-old father are Facebook users, Schulman said his father struggled to load the game, so he had to walk him through directions on the phone during the game. \u201cFor me it was fine, but for an older man or woman who is not as tech savvy, might be more difficult,\u201d Schulman said.Nearly 69,000 comments streamed across the bar on the side of the viewing screen. They ranged from harsh criticism to compliments for the teams and players, as well as complaints about the broadcast and even about privacy concerns facing Facebook. Viewers said they were watching from as far away as Sweden.\u201cWatching on the train in Queens NY. Loving this!\u201d wrote one viewer.\u201cWhy did syndergaard leave early?\u201d asked another.\u201cWorst viewing experience ever,\u201d a different viewer said.M.L.B. first aired a handful of games on Facebook last year, using the local broadcast\u2019s feed on the social media platform. Last month, M.L.B. announced that 25 games this season would be produced by MLB Network and its broadcasters solely for Facebook Watch, joining a wave of new broadcasting efforts in live sports by companies like Twitter and Amazon. Facebook reportedly paid over $30 million for the games.The deal means that fans who usually tune in to their local regional cable network or have purchased M.L.B.\u2019s smartphone At Bat app or MLB.TV service cannot watch the 25 Facebook-broadcast games there.The attendance and ratings are usually lighter for a midweek day game early in the season, and the hour and forty-five minute rain delay on Wednesday most likely didn\u2019t help. The Mets announced a paid crowd of 21,328 people. At one point, over 80,000 viewers watched the Facebook broadcast.Next week, the St. Louis Cardinals and Milwaukee Brewers will get their turn on Facebook.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Signs Order to Require Recipients of Federal Aid Programs to Work", "Date": "2018-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump quietly signed a long-anticipated executive order on Tuesday intended to force low-income recipients of food assistance, Medicaid and low-income housing subsidies to join the work force or face the loss of their benefits.The order, in the works since last year, has an ambitious title \u2014 \u201cReducing Poverty in America\u201d \u2014 and is directed at \u201cany program that provides means-tested assistance or other assistance that provides benefits to people, households or families that have low incomes,\u201d according to the order\u2019s text.But its programmatic goals are considerably more modest, officials said. Many of the initiatives outlined have already been set into motion by the affected agencies, particularly the Department of Health and Human Services, which has begun issuing waivers to Republican governors who want to impose stricter work requirements on Medicaid recipients as a way to reduce costs.And advocates for poor people questioned whether the order could achieve even modest goals, saying most able-bodied adults who receive noncash federal aid either already work or face significant impediments to doing so.The order gave all cabinet departments 90 days to produce plans that impose work requirements on able-bodied aid recipients and block ineligible immigrants from receiving aid, while drafting \u201ca list of recommended regulatory and policy changes\u201d to push recipients off the rolls and into jobs.\u201cPresident Trump has directed his administration to study policies that are failing Americans,\u201d said Andrew Bremberg, the president\u2019s domestic policy chief, who briefed reporters on the order\u2019s contents in a telephone call late Tuesday. Journalists were not provided with copies of the document beforehand.The aim, Trump aides said on the call, is to prod federal and state officials to take a tougher stance with aid recipients \u2014 millions of whom currently receive exemptions from existing work requirements because they are in training programs, provide care for relatives or volunteer their labor.Advocates say most able-bodied adults who do not already have jobs face obstacles including mental problems, criminal records that deter employers from hiring them and complicated family situations.A 2017 study of Michigan\u2019s Medicaid program by the University of Michigan Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation found that three-quarters of those enrolled in the program were already working or physically unable to do so. Another 12 percent were people likely to be exempt, including the elderly and students.\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of a solution in search of a problem,\u201d said Elaine Waxman, a senior fellow with the nonpartisan Urban Institute, who has studied food assistance programs and other government entitlements. \u201cThe administration is reflecting a larger narrative that many low-income individuals avoid work \u2014 but there\u2019s just not a lot of data to support that position. Many of these people have significant barriers to working full time.\u201dBut the greater significance of the order might be semantic \u2014 and political.The order \u2014 signed in private on a frenzied news day dominated by congressional testimony from Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook chief executive, a potential military response in Syria and the president\u2019s rage at the raid on Monday on his personal lawyer\u2019s office \u2014 tries to redefine \u201cwelfare\u201d to fit the catchall term Mr. Trump used in campaign speeches.The word \u201cwelfare\u201d \u2014 politically loaded and often pejorative, especially among the president\u2019s conservative supporters \u2014 has historically been used to describe cash assistance programs such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families.The Trump administration wants to change the lexicon. On Tuesday, Mr. Bremberg sought to stretch the term to encompass food aid and Medicaid \u2014 programs even many conservative lawmakers view as a necessary safety net for families and individuals on the economic margins through no fault of their own.\u201cOur country suffers from nearly record high welfare enrollments,\u201d Mr. Bremberg said. But Temporary Assistance for Needy Families payments to poor people are approaching record lows.Mr. Trump, several aides said, is unconcerned \u2014 or perhaps even unaware \u2014 of the distinction between cash assistance and other safety-net programs.He calls all of them \u201cwelfare,\u201d they said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Photojournalist Killed in Kabul Left a Legacy of Images", "Date": "2018-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 Through the dark days of the 1990s civil war and the Taliban\u2019s oppressive rule, the Afghan photographer Shah Marai never left his country. As the bloodshed continued after the 2001 American-led invasion, he repeatedly expressed a feeling shared by so many Afghans caught in the devastating cycle: \u201cThere is no more hope.\u201dYet through it all, Mr. Marai, 41, continued to bear witness, focusing his camera on the profound human suffering that has become so routine, so forgotten.On Monday, he was among the couple of dozen journalists in Kabul who had rushed to the site of yet another bombing, when a second attacker detonated his explosives amid the reporters and first responders. Altogether 25 people were killed, nine of them journalists.The Afghan war has dragged on for so long that it has redefined seasons and reshaped conventional battle norms. Spring, everywhere else associated with the blooming of flowers, is seen here as a time when deaths pile up. No one \u2014 aid workers, police officers, shopkeepers, doctors \u2014 is spared. While wars usually have a front line, here the whole country has turned into one giant front line, the guarded capital, Kabul, suffering the highest number of casualties year after year.This year\u2019s bloody Taliban spring offensive is particularly unsettling because it comes soon after the government made its most robust peace offer to date. Adding to the confusion is that a small element of the Islamic State, which appeared in the country in 2015, continues to claim attacks despite sustained military operations against the group.From a family genetically predisposed to blindness, Mr. Marai, a father of six, rose to become the chief photographer in Kabul for Agence France-Presse. His income supported many relatives, including three blind brothers and two blind children. The youngest of his children, his only daughter, Khadija, was just 15 days old. He celebrated her birth by bringing a cake to the office.Across town on Monday, Afghan journalists continued to report as they mourned, much of their reporting focused on the funerals of their own colleagues: a cameraman engaged to be married, recently forced to sell his bicycle for $80 to seek treatment for his ill mother; a young female radio reporter, the sole breadwinner of her family, who had just moved to a better-paying job so she could support her family and take part-time university classes.Near the scene of the blast, a shaken television reporter, his assigned cameraman killed, stood in front of the camera of another colleague to give live updates. On a lush hilltop outside town, photographer colleagues of Mr. Marai who had survived the bombing with a stroke of luck briefly put down their cameras to shovel dirt on his grave.\u201cAn incident doesn\u2019t begin with the explosion \u2014 it begins with the cries of a mother, a sister, a wife at a home where a man who left alive in the morning is brought back in a coffin three hours later, his body blown to pieces,\u201d Farahnaz Frotan, a reporter from ToloNews, wrote on Facebook after the funeral of a cameraman colleague. \u201cAll those who were blown to pieces today were men and women of work, from a generation full of dreams \u2014 a generation blown to pieces by suicide bombings.\u201dMs. Frotan posted a picture of her colleague\u2019s engagement ring, covered in blood.Mr. Marai had gotten his professional start during the Taliban regime in the 1990s, when photography was largely banned. He began as a driver for Agence France-Presse and then slowly began to do photographic work, often in secret, when most news bureaus could not get a foothold in the country and relied on brave local residents like him.After the fall of the Taliban in 2001, a new wave of optimism was clear in his work, as he covered elections and the rebuilding of a ravaged country.But, like many Afghans caught in a pattern of violence that feels endless, Mr. Marai had lost hope in recent years.After a brief period of relative calm, the war in Afghanistan has grown devastatingly violent, taking as many as 50 lives a day on all sides. Mr. Marai\u2019s work as a news photographer often meant rushing to the site of the latest suicide bombing, and then following funerals and shattered families.As the violence continued to intensify, the attacks growing deadlier, Mr. Marai arranged for two of his brothers, who were also spared the genetic blindness, to take the migrant trail and seek refuge in Europe.Mr. Marai\u2019s eldest son, who is blind, said he had asked his father many times to also leave for Europe. His mother had asked him to leave his risky job and become a shopkeeper instead.Mr. Marai had just laughed.On Monday, after the first bomb went off just before 8 a.m., Mr. Marai had coordinated with other photographer colleagues and rushed to the scene. The first attack hadn\u2019t been huge; it had killed four people.Mr. Marai and other reporters, some distance from the security cordon set up around the site of the first blast, had climbed to a higher spot of the sidewalk when the second explosion went off.\u201cI heard a big bang behind me \u2014 it threw me to the ground,\u201d said Omar Sobhani, a Reuters photographer and a longtime friend of Mr. Marai who survived with injuries. \u201cThe first thing I saw was the body of Shah Marai, and I understood that he was dead.\u201dWhen his coffin was unloaded for a couple of hours at home, it seemed small for a tall man. Women wailed and gathered around it.\u201cWho will look after us?\u201d his mother said, speaking to his body. \u201cI lost your brother and your father, but I never thought that I was a widow because you were with me. You were everything to me. You weren\u2019t just my son \u2014 you were my friend.\u201dMr. Marai\u2019s last post on his Facebook page was a picture of himself behind spring roses in full bloom. The caption read: \u201cbeautiful rose flowers in our garden.\u201dHis body was driven to a lush hilltop in his home district on the outskirts of Kabul, a place called Guldara, the Valley of Flowers. His blind brother and his blind son sat at the edges of the grave, unable to see. But the sound of mud flopping on the stones as the grave was sealed was loud and clear.\u201cThe streets are colored in blood every day,\u201d said the imam in his final prayer, before everyone dispersed. \u201cO oppressor \u2014 the pain of the loved ones left behind will one day destroy you for sure.\u201dFahim Abed and Fatima Faizi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Everyday Social Media Users Become Real-World Extremists", "Date": "2018-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe InterpreterWhen they talk about incitement to violence on Facebook \u2014 a growing problem in developing markets \u2014 representatives and critics of the platform alike tend to describe it as a problem created by small factions of extremists.The extremists, in this view, push out rumors and inflammatory claims to everyday users, who become ideologically infected. So stopping the violence should be as simple as silencing the extremists.\u201cThat\u2019s the kind of thing where I think it is clear that people were trying to use our tools in order to incite real harm,\u201d he said. Facebook\u2019s response? \u201cWe stop those messages from going through.\u201dEveryday users might not intend to participate in online outrage, much less lead it. But the incentive structures and social cues of algorithm-driven social media sites like Facebook can train them over time \u2014 perhaps without their awareness \u2014 to pump up the anger and fear. Eventually, feeding into one another, users arrive at hate speech on their own. Extremism, in other words, can emerge organically.We saw this firsthand in the small town of Digana, Sri Lanka, a week after anti-Muslim mobs had torn through.But Mr. Weerasinghe\u2019s online stardom was newfound and, according to neighbors, a mere persona.\u201cHe\u2019s from the area, he went to school here,\u201d Jainulabdeen Riyaz, a member of the local Muslim community, said, laughing at the absurdity of this standoffish local boy posing as a crusading outsider. \u201cHis father is a carpenter. He\u2019s a normal person.\u201dWhen Mr. Weerasinghe began assuming his angry online persona, Mr. Riyaz said, some Muslims in town approached his father to ask him to intervene. It didn\u2019t work.We met Mr. Riyaz at a gathering for the family of another young man, Abdul Basith, who was killed by the mob. These three men had grown up side by side, only to have one of them, Mr. Weerasinghe, become a social media celebrity who helped pull the online world into the real Digana. When it was over, a man who had known him his entire life was dead.Though each individual\u2019s story has its own unique turns, there are some common points that have to do with how social media can amplify certain elements of human nature.Facebook\u2019s news feed, for instance, runs on an algorithm that promotes whatever content wins the most engagement. Studies find that negative, primal emotions \u2014 fear, anger \u2014 draw the most engagement. So posts that provoke those emotions rise naturally.Tribalism \u2014 a universal human tendency \u2014 also draws heavy engagement. Posts that affirm your group identity by attacking another group tend to perform well.Finally, social media platforms use color and sound to reward engagement, which humans naturally seek out. Comments and likes are presented like a set of diamonds clicking into place on a slot machine. That delivers a little dopamine boost, training you to repeat whatever behavior wins the most engagement.These are hardly the only things driving Mr. Weerasinghe or others like him. But that path to attention, praise and a sense of importance and agency can appeal to anyone \u2014 even a carpenter\u2019s son railing against his own neighbors.\u201cIt\u2019s disturbing. The radicalization is happening at a very young age,\u201d said Sanjana Hattotuwa, a researcher at the Colombo-based Center for Policy Alternatives, which tracks online hate speech.\u201cThey\u2019re kids; they\u2019re schoolchildren,\u201d he said of the users on Facebook groups prone to extremism. \u201cThe parents don\u2019t have a clue that they\u2019re participating. The schoolteachers don\u2019t have a clue that they\u2019re participating. So this is their initiation into communal relations. And it\u2019s hate. It\u2019s really, really bad.\u201dThis dynamic, far from unique to developing countries, bears similarities to the rise of the \u201calt-right\u201d movement in the United States. Elements of that movement first gained prominence among young people \u2014 mostly men \u2014 on sites like Facebook and Reddit, which is also driven by an algorithm meant to surface the most engaging content.Studies have found that people tend to shut out ideas when they believe society has deemed them extreme. But they become much more open to ideas that they believe are considered mainstream.Traditionally, someone hearing an extremist idea for the first time might have encountered it through friends or relatives, who might also convey that the idea is outside the mainstream. Ideas are now delivered through news feeds governed by raw, engagement-driven popular will.This leads to an ideological flattening. To the algorithm, the content of an idea is irrelevant. Whether it\u2019s extremist or mainstream doesn\u2019t matter; only its ability to draw engagement counts.In 2014 and 2015, for instance, critical masses of users on Reddit promoted hate against feminists and against people they deemed overweight. Such ideas can naturally proliferate on social media algorithms, by indulging anger against vulnerable targets and us-versus-them tribalism.Once those ideas had popped to the top of the user-driven algorithm a few times, they quickly became perceived as mainstream and were adopted \u2014 and even angrily defended \u2014 by much of the site, which is one of the most widely used on the internet. Many users pushed that extremism into the real world, harassing their targets on and offline.Anyone who regularly uses Twitter will recognize the way that it inadvertently trains users \u2014 by providing bursts of affirmation when a post goes viral \u2014 to win plaudits from fellow travelers by putting down users on the other side of any argument and, if no such argument exists, to start one. It is akin to Facebook\u2019s inadvertent promotion of anger and tribalism with a less active algorithm but on a far larger scale.Online outrage can sometimes be a necessary way to channel popular opposition to, say, the injustices of systemic racism or other forms of discrimination. It\u2019s not always bad.And by contributing to the sense that every issue is just a way to keep score in a zero-sum game between political tribes, that dynamic can make serious problems more difficult to solve.That sort of process is not typically considered to be a form radicalization \u2014 or at least the label is not applied as easily as it might be to Sri Lankan Buddhists spinning up anger against Muslims. But the dynamics and platforms bear similarities.As Mr. Hattotuwa put it when describing how online hate had spread in Sri Lanka: \u201cThe cancer has grown such that you\u2019re looking at ordinary people.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Zuckerberg Faces Hostile Congress as Calls for Regulation Mount", "Date": "2018-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 After two days and more than 10 hours of questioning of Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook chief executive, there was widespread consensus among lawmakers that social media technology \u2014 and its potential for abuse \u2014 had far outpaced Washington and that Congress should step in to close the gap.But the agreement largely ended there. For lawmakers, the calculus is tricky: They do not want to infringe on First Amendment rights or hurt Silicon Valley innovation but are also unsure how to regulate this new breed of company, which wields enormous power by collecting vast amounts of private data from billions of consumers.\u201cWhile Facebook has certainly grown, I worry it has not matured,\u201d said Representative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon and the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. \u201cI think it is time to ask whether Facebook may have moved too fast and broken too many things.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg, composed but noncommittal about making any sweeping privacy changes, conceded that it was \u201cinevitable that there will need to be some regulation.\u201d\u201cThe American people are concerned about how Facebook protects and profits from its users\u2019 data,\u201d Mr. Walden said. \u201cDoes Congress need to clarify whether or not consumers own or have any real power over their online data?\u201dWhether Congress can actually mobilize to put new controls into place is an open question. This week, two privacy bills were introduced to coincide with the hearings. One would make it harder to collect data on students who use classroom technology like tablets and laptops. Another would require companies to obtain clear permission from users before collecting and sharing their data.At least three lawmakers have said privately that they are drafting new privacy laws for internet companies. Representative Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, for instance, is pushing a bill she introduced last year that would require broadband providers and internet companies like Facebook to get permission before sharing user data. And late Wednesday, Facebook said it would no longer back the opposition to the California Consumer Privacy Act, a state ballot measure meant to offer consumer protections for personal information.On Wednesday, Ms. Blackburn pressed Mr. Zuckerberg about whether he would support her legislation, asking: \u201cWho do you think owns an individual\u2019s presence online? Who owns their virtual you? Is it you or is it them?\u201dWith more contrition and promises to work harder to protect consumers, Mr. Zuckerberg stayed close to the prepared talking points he has used since the breach came to light. \u201cIt will take some time to work through all of the changes we need to make, but I\u2019m committed to getting it right,\u201d he said.Mr. Zuckerberg also revealed that his own personal data had been compromised by third-party actors, though he did not identify which company was responsible. He said Facebook was considering legal action against Cambridge Analytica.His testimony did little to mollify lawmakers, who called for new regulations that would limit Facebook\u2019s ability to collect data on users without permission and to make privacy policies clear to better empower consumers.\u201cThis incident demonstrates yet again that our laws are not working,\u201d said Representative Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the House committee.Despite the consensus that legislation is needed, there is no clear path forward on any of the proposals. The regulation most likely to pass after the hearings is a Senate bill that would require social media companies to disclose funding of political ads on their sites.Facebook and Twitter have recently announced their support of the bill, called the Honest Ads Act, which is modeled after disclosure rules for broadcasters. Several internet companies, including Facebook, had lobbied aggressively to defeat any new rules for online political ads, but have since changed their positions.For many lawmakers, even defining what Facebook is and how to place it within the regulatory ecosystem was a challenge.\u201cWhat exactly is Facebook?\u201d Mr. Walden asked, listing industries like advertising, publishing and even telecommunications, asking whether the company was a \u201ccommon carrier in the information age.\u201dThe definitions matter. If Facebook is viewed as a telecommunications service that is more like a utility, it may be regulated by the Federal Communications Commission. If lawmakers define Facebook as a publisher, it could also fall under regulations at that agency.Mr. Zuckerberg was careful not to put his company in a clear regulatory category.\u201cI consider us to be a technology company,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg replied. Facebook should be responsible for what it publishes, he said, but it was not a news media company. \u201cThe primary thing we do is have engineers that write code and build services for other people.\u201dBut the hearings helped create a foundation for new rules in the future, experts said. Congress showed an increasing ease \u2014 particularly from important Republicans in both chambers \u2014 to regulate Silicon Valley.\u201cLonger term, we saw growing comfort on both sides of the aisle for privacy legislation,\u201d said Alan Davidson, a former internet policy official in the Obama administration and a former executive at Google. \u201cSo this is not the last we\u2019ve heard from Washington.\u201dFor Mr. Zuckerberg, who has been warmly welcomed by world leaders in China and India, it was clear that Facebook had few friends in Washington, particularly in the House. The company has invested heavily in its lobbying of Congress and the administration. Lobbying expenditures in 2017 increased 32 percent to $11.5 million from the previous year. But it has struggled to shake impressions among some Republicans that the site and its employees have a liberal bias. Democrats who were once close to Silicon Valley have become vocal critics of social media platforms for allowing fake political news and foreign interference in the 2016 presidential election.On Wednesday, House lawmakers from both parties took an aggressive stance toward Mr. Zuckerberg, pointing fingers, interrupting and chastising him for repeated failures \u2014 and apologies \u2014 over privacy.Representative Jan Schakowsky, Democrat of Illinois, used a sizable chunk of her limited speaking time to list Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s past apologies.Representative Bobby L.

{"Headline": "A Comic Strip About the Marines: The Few, the Proud, the Bored Out of Their Minds", "Date": "2018-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byProfileBURBANK, Calif. \u2014 Maximilian Uriarte, the illustrator behind \u201cTerminal Lance,\u201d a comic strip with a loyal following among the latest generation of American Marines, switched on his computer in the apartment where he lives and works. It was Friday morning, and he needed to publish a new strip by the afternoon.The inboxes of his Instagram and Facebook accounts held 82 amateur videos his fans had sent overnight. This was his morning harvest: clips of Marines sparring, singing, dancing, sleeping, griping and making obscene gestures. One had caught a live rat in a rations pouch. Another threw a tray of dark mush to the ground, stomped on his meal and uttered three unprintable words. A third lit a Cheeto on fire and tossed the flaming orange snack into his mouth. Mr. Uriarte was pleased. His muses had spoken.\u201cAll of my stuff is organic, homegrown, no G.M.O., real lance corporal from the actual corps,\u201d he said.Since 2010, Mr. Uriarte has illustrated more than 800 comic strips under the \u201cTerminal Lance\u201d brand, along with a self-published graphic novel, \u201cThe White Donkey,\u201d which hit the best-seller list after it was acquired by Little Brown in 2016. On Tuesday, Little Bown released a collection, \u201cTerminal Lance: Ultimate Omnibus,\u201d spanning nearly a decade of Mr. Uriarte\u2019s work.The Marine Corps likes to present itself with dutiful seriousness. \u201cTerminal Lance\u201d is a counterpoint to that. It is a tribute to the service\u2019s permanent underclass, the young grunts who are too weary to feign enthusiasm anymore. (The strip\u2019s title is derived from slang for the holder of a junior rank \u2014 lance corporal \u2014 who will never be promoted and thus will depart the corps as a terminal lance.)The Pentagon speaks of duty, commitment and national defense. Mr. Uriarte\u2019s troops seem to have boarded the wrong bus. They are anxious, lonely and bored. Sick of slogans and tired of being casually hazed and verbally abused, they take refuge in drawing penises inside the porta-potties that dot their bases and outposts. They find chaplains creepy and lifers tiresome. Their corps is a bizarre professional ecosystem where the working caste masturbates, binge-drinks, watches porn and plays video games in the barracks and then reports to work hung over.In art as in life, it is not that these lance corporals are unwilling to train or to fight. It\u2019s that America\u2019s wars give them little opportunity to train and fight smart. Much of their deployed time is spent on duties that accomplish little, or worse, cause harm to others and themselves. In this dispiriting system the only privilege many of them can claim is the power to look down on even newer Marines \u2014 the \u201cboots,\u201d a clueless population subject to harassment and ridicule.Mr. Uriarte, formerly a terminal lance himself, attributes the success to an unusual trait for a comic strip: accuracy. \u201cI think \u2018Terminal Lance\u2019 has done very well because while it has been critical, it\u2019s been honest,\u201d he said.That\u2019s not to say the strip has not generated complaints. Senior Marines often contact Mr. Uriarte to grouse about unflattering portrayals, including his characters\u2019 excessive drinking. Some try to root out his sources. But the corps and its illustrator have found a measure of peace.\u201cIf you are a grunt and can\u2019t laugh at this stuff, you\u2019d go crazy,\u201d Gen. Robert Neller, the Marine commandant, said in a telephone interview last week. \u201cEvery time I see his comic I read it. If nothing else it makes you ponder his point, or just laugh out loud.\u201dIn hindsight Mr. Uriarte\u2019s success looks like a plan. He enlisted in the Marines in 2006, when he was 19, hoping to become a professional artist with time. He had been drawing and sketching since he was kid and was seeking a challenge and the rich story lines he expected to find in grunt life.\u201cI consider myself an artist before anything else,\u201d he said. \u201cThis whole thing was really to inform my artwork, from a weird 19-year-old perspective.\u201dHe spent his first combat tour, in 2007, as a machine-gunner in the turret of an armored truck, escorting his company commander around. By his second tour, in 2009, he had talked himself into a job as an official photographer.The next year, with only a few months left on active duty and no promotion in sight, Mr. Uriarte started \u201cTerminal Lance,\u201d publishing under his own name. He had a smartphone, a website and a subject: his fellow disgruntled Marines, who had almost no voice of their own. He channeled it.\u201cThey essentially created a monster,\u201d he said, of the corps. \u201cI wonder if they regret not promoting me.\u201d\u201cTerminal Lance\u201d immediately attracted attention, including from a sergeant major who summoned Lance Corporal Uriarte to his office and sent him to see a Marine lawyer. The lawyer told him not to use real names \u2014 a warning he did not always heed.When Mr. Uriarte left the corps, he enrolled at the California College of the Arts on the G.I. Bill. He became part of a growing network of Marines attuned to problems plaguing their cohort: cycles of deployments leading to despair, post-traumatic stress disorder and difficulties readjusting to civilian life. Two members of his former infantry company committed suicide.All of this informed \u201cTerminal Lance.\u201d Staff Sgt. Kevin T. Hoffman, a Marine based at Camp Lejeune, N.C., was drawn to Mr. Uriarte\u2019s strip as it launched, when he was a lance corporal recovering in a hospital from wounds suffered in a bomb attack in Afghanistan.He recognized it as real. The strip resonated with him, he said, because it \u201cmade me reflect and miss the barracks and my friends.\u201d He reads it still, even as a supervisor himself. Mr. Uriarte has \u201cbeen able to remain a figurehead because his experiences are timeless,\u201d Staff Sergeant Hoffman said.Over the years the strip has come to focus on the experiences of two main characters, Abe and Garcia, who in many ways are foul-mouthed millennial updates on Willie and Joe, Bill Mauldin\u2019s comic-strip characters of World War II.Garcia is likable and reasonable, a Marine who accepts the corps\u2019 absurdities, indignities and tedium in stride. Abe is often selfish, unimpressed and eager for the weekend. He seems born not to fight, but to complain, and is not even sure why he volunteered.But Mr. Uriarte\u2019s work has evolved past Abe\u2019s brief and often one-sided episodes of venting. In \u201cThe White Donkey,\u201d his graphic novel, he used the characters to venture into more serious themes, confronting the violence at the center of the infantry\u2019s purpose and presenting a grim view of Marines eager for war.Set in 2007 during the occupation of Iraq, it includes a scene where an Iraqi police officer stands silently beside Abe and Garcia as they talk and smoke cigarettes. Abe is disgusted. Violence has declined. He has seen little action \u2014 except for an unarmed civilian he mistook for a suicide bomber and shot. He finds Iraq ugly. He admits he hates the place.The Iraqi officer startles the Americans by revealing he speaks English and understood everything Abe said. \u201cWould it make you feel better to kill someone?\u201d he asks. \u201cYou came here to kill brown people like me, yes? Why not kill me now?\u201dHe spares no disgust for the occupier\u2019s journey. \u201cI have met many of your type over the last few years, coming here to fulfill some personal conquest, but you never stop to think about how arrogant you are,\u201d he says. \u201cYou seek some enlightenment at the expense of my people.\u201dFor Mr. Uriarte, who modeled Abe in part on his younger self, the scene is both self-lacerating and a hint of perspective gained. It is also a challenge to his core readership, as are his occasional statements on personal social media standing up for gays in the military, women in the corps and gun control.As Mr. Uriarte works on a second graphic novel, he acknowledges that he is growing older than his subjects. He said he expects his work will eventually leave the corps behind.\u201cI don\u2019t want to keep doing this forever,\u201d he said. \u201cAt some point I\u2019ll stop.\u201dThat day does not seem soon. For now, Mr. Uriarte remains fully engaged with the corps and his illustrated version.When an annoyed Marine wrote to Mr. Uriarte demanding that he reveal a source behind a recent video, Mr. Uriarte did not drift into a discussion about the First Amendment or the role of anonymous sources in keeping the public informed.Like a proper terminal lance, his reply was dismissive and defiant, in keeping with what his fans might expect. \u201cYour mother,\u201d he shot back.Advertisement"}

And let\u2019s praise burrata, that cream-filled Italian cheese, but not get hung up on it.For our purposes, let\u2019s say a frittata is a mixture of whisked eggs cooked in a frying pan. It can be thick or thin, flipped and cooked entirely in the pan, finished in the oven or under the broiler, or prepared in a baking dish. (It can also be depressingly dry and overcooked, but that\u2019s not our goal here.) A frittata is a perfect light lunch or supper accompanied by a rather large mixed-green salad \u2014 an easy standby when you don\u2019t feel like cooking.These days, I tend to take the less-is-more approach, with a few herbs and just a bit of cheese, maybe some briefly cooked spinach or asparagus. This recipe, however, goes in the direction of more-is-more, topped just before serving with the creamy burrata and drizzled with an herb-laden pesto.Get real burrata, straight from Italy, if it is available fresh (but check the expiration date). Otherwise, look for domestic burrata, made with cow\u2019s milk instead of the traditional buffalo milk. Remove it from its brine, and hold it at room temperature. (Or if you can\u2019t get burrata, use some thick slices of ultra-fresh mozzarella.)Top each serving with about 2 ounces burrata. Most burrata is sold in 8-ounce parcels, so I often plop the ball in the center of the frittata before cutting it. The tip of a knife will cause the heady filling to burst forth, to be spooned around.Paired with a bottle of chilled Italian white, this frittata is positively deluxe.cookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Australia Pledges Millions of Dollars in Bid to Rescue Great Barrier Reef", "Date": "2018-04-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 The Australian government unveiled a plan on Sunday to try to rescue the imperiled Great Barrier Reef, pledging hundreds of millions of dollars in what would be the largest single investment for reef conservation and management in the country\u2019s history.Environment Minister Josh Frydenberg said 500 million Australian dollars ($379 million) would be set aside to help the reef, an important ecosystem and a global treasure, after years of devastating damage from warming waters caused by climate change.\u201cWe\u2019ll be improving the monitoring of the reef\u2019s health and the measurement of its impacts,\u201d Mr. Frydenberg said from the city of Cairns, a popular jumping-off point for reef tourism. \u201cThe more we understand about the reef, the better we can protect it.\u201dThe money would be used to improve water quality, control a major predator, invest in coral restoration and enhance underwater monitoring.Critics seized on Australia\u2019s continued subsidized development of gas and coal, especially its openness to the Adani coal mine in northern Australia that would be among the world\u2019s largest, pushing coal on boats running near the reef. The plan still awaits final approval.Mr. Frydenberg said he believed that the reef could overcome its many challenges with help.The plan would set aside roughly 200 million Australian dollars ($151 million) for improving water quality, working with farmers to reduce fertilizer use \u2014 especially sugar farmers, who dominate the rich coastal lands of tropical northern Australia.Money would also be set aside for fighting the crown-of-thorns starfish, which feeds on coral and has become an ever-present pest; for enhancing reef health monitoring; and for community engagement and enforcement.An additional 100 million Australian dollars ($76 million) would finance reef restoration and adaptation, including ambitious plans that amount to growing more resilient corals in laboratories.Mr. Frydenberg was cautious about whether the reef could be revived, arguing that experts had told him that it could be \u201cremarkably resilient.\u201dHe also acknowledged the value of the reef, which supports 64,000 jobs, and argued that the government was working closely with experts to make sure that the plan would succeed.But some scientists who are among the world\u2019s greatest experts on the reef \u2014 including Terry P. Hughes, director of a government-funded center for coral reef studies at James Cook University in Queensland \u2014 said that it was too little, too late, posting maps of the damage to the reef on Twitter.The Australian Academy of Science was only slightly more supportive of the government\u2019s plan.\u201cWe urge the government to address the cause of the problem.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Kelly received the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for breaking news photography for his image of a car driving through protesters in Charlottesville, Va.\u201cThere were groups on both sides scattered,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThere were a few small fights that broke out from time to time. People were throwing stuff at each other. A few people were beating on each other. Eventually I came across two large groups of people protesting against the \u2018Unite the Right\u2019 rally and they merged together on Water Street.\u201dHe said he walked ahead of the crowd \u2014 he estimated there were well over 100 people \u2014 when he stopped for a moment.\u201cI edged over onto the sidewalk to get pictures, and right after I did, the car came screeching past me at speed, plowed into the crowd of protesters and immediately reversed back up the hill,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt turned, then took off. Out of instinct, I began taking photos. I just brought the camera to my eye and just mashed the shutter down. I was barely even aware of what I was watching until he was speeding into the crowd.\u201dHe added that had he had stayed in the middle of the street for 20 more seconds, he probably would have been hit, too. \u201cThat was the first thing that went through my head a couple hours after I was done processing images,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI was right where the car went, and I am very fortunate.\u201dHis newspaper\u2019s coverage of the event attested to the role that local news media can play when hometown developments fall under a national spotlight. Aaron Richardson, the editor of The Daily Progress, which has a circulation of 15,000, said the prize was a \u201cgreat recognition\u201d of the work Mr. Ryan and his colleagues had put in over the last year, as they covered protests by the Ku Klux Klan and other white nationalist groups.Mr. Kelly said that while there was no way to prepare for covering an event that would receive international attention, his experience on a small daily newspaper came in handy. \u201cFour years of doing the job every day, you get good at reacting to what\u2019s in front of you,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that\u2019s what I did that day in August.\u201dWhen the news of the award first broke, Mr. Kelly and his wife were on the way back to the United States after attending the World Press Photo awards in Amsterdam.

A Writer Explores the Science and Its Applications", "Date": "2018-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Depending on your point of view, Cris Beam\u2019s \u201cI Feel You: The Surprising Power of Extreme Empathy\u201d might seem either laughably behind the times or na\u00efvely, maybe even willfully, ahead \u2014 so far beyond our collective horizon as to be pretty darned invisible. After all, ours is an age when the president is more concerned with building walls than feeding and educating poor kids, Congress is polarized to the point of paralysis and just about everyone else is seemingly focused on getting theirs first. We\u2019ve become a nation of hard cases, armed to the teeth, with fury battling cynicism for primacy as the default emotion. In this world, a book with a cover featuring one bonsai tree leaning lovingly toward another does not appear likely to find much of a place. And yet here is Beam passionately asserting that \u201cthe pendulum is swinging back toward feeling, back toward love and the communal. Back toward empathy.\u201dWe can only hope. \u201cI Feel You\u201d is less a prescriptive self-help book than a thoughtful exploration of empathy in all its forms \u2014 physiological, historical, sociological and even personal, as Beam struggles to transcend her own less than empathic episodes and explores her aversion to opening herself to change. \u201cSelf-empathy was code for selfish,\u201d she explains before signing up for a workshop on just that. \u201cOne more link in a long chain of American entitlement.\u201d This is a radical book because it challenges the conventional wisdom that self-defense and punitive systems are the only way to keep ourselves physically and emotionally safe, and, maybe more important, because it asserts that it\u2019s possible to work for the betterment of society without the accompanying side effect of feeling like a chump.\u201cI Feel You\u201d is best thought of as a travelogue, with Beam an amiable and skeptical tour guide to places where a new understanding of empathy has led to new, successful applications. It\u2019s probably fortunate that she is a believer, but not an easy sell. Beam has done a lot of homework on her subject, and early on provides a lively distinction between genuine attempts at social change and what she calls \u201cempathic design,\u201d corporate attempts to make us feel loved or needy or connected \u2014 with the goal that we buy more. As a Harvard Business Review story explains, \u201cEnlightened companies are increasingly aware that delivering empathy for their customers, employees and the public is a powerful tool for improving products.\u201d Those adorable Facebook emojis are a case in point. Early in the book Beam tackles that default American compulsion to monetize even our deepest emotions, quoting, for instance, the headline of a Forbes article that offers that the best reason to teach empathy is \u201cTo Improve Education (and Test Scores).\u201dBut this isn\u2019t where Beam puts her emphasis, even though this section is as entertaining as it is damning of American capitalism. She\u2019s looking instead for deeper cuts \u2014 to understand first whether empathy is inborn or a skill to be learned, and then, either way, to investigate how it can be applied to some of our most intractable problems. She takes the obligatory trip through the history of how empathy has been studied in the past and journeys to the neuroscience lab to see what discoveries are being made about how humans feel.Some of the solutions she presents for deploying empathy in social situations may be familiar to those working in the fields of education and law. Restorative justice, for instance, \u201ctries to weave a web of understanding and repair. It\u2019s messier than the decontextualized, one-two punch of crime and consequence. It\u2019s a humanized, empathic approach to what is, by design, the passionless metrics of the law.\u201d In practice, this means the student and teacher, or the playground bully and his or her victim, have an opportunity to talk about how they feel, a practice that would probably make the likes of Sean Hannity apoplectic. Special courts for prostitutes and veterans, where their behavior would be placed in context and they would be provided with housing and medical care, would also anger many. To the Fox News crowd, this might be called coddling. But studies of such diversionary programs are showing them to be more effective at preventing and reducing crime than the usual expulsions and prison sentences. And anyway, why not try? Few can claim that our conventional institutions are doing a great job. As Beam suggests, \u201cat a time when the police, the whip-tail of our justice system, are finally being called out for their entrenched and learned brutality, this is the moment for overhaul.\u201dIn fact, much of this book is a gentle manifesto, urging readers to change their view of themselves and others \u2014 not a bad idea in such a polarized, screen-dominated age. If you cringe at the idea of attending a conference on nonviolent communication, here\u2019s your chance to explore why, and to try, vicariously, to put yourself in the shoes of a nemesis. It may not be such a good idea to start with XXXL villains like Donald Trump or Nancy Pelosi, but the mirroring exercise Beam recounts is truly \u2014 and a little sadly \u2014 revealing. Next time you have an argument with a spouse, co-worker or teenager, stop fighting for a minute and try repeating back to them exactly what they\u2019ve said to you, without editorializing or overdramatizing. It\u2019s a humbling experience.Shifting from individual to societal empathy, Beam has a moving section on Eugene de Kock, the notorious South African death squad chief who captured, tortured and killed many in the anti-apartheid resistance. Beam wanted to understand how a seemingly ordinary man could become the embodiment of evil, but she goes further to examine how he built a life of remorse during and after his prison term. It is heartening to see him reclaim his humanity by apologizing, one by one, to families of his victims, who can then \u2014 sometimes, but not always \u2014 let go of their anger and hatred. It\u2019s probably not an idea that will work with garden-variety sociopaths, or religious fundamentalists turned mad bombers, but it doesn\u2019t hurt to be reminded that there is usually some kind of groupthink behind acts of mass terror. If a society has to be rebuilt, as in Rwanda or the former Yugoslavia, then the question becomes how to move forward together. \u201cWhen they acknowledge wrongdoing and show remorse, what should our response be?\u201d one of Beam\u2019s sources asks. \u201cShould we reject their apology and continue to punish them with our hatred? Or should we extend our compassion and invite them to journey with us on the road of moral humanity?\u201dThe latter is the tougher job. I wish that, along with her examination of the horrors visited on Native Americans and their subsequent attempts at making peace with their white oppressors, Beam had spent time investigating how empathy has acted between whites and African-Americans \u2014 maybe that was just too overwhelming, or too lacking in workable solutions. But even so, \u201cI Feel You\u201d is an important book. If it can\u2019t bring us around to empathy, maybe it can at least get us closer to civility. That would be a good start.Mimi Swartz is an executive editor of Texas Monthly and the author of the forthcoming \u201cTicker: The Quest to Create an Artificial Heart.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Breaking Into the Boom in Escape Rooms: What Entrepreneurs Need to Know", "Date": "2018-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEntrepreneurshipHijacked airplanes, derailed subway cars and trapped submarines are usually the stuff of nightmares. A growing number of entrepreneurs, though, are catering to customers willing to pay to escape these types of situations for fun.Escape rooms are adventure games in which teams of friends, family or colleagues work together to find clues and solve puzzles to escape a simulated danger before time runs out.\u201cWe spend so much time in solitary screen-based worlds, so it is magical when people from a wide range of ages come together and solve a challenge,\u201d said Scott Nicholson, a professor at Wilfrid Laurier University in Ontario who teaches a course in creating escape rooms.The vast majority of escape rooms in the United States are mom-and-pop operations with one or two sites, Ms. Spira said. From chains to smaller outfits, the format is similar. A group of about four to eight people play an hourlong game that could include escaping a prison, evading a serial killer or finding a cure to a deadly disease. Once one puzzle in the escape room is solved, a clue unlocks the next challenge. Hidden doors often reveal new spaces such as secret passageways as the game proceeds.The outcome is not guaranteed. If players get stuck, escape room staff, often in character, provide hints. The success rate varies, but only about 30 percent to 50 percent of participants escape a given room in the time allotted, Ms. Spira said.Admission usually ranges from $20 to $45 per person, with escape rooms in bigger cities usually charging more. Some business owners earn close to a half-million dollars a year, Mr. Spira said, although getting accurate data is difficult because the companies are private and do not release financial figures.Well-designed games draw on many types of knowledge, so all players have a chance for a \u201chero moment,\u201d said Summer Herrick, a co-founder of Locurio, an escape room in Seattle.\u201cEveryone likes to feel smart, and there is an adrenaline rush of solving a puzzle without the risk of, say, sky diving or spelunking,\u201d Ms. Herrick said.Escape rooms evolved from video games, like the Crimson Room and the Rusty Lake series, that involve puzzles and group adventures. The first real-life escape room was created by a company called Scrap in Kyoto, Japan, in 2007. Scrap opened an escape room in San Francisco in 2012 and now has three in the United States, which the company said about 50,000 people visited in 2017.Pioneering American companies like the Escape Game and Escape the Room can now be found in cities like Houston, Nashville and Orlando, Fla. In the early days, several developed a niche, such as the Basement in Los Angeles and Las Vegas, which became quickly known for its actor-driven horror games.Now, many who played an escape room are creating their own. \u201cBut having $10,000, a dream and some moxie isn\u2019t necessarily enough to make a business,\u201d Mr. Spira said.Successful entrepreneurs have relevant backgrounds like engineering and psychology and the ability to learn a variety of new skills, like accounting, game design and set building.Andrew Preble, who founded Escape My Room in New Orleans, drew on his past working at a technology start-up and operating a restaurant in Berlin. Mr. Preble opened his first escape room in 2015 and now has four games that revolve around mysterious events that happen to a fictional old New Orleans family called the DeLaportes, inspired by Marguerite Delaporte, one of the conspirators accused of poisoning Louis XIV in the 1600s.Mr. Preble said he knew starting a new business would be hard, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t expect it to be as popular as quickly as it was.\u201dDemand was high enough that six months after opening a room called the Jazz Parlor in 2016, Mr. Preble built a nearly identical room for corporate groups and birthday parties. The average number of monthly visitors increased 29 percent from 2016 to 2017, Mr. Preble said, and his team now includes eight full-time and eight part-time employees.Despite the rising popularity, getting a bank loan to finance the business can be a challenge, Mr. Preble said. \u201cLenders still don\u2019t exactly understand what escape rooms are, so it\u2019s difficult to assign value to this as an asset,\u201d he said.Innovation is crucial to hooking repeat customers, especially as more escape room companies enter the market. Some are adding new rooms, switching games more frequently or using more actors and more elaborate props to increase the immersive quality of the experience.And entrepreneurs find they have to be handy. When Derek Tam started Mission Escape Games with a longtime friend, he built the sets himself. Now, he hires employees with experience building immersive attractions at amusement parks to do the work. His company\u2019s five outposts include one in Anaheim, Calif., not far from Disneyland.Escape rooms are also sprucing up related amenities like conference rooms for corporate groups or those celebrating special events.\u201cPart of the fun is having dinner or drinks with your friends or colleagues afterward and reliving your experience after the fact,\u201d Mr. Spira said, who played 250 rooms in 2017 with his wife for their blog.Stuart Bogaty, who started Trap\u2019t in Stamford, Conn., with his wife and three daughters, opened his business in 2016 with two \u201cclean and light\u201d conference rooms, in addition to four escape rooms. \u201cI had seen escape rooms that were a bit dark and kind of dumpy,\u201d he said, adding that his attention to detail has helped draw groups from corporations like Indeed, Mastercard and Vineyard Vines.Mr. Bogaty has not done any direct marketing to corporate groups, focusing instead on Google and Facebook advertisements and on customer service.Word-of-mouth advertising and online reviews have been critical, he said. Strong Google reviews have had the most impact because they affect where a company shows up in searches.\u201cHow you respond to reviews makes a big difference,\u201d Mr. Bogaty said. \u201cEven a bad review \u2014 if you respond to it appropriately \u2014 can help your business.\u201dEntrepreneurs in cities with large numbers of tourists, like Mr. Preble in New Orleans, also draw players by leaving fliers in hotels.The newest wave of entrepreneurs is bringing escape rooms into players\u2019 homes.Juliana Patel and Ariel Rubin of Los Angeles loved escape rooms but found it trickier to get out and play once they had children. They set out in 2016 to raise $19,500 on Kickstarter for their home version, Escape Room in a Box. They surged past $135,000.One of their Kickstarter supporters was a Mattel game designer, who brought the toymaker on board to license their game.\u201cWe know that all consumers are gravitating toward social play,\u201d said Ray Adler, a senior director of global marketing at Mattel. \u201cPeople love to test themselves and do things together.\u201dMs. Patel and Ms. Rubin are busy working on their next boxed game, but they also design escape rooms for various customers, including companies marketing a new product or film or charities looking for an unusual activity at fund-raisers.Few escape room entrepreneurs can rest on their laurels, however.\u201cWhat\u2019s good now won\u2019t be that great in a year,\u201d Mr. Spira said. \u201cCompanies that figure out that it\u2019s not just about making an excellent game but creating an experience that makes customers feel good even if they didn\u2019t escape, that\u2019s the key.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Ms. Briskman, 50, had violated the company\u2019s social media policy on obscenity by sharing the image on Facebook and Twitter, they told her, according to the lawsuit filed on Wednesday in Fairfax County Circuit Court in Virginia.The executives also feared blowback from the Trump administration, Ms. Briskman said the executives told her.\u201cI was fired from my job because my employer feared unconstitutional retaliation,\u201d Ms. Briskman said Thursday afternoon. \u201cBut on a larger scale, I feel that our democracy is being threatened.\u201dHer lawyers assert that Ms. Briskman\u2019s gesture was \u201ccore political speech\u201d protected by Virginia law and the Constitution.

After Google fired an engineer, James Damore, for criticizing the company\u2019s diversity efforts last year, hundreds of people on social media called for a boycott of the company. But an analysis of nearly 7,000 tweets using the hashtag #BoycottGoogle since August showed that 26 percent of the tweets came from devices using Google\u2019s Android software, according to Keyhole, a social-media research firm.One Twitter account named Milton Prescott tweeted on Aug. 8: \u201cGoogle\u2019s firing of James Damore proves his point completely. I will no longer be using Google for any services. #BoycottGoogle.\u201d The tweet came from an Android device.

{"Headline": "How to Understand What\u2019s Happening in North Korea", "Date": "2018-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistNorth Korea doesn\u2019t have enough food, it lacks Facebook and Beyonc\u00e9, and its diplomats have to ration their use of computers in the Foreign Ministry because of electricity shortages.But North Korea excels at choreography and theater, and its officials are well educated, very savvy, and agile with a pirouette. So we have peace breaking out on the Korean Peninsula \u2014 and President Trump gets some credit for that.As with any circus performance, it\u2019s amazing to behold but not quite as billed.As Kim Jong-un stepped into South Korea on Friday \u2014 the first North Korean leader to do so \u2014 let\u2019s acknowledge that he has played a weak hand exceptionally well. Kim is now aiming to squirm out of sanctions, build up his economy and retain his nuclear arsenal, all while remaining a global focus of attention. It\u2019s a remarkable performance.\u201cNorth Korea expert\u201d is an oxymoron, but from someone who has been covering the country since the 1980s, here\u2019s my take on why we should be deeply skeptical \u2014 and yet relieved, even a bit hopeful.President Trump\u2019s tightening of sanctions and his belligerent rhetoric genuinely did change the equation. All this was meant to intimidate Kim, but it mostly alarmed President Moon Jae-in of South Korea and galvanized him to undertake successful Olympic diplomacy that laid the groundwork for the North-South summit meeting.Inspiring, but count me skeptical.When North Korea talks about \u201ccomplete denuclearization,\u201d it typically means that the U.S. ends its alliance with South Korea, and then North Korea will no longer need nuclear weapons to defend itself. But the U.S. won\u2019t give up the South. And North Korea has been pursuing nuclear weapons since the 1950s, and I don\u2019t know any expert who thinks that it will genuinely hand over its arsenal.It\u2019s even less likely that North Korea will give up its nukes now that it sees Trump poised to tear up the Iran nuclear deal.Kim\u2019s game plan seems to be to sign pledges for denuclearization, leaving details to be worked out in follow-up talks, knowing that the pledges won\u2019t be fully implemented and that there will never be intrusive inspections. This may be disingenuous on the part of North Korea, but that\u2019s not terrible: It provides a face-saving way for both North Korea and the U.S. to back away from the precipice of war.Trump and Kim both badly want a meeting, so expect North Korea to release its three American detainees in the coming weeks and to make soothing statements. Trump and Kim will present themselves as historic peacemakers as they sign some kind of declaration calling for peace and denuclearization, with some kind of timetable; Trump\u2019s aides will then say that he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize more than Barack Obama did.\u201cOver 100,000 people, a figure that includes countless innocent family members of so-called enemies of the state, are effectively consigned to die in North Korea\u2019s political prisons,\u201d Navi Pillay, a former U.N. high commissioner for human rights, told me. \u201cThe forced abortions, infanticide, persecution of Christians, torture and summary executions that regularly occur in those various facilities are well documented. President Trump can demand that the Red Cross and the international community be given access to North Korea\u2019s prisons and labor camp systems.\u201dIn the meantime, I\u2019m guessing that the North will halt all nuclear and missile testing (hopefully, including short-range missiles), and will stop production of plutonium at its reactors in Yongbyon (North Korea may also claim to stop enriching uranium, but that\u2019s more difficult to verify). In exchange, China and South Korea will quietly ease sanctions \u2014 and Kim will get what he has always wanted, the legitimacy of being treated as a world leader, as an equal, and as the ruler of a de facto nuclear state.Both Kim and Trump benefit politically from that scenario, and for that matter so does the world: Hard-liners will fume that we\u2019re being played and that the North is not verifiably giving up nuclear weapons \u2014 true \u2014 but it\u2019s all preferable to war.How does this end? The West\u2019s plan is to drag things along until the North collapses. This may happen. The problem is that it was also the U.S. plan in 1994 in a previous nuclear deal. And I confess that I chose to be The New York Times\u2019s bureau chief in Tokyo in the late 1990s partly so that I could cover what I thought might be the collapse soon of the North Korean regime. I learned then not to make predictions about the timing of the demise of the Kim dynasty.In effect, the emerging framework is a backdoor route to a nuclear cap or to the \u201cfreeze for a freeze\u201d solution that North Korea and China have previously recommended and that Trump has rejected. It may all fall apart. But it\u2019s possible now to envision a path away from war, and for that even we skeptics should be grateful.Advertisement"}

Only parents were invited. My sister told me I couldn\u2019t come because she and the groom didn\u2019t want to make his brother, who lives in Berlin, feel obligated to make an expensive trip. When my father questioned this, my sister exploded and eloped without my parents there. A year later, things are still strained. I am planning a 65th birthday party for my mother, who wants my sister to come. I think I\u2019m still owed an apology. My sister demands we respect her choices (without regard for our hurt feelings). Advice?SARAHTo everyone sitting around waiting for an apology: Learn a handicraft! Try knitting or carving rosettes out of radishes. Then, at least, you\u2019ll have something to show for your time when the apology never arrives. Some people simply won\u2019t say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d This doesn\u2019t excuse the omission; it\u2019s a character flaw.If you squint, you can almost follow your sister\u2019s loopy logic: The groom didn\u2019t want his brother to feel bad about missing the wedding, so she excluded you as a courtesy to him. It\u2019s a convoluted plot and hurtful \u2014 and a shame she can\u2019t own up to its silliness retrospectively. Then you might all move on. But she\u2019s too stubborn or selfish or embarrassed, so now the choice is yours. We all do terrible things to our siblings (and they to us). Sometimes we can wall off the bad behavior and move beyond fiascos worse than this. (You don\u2019t mention your sister being a lifelong monster.) Focus on your mom\u2019s party and avoid wedding talk. There is no point in rehearsing your hurt feelings; your sister is not prepared to deal with them yet. But like the rest of us, she is not the meanest thing she ever did. Here\u2019s hoping she comes around! I have a super-humiliating problem. Thanks to some gross symptoms, I made a doctor\u2019s appointment; she told me I had a sexually transmitted disease. She gave me a shot and told me I would be fine in a couple of days. But I slept with two guys recently (before the shot). Should I tell them? Maybe they didn\u2019t contract the S.T.D.?ARTYou may have been too freaked out to hear her, but I am nearly certain your doctor told you to notify all recent sexual partners. We don\u2019t know if they were infected (and are now passing the S.T.D. to others); that\u2019s why they need to be tested. Sadly, sex and shame often go hand in hand. But you didn\u2019t hurt anyone intentionally. What you can do intentionally (and briskly) is clean up the mess. I am a bartender at a neighborhood bar. I have a good rapport with my customers, who tell me they enjoy our talks. I\u2019m grateful to them, and for their generosity. But I\u2019m struggling with a patron who wants a friendship outside the bar. He doesn\u2019t want to date me. But I don\u2019t want to share even one cup of coffee with him outside work. He\u2019s not a bad guy; he just doesn\u2019t interest me. How do I refuse his friendship? I\u2019d hate for the bar to lose a patron.ANONYMOUSHave you tried something subtle, like: \u201cI\u2019d sooner drink tequila muddled with rat poison than meet you for coffee\u201d? That would probably work. But you needn\u2019t be dramatic about this or even \u201crefuse\u201d his friendship. The next time he invites you to meet outside the bar, say, \u201cBrad, I\u2019ve learned over the years that it\u2019s better for me not to mix customers with my personal life. Now, what can I get you?\u201d Don\u2019t feel guilty, either. You are paid to provide a service, which, apparently, you do quite well. Any relationship beyond that is your call. I lent a young relative $500. A couple of weeks ago, I received an email from Zelle, a digital payment service, saying that my relative sent me $100. I told her that I don\u2019t deal with digital payment services. What followed were three emails: asking why I don\u2019t use them, telling me how easy they are, and insisting people love them because they\u2019re fast. I said I\u2019d prefer a check. No further word (or check). Was I wrong?YVETTEThat depends on your objective. After reading reams of letters about bad loans to blood relations, yours was one of the few that had even a whiff of repayment about it (albeit partial). On that basis, I wish you\u2019d taken the money and run! But you make a fair point. A quick call to thank you and confirm repayment method would have been nice, especially these days \u2014 when some folks may not be comfortable with digital payment services and others may not have checkbooks.Advertisement"}

And in this case, the office being searched is that of the lawyer representing the president of the United States.

{"Headline": "Review: The Re Store in Perth, Australia", "Date": "2018-04-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAustralia Fare11 PhotosThe Re Store in the Northbridge neighborhood is most often cited as the originator of the continental roll (or the conti roll, or simply: the roll). The business was founded in 1936 by John Re, the son of a Sicilian immigrant and grocer. At the height of the Depression, Mr. Re pawned his wife\u2019s engagement ring in order to purchase the building in Northbridge where the Re Store still stands.Could Western Australia\u2019s continental roll really have evolved organically with no outside influence? We will probably never know.But I love the idea that Italian immigrant culture morphed into the same kind of crusty, meaty magic, independently, on opposite sides of the globe. The Italian roll is not a thing you can get elsewhere in Australia, even though other cities have much larger Italian populations.(This sandwich absence is an especially hard truth for me; I went to high school and university in New York, where I happily subsisted on heroes for a large chunk of my life. I now find myself living in hero-less Melbourne.)At lunchtime, the line for sandwiches sometimes snakes through the Re Store, which also sells a plethora of Italian grocery items, candies and kitchenware. A cafe area takes up a significant portion of the space, with homemade cakes sold by the slice and an espresso machine that is always in use.The customers who sit at the tables out front and at the long communal counter inside are a cross section of Perth itself: construction workers and businessmen and academics and retired older couples and stay-at-home parents. There are old men who have been coming here since they were young enough to receive the complimentary chocolate frog given to children upon exiting the store.The Re Store\u2019s 81-year history is quite incredible in a town where establishments dating from the 1990s are sometimes hailed as historic. The store is now owned and operated by Lorenzo and Fiona Berti. Mr. Berti is the grandson of Mr. Re, and he does the bulk of the cooking for the store, making pastas fresh daily, salads for the deli case and a huge assortment of dishes that you can have heated to eat on-site or take away.But the most common lunch order here is the mixed meat roll \u2014 mortadella, coppa, salami \u2014 on crusty white bread. You can add whatever other toppings you\u2019d like, much as at a decent New York deli. (The store sells around 400 sandwiches a day.)Here, the most popular additions are pickled and oil-cured vegetables. Some would say that these toppings are part of what distinguishes these sandwiches. Pickled eggplant, good Italian olives, roasted peppers and sun-dried tomatoes are common (and advisable) extras. You can also add Australian or Italian prosciutto, or have a whole sandwich stuffed with whatever meat you\u2019d like.On the other end of the long deli case, which takes up the entire rear of the large store, customers line up for salads and pastas and other goodies.Every day there is a lunchtime selection of house-made pastas and risotto, served warm from large vats and spooned into takeaway containers. The move here is to get a large container and ask for half-and-half, allowing you to try two kinds of pasta.Tortellini alla panna is a regular on the blackboard menu, rich with cream and squares of ham. Bolognese shows up on ravioli or rigatoni.One thing Italian-Australians do better and far more commonly than their American counterparts is truly spicy red-sauced pasta \u2014 Re Store often has a penne arrabbiata with a lovely afterburn. If that isn\u2019t enough, the woman behind the counter will offer to douse your order in crushed red pepper as well as grated Parmesan.There is a second Re Store location, a few miles away in Leederville, which opened in 1974 and shares ownership with the original, run by a different member of the family. Its food options are not as extensive, and there are fewer places to sit and eat, but you can still get a damn fine roll.Those rolls are, of course, Re Store\u2019s signature draw \u2014 for those of us who crave Italian deli meats on good bread, it seems perfectly logical to want to fly across the country to get your hands on their sandwiches.But for Perth, Re Store provides much more: It is living history, an everyday lunchtime ritual, a continuing beacon of community that connects generations.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Year of the Woman? In Arizona, It\u2019s Women, Plural, and It\u2019s Both Parties", "Date": "2018-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPHOENIX \u2014 Melinda Merkel Iyer was a stay-at-home mother and political novice when Donald J. Trump was elected president. She didn\u2019t sleep that night. The next day, Ms. Iyer pored over the state legislature\u2019s website, discovered how to track bills, and soon turned her notes on thwarting conservative proposals into a do-it-yourself newsletter.Five months later, Ms. Iyer was live-tweeting from the statehouse to rouse alarm over a school voucher bill that looked likely to pass. Together with Save Our Schools, an alliance of educators and parents that sprang from a postelection Facebook group, she helped collect more than 100,000 signatures against the bill \u2014 forcing the issue to a referendum on the ballot this fall.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to sit back anymore and let policies go through in the middle of the night,\u201d Ms. Iyer said recently at the Arizona Capitol Museum coffee shop. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d be in a place where I\u2019d know the Koch brothers lobbyists by sight \u2014 and they\u2019d know me.\u201dIf this is the Year of the Woman in politics, few places are a better showcase than Arizona, where a surge of female activists and candidates is reshaping policy debates and campaign conversations up and down the ballot. In a way, it\u2019s only fitting: Arizona, long an emblem of conservatism, also has a history of shattering stereotypes about women in power. The state leads the nation in electing women as governor \u2014 two Democrats and two Republicans \u2014 and ties with Vermont for the highest proportion of women in legislatures at 40 percent.Arizona is a coveted target for Democrats, who hope to flip House seats and the state legislature. Yet party leaders have repeatedly tried and failed to win big here. Hillary Clinton held out hope of carrying Arizona in 2016, but Donald Trump won by more than three percentage points. The state has elected deeply conservative leaders like former Gov. Jan Brewer, and it has been a testing ground for harsh immigration policies later embraced by Mr. Trump. Women are playing leading roles in both parties, with Republicans fielding strong female candidates at all levels \u2014 a reminder after Mrs. Clinton\u2019s loss that women do not vote in a bloc.The state embodies dynamics seen across the country. Shocked and despairing at Mr. Trump\u2019s election, women on the left concluded they had been complacent and are now diving into politics, many for the first time. Democrats are hoping to capitalize on a growing Hispanic electorate; Republicans are testing whether their close embrace of the president helps or hurts.Among the state\u2019s marquee races is an all-out fight for the Senate seat being vacated by Jeff Flake, with candidates including Representative Martha McSally, the Air Force\u2019s first female fighter pilot; Kelli Ward, a former state senator and hard-right politician known for her conspiracy theories; and Joe Arpaio, the sheriff whose anti-immigrant stances cost him his job in 2016 on the Republican side. Representative Kyrsten Sinema is running against another woman and several men on the Democratic side. On the state level, January Contreras, a Democrat, is the first Latina to run for state attorney general.Still, Arizona remains a state that has not had a Democratic senator since 1995 and where Republicans have the trifecta of governor and both houses of the legislature. Entrenched conservative values will clash this year with a liberal fervor that often plays out at the local level, in grinding, unglamorous work.This surge of activism is engaging women of all ages and backgrounds, but tensions are already flaring between women on the left and the center about whom to endorse. Advice and training are pouring in from a bevy of national organizations, including Planned Parenthood and Indivisible, another of the \u201cresistance\u201d groups that published a widely downloaded organizing guide.Democrats continue to hope that they can win votes by increasing turnout among Arizona\u2019s large and growing Hispanic population. Ana Maria Escobedo, an entrepreneur, joined Indivisible determined to rally more Hispanics to register; she is knocking on doors to enlist new voters, and proudly recounted how she and an avid Trump supporter spent all night talking at a wedding so she could rebut him point by point.Sustaining this momentum is far from assured. \u201cPeople are angry,\u201d said Kate Fisher, who corrals volunteers for Planned Parenthood. \u201cBut to translate that into activists who will be here in November \u2014 that\u2019s the challenge.\u201d On top of her day job as an engineer at Arizona State University, Ms. Fisher devotes nights and weekends to juggling schedules for voter registration, inviting volunteers to dinner and guiding them to political organizing tools like the Voter Action Network, a database that tracks voter records and assesses who\u2019s persuadable.Other women have geared up to run for local offices where Republicans have enjoyed considerable success, with the party controlling 32 state legislatures to Democrats\u2019 13. Jennifer Jermaine interrupted her maternity leave after the election to post a call on Facebook for a new group she christened Stronger Together Arizona to mobilize community action including voter registration. Within 10 days, she said she had 10,000 members and 1,000 women attended the first meeting on Nov. 20; they in turn spun off Save Our Schools Arizona, which capitalizes on growing anger about education cuts.\u201cThe moms of Arizona got pissed off and decided to do something,\u201d she said. Now she is collecting signatures to appear on the ballot to challenge a Republican state representative.This influx of newly involved women meshes and sometimes clashes with years of political action by a growing cadre of Hispanics enraged by anti-immigrant policies. Carmen Cornejo, chairwoman of Chicanos Por La Causa and a longtime advocate for the Dreamers, said an early example and playbook for many of today\u2019s mobilization efforts in the Latino community was the recall of the State Senate president, Russell Pearce, in 2011 and the defeat of Mr. Arpaio in 2016.Several longtime Hispanic advocates welcome the swell of activism, but say that some of the newcomers failed to defer to their experience, heed their strategic advice, or embrace their political priorities.\u201cThey need to trust that women of color can be strategists,\u201d said Alejandra Gomez, co-executive director of Lucha, a local advocacy group. \u201cWe know we\u2019re in it for the long haul. We want these women to also be in it for the long haul, not just this fired-up moment.\u201dMs. Gomez\u2019s commitment was forged by personal experience. She is a citizen, but her father was not until recently, and the family left California in 1999 as anti-immigrant sentiment swelled, only to encounter it again in Arizona. She, like some other Hispanic activists and progressive groups, has balked at what she sees as a lessening of commitment on immigration issues by Democrats like Ms. Sinema who are trying to woo independents and moderate Republicans. Ms. Cornejo says she hopes young activists will eventually accept a candidate like Ms. Sinema to stave off harsher measures that Republicans endorse; Ms. Gomez once admired her but now says she would not back her. Ms. Sinema\u2019s office declined to comment.As these tensions play out among Democrats, Republican women are also vying to claim an Arizona heritage that has embraced feisty women stretching back to the state\u2019s frontier and rancher roots.As a former fighter pilot given to blunt pronouncements, Ms. McSally fits this mold and is most pundits\u2019 bet to oppose Ms. Sinema for Senate. According to a tally of statewide and congressional races kept by the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers, so far more Democratic women than Republican ones are running for state and congressional seats in Arizona, but Republican women remain formidable in the state.One early test of Republican strength may be the special election.Ms. Tipirneni, in an echo of Democratic national strategy, is hoping to carve out support from independents and moderate Republicans through her embrace of health care and opposition to a school voucher plan Ms. Lesko backed.But Ms. Lesko has several advantages: years in the state legislature; a district where far more Republicans voted in the primary than Democrats; and an electorate she says is majority pro-Trump, even as she has called on the president to address accusations of sexual improprieties. She also says her own history as an abused wife who mustered the courage to leave her first husband more than 25 years ago has resonated with other women.For her part, Ms. Iyer is relishing her transition from suburban mother to legislative scourge. She posted her first newsletter on Facebook, reaching about 350 friends; now she posts it on a civic engagement site and estimates it reaches about 35,000 people. In the days after the presidential election, she discovered Arizona\u2019s Request to Speak program, which allows a verified voter to register an opinion on a bill and ask to appear before the legislature. At first, she said, she noticed a lawmaker rolling his eyes and others texting under the table as she spoke.But after the successful Save Our Schools petition drive and her attendance at statewide protests calling for teachers\u2019 raises, she recounted a different attitude: \u201cThey know when we sit in their office that there are thousands more like us.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I write to you this week from my underground bunker, deep below The New York Times\u2019s headquarters, where I\u2019ve gone to avoid all news about Kanye West\u2019s political views.Facebook\u2019s continued dominance shouldn\u2019t be a shock. The company\u2019s customers are advertisers, not users. And as long as Facebook is still working for advertisers \u2014 in other words, as long as the company is able to deliver targeted ads with a better return on investment than any other platform except, possibly, Google \u2014 there\u2019s no reason for them to go elsewhere.Despite my unhealthy obsession with Facebook, this week I\u2019m actually more interested in what happened with the other big social networks (Twitter, Snapchat and YouTube).That profit was minuscule by Facebook standards: just $61 million in the quarter, compared with the $3 billion Facebook pulled in. But the fact that Twitter is in the black at all is enough to stave off the doomsday narrative that once swirled around it.Interestingly, one of the factors driving Twitter\u2019s growth this time around is strong performance in its data licensing business, which has grown 20 percent year over year.So why is it trying again?Zoom out a bit, and you can see the bigger shift at work here. After an attempt to distinguish itself from platforms like Instagram and Facebook \u2014 both of which feature algorithmically sorted feeds that intermingle content from your friends and content from celebrities and publishers \u2014 Snap may be finding that users liked Snapchat better when it was more like every other social feed.YouTube, which has long insisted that it\u2019s not a social network, is yet another example of a social platform\u2019s prospering financially despite deepening mistrust among users.More broadly, despite not thinking of itself as a social network, YouTube is perhaps the network that is most similar to Facebook right now, in terms of the challenges it faces and the disconnect between what many of its users want (more active moderation, less objectionable content) and what investors want (more of the same, please!).I\u2019m predisposed to disagree with that kind of generalized argument. Despite everything we\u2019ve learned this year, I still believe that social networks, when designed and managed properly, can be a positive force. Moreover, I\u2019m skeptical that getting users to boycott these services is possible, given how addictive they are.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "YouTube Is Improperly Collecting Children\u2019s Data, Consumer Groups Say", "Date": "2018-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA coalition of more than 20 consumer advocacy groups is expected to file a complaint with federal officials on Monday claiming that YouTube has been violating a children\u2019s privacy law.The complaint contends that YouTube, a subsidiary of Google, has been collecting and profiting from the personal information of young children on its main site, although the company says the platform is meant only for users 13 and older.The coalition of consumer groups said YouTube failed to comply with the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act, a federal law that requires companies to obtain consent from parents before collecting data on children younger than 13. The groups are asking for an investigation and penalties from the Federal Trade Commission, which enforces the law.\u201cGoogle has been continually growing its child-directed service in the United States and all over the world without any kind of acknowledgment of this law and its responsibilities,\u201d said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, one of the groups leading the coalition. \u201cIt\u2019s living in a world of online fiction and denied that it\u2019s serving children.\u201dYouTube defines its main site and app as destinations for viewers 13 and older. It directs younger children to the stand-alone YouTube Kids app, which contains a filtered set of videos from the main site.YouTube\u2019s distinction between its main product and YouTube Kids is significant because of the rules on disclosure and parental consent that kick in for sites with \u201cactual knowledge\u201d that they are trafficking in the personal information of children under 13.In the complaint that will be filed on Monday with the commission, the advocacy groups say YouTube is able to collect data on children under 13 through its main site, where cartoons, nursery-rhyme videos and those ever-popular toy-unboxing clips garner millions of views.The groups say this kind of tracking requires parental notification and consent first. While companies can collect some of that information from children to deliver relevant ads, they are supposed to obtain parental consent to use it for more tailored purposes, like behavioral advertising or profiles of individuals. The YouTube Kids app, for example, specifies in its privacy policy that it \u201cdoes not allow interest-based advertising or re-marketing.\u201d\u201cWe haven\u2019t received the letter yet but look forward to reviewing it,\u201d a spokeswoman for the Federal Trade Commission said in an email. She added that the commission took enforcement of Coppa \u201cvery seriously\u201d and had brought more than two dozen cases tied to the rule.YouTube provided an emailed statement that said the platform had not yet received the complaint but that \u201cprotecting kids and families has always been a top priority for us.\u201dJosh Golin, executive director of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood who is also leading the coalition, said YouTube had been \u201cactively packaging under-13 content for advertisers.\u201dMr. Golin said he believed that YouTube was aware it was collecting and monetizing the data of children with such videos, and that the company should simply shift all the videos aimed at children to the YouTube Kids app.\u201cWe know kids are primarily consuming this through iPads and mobile phones, which are not particularly conducive to group watching,\u201d Mr. Golin said.Dylan Collins, chief executive of SuperAwesome, a privacy technology firm used by companies that market to children, said questions around data collection would only grow as children continued to flood huge tech platforms that were built for adults.\u201cSilicon Valley now has a responsibility to figure out how to move from building adult tech into building kid tech,\u201d Mr. Collins said. \u201cI don\u2019t think any company, whether it\u2019s Facebook or YouTube or Snapchat, can hide from the fact that there are about 10 times more kids online today than there were six or seven years ago when their products were being designed or built.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He had spent his life dabbling in the arts and had no interest in Egypt\u2019s frozen political scene until \u201cthe kids\u201d \u2014 his words \u2014 started risking their lives on the streets on Jan. 25, 2011.Pierre, as he was known to all, opened his doors to protect them from police retaliation, and when Al Jazeera, the satellite channel, asked to put a camera on his roof, he accepted with one condition: It must be on 24 hours a day.That decision probably saved many lives.His apartment, quickly labeled the \u201cHouse of Revolution,\u201d became a mixing ground and plug-in zone for protesters of all ages and backgrounds: artists and intellectuals, students, journalists, even a smattering of Islamists and laborers.It was featured in many articles, books and documentary films, about the Arab revolts. The kids commandeered the stove, and pots of koshari, a favorite Egyptian dish, were ferried daily down the nine stories to people camped out in the square.Years later, some of the half-ironic paper signs that Pierre had taped to the many doors of his home were still there. \u201cThis is a work space,\u201d one of them read. \u201cIf you are not working, go out to the streets and revolt.\u201dI remember my first sight of him, when I walked into his place early in the 2011 revolt while reporting for The New York Times Magazine. Pierre was at his desk, a huge, pear-shaped figure with a beard and shoulder-length gray hair that soared in every direction.All around him, protesters were sprawled on chairs and mattresses, surrounded by the shambolic bric-a-brac of Pierre\u2019s life: gilt-framed paintings, encyclopedias, dead plants, chipped tile tables covered with laptops and ashtrays and plates of half-eaten food.He presided over it all like some absent deity, chain-smoking Marlboros, dressed in a T-shirt bearing the Kentucky Fried Chicken logo of Colonel Sanders and below it, the words \u201cMay Your Grandfather Rest in Peace.\u201dI introduced myself, and Pierre glanced up, pushing back the plastic glasses that were always sliding off his nose.\u201cI\u2019m just like everyone else,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one knows anything.\u201dI did many interviews at Pierre\u2019s place over the following weeks. I was on his balcony when the news broke of Hosni Mubarak\u2019s fall from power and the sea of protesters in Tahrir Square broke into wild roars of joy. Pierre jumped up and down with glee, making the floorboards shake.That night, he wrote on Facebook: \u201cINCREDIBLE the kids did it. Bravo and thanks.\u201dPierre continued to make his apartment available through much of that year, and I, like many other reporters, stopped in when I could to hear his take on the evolving political scene.He was far less sanguine than the na\u00efve young protesters he hosted. He told friends he considered Mr. Mubarak\u2019s ouster a kind of coup by the military, and worried that Egypt\u2019s immature political factions would feud and pave the way for more autocracy. His fears proved prescient.After the election of the Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohamed Morsi in 2012, Pierre withdrew from politics, and in the following year, as a vengeful popular movement arose to oust Mr. Morsi, Pierre closed his Tahrir Square apartment in disgust and headed to the beach for the summer.His bursts of gruff sarcasm concealed a shy, sensitive nature. He was upset, friends said, that the \u201ckids\u201d never bothered to visit him after the frenzy of 2011 had passed. But when provoked, he could rise into a fury made all the more intimidating by his bulk.Not long after the 2011 revolt, a senior officer in Egypt\u2019s military police confronted Pierre outside his house, saying he wasn\u2019t Egyptian.\u201cI\u2019m more Egyptian than you!\u201d Pierre shouted back, in a voice so loud, the officer turned and fled. \u201cHow dare you!\u201dPierre Tewfick Antoine Sioufi was born in Cairo in 1961 to a wealthy Christian family that spoke French at home. His father, Antoine Sioufi, an antiquarian, was of mixed Iraqi and Greek heritage; his mother, Maryse-Liliane Soussa, was Lebanese. An only child, Pierre grew up in Cairo\u2019s elegant Downtown area \u2014 near Tahrir Square \u2014 in an apartment filled with art and some 40 cats.He attended a Jesuit academy until one day, in his midteens, he told his parents that he had had enough of school. They had no objection, so he educated himself with books at home instead.In his 20s, he decided to attend the American University in Cairo, where he became a fixture of the theater scene and hung around for years, playing roles in a variety of plays and films. He eventually earned a degree in business administration.Friends remember Pierre as being always at the center of a crowd, but his gregariousness concealed an inner hurt. \u201cMore than anyone I knew, he seemed orphaned in some way,\u201d one friend wrote in a testimonial after his death.In later years he ran the family antique shop, tried his hand at painting and photography, and took up collecting all kinds of objets d\u2019art: postcards, wrought ironwork, Egyptian movie posters, picture frames and heart-shaped rocks, to name a few.In 2013, he married Beatrice Ghiringhelli, whom he had been seeing for several years. One friend said the wedding was the first time he had seen Pierre in a button-down shirt. His usual outfit was a T-shirt, string pants and Birkenstocks, which he wore on all but the coldest winter days.Ms. Ghiringhelli, who confirmed the death and lives in Athens, is his only immediate survivor.Pierre was wealthy, having inherited the entire Downtown building he lived in. But he despised the presumption that came with wealth and power. He preferred to live like the bohemian students whose revolution he so admired.At the height of his renown, a few months after the fall of Mr. Mubarak, Pierre gently slapped down those who were making him into a spokesman.\u201cI wonder abt all those people who send me chat messages or private messages asking me about Tahrir,\u201d he wrote on Facebook. \u201cI AM unfortunately NOT @Tahrir. Cannot give details about it. Thank you for taking this into consideration.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why America\u2019s Black Mothers and Babies Are in a Life-or-Death Crisis", "Date": "2018-04-11", "News": "FeatureThe answer to the disparity in death rates has everything to do with the lived experience of being a black woman in America.Supported byBut Landrum, who was the mother of two young sons, noticed something different about this pregnancy as it progressed. The trouble began with constant headaches and sensitivity to light; Landrum described the pain as \u201cshocking.\u201d It would have been reasonable to guess that the crippling headaches had something to do with stress: Her relationship with her boyfriend, the baby\u2019s father, had become increasingly contentious and eventually physically violent. Three months into her pregnancy, he became angry at her for wanting to hang out with friends and threw her to the ground outside their apartment. She scrambled to her feet, ran inside and called the police. He continued to pursue her, so she grabbed a knife. \u201cBack up \u2014 I have a baby,\u201d she screamed. After the police arrived, he was arrested and charged with multiple offenses, including battery. He was released on bond pending a trial that would not be held until the next year. Though she had broken up with him several times, Landrum took him back, out of love and also out of fear that she couldn\u2019t support herself, her sons and the child she was carrying on the paycheck from her waitress gig at a restaurant in the French Quarter.As her January due date grew closer, Landrum noticed that her hands, her feet and even her face were swollen, and she had to quit her job because she felt so ill. But her doctor, whom several friends had recommended and who accepted Medicaid, brushed aside her complaints. He recommended Tylenol for the headaches. \u201cI am not a person who likes to take medicine, but I was always popping Tylenol,\u201d Landrum says. \u201cWhen I told him my head still hurt, he said to take more.\u201dAt a prenatal appointment a few days before her baby shower in November, Landrum reported that the headache had intensified and that she felt achy and tired. A handwritten note from the appointment, sandwiched into a printed file of Landrum\u2019s electronic medical records that she later obtained, shows an elevated blood-pressure reading of 143/86. A top number of 140 or more or a bottom number higher than 90, especially combined with headaches, swelling and fatigue, points to the possibility of pre-eclampsia: dangerously high blood pressure during pregnancy.When Landrum complained about how she was feeling more forcefully at the appointment, she recalls, her doctor told her to lie down \u2014 and calm down. She says that he also warned her that he was planning to go out of town and told her that he could deliver the baby by C-section that day if she wished, six weeks before her early-January due date. Landrum says it seemed like an ultimatum, centered on his schedule and convenience. So she took a deep breath and lay on her back for 40 minutes until her blood pressure dropped within normal range. Aside from the handwritten note, Landrum\u2019s medical records don\u2019t mention the hypertensive episode, the headaches or the swelling, and she says that was the last time the doctor or anyone from his office spoke to her. \u201cIt was like he threw me away,\u201d Landrum says angrily.Four days later, Landrum could no longer deny that something was very wrong. She was suffering from severe back pain and felt bone-tired, unable to get out of bed. That evening, she packed a bag and asked her boyfriend to take her sons to her stepfather\u2019s house and then drive her to the hospital. In the car on the way to drop off the boys, she felt wetness between her legs and assumed her water had broken. But when she looked at the seat, she saw blood. At her stepfather\u2019s house, she called 911. Before she got into the ambulance, Landrum pulled her sons close. \u201cMommy loves you,\u201d she told them, willing them to stay calm. \u201cI have to go away, but when I come back I will have your sister.\u201dBy the time she was lying on a gurney in the emergency room of Touro Infirmary, a hospital in the Uptown section of New Orleans, the splash of blood had turned into a steady stream. \u201cI could feel it draining out of me, like if you get a jug of milk and pour it onto the floor,\u201d she recalls. Elevated blood pressure \u2014 Landrum\u2019s medical records show a reading of 160/100 that day \u2014 had caused an abruption: the separation of the placenta from her uterine wall.With doctors and nurses hovering over her, everything became both hazy and chaotic. When a nurse moved a monitor across her belly, Landrum couldn\u2019t hear a heartbeat. \u201cI kept saying: \u2018Is she O.K.? Is she all right?\u2019\u2009\u201d Landrum recalls. \u201cNobody said a word. I have never heard a room so silent in my life.\u201d She remembers that the emergency-room doctor dropped his head. Then he looked into her eyes. \u201cHe told me my baby was dead inside of me. I was like: What just happened? Is this a dream? And then I turned my head to the side and threw up.\u201dSedated but conscious, Landrum felt her mind growing foggy. \u201cI was just so tired,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt like giving up.\u201d Then she pictured the faces of her two young sons. \u201cI thought, Who\u2019s going to take care of them if I\u2019m gone?\u201d That\u2019s the last thing she recalls clearly. When she became more alert sometime later, a nurse told her that she had almost bled to death and had required a half dozen units of transfused blood and platelets to survive. \u201cThe nurse told me: \u2018You know, you been sick. You are very lucky to be alive,\u2019\u2009\u201d Landrum remembers. \u201cShe said it more than once.\u201dA few hours later, a nurse brought Harmony, who had been delivered stillborn via C-section, to her. Wrapped in a hospital blanket, her hair thick and black, the baby looked peaceful, as if she were dozing. \u201cShe was so beautiful \u2014 she reminded me of a doll,\u201d Landrum says. \u201cI know I was still sedated, but as I held her, I kept looking at her, thinking, Why doesn\u2019t she wake up? I tried to feel love, but after a while I got more and more angry. I thought, Why is God doing this to me?\u201dThe hardest part was going to pick up her sons empty-handed and telling them that their sister had died. \u201cI felt like I failed them,\u201d Landrum says, choking up. \u201cI felt like someone had taken something from me, but also from them.\u201dFrom 1915 through the 1990s, amid vast improvements in hygiene, nutrition, living conditions and health care, the number of babies of all races who died in the first year of life dropped by over 90 percent \u2014 a decrease unparalleled by reductions in other causes of death. But that national decline in infant mortality has since slowed. In 1960, the United States was ranked 12th among developed countries in infant mortality. Since then, with its rate largely driven by the deaths of black babies, the United States has fallen behind and now ranks 32nd out of the 35 wealthiest nations. Low birth weight is a key factor in infant death, and a new report released in March by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the University of Wisconsin suggests that the number of low-birth-weight babies born in the United States \u2014 also driven by the data for black babies \u2014 has inched up for the first time in a decade.This tragedy of black infant mortality is intimately intertwined with another tragedy: a crisis of death and near death in black mothers themselves. The United States is one of only 13 countries in the world where the rate of maternal mortality \u2014 the death of a woman related to pregnancy or childbirth up to a year after the end of pregnancy \u2014 is now worse than it was 25 years ago. Each year, an estimated 700 to 900 maternal deaths occur in the United States. In addition, the C.D.C. reports more than 50,000 potentially preventable near-deaths, like Landrum\u2019s, per year \u2014 a number that rose nearly 200 percent from 1993 to 2014, the last year for which statistics are available. Black women are three to four times as likely to die from pregnancy-related causes as their white counterparts, according to the C.D.C. \u2014 a disproportionate rate that is higher than that of Mexico, where nearly half the population lives in poverty \u2014 and as with infants, the high numbers for black women drive the national numbers.Monica Simpson is the executive director of SisterSong, the country\u2019s largest organization dedicated to reproductive justice for women of color, and a member of the Black Mamas Matter Alliance, an advocacy group. In 2014, she testified in Geneva before the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, saying that the United States, by failing to address the crisis in black maternal mortality, was violating an international human rights treaty. After her testimony, the committee called on the United States to \u201celiminate racial disparities in the field of sexual and reproductive health and standardize the data-collection system on maternal and infant deaths in all states to effectively identify and address the causes of disparities in maternal- and infant-mortality rates.\u201d No such measures have been forthcoming. Only about half the states and a few cities maintain maternal-mortality review boards to analyze individual cases of pregnancy-related deaths. There has not been an official federal count of deaths related to pregnancy in more than 10 years. An effort to standardize the national count has been financed in part by contributions from Merck for Mothers, a program of the pharmaceutical company, to the CDC Foundation.The crisis of maternal death and near-death also persists for black women across class lines. This year, the tennis star Serena Williams shared in Vogue the story of the birth of her first child and in further detail in a Facebook post. The day after delivering her daughter, Alexis Olympia, via C-section in September, Williams experienced a pulmonary embolism, the sudden blockage of an artery in the lung by a blood clot. Though she had a history of this disorder and was gasping for breath, she says medical personnel initially ignored her concerns. Though Williams should have been able to count on the most attentive health care in the world, her medical team seems to have been unprepared to monitor her for complications after her cesarean, including blood clots, one of the most common side effects of C-sections. Even after she received treatment, her problems continued; coughing, triggered by the embolism, caused her C-section wound to rupture. When she returned to surgery, physicians discovered a large hematoma, or collection of blood, in her abdomen, which required more surgery. Williams, 36, spent the first six weeks of her baby\u2019s life bedridden.The reasons for the black-white divide in both infant and maternal mortality have been debated by researchers and doctors for more than two decades. But recently there has been growing acceptance of what has largely been, for the medical establishment, a shocking idea: For black women in America, an inescapable atmosphere of societal and systemic racism can create a kind of toxic physiological stress, resulting in conditions \u2014 including hypertension and pre-eclampsia \u2014 that lead directly to higher rates of infant and maternal death. And that societal racism is further expressed in a pervasive, longstanding racial bias in health care \u2014 including the dismissal of legitimate concerns and symptoms \u2014 that can help explain poor birth outcomes even in the case of black women with the most advantages.\u201cActual institutional and structural racism has a big bearing on our patients\u2019 lives, and it\u2019s our responsibility to talk about that more than just saying that it\u2019s a problem,\u201d says Dr. Sanithia L. Williams, an African-American OB-GYN in the Bay Area and a fellow with the nonprofit organization Physicians for Reproductive Health. \u201cThat has been the missing piece, I think, for a long time in medicine.\u201dThen he tore off her clothes and sexually assaulted her. She called the police, who arrested him and charged him with second-degree rape. Landrum got a restraining order, but the district attorney eventually declined to prosecute. She also sought the assistance of the New Orleans Family Justice Center, an organization that provides advocacy and support for survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault. Counselors secreted her and her sons to a safe house, before moving them to a more permanent home early last year.Landrum had a brief relationship with another man and found out in March 2017 that she was pregnant again and due in December. \u201cI\u2019m not going to lie; though I had a lot going on, I wanted to give my boys back the sister they had lost, \u201d Landrum said, looking down at her lap. \u201cThey don\u2019t forget. Every night they always say their prayers, like: \u2018Goodnight, Harmony. Goodnight, God. We love you, sister.\u2019\u2009\u201d She paused and took a breath. \u201cBut I was also afraid, because of what happened to me before.\u201dRight away, the case manager thought of her young, pregnant client. Losing her baby, nearly bleeding to death and fleeing an abusive partner were only the latest in a cascade of harrowing life events that Landrum had lived through since childhood. She was 10 when Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans in 2005. She and her family first fled to a hotel and then walked more than a mile through the rising water to the Superdome, where thousands of evacuees were already packed in with little food, water or space. She remembers passing Charity Hospital, where she was born. \u201cThe water was getting deeper and deeper, and by the end, I was on my tippy-toes, and the water was starting to go right by my mouth,\u201d Landrum recalls. \u201cWhen I saw the hospital, honestly I thought, I\u2019m going to die where I was born.\u201d Landrum wasn\u2019t sure what doulas were, but once Bartkowicz explained their role as a source of support and information, she requested the service. Latona Giwa would be her doula.Giwa, the daughter of a white mother and a Nigerian immigrant father, took her first doula training while she was still a student at Grinnell College in Iowa. She moved to New Orleans for a fellowship in community organizing before getting a degree in nursing. After working as a labor and delivery nurse and then as a visiting nurse for Medicaid clients in St. Bernard Parish, an area of southeast New Orleans where every structure was damaged by Katrina floodwaters, she devoted herself to doula work and childbirth education. She founded Birthmark in 2011 with Dana Keren, another doula who was motivated to provide services for women in New Orleans who most needed support during pregnancy but couldn\u2019t afford it.\u201cBeing a labor and delivery nurse in the United States means seeing patients come in acute medical need, because we haven\u2019t been practicing preventive and supportive care all along,\u201d Giwa says. Louisiana ranks 44th out of all 50 states in maternal mortality; black mothers in the state die at 3.5 times the rate of white mothers. Among the 1,500 clients the Birthmark doulas have served since the collective\u2019s founding seven years ago, 10 infant deaths have occurred, including late-term miscarriage and stillbirth, which is lower than the overall rate for both Louisiana and the United States, as well as the rates for black infants. No mothers have died.In early November, the air was thick with humidity as Giwa pulled up to Landrum\u2019s house, half of a wood-frame duplex, for their second meeting. Landrum opened the door, happy to see the smiling, fresh-faced Giwa, who at first glance looked younger than her 23-year-old client. Giwa would continue to meet with Landrum weekly until her Dec. 22 due date, would be with her during labor and delivery and would make six postpartum home visits to assure that both mother and baby son remained healthy. Landrum led Giwa through her living room, which was empty except for a tangle of disconnected cable cords. She had left most of her belongings behind \u2014 including her dog and the children\u2019s new Christmas toys \u2014 when she fled from her abusive boyfriend, and she still couldn\u2019t afford to replace all her furniture.They sat at the kitchen table, where Giwa asked about Landrum\u2019s last doctor visit, prodding her for details. Landrum reassured her that her blood pressure and weight, as well as the baby\u2019s size and position, were all on target.\u201cHave you been getting rid of things that are stressful?\u201d Giwa asked, handing her a tin of lavender balm, homemade from herbs in her garden.\u201cI\u2019m trying not to be worried, but sometimes. \u2026\u201d Landrum said haltingly, looking down at the table as her hair, tipped orange at the ends, brushed her shoulders. \u201cI feel like my heart is so anxious.\u201dTaking crayons from her bag, Giwa suggested they write affirmations on sheets of white paper for Landrum to post around her home, to see and remind her of the good in her life. Landrum took a purple crayon, her favorite color, and scribbled in tight, tiny letters. But even as she wrote the affirmations, she began to recite a litany of fears: bleeding again when she goes into labor, coming home empty-handed, dying and leaving her sons motherless. Giwa leaned across the table, speaking evenly. \u201cI know that it was a tragedy and a huge loss with Harmony, but don\u2019t forget that you survived, you made it, you came home to your sons,\u201d she said. Landrum stopped writing and looked at Giwa.\u201cIf it\u2019s O.K., why don\u2019t I write down something you told me when we talked last time?\u201d Giwa asked. Landrum nodded. \u201cI know God has his arms wrapped around me and my son,\u201d Giwa wrote in large purple letters, outlining \u201cGod\u201d and \u201carms\u201d in red, as Landrum watched. She took out another sheet of paper and wrote, \u201cHarmony is here with us, protecting us.\u201d After the period, she drew two purple butterflies.Landrum\u2019s eyes locked on the butterflies. \u201cEvery day, I see a butterfly, and I think that\u2019s her. I really do,\u201d she said, finally smiling, her large, dark eyes crinkling into half moons. \u201cI like that a lot, because I think that\u2019s something that I can look at and be like, Girl, you going to be O.K.\u201dWith this pregnancy, Landrum was focused on making sure everything went right. She had switched to a new doctor, a woman who specialized in high-risk pregnancies and accepted Medicaid, and she would deliver this baby at a different hospital. Now she asked Giwa to review the birth plan one more time.\u201cOn Nov. 30, I go on call, and that means this phone is always on me,\u201d Giwa said, holding up her iPhone.\u201cWhat if. \u2026\u201d Landrum began tentatively.\u201cI\u2019m keeping a backup doula informed of everything,\u201d Giwa said. \u201cJust in case.\u201d\u201cI think everything\u2019s going to be O.K. this time,\u201d Landrum said. But it sounded like a question.At Essence magazine, where I was the health editor from the late \u201980s to the mid-\u201990s, we covered the issue of infant mortality by encouraging our largely middle-class black female readers to avoid unwanted pregnancy and by reminding them to pay attention to their health habits during pregnancy and make sure newborns slept on their backs. Because the future of the race depended on it, we also promoted a kind of each-one-teach-one mentality: Encourage teenagers in your orbit to just say no to sex and educate all the \u201csisters\u201d in your life (read: your less-educated and less-privileged friends and family) about the importance of prenatal care and healthful habits during pregnancy.Though I wouldn\u2019t learn of her work until years later, Dr. Arline Geronimus, a professor in the department of health behavior and health education at the University of Michigan School of Public Health, first linked stress and black infant mortality with her theory of \u201cweathering.\u201d She believed that a kind of toxic stress triggered the premature deterioration of the bodies of African-American women as a consequence of repeated exposure to a climate of discrimination and insults. The weathering of the mother\u2019s body, she theorized, could lead to poor pregnancy outcomes, including the death of her infant.By the late 1990s, other researchers were trying to chip away at the mystery of the black-white gap in infant mortality. Poverty on its own had been disproved to explain infant mortality, and a study of more than 1,000 women in New York and Chicago, published in The American Journal of Public Health in 1997, found that black women were less likely to drink and smoke during pregnancy, and that even when they had access to prenatal care, their babies were often born small.When I became pregnant in 1996, this research became suddenly real for me. When my Park Avenue OB-GYN, a female friend I trusted implicitly, discovered that my baby was far smaller than her gestational age would predict, even though I was in excellent health, she put me on bed rest and sent me to a specialist. I was found to have a condition called intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), generally associated with mothers who have diabetes, high blood pressure, malnutrition or infections including syphilis, none of which applied to me. During an appointment with a perinatologist \u2014 covered by my excellent health insurance \u2014 I was hounded with questions about my \u201clifestyle\u201d and whether I drank, smoked or used a vast assortment of illegal drugs. I wondered, Do these people think I\u2019m sucking on a crack pipe the second I leave the office? I eventually learned that in the absence of a medical condition, IUGR is almost exclusively linked with mothers who smoke or abuse drugs and alcohol. As my pregnancy progressed but my baby didn\u2019t grow, my doctor decided to induce labor one month before my due date, believing that the baby would be healthier outside my body. My daughter was born at 4 pounds 13 ounces, classified as low birth weight. Though she is now a bright, healthy, athletic college student, I have always wondered: Was this somehow related to the experience of being a black woman in America?During Giwa\u2019s last prenatal visit, the day before, she explained to Landrum that she would be given Pitocin, a synthetic version of the natural hormone that makes the uterus contract during labor, to start her contractions. \u201cWill inducing stress out the baby?\u201d Landrum asked. \u201cI can\u2019t lie; I used to wake up and scream, when I\u2019d be dreaming about getting cut open again. I know my body is fine, and I\u2019m healthy, but I don\u2019t want to die.\u201d\u201cI respect how honest you are, and your trauma is real,\u201d Giwa told her, slowing down her words. \u201cBut my hope for you is, this birth can be a part of your healing. Your uterus is injured and has been scarred, but you\u2019ve pushed out two babies, so your body knows what it\u2019s doing.\u201dNow, lying on the table, Landrum looked out the window, smiling as the sound of her baby\u2019s heartbeat filled the room. A few minutes later, the technician returned and looked at the monitor. The baby\u2019s heart rate appeared less like little mountains than chicken scratching. He was also either not moving consistently or not breathing properly. A nurse left the room to call Landrum\u2019s doctor to get her opinion. The nurse returned in 20 minutes and gave Landrum the news that the baby would be induced not in two days but now. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to wait; we\u2019re going to get him out today,\u201d she said to Landrum.\u201cI\u2019m very anxious,\u201d Landrum told Giwa on the phone as she walked to labor and delivery, a few floors up in the same hospital, \u201cbut I\u2019m ready.\u201d An hour later, Giwa arrived, wearing purple scrubs, her cloth bag filled with snacks, lavender lotion and clary sage oil. She made sure the crayon-drawn affirmations were taped on the wall within Landrum\u2019s line of vision, then settled into a chair next to the bed, low-key but watchful. Though some doctors resent or even forbid the presence of a doula during labor and delivery \u2014 and some doulas overstep their roles and create conflict with doctors and nurses \u2014 Giwa says she and the other Birthmark doulas try to be unobtrusive and focused on what\u2019s best for the mother.A medical resident, who was white, like all of the staff who would attend Landrum throughout her labor and delivery, walked into the room with paperwork. Right away, she asked Landrum briskly, \u201cHave you had any children before?\u201dShe hadn\u2019t read the chart.\u201cYes, I\u2019ve had three babies, but one died,\u201d Landrum explained warily, for the third time since she had arrived at the hospital that day. Her voice was flat. \u201cI had a stillbirth.\u201d\u201cThe demise was last year?\u201d the resident asked without looking up to see Landrum stiffen at the word \u201cdemise.\u201d\u201cMay I speak to you outside,\u201d Giwa said to the nurse caring for Landrum. In the hall, she asked her to please make a note in Landrum\u2019s chart about the stillbirth. \u201cEach time she has to go over what happened, it brings her mind back to a place of fear and anxiety and loss,\u201d Giwa said later. \u201cThis is really serious. She\u2019s having a high-risk delivery, and I would hope that her care team would thoroughly review her chart before walking into her room.\u201dOne of the most important roles that doulas play is as an advocate in the medical system for their clients. \u201cAt the point a woman is most vulnerable, she has another set of ears and another voice to help get through some of the potentially traumatic decisions that have to be made,\u201d says D\u00e1na-Ain Davis, the director of the Center for the Study of Women and Society at the City University of New York, the author of a forthcoming book on pregnancy, race and premature birth and a black woman who is a doula herself. Doulas, she adds, \u201c are a critical piece of the puzzle in the crisis of premature birth, infant and maternal mortality in black women.\u201dOver the next 10 hours, Giwa left Landrum\u2019s side only briefly. About five hours in, Landrum requested an epidural. The anesthesiologist required all visitors to leave the room while it was administered. When Giwa returned about a half-hour later, Landrum was angry and agitated, clenching her fists and talking much faster than usual. She had mistakenly been given a spinal dose of anesthesia \u2014 generally reserved for C-sections performed in the operating room \u2014 rather than the epidural dose usually used in vaginal childbirth. Now she had no feeling at all in her legs and a splitting headache. When she questioned the incorrect dose of anesthesia, Landrum told Giwa, one nurse said, \u201cYou ask a lot of questions, don\u2019t you?\u201d and winked at another nurse in the room and then rolled her eyes.As Landrum loudly complained about what occurred, her blood pressure shot up, while the baby\u2019s heart rate dropped. Giwa glanced nervously at the monitor, the blinking lights reflecting off her face. \u201cWhat happened was wrong,\u201d she said to Landrum, lowering her voice to a whisper. \u201cBut for the sake of the baby, it\u2019s time to let it go.\u201dShe asked Landrum to close her eyes and imagine the color of her stress.\u201cRed,\u201d Landrum snapped, before finally laying her head onto the pillow.\u201cWhat color is really soothing and relaxing?\u201d Giwa asked, massaging her hand with lotion.\u201cLavender,\u201d Landrum replied, taking a deep breath. Over the next 10 minutes, Landrum\u2019s blood pressure dropped within normal range as the baby\u2019s heart rate stabilized.\u201cHe\u2019s ready,\u201d the doctor said, snapping off his gloves. \u201cIt\u2019s time to push.\u201dOne resident stepped forward and took his place, putting her hand into Landrum\u2019s vagina, feeling for the baby. Landrum gripped the side of the bed and closed her eyes, grimacing. \u201cYou\u2019re a rock star,\u201d Giwa said. The nurse, standing at her side, told Landrum: \u201cPush! Now. You can do it.\u201d After about 20 minutes of pushing, the baby\u2019s head appeared. \u201cThis is it,\u201d the nurse told her. \u201cYou can do this,\u201d Giwa whispered on her other side.Landrum bore down and pushed again. \u201cYou\u2019re doing amazing,\u201d Giwa said, not taking her eyes away from Landrum. The attending physician left the room to put on a clean gown. Landrum breathed in, closed her eyes and pushed. More of the infant\u2019s head appeared, a slick cluster of black curls. The senior resident motioned to the third and most junior of the women, standing at her shoulder, and told her, \u201cHere\u2019s your chance.\u201d The young resident took the baby\u2019s head and eased the slippery infant out. Landrum was oblivious to the procession of young residents taking turns between her legs or the fact that the attending physician wasn\u2019t in the room at all. She was sobbing, shaking, laughing \u2014 all at the same time \u2014 flooded with the kind of hysterical relief a woman feels when a baby leaves her body and emerges into the world.The resident lay the infant, purple, wrinkled and still as a stone, on Landrum\u2019s bare chest. \u201cIs he all right? Is he O.K.?\u201d Landrum asked, panicking as she looked down at the motionless baby. A second later, his tiny arms and legs tensed, and he opened his mouth and let out a definitive cry.\u201cHe\u2019s perfect,\u201d Giwa told her, touching her shoulder.\u201cI did it,\u201d Landrum said, looking up at Giwa and laying her hands on the baby\u2019s back, still coated with blood and amniotic fluid. She had decided to name him Kingston Blessed Landrum.\u201cYes,\u201d Giwa said, finally allowing herself a wide smile. \u201cYou did.\u201dWhat happened to the doctoral student altered the course of the study. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking, Here\u2019s a middle-class, well-educated black woman having a preterm birth when no one else in our group had a preterm birth,\u201d says Dr. Julie Palmer, associate director of the Slone Epidemiology Center at Boston University and a principal investigator of the continuing study of 59,000 subjects. \u201cThat\u2019s when I became aware that the race difference in preterm birth has got to be something different, that it really cuts across class. People had already done some studies showing health effects of racism, so we wanted to ask about that as soon as possible.\u201dIn 1997, the study investigators added several yes-or-no questions about everyday race-related insults: I receive poorer service than others; people act as if I am not intelligent; people act as if I am dishonest; people act as if they are better than me; people act as if they are afraid of me. They also included a set of questions about more significant discrimination: I have been treated unfairly because of my race at my job, in housing or by the police. The findings showed higher levels of preterm birth among women who reported the greatest experiences of racism.The bone-deep accumulation of traumatizing life experiences and persistent insults that the study pinpointed is not the sort of \u201clean in\u201d stress relieved by meditation and \u201cme time.\u201d When a person is faced with a threat, the brain responds to the stress by releasing a flood of hormones, which allow the body to adapt and respond to the challenge. When stress is sustained, long-term exposure to stress hormones can lead to wear and tear on the cardiovascular, metabolic and immune systems, making the body vulnerable to illness and even early death.Lynn Freedman, director of the Averting Maternal Death and Disability Program at Columbia University\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health, decided to take the lessons she and her colleagues learned while studying disrespect and abuse in maternal care in Tanzania \u2014 where problems in pregnancy and childbirth lead to nearly 20 percent of all deaths in women ages 15 to 49 \u2014 and apply them to New York City and Atlanta. Though the study is still in its preliminary phase, early focus groups of some 50 women who recently delivered babies in Washington Heights and Inwood, as well as with doulas who work in both those areas and in central Brooklyn, revealed a range of grievances \u2014 from having to wait one to two months before an initial prenatal appointment to being ignored, scolded and demeaned, even feeling bullied or pushed into having C-sections. \u201cDisrespect and abuse means more than just somebody wasn\u2019t nice to another individual person,\u201d Freedman says. \u201cThere is something structural and much deeper going on in the health system that then expresses itself in poor outcomes and sometimes deaths.\u201dLandrum stopped, and her entire body sagged. She told Giwa that her sons were staying on the other side of town with her godmother, whom she called Nanny. But with children of her own, Nanny was unable to make the 40-minute drive to bring Landrum\u2019s sons to the hospital to see their mama and meet their brother. \u201cAfter they lost their sister, it\u2019s really important that they see Kingston,\u201d Landrum said.\u201cI understand,\u201d Giwa said, stroking her shoulder. \u201cYou need the boys to see their brother, to know that he is alive, that this is all real.\u201d Landrum nodded. She made several phone calls from her hospital bed but could find no one to get the boys, so I left to drive across town and pick them up. It took Giwa\u2019s attentive eyes, and the months of building trust and a relationship with Landrum, to recognize a problem that couldn\u2019t be addressed medically but one that could have emotional and physical consequences.The doula consumer market has been largely driven by and tailored for white women, but the kind of support Giwa was providing to Landrum was actually originated by black women, the granny midwives of the South. Inspired by that historic legacy and by increasingly visible reproductive-justice activism, dozens of doula groups like Birthmark in New Orleans have emerged or expanded in the past several years in Brooklyn, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Dallas, Memphis, Miami, Washington and many other cities, providing services to women of color, often free or on a sliding scale.Interventions that have worked to bring down maternal- and infant-mortality rates in other parts of the world have been brought back to the United States. Rachel Zaslow, a midwife and doula based in Charlottesville, Va., runs a program in northern Uganda, where a woman has a one-in-25 lifetime chance of dying in childbirth, through her nonprofit organization, Mother Health International. In Zaslow\u2019s program, community health workers \u2014 individuals selected by the community and given medical training \u2014 link local pregnant women to trained midwives and nurse-midwives. Since 2008, a mother has never died in Zaslow\u2019s program, and the infant-mortality rate is 11 per 1,000, compared with 64 per 1,000 for the country at large.Three years ago, when she became aware of high rates of infant and maternal mortality in pockets of Virginia, Zaslow decided to take her Ugandan model there: a collective of 45 black and Latina doulas in Charlottesville, called Sisters Keeper, that offers birthing services free to women of color. \u201cThe doula model is very similar to the community health worker model that\u2019s being used a lot, and successfully, throughout the global South,\u201d Zaslow says. \u201cFor me, when it comes to maternal health, the answer is almost always some form of community health worker.\u201d Since 2015, the Sisters Keeper doulas have attended about 300 births \u2014 with no maternal deaths and only one infant death among them.\u201cIt is really hard for American health care professionals to get their heads around that when you have an organized community-based team that connects technical clinical issues with a deep, embedded set of relationships, you can make real breakthroughs,\u201d says Dr. Prabhjot Singh, the director of the Arnhold Institute for Global Health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, who studies community health worker models and how they can be used in the United States. \u201cIn the U.S., doulas can\u2019t do it by themselves, but based on work that\u2019s taken place globally, they can help reduce infant and maternal deaths using what is essentially a very simple solution.\u201dAn hour and a half after Giwa noticed that Landrum needed to have her sons with her, Caden and Dillon burst through the door of the hospital room. Holding Kingston in her lap, Landrum lit up at the sight of the boys. Caden, who is 4, ran to his new brother, gleefully grabbing at the infant. \u201cCalm down,\u201d Landrum said, smiling and patting the side of the bed. \u201cPut out your arms, strong, like this,\u201d she told him, arranging his small arms with her free hand. Gently, she lay Kingston in his brother\u2019s outstretched arms. \u201cIt\u2019s my baby,\u201d he said excitedly, leaning down to kiss the infant all over his cheeks and forehead. \u201cI luh you, brother.\u201dDillon, 7, was more cautious. He stood near the door, watchful. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to meet your brother, Dillon?\u201d Landrum asked. He inched closer, looking at the floor. \u201cCome on, boy, don\u2019t be shy. This is Kingston.\u201d He sat on the other side of his mother, and she took the baby from Caden and placed him in Dillon\u2019s arms. He looked down at the newborn, nervous and still hesitant. \u201cIt\u2019s a real baby,\u201d he said, looking up at his mother and finally smiling. \u201cMommy, you did it.\u201d\u201cAt that moment, I felt complete,\u201d Landrum said later, tearing up, \u201cseeing them all together.\u201dLandrum had lost the baby weight and looked strong and healthy in an oversize T-shirt and leggings, wearing her hair in pink braids that hung down her back. There was a lightness to her that wasn\u2019t apparent during her pregnancy. One word tumbling over the next, she told me that the new baby had motivated her to put her life in order. She had been doing hair and makeup for church members and friends out of her house to earn money to buy a car. She had applied to Delgado Community College to study to be an ultrasound technician. \u201cI love babies,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I look at ultrasound pictures, I imagine I see the babies smiling at me.\u201dLatona Giwa had continued to care for Landrum for two months after Kingston\u2019s birth. The C.D.C. measures American maternal mortality not just by deaths that occur in pregnancy or childbirth, or in the immediate days afterward, but rather all deaths during pregnancy and the year after the end of pregnancy \u2014 suggesting the need for continued care and monitoring, especially for women who are most at risk of complications.It was Giwa who drove Landrum and the baby home from the hospital, moving her own 2-year-old daughter\u2019s car seat from the back of her Honda and replacing it with a backward-facing infant seat, when Landrum had no other ride. It was Giwa who ushered the new mother into her home and then surprised her by taking a bag of groceries and a tray of homemade lasagna, still warm, from the back of the car. And it was Giwa who asked her, six weeks after childbirth, if she had talked to her doctor about getting a contraceptive implant to avoid pregnancy. When Landrum told her that her doctor had never called her about a checkup, Giwa was livid. \u201cHigh-risk patients with complicated maternal histories often have an appointment two weeks after they\u2019ve been discharged,\u201d she said later, after insisting that Landrum call to make an appointment. \u201cHer life is hectic; she\u2019s at home with three children. Luckily she\u2019s fine, but at minimum someone should\u2019ve called to check on her.\u201dFor Giwa\u2019s work with Landrum, from October to February, she earned just $600. Like the other Birthmark doulas, Giwa can\u2019t make ends meet just doing doula work; she is employed as a lactation consultant for new mothers both privately and at a \u201clatch clinic\u201d in a New Orleans office of the federal Women, Infants and Children Food and Nutrition Service that supports low-income pregnant and postpartum women.\u201cWe need to recognize that there is actual medical benefit to having doula support \u2014 and make the argument that insurance should pay for it,\u201d says Williams, the Bay Area OB-GYN. \u201cIt is a job. People do have to be paid for that work.\u201d Insurance would mean some standardization; Williams notes that many programs securing public funding or grants to provide doula support to lower-income women can\u2019t match the kind of money that private doulas can command. These programs often have \u201call black women who are doulas,\u201d she says. \u201cYes, it\u2019s fantastic that these women are training to be doulas and supporting other black women \u2014 but they\u2019re not making as much as these other doulas.\u201d If, she asks, \u201cdoula support is important and can have this beneficial outcome for women, especially black women, how can we actually move forward to make that more accessible to everybody?\u201dIn her home on that March afternoon, Landrum put Kingston into a baby carrier. He fell asleep as we walked five blocks to meet Dillon and Caden, who were due home from school at two different bus stops. The boys jumped off their buses, dressed in identical red polo shirts, their hair freshly cut, each dragging a large backpack, and ran to their mother. Dillon could hardly wait to pull out his report card and show his mother his grades; he had received four out of six \u201cexceptional\u201d marks. \u201cHe\u2019s smart,\u201d Landrum said, and he gave her a huge, gaptoothed smile.Then he raced ahead, his backpack lurching as he leapt over bumps in the sidewalk full of pent-up little-boy energy; Caden was right behind him, doing his best to keep up with his brother\u2019s longer strides. \u201cHey, y\u2019all, you be careful!\u201d Landrum called, keeping her eyes trained on them. \u201cYou hear me?!\u201dKingston stirred when he heard his mother\u2019s voice. He lifted his head briefly and looked into Landrum\u2019s face. Their eyes met, his still slightly crossed with new-baby nearsightedness. Landrum paused long enough to stroke his head and kiss his damp cheek. The baby sighed. Then he burrowed his head back into the warmth and safety of his mother\u2019s chest.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cubans Doubt a Change at the Top Will Bring Change at the Bottom", "Date": "2018-04-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHAVANA \u2014 The streets brimmed with people going about their day, hauling handcarts of fruit down narrow side streets, shuffling along sun-faded esplanades, waiting impatiently at the crosswalks of busy intersections.Rather, the long-awaited transition was a seamless and carefully managed affair, cloaked in the quiet formalism of a modest ceremony before the nation\u2019s national assembly.He stood in the sun accompanied by his friend Ulises Menendez, an electrician, who nodded quietly and added: \u201cIllusions are a terrible thing in Cuba. You cannot have them because you never know what will happen and we are tired of disappointment.\u201dThere is a serious lag between change at the top and change on the bottom in Cuba.After Ra\u00fal Castro officially took over the presidency from his brother Fidel in 2008, he pushed through unprecedented reforms to open up the economy and chart a new future. That included brokering a deal to make peace with the United States, which paved the way for a flood of well-heeled American visitors that is now, under President Trump, slowing drastically.Here on the island, many feel deflated by so much promise with so little impact on their daily lives. They express a sense of a hopelessness \u2014 a disappointment more deeply felt because of all the anticipation that preceded it.Those economic reforms? Some have failed to materialize, while the most successful \u2014 the issuing of licenses to start small businesses \u2014 has all but stalled as the state deliberates how to move forward. The rapprochement with the United States? President Trump all but torpedoed it, at least in tone. Even the island\u2019s historic escape valves \u2014 visas and undocumented migration to the United States \u2014 have been turned off.In the most recent blow, the United States Embassy in Havana vastly reduced its staff and stopped issuing visas to Cubans after dozens of its personnel were mysteriously sickened in what the State Department has described as attacks of unknown origin.That happened after the immigration pipeline of Cubans trying to reach the United States had already been abruptly squeezed by the Obama administration. Before leaving office, President Barack Obama put an end to the longstanding policy known as wet-foot-dry-foot, which allowed Cubans who made it to American soil or border crossings without a visa to stay in the United States.Now the Trump administration\u2019s decision to shut down many of the functions of the Havana embassy is making it even harder for Cubans to head north.Without an operating consular office, Cubans had to travel to Colombia earlier this year to even apply for their visas, a costly endeavor considering that their average salaries amount to about $1 a day. Today, that pipeline has been blocked, too. Visa issuance for Cubans hoping to visit their families in the United States is now being done from Guyana.\u201cThere are thousands of parents who have children in the U.S. and who are not going to be able to visit them,\u201d said one Cuban doctor, who spoke on condition of anonymity because she and her partner are trying to leave the country without permission. \u201cWith Obama, there was a big step forward because relations were reestablished. And now just because of Trump\u2019s whim, things have become worse than ever.\u201dIt is still unclear exactly how Mr. Trump\u2019s promised reversal of Obama administration policies will play out over the long haul. Some American visitors to Cuba say they did not take any measures to come to the island that were not already in place following the opening of relations between the two nations.In the first quarter of 2018, visits to the island from non-Cuban Americans dropped by nearly 60 percent, according to government figures.For Cubans who have been fortunate enough to find work in the booming tourism industry, the results have been devastating.N\u00e1yade Trini\u00f1o Ginori, a 44-year-old teacher who joined the wave of private-sector opportunities as a tour guide, says she has not hosted a group of Americans since last June. While leading tours, she earned about $100 a day, an enormous sum in Cuba \u2014 100 times her state salary as a teacher.\u201cBecause of the policies of the new U.S. president, I\u2019m out of work,\u201d she said.For now, she has decided to return to teaching, at a slightly better salary than before, but nowhere near what her tourism job paid.Feeling trapped is nothing new to Cubans. Many stayed in the country during its toughest periods either because they could not find a way to leave or because of their commitment to the ideals extolled by Fidel Castro.But today, some feel as though they are in a pressure cooker, or a fishbowl, looking out at the world from the confines of Cuba yet unable to participate.Alejandro Rodriguez, 29, a popular DJ in Havana, scrolled through his Facebook feed on a recent night with envy.He shook his head.\u201cHe\u2019s gone, she\u2019s gone,\u201d he said, ticking off the friends who have fled. \u201cPeople are leaving any way they can.\u201dMidway through a scroll, he stopped.\u201cThis guy just claimed political asylum in France on his layover to Russia,\u201d he said with grudging admiration. \u201cWhat a move.\u201dThe very idea of a political transition to a new Cuban president makes little sense to him \u2014 especially one he expected to propagate the same reality.\u201cI didn\u2019t even know there was this transition happening, and I would bet that most of my neighbors didn\u2019t know either,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that it\u2019s not important. It\u2019s just that whatever happens up there doesn\u2019t trickle down to us. S o why does it matter?\u201dLike others in his generation, the future seems a distant concern, perhaps more of an idea than a reality. With so much reform and so little change, daily life is where hopes begin and end.As Cuba\u2019s new president traded off at the podium with the old one at the National Assembly this week, residents in the neighborhood of La Ceiba took to other forms of entertainment. They huddled in a worn down park, browsing the relatively new luxury of public internet that has come to Havana in recent years.It was a midmorning affair, with well-groomed youth staring down at cellphones, dashing off messages or chatting with family abroad. Nearby, parked outside of the neighborhood bodega with a few friends, Luis Ernesto Rodriguez, 28, sized up his day.As a construction worker, he helps build and finish houses, irregular work that earns him less than $80 a month. Today, however, he was off.\u201cThe people I am working for can\u2019t afford to buy the materials, so what can I do?\u201d he said. \u201cHere, it\u2019s day-to-day.\u201dOlder men worked along the periphery of the denuded space, collecting trash or fixing cars.\u201cThe youth of today are different from us,\u201d said Alberto Gonzalez, a 54-year-old trash collector whose pushcart was littered with glass bottles and refuse. \u201cThey didn\u2019t see firsthand the benefits of the revolution that we did.\u201dHe and at least some of his generation buy into Cuba\u2019s social compact. They have seen better times, and to them working toward a common prosperity amounts to more than just words.Still, life is hard. On his base salary of about $10 a month, there are few luxuries for Mr. Gonzalez. Beers cost $1 a piece, after all. Though in some ways he resents the young men and women sitting around in the park and not working, he understands.\u201cToday,\u201d he said, \u201cthere is nothing for the youth.\u201dAn earlier version of this article incorrectly described adjustments to immigration policy under the Obama administration. President Barack Obama did not end the Cuban adjustment act. He ended \u201cwet foot dry foot,\u201d a rule that allowed Cubans who arrived without visas to remain in the United States.Hannah Berkeley Cohen and Ed Augustin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "8th Murder Charge in Case That Rattled Toronto Gay Community", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor more than a month, the police in Toronto have been trying to solve a mystery. They had a photograph of an unidentified dead man, and they had discovered human remains in planters where a man suspected of multiple killings had worked as a landscaper.On Monday, the police announced that they had charged the suspect, Bruce McArthur, with first-degree murder in the death of an eighth alleged victim \u2014 Kirushna Kumar Kanagaratnam, the man in the photograph.The development was weeks in the making. Investigators released Mr. Kanagaratnam\u2019s photograph to the public on March 5, declining to say where it had come from and appealing for help identifying him. They enlisted the assistance of an officer who spoke Tamil, and coordinated with Mr. Kanagaratnam\u2019s family, who was still in Sri Lanka.He said Mr. Kanagaratnam had arrived in Canada from Sri Lanka in 2010, and lived in Toronto. He was believed to have been murdered between Sept. 3 and Dec. 14, 2015, at the age of 37, but his name was not on file with the department as a missing person.The case has unsettled Toronto and exposed a rift that has lingered for decades between gay residents and law enforcement officials there.\u201cIt has shaken the L.G.B.T.Q. community to the core,\u201d Councilor Kristyn Wong-Tam, whose ward includes the downtown neighborhood featuring the Gay Village, said. \u201cPeople have responded with a mix of emotions from absolute horror to anger. There is a level of frustration that I think is quite palpable, especially as it relates to wanting more answers and not getting them in a timely fashion.\u201dIn December 2017, the Toronto police chief, Mark Saunders, said there was no evidence of a serial killer, prompting outrage when Mr. McArthur, a 66-year-old landscaper, was arrested weeks later, on Jan. 18.This month he was charged with the murder of Abdulbasir Faizi, who disappeared in December 2010.Mr. McArthur had previously been charged with six counts of first-degree murder for the deaths of six men: Selim Esen, Andrew Kinsman, Soroush Mahmudi, Dean Lisowick, Majeed Kayhan and Skanda Navaratnam. Remains of all of the men, except for Mr. Kayhan, were recovered from planters on a property where Mr. McArthur worked.Mr. Kanagaratnam \u201cdoesn\u2019t quite fit the profile that we have seen before,\u201d Sergeant Idsinga said, referring to the lack of evidence of ties between Mr. Kanagaratnam and the Gay Village.Sergeant Idsinga said that the department was working through its list of outstanding missing-person cases and that it was looking at cold cases.\u201cThis does create basically a wide open net,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve had lots of calls, international calls, since our pleas began, from people who just haven\u2019t seen family members in years.\u201dMr. McArthur will return to court later this month on all eight charges. The police have not said whether there will be further charges or identification of additional remains.Immigrants account for about half the population of Toronto. Ms. Wong-Tam said that Mr. Kanagaratnam had reached Canada\u2019s shores after months on a boat in his quest for asylum.\u201cHe risked his life to try to flee a politically unstable country in a region where he was facing violence,\u201d she said. \u201cFor him to face his imminent death in Toronto in such a way is heartbreaking.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Rice Balls, Subtle and Showy Alike, at Omusubi Gonbei", "Date": "2018-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHungry City10 PhotosI\u2019d never seen a rice ball quite as large as the Bomb, whose heft in the palm calls to mind the smack of a line drive into the glove.It comes entirely wrapped in nori and, when bitten into, reveals a mantle of impeccably fluffy rice, so white that the grains gleam. At its core lie flakes of grilled salmon, tuna tinged with Sriracha-spiked mayonnaise, and kombu for a pop of brine: three rice balls\u2019 worth of fillings in one.The Bomb is the creation of Omusubi Gonbei, a chain founded in Japan in 1999. Its first American outpost opened in 2013 in the food court of Mitsuwa Marketplace, a sprawling Japanese store in Edgewater, N.J. The second followed last spring, a counter tucked inside Katagiri grocery by Grand Central Terminal.Its other rice balls, known as omusubi or onigiri in Japanese, are more traditional in ingredients and shape, neatly triangular, trussed with a band of nori or shielded by a shiso leaf like a strategically placed fan. But they, too, are larger than life: Omusubi Gonbei claims to use one and a half times as much rice as its competitors.(This is true both here and at home in Japan. Omusubi Gonbei\u2019s rice balls are giants in both countries, not supersized for American appetites.)The plainest of onigiri is just rice with a press of salt from the fingertips and a stripe of sesame seeds on top. But there\u2019s no just: The rice is grown in Japan without pesticides or chemical fertilizers, then shipped unprocessed and milled only once on the premises, to retain its flavor.The white rice is exceptional, the grains swelling and clinging without clotting, so that the onigiri, gently patted into form by hand, stay fluffy and porous, not contracting with the loss of heat. The brown rice is arguably even better, slightly denser but wonderfully nutty and almost chewy.Little signs are posted listing cooking and expiration times. The company advises that you eat the omusubi within four hours of its being made. I pushed that to the limit, and they were still delicious.Onigiri start at $1 and top out at $3.80 for the Bomb, which could be a lunch unto itself. Ingredients might be mixed into the rice or buried at the center with a lone dab at the peak, like a flag.The American menus \u2014 and the French: There\u2019s an Omusubi Gonbei in Paris \u2014 are practically identical to those in Tokyo, save for the intrusion of that spicy tuna. It\u2019s a generous concession to Western tastes, harking back to the spicy tuna rolls reportedly concocted by Japanese immigrant chefs in Los Angeles in the 1970s, to cater to the local fondness for condiments and the heat of Mexican food.Some consider this sacrilege, the chile masking the flavor of the fish. Here, it\u2019s a nice kick after all that soothing rice, like a muffled bolt of lightning.Still, I preferred less showy ingredients: takana, pickled mustard greens with a faint, grounding bitterness; umeboshi, salty-sour pickled plum whose residual sweetness fights through; mentaiko (pollock roe), briny and close to cream.Jako, dark-eyed glassine baby sardines, bodies ossified, taste like shattered deep-sea bacon. They\u2019re threaded through a rice ball framed by shiso leaves, lending a green scent and hint of menthol.A shrimp locked in tempura batter flares its tail, the nori draped around the rice like a tuxedo vest. The idea is smartly reprised with a fried oyster, another innovation for the American audience. Spam, a nod to the Hawaiian version of omusubi, is slapped over tamago, omelet laced with sugar and mirin: the classic death match \u2014 and love match \u2014 of salty and sweet.Also on offer are miniature buckets ($3.50 each) of karaage, fried chicken in boneless pieces, all dark thigh, the meat rich from a bath in soy sauce. The crust softens a little as it sits, but still has fervor, its nubbly coat infiltrated by ginger, garlic and seasonings that the manager very kindly, very firmly refused to name.Omusubi Gonbei is stationed right inside the entrance to Katagiri, which opened in 1907 as one of the first Japanese markets in the United States. (The original shop still stands on East 59th Street.) Venture deeper, and the missed opportunities multiply: bento boxes, sushi, steam rising from bowls of ramen.No regrets. Just a promise to come back.Omusubi GonbeiAdvertisement"}

But in recent years, you\u2019ve experienced droopy eyes, a drippy nose or violent sneezing during spring.As sniffle season sets in, we wondered: Is that a sign you\u2019ve developed later-in-life allergies?While it\u2019s relatively common to outgrow allergies over time, the hunch that we\u2019ve picked up new ones is often a misconception, according to Dr. William Reisacher, an ear, nose and throat specialist at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian.Allergies peak in adolescence or early adulthood, he told us, and tend to remain steady for years after that before eventually declining in older age.What\u2019s more likely happening, he said, is that we\u2019re not changing, but the environment is \u2014 and that\u2019s what is triggering these symptoms.\u201cPeople are sensitive to things in the environment \u2014 like cats, dust and pollen \u2014 but if they\u2019re exposed to a regular amount of it, they don\u2019t have problems and might not even know they\u2019re sensitive to it,\u201d Dr. Reisacher said.\u201cBut now, if the levels of that allergen go up in your immediate environment \u2014 a bad pollen season, or if you went to a place with lots of cats \u2014 you may exceed your threshold,\u201d he said.New Yorkers may also confuse allergy-like symptoms with reactions to other irritants in the city, like chemicals, odors or air pollutants, Dr. Reisacher said. And as we age, he added, we also tend to write off our ailments \u2014 runny noses (a side effect of some medications), asthmalike symptoms (which may be caused by heart conditions) or sneezing (which occurs naturally as our nasal passageways dry up) \u2014 as caused by pollen in the air.And if, despite the doctor\u2019s advice, your reaction to this rainy weather has you convinced of your new allergies?Think again.\u201cWhat happens in the later spring, when there\u2019s a lot of rain, is that there\u2019s also a spike in mold levels,\u201d Dr. Reisacher said. \u201cSo some people who think they\u2019re allergic to pollen are actually reacting to the seasonal rise in mold spores.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:Today\u2019s a wash. Literally.(Hair forecast: like you walked through a carwash.)Things should clear up again by tomorrow, and the partly sunny skies ahead are here to stay through the weekend.Happy birthday, Edward R. Murrow.Although the celebrated broadcaster, born 110 years ago today, did much of his most notable reporting from London, he was, at the end of the day, a New Yorker \u2014 a resident of a 10th-floor apartment at 580 Park Avenue and of a farm in Pawling in Dutchess County.His first job out of college was as president of the National Student Federation, work done for $25 a week out of a New York basement.

{"Headline": "We Already Know How to Protect Ourselves From Facebook", "Date": "2018-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Tufekci is the author of \u201cTwitter and Tear Gas: The Power and Fragility of Networked Protest.\u201dThis week, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, is scheduled to testify before two congressional committees amid the growing outcry over the company\u2019s data collection practices. Because I have been analyzing the potential negative effects of Facebook on politics for a long time, I am fielding a lot of inquiries about what legislators should ask Mr. Zuckerberg.Here\u2019s my answer: Nothing. We already know most everything we need for legislators to pass laws that would protect us from what Facebook has unleashed.The sight of lawmakers yelling at Mr. Zuckerberg might feel cathartic, but the danger of a public spectacle is that it will look like progress but amount to nothing: a few apologies from Mr. Zuckerberg, some earnest-sounding promises to do better, followed by a couple of superficial changes to Facebook that fail to address the underlying structural problems.This has been Facebook\u2019s public relations strategy for years. After each scandal, it expresses regrets, announces a few cosmetic fixes and then works like mad to scuttle any legislation that might have a favorable impact on the core problem: how our data is harvested, used and profited from. It would be a shame if we went through that again.In addition to apologizing, Mr. Zuckerberg will no doubt promise more transparency. Don\u2019t get me wrong: I\u2019m all for transparency. But while transparency can help us diagnose problems in the online economy, it alone doesn\u2019t fix them.Mr. Zuckerberg is also likely to promise to lock down all the data Facebook has collected on billions of people. That sounds like a good idea, but it is mostly irrelevant now; the data is already compromised.So why did it give away people\u2019s data in the past? In part because it is a reckless company (\u201cMove fast and break things\u201d used to be a company motto of sorts). And in part because the data \u2014 a tantalizing resource for programmers \u2014 could be used to lure developers to make games, quizzes and other apps for Facebook that would keep users coming back to the site.But that phase of the company\u2019s development is over. Because Facebook does not sell our data directly (or even want to), extracting promises from Mr. Zuckerberg that it not do so would be worse than a toothless remedy. It would only serve Facebook\u2019s business model.What would a genuine legislative remedy look like? First, personalized data collection would be allowed only through opt-in mechanisms that were clear, concise and transparent. There would be no more endless pages of legalese that nobody reads or can easily understand. The same would be true of any individualized targeting of users by companies or political campaigns \u2014 it should be clear, transparent and truly consensual.Second, people would have access, if requested, to all the data a company has collected on them \u2014 including all forms of computational inference (how the company uses your data to make guesses about your tastes and preferences, your personal and medical history, your political allegiances and so forth).Third, the use of any data collected would be limited to specifically enumerated purposes, for a designed period of time \u2014 and then would expire. The current model of harvesting all data, with virtually no limit on how it is used and for how long, must stop.Fourth, the aggregate use of data should be regulated. Merely saying that individuals own their data isn\u2019t enough: Companies can and will persuade people to part with their data in ways that may seem to make sense at the individual level but that work at the aggregate level to create public harms. For example, collecting health information from individuals in return for a small compensation might seem beneficial to both parties \u2014 but a company that holds health information on a billion people can end up posing a threat to individuals in ways they could not have foreseen.Facebook may complain that these changes to data collection and use would destroy the company. But while these changes would certainly challenge the business model of many players in the digital economy, giant companies like Facebook would be in the best position to adapt and forge ahead.If anything, we should all be thinking of ways to reintroduce competition into the digital economy. Imagine, for example, requiring that any personal data you consent to share be offered back to you in an \u201cinteroperable\u201d format, so that you could choose to work with companies you thought would provide you better service, rather than being locked in to working with one of only a few.Right now, Silicon Valley is stuck in a (very profitable) rut. To force it to change would not only make us safer but also foster innovation.That would be a better, more satisfying outcome than any dramatic \u201cHave you no sense of decency, sir?\u201d moment that a congressional hearing might produce.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Picking an Extra A\u00f1ejo Tequila Takes Extra Care", "Date": "2018-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCinco de Mayo is not the moment for extra a\u00f1ejo tequila. While plenty of the agave spirit from Jalisco, Mexico, will flow on May 5, in cheap margaritas and shots, the bottles classified as extra a\u00f1ejo \u2014 which by Mexican law must be aged more than three years \u2014 will mostly stay on the top shelf of the bar, awaiting another day.That\u2019s because extra a\u00f1ejo is tequila\u2019s big stretch into the heady world of high-end brown spirits, an unabashedly flashy space crowded with Cognac in shiny crystal decanters, expensive decades-old Scotch and impossible-to-find single-cask bourbon.The popularity of long-aged agave spirits is a recent phenomenon, so it\u2019s perhaps no surprise to find these arriviste tequilas aping the packaging and storytelling of whiskey or brandy, focusing on rarity and age and high prices. You\u2019ll find extra a\u00f1ejo bottled flamboyantly, adorned with ribbons, strings, wax seals and medallions, and sold in boxes that are gold-trimmed, leather-encased or faux-velvet-lined. Many sell for more than $100, and some for much more.But some spirits aficionados view all this flash with skepticism, and say the quality of the tequilas doesn\u2019t always measure up to the expense and hype.Much of the growth in super-premium tequilas occurred after 2006, when the Tequila Regulatory Council, a Mexican trade organization, created the extra a\u00f1ejo classification; before that, the oldest tequilas were simply labeled a\u00f1ejo, meaning that they had to be aged a minimum of one year.The big tequila brands, several of which have been acquired by larger conglomerates in the last year, have noticed. Patr\u00f3n (acquired by Bacardi for $5 billion) and Avi\u00f3n (acquired by giant Pernot Ricard) have both introduced extra a\u00f1ejo tequilas since 2014.\u201cWe didn\u2019t really forecast for extra a\u00f1ejo to become so big. Who would have thought?\u201d said Jenna Fagnan, the president of Avi\u00f3n \u201cTwo years ago, we said, \u2018Something\u2019s happening here.\u2019 \u201dCarlos Camarena, the influential distiller of tequila brands like El Tesoro, Tapatio, Villa Lobos and Excellia, estimates that his brands\u2019 extra a\u00f1ejo sales have grown more than 50 percent over the past three years. \u201cIt\u2019s growing faster than any of the other categories,\u201d said Mr. Camarena, who pioneered the aging of tequila in the late 1980s, when he created El Tesoro Paradiso, which was aged for five years in Cognac barrels.Until the late 20th century, Mexico consumed more aged Spanish brandy and whiskey than tequila, which was regarded as a lowbrow spirit even its homeland. Five-year-old tequila was unheard-of. \u201cWe were breaking the myth that tequila couldn\u2019t be aged,\u201d Mr. Camarena said.Since then, he has experimented widely, aging tequila in Sauternes barrels, sherry butts, rum casks and barrels made from Japanese oak. \u201cThe sky is the limit,\u201d he said. \u201cBut regardless of the aging or the barrel, the consumer has to still perceive the agave. It should not taste like chewing a piece of oak.\u201dWoody tequila is a pet peeve for many purists, who prefer the spicy, complex agave flavors of unaged blanco or lightly aged reposado (\u201crested\u201d for less than 12 months) tequila, and view extra a\u00f1ejo bottles with a gimlet eye.\u201cYou can\u2019t age tequila forever,\u201d Ms. Fagnan said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t behave the same as whiskey. Eventually it just falls apart.\u201dMr. Palazzi, the Brooklyn distributor, said: \u201cThere\u2019s very little research about how the agave ages in the barrel. Most of the extra a\u00f1ejo you drink tastes like vanilla and coconut. Often it\u2019s hard to say what\u2019s the cask and what is the aging of the agave.\u201dStill, when the agave and wood are in balance, there is nothing quite like great extra a\u00f1ejo, which offers a distinctly different sipping experience than brandy or whiskey do. \u201cAs long as the oak doesn\u2019t completely cover the agave flavor, you could age it 12 to 15 years,\u201d Mr. Camarena said.For a long time, he resisted long-aging his tequilas, and even now insists on barrels made of brand-new French oak, or virgin oak from the Ozarks that he seasons with his own blanco tequila. \u201cI don\u2019t think tequila calls for the help of bourbon or Cognac,\u201d he said. Siembra Azul\u2019s three extra a\u00f1ejos, all aged for five years, seem to back up his point.\u201cIt\u2019s a new experiment for all of us,\u201d Mr. Suro-Pi\u00f1era said. \u201cBut here\u2019s what I do know: The blanco going into the barrel has to be remarkable in order to have a good extra a\u00f1ejo.\u201dExtra a\u00f1ejo tequila is not cheap. But when the agave and wood are in harmony, there\u2019s nothing quite like the taste. Here are some of the best. Besides these six, also look for the hard-to-find Tapatio Excelencia ($170) and Siete Leguas D\u2019Antano ($279).Delicate and approachable, floral with light spice and notes of apricot and citrus.

Arlee is a public school on the Flathead Indian Reservation; about half the town is Salish, descendants of the people forced out of the Bitterroot in the 19th century. Manhattan Christian\u2019s boys were tall and muscled; most of Arlee\u2019s players were well under six feet and on the thinner side. Manhattan Christian arrived in a sleek black bus with aerodynamic curvature and tinted windows; Arlee came in a yellow Blue Bird. The Feb. 23 game would be a rematch of the previous year\u2019s Class C state championship, which the Warriors won. On one wall of the gym, Manhattan Christian had hung a banner reading \u201c#unfinished.\u201d Arlee had their own banner, but they did not need it. They had Phillip Malatare.Phil is 18 and six feet tall. He claimed to be 167 pounds, but that seemed generous. His normally angular face was especially gaunt that afternoon, a result of a nasty cold. But he had a reputation in the state: for his routine triple-doubles, his no-look passes thrown around his back at a dead sprint, his unguardable pull-up jump shot, the speed and body control that made it all possible. His parents, John and Becky, arrived at 9 a.m. to watch the day\u2019s earlier games and to stake out seats. The Malatares never sat together at games. \u201cIt just works better,\u201d Becky said. \u201cI like to kind of breathe.\u201d John wore a red T-shirt adorned with a Salish phrase that translates as \u201cI\u2019m proud of my warriors.\u201dTen minutes remained before warm-ups. Normally, at this point, the boys would be making fart jokes or talking about video games. Now, though, the Warriors left the locker room and gathered in a hallway. A cameraman lined the players up. They were silent. The light on the camera blinked, and Phil spoke.\u201cWe, the Arlee Warriors,\u201d he said, \u201care dedicating this divisional tournament to all the families that have lost a loved one due to \u2014 um \u2014\u201d He tripped up, and the cameraman asked for another take.\u201cWe, the Arlee Warriors,\u201d he said, \u201care dedicating this divisional tournament to all the families that have lost a loved one due to the pro \u2014 due to the pressures \u2014\u201dPhil tried again: \u201cWe, the Arlee Warriors, are dedicating this divisional tournament to all the families that have fallen victim to the loss of a loved one due to the pressures of life.\u201d\u201cWe want you all to know,\u201d said Greg Whitesell, one of Phil\u2019s co-captains, \u201cthat you will be in our hearts and in our prayers as we step onto the floor to represent our school, community and our reservation.\u201dLane Johnson, the power forward, spoke: \u201cAs a team, we rely on each other to get through the challenges on the court or in life.\u201d Then Isaac Fisher, the 6-foot-9 center, said, \u201cTo all the youth on the Flathead reservation, we want you to know that we stand together with you.\u201dDarshan Bolen, the sixth man and Phil\u2019s cousin and foster brother, said, \u201cRemember, you are the future.\u201d Phil wrote that line. Then Will Mesteth, a co-captain and the team\u2019s only other senior, closed it: \u201cPlease help us share this message and join our team as we battle against suicide.\u201dOnly about half the Warriors could legally drive, and many struggled academically. But as state champions, they were kings on the Flathead reservation. They came into the season hoping to defend their trophy; Phil and Will also wanted a chance to play in college. But by the evening of the Manhattan Christian game, the season had transformed into something else entirely.The videographer turned off his camera, and the Warriors retreated into the locker room. The boys could hear the gym rippling with noise. Then the drumming started.The town is named for a Salish subchief. In 1872, Arlee, a Nez Perc\u00e9 by birth, acquiesced to the U.S. government\u2019s demands that the Bitterroot Salish relocate. This put him at odds with the head Salish chief, Charlo, who stayed in the Bitterroot Valley until 1891, when he marched north under military escort. Embittered, he had called Arlee \u201cthat renegade Nez Perc\u00e9.\u201d On the reservation, the Salish were forced together with the Pend d\u2019Oreille, their historical allies, and the Kootenai, a northern tribe with a different language. Government officials assigned them Anglicized names, and in 1909 Congress passed legislation opening the reservation to settlers. Many tribal members sold their allotted land, and Chief Charlo died in 1910; Native youth were forced into a Catholic boarding school, where nuns told the children that the devil was in them. The town of Charlo, 30 miles from Arlee, is now almost entirely white. Arlee is not. The town\u2019s most popular gathering places are Wilson\u2019s, a grocery store; a community center full of basketball courts; and the gleaming gymnasium that looms over the one-story public high school.Because of its size, Arlee competes in Class C, the division representing Montana\u2019s smallest schools, most of them in mining and ranching towns or communities in Indian Country. The state\u2019s seven reservations \u2014 home to members of the Salish, Pend d\u2019Oreille, Kootenai, Blackfeet, Gros Ventre, Sioux, Crow, Northern Cheyenne, Assiniboine and Chippewa-Cree tribes \u2014 share a deep passion for basketball. In 1904, just 13 years after James Naismith invented the game, a team of Native girls at a boarding school near Great Falls competed in a tournament at the World\u2019s Fair in St. Louis and were proclaimed world champions. In 1936, a team from the Fort Peck Reservation won a state high school championship; its stars, three brothers, went on to anchor a group that beat the Harlem Globetrotters.\u201cIndian ball,\u201d as it became known, was characterized by full-court-press defense and high-scoring, improvisational fast breaks. The game is predicated on speed and cooperation. \u201cIt\u2019s not very individualized,\u201d says Don Wetzel Jr., a Blackfeet Nation descendant who manages the Montana Indian Athletic Hall of Fame. \u201cYou\u2019re not taught to be like that. To make your people happy is one of the greatest things you can ever do.\u201d High school stars from the past remain celebrated today: Names like Jonathan Takes Enemy, Sharon LaForge, Elvis Old Bull, Malia Kipp and Mike Chavez remind people of on-court triumphs and, in many cases, off-court trials.Montana\u2019s best-known reservation teams have come from the plains east of the Rocky Mountains: from Lodge Grass, on Crow Nation, and from Browning and Heart Butte, on Blackfeet Nation. But for the past decade, the basketball program in Arlee, which is in the foothills of the Mission Range, has touched the hem of this elite. In 2005, a group of parents, including John and Becky Malatare, started a youth basketball clinic. Between 2009 and 2013, Arlee\u2019s boys went 88-34; the girls went 105-39 between 2011 and 2016. During that time, both teams secured divisional titles but fell short at the state level. Zanen Pitts, a 32-year-old rancher and Pend d\u2019Oreille first descendant, took over as the boys\u2019 coach in 2013. He installed a system that combined the freewheeling speed of Indian ball with defensive strategies borrowed from college programs. \u201cThere is a structure to our chaos,\u201d Pitts says.In 2014, Phil Malatare entered high school. He had dedicated most of his young life to two pursuits: horn hunting \u2014 searching for the freshly shed antlers of bull elk \u2014 and playing basketball at the community center. His arrival turned the Warriors\u2019 defense into something terrifying. During his freshman year, the team lost in the state semifinals; during his sophomore year, they reached the championship; last year, they went 25-1, and Phil played nearly every minute of the championship run. Just before the end of the game, someone in the crowd called him a redskin. Then, in the final seconds, he jumped for a rebound that clinched the victory. In his bedroom, he hung news clippings of his victories and defeats, for motivation, along with the cleaned skull of a buffalo he killed.John Malatare, a Salish and Cree wildland firefighter, wanted Phil to cash in his ticket to leave the reservation while it was still good. \u201cA lot of these colleges in Montana,\u201d John says, \u201cwill give a Native kid one chance.\u201d On reservations, basketball stars become symbols of hope, but many have struggled to replicate their high school success in college. Wetzel played at Montana State University at Billings, but he left the team after having a child in his sophomore year. He went on to a career in public education. Not everyone has been so fortunate. In 1991, Sports Illustrated\u2019s Gary Smith wrote about the Crow stars Takes Enemy and Old Bull, who both struggled with alcohol. Others have gone to college, only to leave after feeling homesick.Pitts says that in five years as head coach, he has had three college coaches ask if prospects are Native, openly worrying that they might not last in school. Women from Montana\u2019s reservations have carried a similar weight. In 1992, Malia Kipp, from Blackfeet Nation, entered the University of Montana, starring with the Lady Grizzlies for all four years. \u201cI felt if I didn\u2019t succeed,\u201d she once said, \u201cothers wouldn\u2019t get the opportunity.\u201dAccording to Pitts and Wetzel, the skepticism Native recruits face is owed to cultural misunderstanding, and the inadequate support systems in place as a result. \u201cThose coaches need to do a better job of sustaining \u2019em,\u201d Pitts says. \u201cThey need to understand what they\u2019re coaching.\u201d That meant recognizing the gravitational pull of home for players from reservations, but also the genuinely distinct sports culture incubated there. Kids who grow up playing Indian ball on the reservation, whether or not they are themselves Native \u2014 the Arlee Warriors are Salish, Navajo, Sioux, Pend d\u2019Oreille and Blackfeet, but also white, black and Filipino \u2014 can find the college game as alienating as campus life. For Wetzel, the businesslike nature and slower pace of college ball was challenging. \u201cIt\u2019s conformity,\u201d he says. Wetzel thinks schools should recruit multiple reservation players at once, the way the Lady Grizzlies did a decade ago, following Kipp\u2019s success. \u201cI rarely see two Natives on the court at the same time at a college level,\u201d Wetzel says. \u201cIt does bring some magic.\u201dPitts, for his part, just wanted his players to get the opportunities they deserved. That meant a lot was riding on Phil. A good student with a supportive family, he was covered by local newspapers with headlines like unstoppable. Pitts thought he had been touched by God. Sometimes he found himself pleading with him to thrive in college. \u201cYou\u2019re doing this for every kid in the world,\u201d he says, \u201cthat\u2019s ever looked up to a basketball player coming off the rez.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re here for a purpose,\u201d Pitts said. \u201cThat purpose is to win a state championship. I\u2019m going to chew on you, I\u2019m going to break you down, I\u2019m going to build you back up.\u201d He said he was going to change their lives. \u201cThis is so much bigger than you.\u201d He outlined the rules. Guys who disrespected teachers would not play. Guys whose parents complained about court time would not play. Latecomers would not play. Exceptions would be made only in extreme circumstances: \u201cIf you want to go hunting, you\u2019ve got some huge buck figured out, call me.\u201dPitts cued up a highlight reel from last year\u2019s championship season and left the room. Will Mesteth often watched the tape at night; it made him feel all warm inside. But it just made Phil sad, because his two best friends had graduated, and he wanted another championship. He also wanted, desperately, to make it as a Division 1 college player.When the tape finished, Phil walked to the front of the room in a camouflage hoodie and a backward hat. \u201cEverybody\u2019s going to be intimidated,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we got to make them intimidated. And that is going to be how it\u2019s going to be.\u201dThe first game of the season was on Dec. 8, against a larger school from the Rocky Boy\u2019s Reservation. A couple of thousand fans filled the gym at a tribal college 40 miles north of Arlee. Will\u2019s hair was shining in a double braid courtesy of his mother. Phil was wired even though he had spent the morning deer hunting.\u201cWe\u2019re not nervous,\u201d Pitts said.\u201cI\u2019m nervous,\u201d Phil said. His teammates appeared relieved.On the mirror behind Pitts was a flier for a suicide-prevention hotline; all but three of the tags on the bottom had been ripped off. He opened a box, revealing sleek, hooded warm-up shirts. The boys\u2019 nerves melted away in a chorus of hollering. Pitts choreographed the team\u2019s entrance, instructing the boys to fan out onto the floor once Will\u2019s grandfather, father and uncles hit the drum and started the honor song. \u201cI want everyone to know,\u201d he said: \u201cThe champs are here.\u201d The boys fell silent, and Pitts prayed:Our Father in HeavenWe bow our heads humbly before youFor the great opportunity that we have to play this game.To separate ourselves from the world.We ask, Father,That thou will bless us with strength and wisdomAnd give us the ability to be safe.Bless our opponentsThat they also can come out and perform at their highest potential.That they can be safe as well.And most of all,Let the refs keep up.The cause of his concern was a proliferation of suicides that had swept the Flathead reservation in recent months. It started in the fall of 2016, with a few teenagers. Then in the winter, just before the 2017 divisionals, the Malatares awoke to discover that a close friend had taken her own life \u2014 a woman Phil considered to be \u201clike an auntie,\u201d and an aunt of Will\u2019s by blood.Pitts and John Malatare told the boys that when people came to see the Warriors play, they briefly escaped their worries. But the suicides continued; they had become what public-health professionals call a cluster. In April, a former Warrior who quit the team shot himself after attending the funeral of a friend who committed suicide. The former teammate survived, but Pitts was haunted. \u201cThe adversary is so strong,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just there.\u201dBetween November 2016 and November 2017, there were 20 deaths by suicide on the reservation, according to Anna Whiting Sorrell, an official with the tribal health department. Phil said he had known \u201ca few\u201d people who had died by suicide. Asked to clarify, he said, \u201cTwenty or thirty.\u201dIn 2016, the Centers for Disease Control released a study examining suicide rates among Americans by race and ethnicity. In 2014, the last year for which the researchers compiled data, non-Hispanic Native women between the ages of 15 and 24 committed suicide at a rate of 15.6 deaths per 100,000, or three times the rate of non-Hispanic white women and five times the rate of non-Hispanic black women of the same age. Young Native men had a rate of 38.2 deaths per 100,000 people. Among young people, the suicides often come in clusters, as happened in 2013 and 2014, on Arizona\u2019s Gila River Indian Reservation; in 2015, on South Dakota\u2019s Pine Ridge Indian Reservation; and last year, on the Flathead reservation. Some there, like Pitts, blamed technology, social media and bullying. Others looked to the boarding schools that removed a generation of children and created a cycle of abuse. Whiting Sorrell had come to think of suicide \u2014 along with alcoholism and drug abuse \u2014 as a symptom of intergenerational trauma, the inherited grief among indigenous communities resulting from colonization. Whitesell said that the community\u2019s kids needed to learn to \u201csurvive their past and their present.\u201dPart of that, he thought, was getting kids to talk openly about mental health. Upon taking the superintendent job in 2015, Whitesell sent the school staff to prevention training and had them take what\u2019s called an adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) quiz, a 10-question test to assess trauma. According to ACEs data the C.D.C. collected in 2010 from more than 53,000 people in 10 states and the District of Columbia, 40.7 percent of participants reported no adverse childhood experiences, while 14.3 percent reported four or more, scores that were linked to increased health and behavioral risks. \u201cI scored a seven,\u201d Whitesell says. Many kids in Arlee, he says, would most likely register right around there. That trauma can manifest in many ways. Suicide, Whitesell says, was \u201can option. It can\u2019t be an option.\u201dIn the fall, Whitesell\u2019s son Greg, the Warriors\u2019 co-captain, got a concussion playing football, his fifth, and had to stay home from school for three weeks. He struggled to eat and felt depressed. That confused him, because he was a star and a state champion. He almost felt as if he had no right to be sad, and that just made it worse. Greg didn\u2019t hunt like Phil and Will; off the court, he loved video games and hanging out with his friends. Now Greg started to isolate himself and to sleep a lot. \u201cI was tired of being depressed,\u201d he says. \u201cYou just get tired of everything.\u201dOne night he sent a despairing text to a couple of friends. He was considering climbing out his window to start running when he saw headlights in the driveway. It was two teammates, Lane Schall, a gregarious ranch kid, and Darshan Bolen, Phil\u2019s cousin and foster brother. Greg told them he didn\u2019t want to live anymore.Dar sat with him while Lane went to get Greg\u2019s mother, Raelena. She spoke with her son for about 45 minutes, then took Greg to a hospital in Missoula, where Whitesell met them. (He and Raelena are divorced.) Greg spent that night in a bare room with scratches on the wall. \u201cI felt like I didn\u2019t belong there,\u201d he says.The hospital staff determined he wasn\u2019t an immediate risk and sent him home. For weeks Raelena woke up every couple of hours to check on her son, and Greg regularly saw a counselor. Then basketball season started. He kept his experience private until he learned that a younger teammate was battling depression, at which point he told the kid he had been through similar struggles. Lane and Dar never talked publicly about that night. But, Greg said later, \u201cif they didn\u2019t show up, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be here now.\u201dBut Phil had other ideas. Sometimes he envisioned going to a powerhouse program like Oregon, but the idea of leaving Arlee caused an almost physical discomfort. He had been approached by a Division 1 school in Washington, and a small California school had offered him a full scholarship, but he brushed them off. The path to reconciling his athletic ambitions with his desire to stay close to home ran through Missoula: the college town just 24 miles south of Arlee, home of the Division 1 University of Montana Grizzlies. But the Griz had offered Phil only an invitation to walk on, meaning he\u2019d have to try out and pay his own way.Tech, on the other hand, was offering a full scholarship. Phil was the team\u2019s No. 1 recruit. Becky liked the idea. But Phil said he needed more time, and sure enough, soon a coach from the Griz reached out again. \u201cThey\u2019re dangling that carrot,\u201d Becky said.By Jan. 9, the Warriors were 8-0 and had outscored their opponents by an average of more than 40 points per game. That evening they played Mission, a larger high school in St. Ignatius and a rival, just up Highway 93 from Arlee. In the stands, Becky sat next to Hiatt. \u201cHe\u2019s the best player in the state,\u201d the coach said of Phil. John Malatare sat a couple of rows away, calling out traps.Sitting with Hiatt, Becky digressed, as is her habit, talking about her son\u2019s dietary preferences \u2014 \u201cPhil doesn\u2019t eat salad; he eats chicken\u201d \u2014 and how he and John would leave in the middle of the night to hunt buffalo.\u201cThat\u2019s crazy,\u201d Hiatt said.But mostly Becky discussed Will Mesteth and how much Phil loved playing with him. \u201cThey grew up together,\u201d she said. A few minutes later, Will carved his way to the basket. \u201cWill, No. 3,\u201d Becky said suggestively. \u201cThere he goes.\u201d And then, a few minutes later: \u201cNo. 3, his grandma is a Malatare. So they\u2019re related.\u201d But Will\u2019s shot was off. In the stands, his dad, Big Will, yelled, \u201cGet him the ball!\u201dJohn and T.J. had heard that buffalo were moving out of Yellowstone National Park, so they had loaded up T.J.\u2019s trailer with snowmobiles and rolled south at 2 a.m. In the 1870s, the Salish moved a few calves into the Flathead reservation, building up a herd that was later used to revive the flagging Yellowstone population. Now the Salish are one of six tribes with treaty rights allowing them to hunt Yellowstone\u2019s bison when they move out of the park.On the ride down, the men rubbed their hands and whistled in anticipation. Sometimes the hunters just stood in line waiting for the bison to cross onto Forest Service land, and sometimes animal rights protesters tailed them. Even so, John would rather hunt buffalo than anything else. \u201cThe first time I shot one of these, it was a whole different feeling,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just the respect.\u201d He and T.J. talked about their disdain for trophy hunters who sell the hides. \u201cPhillip, he sleeps on his,\u201d John said. \u201cGot to keep the fan on just \u2019cause he stays so warm!\u201dHe considered his son\u2019s college prospects. He wanted Phil to get back to the Montana Tech coach. He knew Phil wanted to play for the Griz, but he didn\u2019t know what to do. Should he go knock down the coach\u2019s door and ask what it would take? He thought of a friend who had played college ball. The coach had given him a hard time. \u201cI said, \u2018They\u2019re testing you out,\u2019\u2009\u201d John recalled. \u201c\u2009\u2018They\u2019re seeing how tough your willpower really is.\u2019\u2009\u201d But his friend quit. John said, \u201cProven point right there.\u201d Native kids got one shot.A track star in high school, John always wished he had pursued athletics more seriously; Terry Pitts, Zanen\u2019s father, a retired coach and former tribal councilman, thought he could have been an Olympian. John met Becky, who was a descendant of European settlers and played basketball against his sisters, at age 22. Becky went on to work for a Missoula hospital, handling accounts, while John was hired by the Forest Service, digging breaks around wildfires. When he started out, \u201cWe heard a lot of, \u2018What are you Indians doing here?\u2019\u2009\u201d he recalled. \u201cI had to work extra hard to prove that I could do the job.\u201d John became a supervisor, earning a good living, and when Phil was in sixth grade, four of his cousins, including Dar, came to live with the Malatares and their three children. After that the Malatares kept getting calls from the tribe, asking them to foster more kids. They came and came, sometimes for days at a time, sometimes more. Mounds of laundry piled up in the kitchen.When Phil was 6, he told his parents he was going to be a professional athlete. By the time he was a freshman, he said he wanted to be the best basketball player Montana had ever seen. John realized he hadn\u2019t considered his own life once his son\u2019s career ended. \u201cWhat are we going to do if he doesn\u2019t continue and play through college?\u201d he asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve thought that far.\u201dDawn revealed a blue, snowed-in landscape. T.J. and John parked at a pull-off, stepped out of the truck and fired up their snowmobiles. A wolf ran past. The men hopped on the sleds and tore off into the lodgepole. They wound up a long curving track to an overlook from which they could see wide plains and craggy peaks, but no buffalo. They descended into low timber and split up. T.J. wound his way a bit farther, then stopped. A herd of bison moved slowly through the trees, followed by hunters on foot and, behind them, a group of animal rights campaigners documenting the kills. Shots rang out, and the herd split up, some moving toward private property, some back toward the park boundary.An hour or so later, John and T.J. met back at the truck. John hadn\u2019t caught the herd. \u201cEveryone without sleds killed \u2019em,\u201d John said.\u201cThem protesters must have pushed \u2019em all onto that private property,\u201d T.J. said.Over dinner that night at a sports bar, they joined a group of Salish hunters, who talked basketball and hunting and foster-parenting. At one point, one of the men tried to imagine life with endless buffalo. \u201cUsed to be a perfect world,\u201d he said.\u201cSure ain\u2019t now,\u201d T.J. said.On the way home the next day, John considered the state championship in Butte, six weeks away. With seven games remaining in the regular season, the Warriors were undefeated. John had already booked his hotel room. \u201cStars are going to have to start falling out of the skies,\u201d he said, \u201cfor us not to be there.\u201dAfter the call, John sat down in his leather recliner and exhaled. Becky was still partial to Tech \u2014 the school had great academics, and the free ride wouldn\u2019t hurt, given that the Malatares still had two more kids to put through high school and college. But Phil had made up his mind. He called Adam Hiatt to relay his decision, but he asked his parents not to share the news widely. He didn\u2019t want to disrupt the Warriors\u2019 playoff run.The season came down to three weekends in late February and early March: the district championship, the divisional championship and state. By this point, Will had rediscovered his shot, and the Warriors played with devastating joy. In the last regular-season game, Phil and Will combined to score 72 points.Pitts called a coach from a Montana college, gushing that Will had a 35-foot shooting range, defense that can\u2019t be taught, strong grades. The coach wanted to know about Will\u2019s family. Pitts said that Will\u2019s father was a cop and that if the coach gave him a chance, his mother would \u201chave him there tomorrow.\u201d Assuming his most authoritative sales voice, Pitts declared that Will would make it: \u201cI\u2019d stick my job on the line for him.\u201d The coach said he\u2019d think about it. Pitts hung up and shook his head.On Tuesday, Feb. 20, just before divisionals, word spread of a suicide: a teenage basketball player from Two Eagle River, a competing team on the Flathead reservation. Pitts was worried. \u201cThe next week or two, another kid might do it,\u201d he said.The divisional tournament was held in Hamilton, in the Bitterroot Valley, the ancestral homeland of the Salish. On the bus ride down before the first game, Pitts asked the players if they wanted to make a statement about the suicide. The boys thought it was a good idea and settled on a video as the way to do it. They decided that Phil would speak first and Will last, but when the camera rolled, Phil got nervous. One player didn\u2019t: Greg. His voice was calm and resolute. \u201cI was focused on helping these people,\u201d he later said. \u201cIt felt awesome.\u201dWill and Phil had carried two pillowcases into the locker room. In them were a pair of war bonnets adorned with golden-eagle feathers, which Will\u2019s grandfather, who worked at the Salish language school, had made by hand. When the boys put on the bonnets, their teammates stared. Then Will\u2019s grandfather hit the drum and started the honor song, and the cousins sprinted onto the floor.The Arlee crowd stood, everyone scrambling for their smartphones to capture the moment. Phil\u2019s grandparents, Bear and Irma, weren\u2019t sure about the bonnets; if a feather fell out, they might have had to do a ceremony on the court. But it was different for John. He hadn\u2019t always felt that his son had fully embraced Salish culture. Now, seeing Phil in the war bonnet, shaking the opposing coach\u2019s hand, he thought his heart might burst through his rib cage.A couple of minutes into the game, Phil sprinted into the locker room, where he threw up. Then he checked back in, and the team ran an isolation play pitting Phil against Manhattan Christian\u2019s best player, Caleb Bellach, a 6-foot-5 junior and the coach\u2019s son. Phil dribbled between his legs three times as he approached Bellach, then feinted a hard crossover to the left but brought the ball back to the right and was gone. Another defender came to meet Phil, but he spun and jumped to his left, rising toward the rim with two hands, then pulled the ball down and scooped it to the right. His body moved one way but the ball went the other. The defender followed his body, and Phil softly laid the ball in.At halftime, Arlee was up 39-30, and Phil threw up again. So did Will. In the third quarter, Manhattan closed the gap. Then, in the span of a minute, Will hit a three-pointer, made a layup, stole the ball and threw an around-the-back pass to Greg for two points, at which point the crowd detonated. Arlee won, 69-60. The announcer, a white man, marveled at the noise. \u201cYou think this many people lived in Arlee?\u201d he chuckled, out of range of the microphone. \u201cNobody\u2019s guarding the stores tonight.\u201dThe next day, the Warriors released their suicide-prevention video on Facebook. As the team warmed up before the divisional finals, Anna Whiting Sorrell, who helped oversee the tribe\u2019s response to the 2017 suicide cluster, was sitting in the stands. She considered the video in the context of the teenagers who, after the Parkland shooting, advocated gun control. \u201cMaybe,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s kids saying: enough.\u201d She continued: \u201cMaybe these kids can. I want them to just be happy and enjoy their lives. They chose to engage. They\u2019ve all been there. They say enough.\u201dThe team hoped a few thousand people might view their video. But within 24 hours, it had been watched nearly 86,000 times. On Monday, the team, inspired by the reception, skipped practice to make another, this one an elaborate production with alley-oops and war bonnets. As they were finishing, a coach from Two Eagle River arrived in a black suit. He had come from the wake for the boy \u2014 his player \u2014 who committed suicide the week before divisionals. \u201cI just wanted to say thank you, guys,\u201d he said in halting breaths. His chest heaved, and he told the Warriors to bring home the trophy.A long silence followed. Then someone asked: \u201cCan we hug him?\u201dPhil embraced the man, and everyone else followed.In the third quarter, Pitts unveiled a brutal press. The team\u2019s defense was designed to tire the opponent out until, all at once and in a great rush, the boys unleashed. With less than three minutes remaining in the quarter and Arlee losing by four, Pitts hopped up and down on the sideline and screamed. In a moment, the boys were everywhere. The next 60 seconds passed in a blur of steals and turnovers. Greg and Will each hit a long three-pointer, the second giving Arlee its first lead. Then, as Scobey brought the ball up, Greg and Phil smacked the floor. Phil took off in a straight line for the ballhandler, who looked terrified; he ripped the ball away and flew off for a layup. He sprinted back down the court, beckoning to the crowd. The cheers sounded like the inside of a breaking wave.In just over two minutes, Arlee had scored 14 unanswered points. After the game, Pitts teared up, thanking the boys. Then the Warriors watched Manhattan Christian win, setting up one last rematch. A couple of hours earlier, in a hallway of the Butte Civic Center, the father of one of Manhattan Christian\u2019s players said he just wanted everyone to have fun. \u201cIt\u2019s not life,\u201d he said.The following morning, Becky and John Malatare staked out their seats for the final by 11 a.m., nine hours before tipoff. By game time, Senator Steve Daines, whose son previously attended Manhattan Christian, was in the crowd. Shortly before tipoff, Chasity did Will\u2019s hair by center court. Phil got an IV of fluids, his third of the week. Then he joined his teammates in a practice gym, where Pitts told the boys to enjoy the moment and prayed to God and the Creator. Then Phil spoke.\u201cIt was a pretty short year, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d he said to his teammates in a dry, cracking voice. He turned to Lane Johnson, who would be guarding Bellach: \u201cHound that guy!\u201d Then he turned to Isaac. \u201cDunk it. Rip that rim off! Will, Greg, freaking rip that net off!\u201d He told them, \u201cDon\u2019t get down if we go down by two points. We\u2019ve been down. All right, boys? Come out, battle for me. Battle for Will. Battle for each other. Let\u2019s make that crowd happy.\u201dNow the long, slow cadence of Phil\u2019s voice changed. It got small and rushed, and he started to cry. Normally the team ended these huddles by chanting \u201cbrothers\u201d and \u201cfamily.\u201d Now, though, Phil said, \u201c\u2009\u2018Love you\u2019 on three.\u201d He counted \u2014 one, two, three \u2014 and his team chanted: \u201cLove you.\u201d Then Big Will and Will\u2019s grandfather and uncles hit the drum, and Phil and Will sprinted onto the floor in war bonnets, Greg trailing them in a Navajo headband. On the east side of the Civic Center, the town of Arlee rose as one.Manhattan Christian won the opening tipoff, and Bellach hit a three-pointer. Then Phil threw a no-look pass off Isaac\u2019s hands, Will missed a three and the game turned ugly. Phil missed his first five shots; Will made only one of four. At the end of the first quarter, Bellach blocked Phil\u2019s shot, and the game was tied at 10.In the second quarter, Will missed two more three-pointers, and Manhattan\u2019s boys began to nod their heads. With a few seconds remaining in the first half, Phil dropped the ball to Will about 10 feet behind the three-point line. Will eyeballed the waning clock and fired a wild shot toward the rafters. The ball ripped through the net, the buzzer sounded and Will pumped his fists and screamed. He made two more three-pointers in the third quarter, and the score was 40-36 Arlee going into the fourth. Then Phil took over.He rebounded a missed three-pointer and bullied in for a layup. While nearly lying on the floor, he tossed the ball to Isaac for a basket. When Manhattan closed to within two, Phil drove, scored and was fouled. With a four-point Arlee lead and less than one minute left, Phil whipped the ball to Isaac for another layup. But in the season\u2019s final moments, it was Will who stood at the free-throw line, preparing for two shots to seal the state championship. In the stands, Jennifer Jilot whispered to Will: \u201cJust breathe.\u201d Twice the ball rolled through the net, and Jilot wept.On Sunday, the Warriors returned to Arlee led by a fire-truck and tribal police escort. Afterward, the team gathered on the bus to listen to an elder. She said that the kids would crash, and that a time would come when they would feel alone. She asked them to forgive themselves. \u201cIt\u2019s temporary,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like the breeze. It will be gone.\u201dBecky Malatare received a gracious message from Manhattan Christian\u2019s coach, Jeff Bellach, thanking her for the opportunity to compete against Phil. On Wednesday, Will went to the hospital, where he discovered he had been playing with walking pneumonia and an enormous kidney stone. He elected to delay its removal until after three all-star tournaments. College recruiters had reached out to him following the championship, and he needed one more push to get into school.That night, Big Will went on a difficult call. He arrested one of the players from the previous year\u2019s championship, a freshman at the University of Montana. The police said the boy had been present at a shooting, and he would later be charged for accountability to attempted deliberate homicide. Big Will apologized to the boy\u2019s parents before driving him to Missoula.One afternoon that week, Phil got his spotting scope and drove his red Chevy toward one of his horn-hunting spots, a ridge from which gullies descended to a river. He pulled over and fastened his scope to the open passenger window. The snow was still deep up top. He scoped until he found a herd of about 100 elk. \u201cCan\u2019t hide forever!\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll walk all this even if it don\u2019t melt. If I know they\u2019re dropping, I\u2019ll go in there.\u201d But the herd was mostly dark: cows. He was looking for the big, tawny bulls.As he scanned the hills, Phil thought about this summer. He figured it would be his last as a kid. He planned to be starting for the Griz by the time he was a sophomore. He wondered about the temptations of college. \u201cAfter a big win, am I going to want to go be dumb?\u201d he asked, as if it were a question he couldn\u2019t possibly answer.He thought about his father and T.J., who could walk these hills for a full day without eating. Phil couldn\u2019t do that. He discoursed on the supremacy of brown antlers \u2014 which are fresh with blood \u2014 to white ones. \u201cWhite\u2019s old, brown\u2019s new,\u201d he said. \u201cPut it this way: You rather have a Lamborghini or a Subaru?\u201dA Subaru, I said.\u201cBut if you lived in California?\u201dPhil didn\u2019t want to live in California. \u201cEveryone\u2019s like \u2018Oh, you need to get out of here,\u2019\u2009\u201d he said. \u201cWhich I believe. But if you love where you live, why not live there? No use movin\u2019.\u201dOnce I asked him about the pressure of making it with the Griz. He said that he was \u201call in,\u201d but that if it didn\u2019t work out, that would be O.K. \u201cIt\u2019s my life,\u201d he said. What did that mean, anyway, to make it? Was it a jersey entombed in glass? Phil couldn\u2019t take that with him when he died. He was going to play ball as long as he could, but when it ended, he wanted to be a game warden, like T.J.\u2019s father, Tom Haynes, so he could work in the mountains.As chance would have it, Tom drove by just then. Maybe he was out busting someone for illegal firewood cutting. Phil went back to scoping; he had found three bulls bedded down in the snow. He was hoping one would drop its antlers right there. \u201cThat\u2019s my dream,\u201d he said \u2014 to see one shed through the lens of his scope. It had never happened. \u201cCome on, guy,\u201d he said to the elk. \u201cLose your horns.\u201d His right eye affixed to the scope, the boy in constant motion was absolutely still. Only his left eyelid fluttered. \u201cI wish I could sit here all day,\u201d he said. He stared into the wilderness, wondering what would happen.Bear had been reading a history of the Cree. He normally didn\u2019t dwell on the past. He never told Phil about his time at the boarding school, when teachers beat him for speaking his language. \u201cWe can\u2019t constantly sit and cry about what they done to us,\u201d he once said. But the book made him think about his grandparents\u2019 migration from Canada, and his own father, for whom Phil was named, and his time with the nuns; the constant efforts at assimilation and extermination.\u201cWe\u2019re not supposed to be here,\u201d he said, his face turning momentarily dark, his immense hands clenching. Then his hands released, and a great smile worked its way across his face. \u201cWe\u2019re still here,\u201d he said.He walked inside, where mothers danced around the laughing boys, shoving them playfully down to the court. The world is never so hopeful as when the old honor the young.An earlier version of this article misstated the year that Arlee, a chief of the Salish tribe, agreed to government demands that his tribe relocate. It was 1872, not 1871.Abe Streep is a contributing editor for Outside and a contributing writer for The California Sunday Magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What May Life in Italy Be Like Under the Right? These Immigrants Already Know", "Date": "2018-04-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySESTO SAN GIOVANNI, Italy \u2014 For 70 years, Sesto San Giovanni, on the outskirts of Milan, was a bastion of the left as it drew thousands of migrants from Italy\u2019s poorer south to work in its factories.But much has changed recently. The factories are shut down. The most recent migrants who have arrived are not from Italy\u2019s south, but other nations. And the center-right broke the left\u2019s long-unchallenged governing streak and won municipal elections last June.Today, if there is one place in Italy where the country\u2019s economic and migrant crises collide, it is in Sesto. And if there is one place to take the measure of the right\u2019s creeping anti-immigrant influence in politics and society, Sesto is that place, too.But for nine months now, immigrants in Sesto \u2014 about 19 percent of the city\u2019s 81,000 residents \u2014 have been getting a taste already of life under right-wing rule.The new mayor, Roberto Di Stefano, 40, said he identifies with both Forza Italia \u2014 the party of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi \u2014 and the League.He boasted in an interview that when he took office he expelled 230 undocumented migrants, and he asked the central government to send an army unit to patrol the streets.He took control of the city\u2019s public housing, evicted migrants who paid by the bed from crowded dormitories and gave precedence to Italians. He also blocked the construction of a mosque, approved by the previous administration.\u201cWe\u2019re giving a different signal,\u201d when it comes to coping with the financial crunch faced by mayors throughout Italy, by prioritizing the needs of Italians, Mr. Di Stefano said. Which is why his administration had been contacting the foreign embassies whose citizens were weighing on Sesto\u2019s social services.\u201cWe tell them, sirs, it\u2019s not up to Italy or city hall to look after your citizens in need, so please take care of it,\u201d he said.Asked whether any of the embassies had answered, his reply was curt: \u201cNo.\u201dMr. Di Stefano\u2019s critics say it is the most recent migrants who have been the hardest hit by his cuts to social services, like the closing of two public day-care centers. But more than that, even longtime immigrants in Sesto say that life under his government increasingly bears the message \u2014 sometimes insidious, sometimes obvious \u2014 that they are unwelcome.Ask Andi Nganso, 31, a doctor born in Cameroon, who came to Italy 12 years ago to study economics and medicine. A patient visiting the medical clinic where he was on shift in Cant\u00f9, some 19 miles to the north, refused to be treated by him.\u201cShe told me, \u2018I will never be touched by a black doctor,\u2019 and then she left,\u201d said Dr. Nganso. \u201cThank you. Now I have 15 minutes for a cup of coffee,\u201d he quipped on his Facebook page.\u201cThat small episode inevitably happens if a certain way of speaking, if some expressions, are legitimized,\u201d Dr. Nganso said in an interview. \u201cRacism is something that is stoked.\u201dMr. Di Stefano said that a few weeks ago, he had met with Dr. Nganso to express his solidarity.While Dr. Nganso appreciated the gesture, he noted that blocking the mosque and cutting social services were not comforting signs. \u201cIt\u2019s useless to say I am not worried,\u201d he said.But Mr. Di Stefano has been especially adamant about blocking construction of a mosque, which he said would be \u201ca ghetto zone\u201d that would attract thousands of Muslims and risked falling outside the reach of Italian law and tradition.\u201cIf it starts with this, tomorrow they will ask for a Muslim soccer team, a Muslim school, a Muslim swimming pool\u201d \u2014 the opposite direction of integration, he said.The setback has not daunted the city\u2019s Muslim community of about 5,000, which has continued to press for their place of worship in a series of courts.Abdullah Tchina, director of the Islamic Center of Milano Sesto, which is in charge of building the mosque, pointed out that many of the Muslims living in Sesto had been there for decades.\u201cThe community is rooted here,\u201d and deserves a dignified place to pray, he said.\u201cWe are an integral part of the city,\u201d added Asmaa Gueddouda, 31, who was born in Italy of Algerian parents. When she turned 18, she got Italian citizenship.\u201cWe are part of the second generation and to continually hear Islam associated with immigration is offensive. It suggests that we\u2019re a foreign body, though we don\u2019t feel like a foreign body,\u201d she said.Fear of Islamic fundamentalism is a populist refrain for the right. During the election campaign, the leader of the League, Matteo Salvini, said he would close any illegal mosques.In reality, in Italy, mosques as stand-alone buildings can be counted on the fingers of two hands, meaning that most Muslims pray in makeshift prayer halls.The Sesto mosque \u2014 when built \u2014 would revitalize an abandoned part of the city, Mr. Tchina said.\u201cEach wall slows down the course of a society or of a community,\u201d he said, noting that shortly after Mr. Di Stefano was elected, the mayor refused permission to the city\u2019s Muslims to celebrate their most revered religious festival, Eid al-Adha, at a local arena, as they had done for a decade.\u201cWhen the delays increase, the community sees that it is being excluded from their rights\u201d and \u201cthat\u2019s when negative thoughts begin,\u201d Mr. Tchina said.The Rev. Leone Stefano Nuzzolese, the most senior of Sesto\u2019s priests, said the city\u2019s primary problems \u2014 economic and social \u2014 actually resulted from the abandoned factories pockmarking the city.\u201cUntil that issue gets resolved, the city remains blocked,\u201d he said. Fueling populist rhetoric by vilifying immigrants was a distraction that \u201ccomes at zero cost,\u201d because most migrants can\u2019t vote, he said.Patrizia Minella, a longtime volunteer in the city who now works with migrant mothers, said Sesto had always been \u201can important melting pot,\u201d initially of Italians come to work at the factories.\u201cYou can count the families that have been here for three generations on one hand,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s an unstoppable, historical phenomenon.\u201dMany recent arrivals said they saw their future here.\u201cI like living here, living with Italians,\u201d said Ibtissem Mabrouk, who moved to Italy from Tunisia nine years ago, and now works as a translator and interpreter, mostly for Arab women.She feels assimilated in Sesto, she said, and wants to raise her two sons here. \u201cI am Arab,\u201d she said. \u201cI am proud of it, but I like the way that Italians educate their children.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Released Its Content Moderation Rules. Now What?", "Date": "2018-04-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMs. Klonick is a lawyer and a fellow at Yale Law School\u2019s Information Society Project.NEW HAVEN \u2014 Tuesday was a huge day for online speech. Facebook finally released the internal rules that its moderators use to decide what kinds of user content to remove from the site, including once-mysterious details on what counts as \u201cgraphic violence,\u201d \u201chate speech\u201d or \u201cchild exploitation.\u201d It also announced the introduction of an appeals process for users who want to challenge the removal of their posts.These developments represent a big step toward due process, which is essential on a site where so much of our speech now takes place. But an entity with such enormous power over online expression should do even more to listen to its users about what kinds of expression are allowed, and its users should be ready to be heard. Ideally, Facebook will eventually create a more robust system to respond to those who believe their posts were taken down in error, and to give its users the opportunity to weigh in on its policies.First, no notice (of the kind that has appeared in the past when, say, Facebook has made changes to privacy policy) appeared in users\u2019 feeds to inform them that the community standards had been updated. Instead, users had to rely on news reports that the rules were finally being shared.Second, while an appeals system for the removal of individual posts is a promising first step, the one that Facebook started this week has a lot of growing to do before it can really create real procedural fairness. While users can ask Facebook to take a second look at content removed for nudity, hate speech or violence, there is no indication that these requests will be handled by more experienced moderators.Instead, it seems possible that they will simply be put through the system again, making the process more of a retrial than an appeal. It doesn\u2019t appear that there will be an opportunity for users to provide new information that could explain why the removal of a post was a mistake.The most serious shortcoming highlighted by this week\u2019s announcement was that Facebook still doesn\u2019t have a meaningful vehicle for users to directly comment on the policies that are governing their online speech, and the speech they see on the platform. As a result, Facebook is still not truly accountable to all of its users.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Zuckerberg Gets a Crash Course in Charm. Will Congress Care?", "Date": "2018-04-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor Facebook, Tuesday is being seen as a kind of dreaded final exam.In preparation for Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony, his first such appearance, Facebook has spent the last couple of weeks trying to transform its public image from a defiant, secretive behemoth into a contrite paragon of openness, announcing a string of new privacy and anti-abuse measures and making company executives available for numerous interviews.It has also hired a team of experts, including a former special assistant to President George W. Bush, to put Mr. Zuckerberg, 33, a cerebral coder who is uncomfortable speaking in public, through a crash course in humility and charm. The plan is that when he sits down before the Senate Commerce and Judiciary committees on Tuesday, Mr. Zuckerberg will have concrete changes to talk about, and no questions he can\u2019t handle.\u201cFor every major C.E.O., and now for Mark Zuckerberg, this is a rite of passage,\u201d said Reed E. Hundt, a former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. \u201cFacebook has become so important \u2014 not just to business but to society \u2014 it can\u2019t avoid having to run the congressional gantlet.\u201dInternal staff has pushed Mr. Zuckerberg to answer lawmakers\u2019 questions directly, and not to appear overly defensive. Their goal is to make Mr. Zuckerberg appear as humble, agreeable and as forthright as possible, the people close to the preparations said. Reginald J. Brown, a former special assistant to President George W. Bush, is leading the WilmerHale group. A spokesman for Facebook declined to comment.As questions about Facebook\u2019s role in the 2016 election and its privacy issues mounted, Mr. Zuckerberg initially tried to avoid the limelight, dodging requests for public testimony by lawmakers in the United States and Europe. He instead sent lieutenants, including Sheryl K. Sandberg, the company\u2019s chief operating officer, and Colin Stretch, Facebook\u2019s general counsel, to answer tough questions from lawmakers and reporters.Mr. Zuckerberg is set to testify before the Senate Commerce and Judiciary committees on Tuesday and the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday. In these hearings, Democrats are expected to grill Mr. Zuckerberg about the privacy scandals, and how the social network is guarding against possible interference in this fall\u2019s midterm elections. Republicans are expected to be more reticent about privacy regulations, and may use the hearings to raise suspicions of political bias on the social network.The risk for Mr. Zuckerberg is appearing evasive or further angering government officials, which could lead them to attack the company even more aggressively. The company\u2019s stock has fallen about 15 percent in the three weeks since Cambridge Analytica\u2019s misuse of data became public.Facebook\u2019s damage control efforts, which are being overseen by a policy and communications team of more than 500 employees as well as a handful of outside crisis communications firms, are unprecedented in the company\u2019s 14-year history.The 2016 election, and revelations that Russians used the platform to spread misinformation, have proved to be more intractable problems. In the fall, when Mr. Stretch testified before a Senate subcommittee about why Facebook had failed to stop Russian interference, his remarks were not warmly received.The Cambridge Analytica scandal seems to have unlocked even larger worries about the influence of social media, the power of Silicon Valley and the cavalier approach many tech companies have taken toward user privacy. While the vast majority of users and advertisers have not abandoned Facebook, Mr. Zuckerberg has acknowledged that the company\u2019s reputation has taken a hit.\u201cSo far, they\u2019ve failed at every state of this, and at every level of the organization,\u201d said Ari Ratner, a former Barack Obama administration official who now runs Inside Revolution, a strategic communications firm. \u201cThey have the potential to reset with Zuckerberg\u2019s appearance before Congress.\u201dIn addition to mollifying lawmakers and investors, Mr. Zuckerberg needs to impress another important audience during next week\u2019s hearings: Facebook\u2019s rank-and-file employees, who have begun to question the company\u2019s leadership as the latest crisis has spiraled.\u201cMorally, it was extremely difficult to continue working there,\u201d Mr. Lohne wrote.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Black Mothers Respond to Our Cover Story on Maternal Mortality", "Date": "2018-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs soon as I learned I was pregnant back in September, it was like a switch turned on, and I started seeing story after story about the risks associated with childbirth and motherhood for black women. It felt like a cruel trick. I knew for me to remain calm and confident throughout the process, I would need to seek a health care provider who would provide warm, focused and passionate care. That is how I ended up at a birthing center. I saw an OB for screenings, but my primary prenatal care has been provided by a licensed midwife practitioner and her staff. The level of attention and detail is so much more pronounced with her versus with our doctor visits.We are not anti-science, or anti-drugs, or anti-medicine. We also know that receiving care through a birthing center is a privilege all cannot afford. However, in light of what we know, and the care often experienced by black women in formal health care institutions, we feel we have no choice but to go this route.The sad part is, in all of our childbirth-education classes and from what we can tell, of all the patients at the birthing center, we are the only black family. We often feel lonely on this birth path. I am 31 weeks pregnant, and we shall see what the future holds.Crystal Marie McDaniels, Los AngelesI am a black woman, an emergency-department physician, and the director of the Detroit Health Department. I am also the survivor of a life-threatening postpartum complication \u2014 a brain bleed (bilateral subdural hematomas) that was delayed in diagnosis, three weeks after I delivered my first child 11 years ago.I originally had planned a natural labor and enlisted a doula, but after a day and a half of labor, I failed to progress and ended up having a C-section. After the delivery, I had excruciating headaches and told both my OB and my anesthesiologist several times. I felt brushed off and did not know what to do. It was not until I told one of my fellow residents about the pain I was experiencing that I went into my own ER where I worked and received a CT scan that diagnosed my life-threatening brain bleed.I ended up having an urgent surgery on a Sunday afternoon to save my life. This experience has made me a better physician, and it is why I have committed myself to improving the lives of mothers and babies in my work in Detroit.Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, DetroitI\u2019m a black first-time mom and also a Ph.D. student in education at Harvard University. I gave birth in November 2017 to a beautiful baby girl. My pregnancy was tough throughout. I complained about my heart rate and shortness of breath toward the end of my pregnancy, but my health care providers chalked up my condition to regular pregnancy symptoms. My heart rate remained high during and after labor. I felt dismissed throughout my postnatal care, and even after I was sent home, I felt that I could barely breathe or carry my baby.I saw my primary-care physician and my nurse practitioner, who told me that I was fine and that I needed anxiety medication. The next day, I was admitted to the hospital for postpartum pre-eclampsia. An echo of my heart revealed dilation and a reduced ejection fraction. I saw a cardiologist for a few weeks after discharge and thought I was getting better with blood-pressure medication, until I began to experience severe, crushing chest pain and shortness of breath.After weeks of feeling as if I were going to die, I emailed a cardiologist I found through a peri-partum cardiomyopathy Facebook group. If I didn\u2019t have my Harvard email address, I often wonder if he would have emailed me so quickly. But he did. An MRI led to a diagnosis of peri-partum cardiomyopathy \u2014 a type of pregnancy-induced heart failure. I am receiving better care now, but it\u2019s been hard physically and psychologically.Whitney Polk, Salem, Mass.The first six months of my pregnancy were smooth sailing: zero morning sickness, no diabetes and my nursery to-do list had many check marks. My husband of 11 years was supportive and grounded in his duties as a new father to be. But one week after a cherry-blossom-themed baby-shower luncheon, I got the news that my daughter no longer had a heartbeat. Flower-essence treatments, reiki sessions, acupuncture and a birth doula didn\u2019t save the life of Lulu Mika, stillborn at seven months (May 8, 2017). She was 3 pounds. I held her but couldn\u2019t stand to see her face.My OB-GYN of 10 years was super-attentive, but at a loss for the medical language of what cut my daughter\u2019s life short. The autopsy showed nothing. My follow-up postnatal treatments included many talks with her about managing myself and the pros and cons of jumping back into work. I didn\u2019t have the luxury of taking a complete pause while working through a broken heart, nor did I have family members to help me navigate the emotional tunnel ahead.Luckily, I had a circle of friends who held me up in big and small ways, with weeklong getaways, french-fry dates, bouts of absences, phone calls (not text messages), Rancho Gordo beans deliveries, flowers, cards and showing up at my apartment with wine. Mostly, women of color who understood the definition of \u201cpush through it.\u201d In the beginning, I wanted to die, but I tucked that feeling away; I\u2019m lucky the thought faded. This nuclear group understood that being a black career woman doesn\u2019t allow much room to mourn. They knew the unspoken rule of protecting the lineage narrative or never speaking the trauma of the women closest to us. It\u2019s silence that contributes to the demise of black women and our babies. After counseling and many days of reflection, my eyes were open to the multitude of unhealthful societal structures that were riding my back while carrying a child. I realized that the psychological weight of three generations of black women lives in my womb.Nicole A. Taylor, Brooklyn, New YorkI am a mother of two sons. After each of their births, I ended up in the hospital with postpartum eclampsia and HELLP syndrome \u2014 serious complications of high blood pressure. Both times it was a struggle to get doctors to even pay attention to my symptoms. When I first noticed that my blood pressure was elevated, I was told, \u201cYou people usually have higher blood pressure.\u201d The first time, but for the presence of my father who called an OB-GYN friend in California, I would be dead. The second was even more frustrating and surreal, because I was in a different hospital for high-risk pregnancies in the same system, and I still was not listened to until my family threatened litigation. I am an African-American woman with degrees from Princeton and Yale. I still remember every conscious moment of both experiences. The second time, I was even using their language to describe my vascular headache, asking why they were not checking my urine for protein, requesting a magnesium drip because that saved me the first time. You would have thought I was a mute from Mars. It was the most frustrating experience of my life.Deidre Johnson, DenverAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Front of the Cameras, Mark Zuckerberg Avoids Going Viral", "Date": "2018-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookSocial media lives and dies on engagement. You serve your audiences such provocative content \u2014 news, political hot takes, baby pictures \u2014 that they keep their eyes on you as long as possible.When Facebook\u2019s chief, Mark Zuckerberg, showed up in Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday, he seemed to be aiming for disengagement. Facing a grilling over data breaches and Facebook\u2019s role in foreign interference in the 2016 election, he was interested in keeping the provocation, and thus the attention, to a minimum.If the byword of platforms like Facebook is \u201cstickiness,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s prepared, bland affect achieved the opposite. He was so unsticky, the questions slid right off him.He came prepared with stock answers: \u201cSenator, that\u2019s a great question\u201d; \u201cI\u2019ll have my team get back to you.\u201d (That team is going to be busy.) He repeatedly alluded to having begun Facebook in his dorm room at Harvard, framing the company as a bootstrap success story rather than a global supra-state with a population larger than any country\u2019s.And he faced a panel of senators who did not always seem to understand the platform\u2019s functions \u2014 the distinction between selling data and using that data to sell targeted ads, for instance \u2014 or how to phrase questions to press their points.It was a far cry from the film \u201cThe Social Network,\u201d written by Aaron Sorkin, in which an arrogant, fictionalized Mr. Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) had little patience for a lawyer deposing him: \u201cYou have part of my attention. You have the minimum amount.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg was all attentiveness. That\u2019s not the same as openness. He was slippery when it came to the tension between the company\u2019s business model \u2014 which depends on access to granular personal data \u2014 and privacy concerns.But he answered with white-noise-machine calm, like a tech-support representative asking legislators if they\u2019d tried turning their democracy off and turning it back on again.At least one audience was happy with the uneventful session. On some channels on Tuesday, Mr. Zuckerberg was split-screened with a graph of Facebook\u2019s stock price, which rose in inverse proportion to the hearing\u2019s newsworthiness.Denied any explosive Sorkinian moments or news-breaking exchanges, the networks peeled off one by one in mid-hearing: first the broadcast networks, then CNN and MSNBC. (Fox News stuck around longer.)But there were a lot fewer eyes on it. None of the broadcast networks carried Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony. On cable, it was relegated to HLN and CNBC.Mr. Zuckerberg had help from Wednesday\u2019s crowded news cycle. The House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, announced that he would not seek re-election, and President Trump tweeted that he planned to fire missiles at Syria, giving the embattled head of Facebook an indirect assist from his competitor Twitter.But the networks cut away from their coverage anyway, which may have been just fine with Facebook. The hearings didn\u2019t do much to clear up how the mass of us, in the social-media era, can minimize unwanted attention. But they showed that Mr. Zuckerberg has a few hacks to do just that.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "This Start-Up Says It Wants to Fight Poverty. A Food Stamp Giant Is Blocking It.", "Date": "2018-04-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFour years ago, Jimmy Chen left a lucrative perch as a product manager at Facebook to found Propel, what he calls an \u201canti-poverty software company.\u201dThe Propel-Conduent conflict offers a textbook case of a digital newcomer running into resistance from the old order. The twist is that the newcomer said it did not want to destroy the incumbent but instead build atop it to do good for underserved populations, as well as build a business for itself.The animating idea behind Propel, Mr. Chen said, was to \u201capply the Silicon Valley playbook to poverty in some way.\u201d He added that \u201cwe have to build on top of the old world to be successful.\u201dPropel has had no problems with the other major government contractor that manages state food stamp networks, FIS, Mr. Chen said. Nor did Propel have trouble with the Conduent system until recently. Propel has complained to Conduent managers repeatedly, but, Mr. Chen said, \u201cthey\u2019ve never offered us a direct explanation as to why now.\u201dIn written replies to questions, Conduent, which spun out from Xerox in January 2017, portrayed Propel less as an innovator than as a freeloader. Propel\u2019s smartphone app, Conduent said, was introduced \u201cwithout the knowledge, input or consent from Conduent.\u201d It accused Propel of overloading its networks with data requests, causing \u201ca capacity ambush.\u201dConduent took actions to block the app, and described them as prudent \u201csteps to prevent unauthorized access to data \u2014 from Propel or any other unauthorized user.\u201dThe fight over the app is now affecting people like Brianna LaBelle, 25, of Augusta, Me., who has two young sons. She has used Propel\u2019s app to create shopping lists, track food purchases and budget. \u201cI love it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very handy.\u201dBut in February, when Ms. LaBelle tried to check her food stamps balance, she got a message that access to her information was \u201ccurrently unavailable to the residents of Maine.\u201d That interruption, she said, lasted for nearly a month, in which she also lost the timesaving and meal-planning convenience of the app.Propel, Mr. Chen insisted, has tried to explain its business to state governments and to food stamp contractors. The Propel app is a digital \u201cskin\u201d that works on top of the websites of food stamp contractors, like Conduent. A user taps the app, which is known as FreshEBT, to look up the amount left in the account. On average, users check their balances seven times a month.Conduent, in another twist, has begun competing with the start-up. The business services outsourcer, which has $6 billion in yearly revenue, introduced its own smartphone app last year. Conduent\u2019s entry, ConnectEBT, has significantly fewer reviews and lower ratings on the Google and Apple app stores than Propel\u2019s FreshEBT.Conduent\u2019s app is available in Utah, South Carolina and Oklahoma, and offers only basic information on account balances and purchases. But the company said it was beginning a broader rollout this year, and would provide \u201cmore features and functions\u201d as it gets states\u2019 approval as a regulated contractor, unlike Propel.Propel\u2019s predicament is magnified because the food-stamp system\u2019s technology, like many government tech services, is outsourced to a relatively small number of companies.\u201cIt\u2019s an oligopoly game, so there\u2019s often not much choice, competition or innovation,\u201d said Josh Miller, who oversaw the development of digital products in the Obama White House. He added that the volume of data requests from Propel is \u201ctiny\u201d in internet terms.Propel\u2019s early success suggests there is opportunity for innovation in the low-income market, no matter how the start-up\u2019s wrangling with Conduent turns out.Propel is a fledgling company, with only 11 employees, two of them former food-stamp recipients. Mr. Chen, 30, is not one of them. His family emigrated from China when he was 4, and he attended Stanford University on a full scholarship, based on need. Propel has raised $5.2 million from investors like Andreessen Horowitz, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm, and Omidyar Network, which funds start-ups focused on social goals.Paper food stamps are long gone, replaced beginning nearly two decades ago by debit-style cards, called Electronic Benefit Transfer cards. The program is federally funded and administered by the states, which typically rely on private contractors to provide the service.The account look-up feature in FreshEBT has been its way into the low-income market, but was only a first step. Other features that were added over time, including food coupons, job opportunities and recipes for inexpensive meals, have also become popular.So far this year, FreshEBT users have downloaded coupons advertised on the app worth more than $2 million. In the past six months, they have applied for jobs more than 10,000 times from the app, the company said. Propel typically gets referral fees from its coupon, job-listing and other advertiser partners. It does not store or sell users\u2019 personal information, the company said.Keyana Workman, 25, who has two young children and lives in Brooklyn, has been off and on food stamps for the last three years, as jobs and income fluctuate. She calls FreshEBT\u2019s balance look-up \u201ca real improvement\u201d from making 800-number calls.Lately, Ms. Workman has also tapped into the recipes and health and exercise tips. \u201cI\u2019ve been working out a lot,\u201d she said.Propel estimates that 80 percent of its users in the Conduent states have now had problems accessing their information from its app at some point in the past few months.What Propel is doing in the low-income market is broadly similar to what other companies like Mint and Yodlee have done by offering digital services that let people organize and manage their personal finances. The major banks initially opposed allowing those online services to pull account information, but the Dodd-Frank financial reform law in 2010 included a mandate to allow consumers \u2014 and third-party apps on their behalf \u2014 to access their data.\u201cIt should be up to the participants in the program to decide how to organize and use their information,\u201d Ms. Dean said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On His Own, the Burgundy Iconoclast Laurent Ponsot Looks to Big Projects", "Date": "2018-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe PourSo Burgundy fans were shocked when Mr. Ponsot announced in February 2017 that he was leaving the family estate, effective immediately. He offered no explanation other than that it was for personal reasons.Since then, Mr. Ponsot has stayed \u201csilent and hidden,\u201d as he put it in a recent interview in New York, when for the first time since his departure he spoke about his plans. In typical Ponsot fashion, he is going his own way.First, Mr. Ponsot said, he will be making wine, both from grapes he purchases as a n\u00e9gociant and from vineyards that he owns. And he will be working with his son, Cl\u00e9ment.\u201cI was born above a cellar in Morey-St.-Denis and grew up among barrels and vats, working with my father,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I have some blood in my wine, not wine in my blood.\u201dMr. Ponsot, 63, lean and voluble with salt-and-pepper hair that once hung past his shoulders but is now trimmed neatly, said his new label would simply be \u201cLaurent Ponsot,\u201d which he said represented not an estate or a house, but simply an \u201centity.\u201d The name was selected not out of vanity, he said, but as an assumption of responsibility for what is in the bottle.Mr. Ponsot will continue to make some grand crus, though no Clos de la Roche. But he said he will also focus on less exalted, and less expensive appellations.\u201cWhen I left Domaine Ponsot,\u201d he said, \u201cI traveled and asked people in the trade, \u2018I\u2019m starting from zero; what do you want me to produce?\u2019 They said, \u2018Bourgogne rouge et blanc, and then villages.\u2019\u201dThese are the lower levels of the Burgundy hierarchy, in which vineyard areas are ranked on their potential to produce distinctive wines. Regional wines like Bourgogne Rouge or Bourgogne Blanc are made of pinot noir or chardonnay, just like their grander counterparts. But while they may be delicious, they theoretically offer no distinct sense of place beyond a general Burgundy character.Above these are village wines, which may express the personality of places like Meursault, Gevrey-Chambertin or Chambolle-Musigny, all of which Mr. Ponsot will produce. Still more distinctive are premier cru wines, from particular vineyards within villages that have the potential to produce better wines, and, at the top, the grand crus, which receive no village designation because the vineyards themselves are so singular.As Burgundy has gained popularity around the world in recent decades, these grand cru wines, made in minute quantities, have become exorbitantly expensive, leading in part to counterfeiting, as in the Kurniawan case.\u201cYou have people pricing these wines at insane levels,\u201d Mr. Ponsot said. \u201cSeventy percent of grand cru is drunk by people who know nothing about wine. This makes the pricing crazy.\u201d\u201cI want to produce wines that people can open and enjoy,\u201d Mr. Ponsot said. \u201cNot one in two bottles of D.R.C. is ever opened.\u201dIf the current situation makes Mr. Ponsot angry, it is primarily because he passionately loves Burgundy and its defining notion of terroir: that the best wines can express the qualities of where the grapes were grown and the culture of the people who made them. He hates to see a distortion of what it represents.\u201cNo place on earth is like Burgundy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s 70 kilometers long, one kilometer wide, and it has 1,200 appellations. My whole life I have been believing in terroir.\u201dThis faith in terroir, and a desire that people understand it better, has led Mr. Ponsot to his most ambitious, and perhaps most outlandish, idea for the future.He emphasized that Villa Vinum would not be a museum. Rather, he said, it would be focused on the future. The project, he estimated, would cost 20 million euros. He said he hoped to break ground in 2020 or 2021. While he is committed to his vision, he said he also found it a bit daunting.\u201cYou have to be a little na\u00efve, otherwise you do nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cI am scared of this, but it activates my blood.\u201dMr. Ponsot has never taken the easy way. While he knew early on that he wanted to work in the vines, he said he would not have felt challenged had he never left Burgundy. Instead, he said, he hid his early passion for wine and left to see the world.Eventually, he opened a travel agency in Paris, married and had three children. Only in his early 30s did he decide to return to the family domaine. He still will not elaborate on why he left it last year. Domaine Ponsot is now run by his sister Rose-Marie.His aim at Laurent Ponsot, he said, is to make \u201chaute couture\u201d wines.\u201cI want to work on each element, from planting the vine to presentation of the wine on the table,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I don\u2019t grow the grapes, the grapes I buy must be perfect, in my opinion. Every detail is important.\u201dIn his winemaking, as in his new visitor center, Mr. Ponsot combines a reverence for history with an appreciation of what technology can offer. He farms without chemicals, but refuses to adhere to any sort of agricultural ideology, which he describes as restrictive. He avoids sulfur dioxide, but protects the wine in vats with layers of neutral gas.Stung by fraud, he says his bottles will be equipped with microchips to assure their provenance. And cases will carry temperature sensors so that customers can be sure they have not been mishandled in transportation.Mr. Ponsot has always avoided the use of new oak barrels because he dislikes the oaky flavor that they can impart, but he has continued to use older barrels because they permit the slow oxygenation of the wine as it rests in the winery. Now, he said, he has begun an experiment testing an alternative to barrel aging that will also permit this slow exposure to oxygen.\u201cIt took me 20 years to get the perfect cork,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I hope it will take less time in this new study.\u201dThe aim, he said, is wine that does not show off, and that is alive and has the ability to communicate. \u201cI don\u2019t want to please critics. I want to please myself,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I open a bottle, I want to have an emotion. If I don\u2019t have the emotion I won\u2019t put it on the market.\u201dUltimately, he hopes, he will be able to produce from 500 to 600 barrels of wine a year, which is about four times the production of Domaine Ponsot.\u201cI am an optimistic guy,\u201d he said. \u201cI will end my life with goals, work and faith.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The President Is Not Above The Law", "Date": "2018-04-15", "News": "\u201cThis great nation can tolerate a president who makes mistakes,\u201d declared Senator Orrin Hatch, the Utah Republican. \u201cBut it cannot tolerate one who makes a mistake and then breaks the law to cover it up.\u201dAt that time, the American system \u2014 and the flawed yet sometimes heroic people their fellow Americans choose to lead them \u2014 underwent, and passed, a hard test: The president, his financial dealings and his personal relationships were painstakingly investigated for years. Prosecutors ultimately accused Mr. Clinton of lying under oath, to cover up a sexual affair. The House of Representatives impeached him, but the Senate declined to convict, and Mr. Clinton stayed in office.The public, which learned in detail about everything investigators believed Mr. Clinton had done wrong, overwhelmingly agreed with the judgment of the Senate. It was a sad and sordid and at times distracting business, but the system worked.Now Mr. Hatch and his fellow lawmakers may be approaching a harsher and more consequential test. We quote his words not to level some sort of accusation of hypocrisy, but to remind us all of what is at stake.Make no mistake: If Mr. Trump takes such drastic action, he will be striking at the foundation of the American government, attempting to set a precedent that a president, alone among American citizens, is above the law. What can seem now like a political sideshow will instantly become a constitutional crisis, and history will come calling for Mr. Hatch and his colleagues.For months, investigators have been examining whether Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign conspired with the Russian government to undermine American democracy, and whether the president misused his power by obstructing justice in an effort to end that investigation.Until the last few weeks, Mr. Trump had shown restraint, by his standards, anyway. He and his lawyers cooperated with investigators. Mr. Trump never tweeted directly about Robert Mueller, the special counsel, and spoke about him publicly only when asked.Alas, that whiff of higher executive function is gone. Mr. Trump is openly attacking both Mr. Mueller and Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, appointed by Mr. Trump himself. Mr. Rosenstein is overseeing the Russia investigation and signing off on Mr. Mueller\u2019s actions.But if the president does move against the investigators, it will be up to Congress to affirm the rule of law, the separation of powers and the American constitutional order. The miserable polarization and partisan anger that have been rising in American life for decades will hit a new crescendo, and that will present congressional Republicans with a heavy burden indeed.Yet if Mr. Trump goes after Mr. Mueller or Mr. Rosenstein, even Republicans who have misgivings about the president might be inclined to fall into line. They may resent what feels like an endless investigation, one that is endangering their agenda; or they may resent partisan attacks on Mr. Trump. Such frustrations \u2014 like ones Democrats vented when Mr. Clinton was in investigators\u2019 sights \u2014 are certainly understandable. Republicans may also find themselves tempted by the political running room they would have with the investigation ended and the three branches of government under their control.Of course, it\u2019s when overriding your principles is the easy thing to do that you have an urgent responsibility, and opportunity, to demonstrate that you have some.Yet the legislative report detailing his misbehavior was bipartisan, and top state Republicans have spoken out forcefully. They recognize that Mr. Greitens is unfit. (They also see a threat to their political interests, but the two can go hand in hand.)Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation has already yielded great benefit to the country, including the indictments of 13 Russians and three companies for trying to undermine the presidential election. None of us can know if prosecutors will eventually point the finger at the president himself. But should Mr. Trump move to hobble or kill the investigation, he would darken rather than dispel the cloud of suspicion around him. Far worse, he would free future presidents to politicize American justice. That would be a danger to every American, of whatever political leaning.The president is not a king but a citizen, deserving of the presumption of innocence and other protections, yet also vulnerable to lawful scrutiny. We hope Mr. Trump recognizes this. If he doesn\u2019t, how Republican lawmakers respond will shape the future not only of this presidency and of one of the country\u2019s great political parties, but of the American experiment itself.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Latest Uproar in Brazil\u2019s Raw Political Debate: A Netflix Series", "Date": "2018-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe series, \u201cThe Mechanism,\u201d has drawn heat since it was released on March 23. Critics say its inaccuracies are unfair to a former president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who is the leading candidate in the polls for the election this fall. Others see in the show a more or less fair, if depressing, depiction of an intricate investigation that has so far seen more than 100 people convicted, including senior political figures like Mr. da Silva.The debate has been fierce.Paulo Roberto Pires, a left-leaning columnist at the newsmagazine \u00c9poca, called the series misleading, adding that it reduced complex political, historical and social issues to the fight against corruption.Antonia Pellegrino, a feminist activist who has a blog at the newspaper Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo, said the series amounted to a \u201ccondemnation of representative democracy.\u201dMr. da Silva, known universally as Lula, has not directly commented on the series, but his ally and successor as president, Dilma Rousseff, wrote a post on Facebook listing inaccuracies. \u201cNetflix\u2019s board doesn\u2019t know what they got into,\u201d she said last Monday, a comment that some commentators interpreted as an implicit threat. \u201cI think this is very serious for them.\u201dThe show\u2019s creator, Jos\u00e9 Padilha, a Brazilian based in Los Angeles, said the furor had only benefited the series. \u201cI think Lula and Dilma are helping us a lot with the marketing of the series,\u201d he said with a laugh.A main source of the controversy is a scene in the fifth episode of the series, in which a character based on Mr. da Silva talks about efforts to block the investigation and speaks of a need to \u201cstop this bleeding.\u201dIn reality, the quotation was uttered in a notorious 2016 secret recording of Senator Romero Juc\u00e1, a onetime ally of Mr. da Silva\u2019s who by then had become a political opponent and later backed the impeachment of Ms. Rousseff.Ms. Rousseff pointed to other liberties the series took with the facts.One money-laundering scandal referred to in the series occurred when an opposition party \u2014 not Mr. da Silva\u2019s Workers\u2019 Party \u2014 was in charge.Ms. Rousseff also complained that the main money launderer, Alberto Youssef, is depicted in a scene inside her campaign committee during the 2014 elections, when in reality he was already in jail by then.The series takes a largely dim view of Mr. da Silva. Prosecutors have portrayed him as an embodiment of corruption, while Mr. da Silva says that the investigations were driven by rivals who resented his redistributive economic policies.Mr. da Silva wants to stand as a candidate in the October election, although he was convicted last year of corruption and still faces charges in six other corruption cases. He has appealed. On Wednesday, the Supreme Court is expected to rule on whether he should be jailed imminently.The title of the Netflix series comes from Mr. Padilha\u2019s theory, expounded in columns, that only the corrupt can get ahead in Brazilian politics.Some critics have called him a reactionary, a charge he denies; he has made donations to a smaller left-wing party that has not been embroiled in the corruption investigation.On the left, the response to Mr. Padilha\u2019s show has been outrage. Pablo Villa\u00e7a, a left-leaning film critic, called the release of the series \u201cextremely irresponsible.\u201d After watching two episodes, he announced on his Twitter account that he was canceling his subscription to Netflix.More conservative voters saw it differently. \u201cI think Padilha wanted to give a general overview of corruption in Brazil,\u201d said Adelaide Oliveira, a spokeswoman for Vem Pra Rua, or Take to the Streets, an activist movement that opposes corruption and big government. \u201cI think he did it well, though reality is richer.\u201dIn a speech during a rally last Wednesday, Mr. da Silva said he might sue Netflix. \u201cIf we need to, we will sue him in Brazil, in the United States, in Europe, anywhere,\u201d he said. His lawyers told Netflix last year about his concerns with distortions in the series; the company did not respond to requests for comment about this article. Nearly half of Brazilians lack home internet access, limiting the reach of the series here.In an interview, Mr. Padilha played down the significance of the misquote attributed to Mr. da Silva, saying the phrase \u201cdoesn\u2019t belong to anybody.\u201dHe added, \u201cWe have a show where we show that those politicians stole billions of dollars, and the problem they have is with a line?\u201dF\u00e1bio Vasconcellos, a political scientist at the State University of Rio de Janeiro, said he did not think \u201cThe Mechanism\u201d would have much electoral impact. \u201cThe series fuels already existent points of view,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of what is in there is very well known to Brazilians.\u201dBut the series has found some fans among Brazilians. \u201cPeople are criticizing it, but those people were the leaders of the government, of course they were involved,\u201d said Gabriel Coelho, a 29-year-old cook in Rio de Janeiro. \u201cWe only need to find out to what extent.\u201dOthers refused to give it an audience. \u201cIt\u2019s bad for Brazil, because it\u2019s a series that arrives in people\u2019s homes with just with one side of the story,\u201d said Paula Abreu, a 31-year-old teacher, also from Rio de Janeiro. \u201cIt\u2019s concerning because it intensifies hate.\u201dIt is likely that this will not be the last time Netflix wades into politically treacherous waters in Latin America.In neighboring Argentina, expectations are high for a mini-series that Netflix has reportedly begun producing about the mysterious death of a prosecutor, Alberto Nisman, who was investigating the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center.The death, which a recent forensic report concluded was a murder, has divided Argentina and continues to be enveloped in mystery.Daniel Politi contributed reporting from Buenos Aires.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Save Money With the Help of Your Community", "Date": "2018-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf you\u2019re a deal hunter, you probably scour Craigslist, coupon sites and other sales for that perfect discount. But there are a lot of local community groups that can help you save money that might not be so obvious.No deal you get at a store will ever match the money you can save buying used or by dealing with hyper-local organizations. There are countless different ways your community can work for you, but here are a few examples of places you can save loads of money with a bit of help from your neighbors.\u201cAlmost anything legal you could think of has probably been gifted,\u201d says Amber Toland Perry, one of the admins in the North Park Buy Nothing group in San Diego. \u201cI\u2019ve seen toilet paper, all toiletries. Lingerie. Concert tickets. . .Once someone gifted a sword.\u201d Not everything will be of interest to you (in fact, most probably won\u2019t), but you\u2019d be surprised what you can get for free from your neighbors.These groups aren\u2019t just great for getting stuff, either \u2014 you can also use them to get services, like massage sessions, photography sessions, even dance lessons. You can also use it to get rid of stuff and save money in the process. For example, after a recent home improvement project, my wife and I had a few corrugated roof panels to get rid of that wouldn\u2019t fit in our trash. Instead of paying to get it hauled away, a neighbor renovating their garage came and picked them up from us. Everybody wins.To find a group in your neighborhood, just search Facebook for \u201cbuy nothing\u201d and your neighborhood (e.g. \u201cbuy nothing royal oak\u201d rather than \u201cbuy nothing Detroit\u201d). The smaller the group, the easier it is to browse and get stuff. You\u2019ll also find related groups for buying and selling, which can be handy.Did you know you\u2019re supposed to recycle old electronics? Most of those old gadgets have valuable materials that can be harvested and many cities have local recycling centers that will take your used electronics off your hands.If you have kids, you know how expensive baby clothes can get \u2014 especially when the little tykes seem to grow out of them every few weeks. That\u2019s why baby resale stores exist: They buy gently used clothes, toys and other items and resell them back to parents on a budget.Saving money isn\u2019t just about getting stuff for less. Your community can also offer services for cheap or free, if you know where to look. Workouts are a prime example: Why spend money on a gym membership when you can work out with a highly motivated group of people in the park?We\u2019d be remiss not to mention some of the more obvious options you already know about, like local thrift stores, consignment shops and swap meets. These types of organizations have been around forever and they can still be a great way to save money \u2014 though they\u2019re usually better for browsing than trying to find something specific. (Remember that Goodwill isn\u2019t the only thrift store around, either \u2014 there are probably locally owned ones that are less trafficked or specialize in different kinds of items.)Every city and town is different, and finding the local version of the above organizations is the real challenge. If you know where to look, though, you can make things a bit easier on yourself. Be sure to check:Once you get on a roll, you\u2019ll be surprised how many great resources you can find right in your own neighborhood. Remember to pay it forward, too \u2014 if these organizations have helped you out, don\u2019t be afraid to offer your own unwanted stuff for donation, too.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Will Italy Leave the E.U.? Not So Fast", "Date": "2018-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Severgnini is\u00a0the author of \u201cLa Bella Figura: A Field Guide to the Italian Mind.\u201dMILAN \u2014 Eight weeks after Italy\u2019s election, it\u2019s still possible that a government will be formed by the Five Star Movement and the League, two parties that have campaigned passionately against Brussels and the European Union in the past. In the last few days they have quarreled, but it seems sure that one of them, maybe both, will be the force driving Italy\u2019s next government, with the question before it being whether to continue on that anti-European path.Speaking in the European Parliament in February, the League\u2019s leader, Matteo Salvini, likened the European Union to \u201cthe Titanic about to sink.\u201d The views of Five Star are less clear cut. Its leaders have changed their minds several times about the euro, and at the moment, it seems that they\u2019d like to stay in the union. But they might well change their minds again. After all, Beppe Grillo, the movement\u2019s founder and ultimate authority, once shouted, \u201cItaly should leave the euro as soon as possible!\u201d Others are on the record as saying that \u201cthe euro has destroyed us\u201d and that \u201cit will eventually make southern Italy a wasteland.\u201dOn March 4, Election Day, Five Star attracted 32 percent of the vote. The League got 17 percent, and a third, even more Euroskeptic party \u2014 the right-wing Brothers of Italy \u2014 polled 4 percent. That means that more than half of Italian voters turned against Europe.Does it follow that the European Union is now at risk? Well, not yet. Do not expect Italy to drop the euro or leave the union anytime soon. The price would be way too high. Nevertheless, it\u2019s a fact: The continent\u2019s most Europhile country has lost faith in Europe\u2019s ability to solve Italy\u2019s problems.A Euroskeptic Italy is almost an oxymoron. Italy is one of the six founding nations of the European Union, having signed the Treaty of Rome in 1957 with France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. For 60 years it has been a loyal member and has regularly led the polls that measure trust and good will toward the bloc.What\u2019s changed?Three things, mainly. One relates to European policies. Another involves Italian politicians. The third, a consequence of the first two that looks as if it would be the most difficult to fix, concerns Italian voters.No. 1: The European Union has disappointed Italy on immigration, a deeply sensitive issue. The Dublin Regulation, in force since 1997, states that the country where an asylum-seeker first enters the union is responsible for registering his or her asylum application. With the current decade\u2019s flood of migrants coming mostly from the Middle East and Africa, the two most exposed countries have been Greece and Italy. A look at a map is enough to tell you why.Making things worse for Italy, a costly agreement with Turkey to act as a sort of bouncer for Europe has almost totally shut down the eastern route through Greece. But in Libya, which lies just south of Sicily, there has been no government to deal with, so migrants from Africa kept coming. When Italy asked its European partners to share the burden, they first said no, then maybe, then yes to opening their borders to some migrants. But only a few hundred were accepted, and Italy felt betrayed.European insensitivity has shown up elsewhere. In a supposedly \u201ccommon\u201d market, Ireland, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Cyprus and Britain all offer tax havens to encourage international companies to set up their headquarters within them. Mr. Salvini, speaking in the European Parliament in February, described the European Commission\u2019s president, Jean-Claude Juncker, a former prime minister of Luxembourg, as \u201cthe head of government of a tax haven for 20 years.\u201d And a few weeks before the election, Embraco, a company in the Whirlpool group, announced that it would close its compressor plants near Turin, fire 500 people and move to Slovakia, where wages and employee benefits are much lower. Very bad timing for Europhiles.No. 2: Every country in the union has at least one political party that built its fortunes on bashing Europe. But in Italy, lately, this attitude has been adopted by even the historically pro-European parties, which couldn\u2019t resist blaming Brussels for their own failures. Matteo Renzi, first as a prime minister (2014 to 2016) and then as the leader of the center-left Democratic Party (2017), could hardly open his mouth without saying something unpleasant about the union. Did he think he could outsmart his opponents that way? Well, he failed. \u201cBlame it on Brussels!\u201d didn\u2019t pay off for him or his government. It compares with what happened in Britain before the Brexit referendum. David Cameron, while leading the campaign to remain in the bloc, chose to acknowledge the union\u2019s shortcomings; he did it so well that he persuaded his fellow citizens to leave it.No. 3: Italy, where feelings run high on these issues, senses an emotional disconnection between Europe and its citizens. For almost 60 years, Italian voters had seen the European Union as a dull but reliable babysitter who would ultimately take care of those rowdy Italian politicians. A former prime minister told me, \u201cIf not for Brussels, I could never resist pressure to expand public spending.\u201d All that is gone now. And a majority of Italians think the sitter is at least partly to blame.But what about the union\u2019s very substantial achievements? It\u2019s created common standards in areas from home safety to cellphone roaming; it\u2019s allowed people to trade, work and live where they please; it protects agriculture and fishing; it\u2019s helped millions of students spend time abroad. And it\u2019s enabled 28 countries to speak with one voice and be respected \u2014 as Microsoft, Google and Facebook know well.All forgotten? No. But most Italians, yearning for the supposed security of a lost age, find Brussels too distant. National, local and ethnic identities are more familiar, thus more reassuring.That remoteness is important. The European Union looks soulless. Its greatest flaw may be that it cannot communicate its achievements. Take Europe Day. Only a small fraction of the 510 million citizens of the union even know about the day, let alone celebrate it, and almost no one has any idea why it\u2019s May 9. In fact, it was on May 9, 1950, that Robert Schuman, then France\u2019s foreign minister, officially proposed placing French and German coal and steel production under one authority; can you see why those 510 million don\u2019t deck the halls?So here\u2019s an idea: Let\u2019s declare May 9 \u201cNo Europe Day\u201d and suspend all of the union\u2019s achievements for 24 hours. Border crossings will be reintroduced and trade barriers re-erected. People will exchange their currency for every trip, and soccer teams will field only players from their own countries.Oh, and war will be once again a very real threat. Not far away. Right at home.One day would be enough to remind its citizens what Europe is about. And in Italy, if they do form a government, Five Star and the League might understand the importance of our common European home.Sure, it\u2019s not perfect. So let\u2019s not demolish it. Let\u2019s fix it.Beppe Severgnini is the editor in chief of Corriere della Sera\u2019s magazine 7 and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

We were slamming that ball,\u201d she said on Tuesday. \u201cSo when they were trying to say \u2018too slow of a pace,\u2019 that was just false.\u201dTheir day started out with a hiccup: Frost on the course delayed their tee time by an hour, Ms. Thompson said, so they weren\u2019t able to start playing until 11 a.m. Though a foursome is the norm, the club permitted a group of five, she said.Later, after the group finished playing nine holes, three of the women left. The remaining two, Myneca Ojo, 56, and Ms. Thompson, had just finished a break and were going to start the second nine holes, when they were approached by one of the club\u2019s owners and other employees, who said that their break took too long and that they had called the police.Officers arrived and \u201cquickly determined that this was not a police issue,\u201d Mark L. Bentzel, chief of the Northern York County Regional Police Department, said. After speaking with both of the parties involved, he said, \u201cthere was no need for us to be there and we left.\u201dNo charges were filed, Chief Bentzel added.\u201cThe police were respectful, so it is not about the police,\u201d Ms. Thompson said in her Facebook post.That contrasted with other episodes involving black customers that have fueled fury online this month. At the Starbucks in Philadelphia and the Waffle House in Alabama, the police made arrests.The former county commissioner, Steve Chronister, and the club\u2019s co-owner, his son, Jordan Chronister, could not be reached for comment.

Even so, the women said, they skipped the third hole after Steve Chronister approached them.\u201cThe only other difference between us and the other players was our race and our gender,\u201d Ms. Thompson said.York, a county of small towns, suburbs and farmland in southern Pennsylvania about 50 miles north of Baltimore, is predominantly white, said Ms. Ojo, who lives there. Black and Latino people are concentrated in the largest municipality, the city of York.\u201cThis ain\u2019t Baltimore,\u201d she added.

{"Headline": "New York Today: The Future of Playbill", "Date": "2018-04-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York TodayGood morning on this cool and bright Friday.When New York City icons change, people usually take notice.And yet, unless you see multiple Broadway shows a year, the evolution of one of the city\u2019s most venerable publications, Playbill, may have passed you by.Over the course of a few weeks, we got a backstage look into the making of Playbill \u2014 the unmistakable, yellow-bannered magazine for theatergoers \u2014 and the transition of the 134-year-old New York institution to the mobile-first, social media-obsessed age.Playbill has two New York offices, one digital and the other analogue, which are separated by about four miles and the East River, but at times can feel worlds apart.At the magazine\u2019s printing plant in Woodside, Queens, the smell of ink wafted off roaring presses as they churned out thousands of shiny copies of \u201cHello, Dolly!\u201d and \u201cCome From Away\u201d an hour. Earplugs and close-toes shoes were a must.Thirty minutes away in Midtown Manhattan, Playbill\u2019s online newsroom was more hushed: A team of 11 writers and editors worked at one long table, quietly tapping out features and news stories, and creating videos and social media content.The average Broadway audience member spends about 16 minutes in their seats before a show starts, according to Playbill\u2019s market research, but that time is increasingly spent on phones.His job lately has been to channel the \u201cHamilton\u201d bump, a surge in interest in theater news after Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s groundbreaking show, and reach theater obsessives from Hell\u2019s Kitchen to Kansas.He\u2019s also given the print Playbill a makeover.\u201cIn the past, too many times the pages would look like The New Yorker, all text,\u201d Mr. Peikert told us. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to sit in a dark theater and read that before the show. You want to read something quick and snappy and get a lesson or learn something.\u201dFor more than a hundred years, theatergoers have almost instinctively flipped through a Playbill before a show, and then tucked it in their bag or coat pocket as a keepsake.But, we wondered, how long will that experience with a print magazine last?\u201cForever,\u201d Mr. Birsh said. \u201cFor the audience it\u2019s a souvenir, it\u2019s a guide and it\u2019s woven into their experience.

{"Headline": "How Fake Mark Zuckerbergs Scam Facebook Users Out of Their Cash", "Date": "2018-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A Facebook notification on Gary Bernhardt\u2019s phone woke him up one night last November with incredible news: a message from Mark Zuckerberg himself, saying that he had won $750,000 in the Facebook lottery.\u201cI got all excited. Wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d said Mr. Bernhardt, 67, a retired forklift driver and Army veteran in Ham Lake, Minn. He stayed up until dawn trading messages with the person on the other end. To obtain his winnings, he was told, he first needed to send $200 in iTunes gift cards.Hours later, Mr. Bernhardt bought the gift cards at a gas station and sent the redemption codes to the account that said it was Mr. Zuckerberg. But the requests for money didn\u2019t stop. By January, Mr. Bernhardt had wired an additional $1,310 in cash, or about a third of his Social Security checks over three months.An examination by The New York Times found 205 accounts impersonating Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg on Facebook and its photo-sharing site Instagram, not including fan pages or satire accounts, which are permitted under the company\u2019s rules. At least 51 of the impostor accounts, including 43 on Instagram, were lottery scams like the one that fooled Mr. Bernhardt.A day after The Times informed Facebook of its findings, the company removed all 96 impostor Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg accounts on its Facebook site. It had left up all but one of the 109 fakes on Instagram, but removed them after this article was published.\u201cThank you so much for reporting this,\u201d said Pete Voss, a Facebook spokesman. He could not say why Facebook had not spotted the accounts posing as its top executives, including several that appeared to have existed for more than eight years. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to get better.\u201dFacebook requires people to use their authentic name and identity. Yet the company has estimated that perhaps 3 percent of its users \u2014 as many as 60 million accounts \u2014 are fake. Some of those accounts are disguised as ordinary people, some pretend to be celebrities such as Justin Bieber.\u201cFake accounts, over all, are a big issue, because that\u2019s how a lot of the other issues that we see around fake news and foreign election interference are happening as well,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg told lawmakers, adding that Facebook is hiring more people to work on reviewing content.But major holes remain. Interviews with a half-dozen recent victims \u2014 and online conversations with nine impostor accounts \u2014 showed that the Facebook lottery deception is alive and well, preying particularly on older, less educated and low-income people.The Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg impostor accounts typically use the executives\u2019 pictures as profile photos and list their Facebook titles. Some post manipulated images of people holding oversize checks. The names of Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg are sometimes misspelled, or use parentheses and middle names (Elliot for Mr. Zuckerberg and Kara for Ms. Sandberg) to evade Facebook\u2019s software.Many of the impersonators had dozens to hundreds of followers; several had thousands. They are aided by a network of other sham accounts with generic names, such as Jim Towey and Mary Gilbert, which purported to be \u201cFacebook claim agents.\u201dThe pitch often begins with an unsolicited \u201cHello. How are you doing?\u201d on Facebook or Instagram. The fake accounts then proceed, sometimes in broken English, to inform people of their enormous Facebook lottery prize.After several messages between The Times and a fake Sheryl Sandberg account on Instagram last week, the impostor offered $950,000 and a new car via the \u201cFacebook splash promotion 2018.\u201dWhen asked for proof the account was Ms. Sandberg, the scammer sent a Photoshopped identification. \u201cI want you to know that this Promo is 100% Real and Legitimate and the Government are aware of this Promo you don\u2019t have to be skeptical all you just have to do is to follow all instruction giving to you okay,\u201d the account added.After initially resisting, the sham Ms. Sandberg agreed to a phone call, adding \u201cI\u2019m not the one that will be speaking to you O.K.\u201d Seconds later, a call arrived from a number with a 650 area code \u2014 Silicon Valley.\u201cYou have to be careful, there are lots of scam artists,\u201d a man said in accented English after he was informed that he was speaking with The Times. He added, \u201cAll I\u2019m trying to do is get your winning package.\u201dThe Times reached out to more than 50 impostor accounts. Most messages went unreturned. None that replied broke character.The charade has ensnared people like Donna Keithley, 50, a stay-at-home mom with four children in Martinsburg, Pa. In March 2016, an account with the name Linda Ritchey messaged Ms. Keithley \u201con behalf of the Facebook C.E.O Mark Zuckerberg\u201d to pass on word of her good fortune: $650,000 in lottery winnings. Ms. Keithley wired $350 \u2014 a delivery fee \u2014 the next day.That began a monthlong saga. According to a 28,000-word transcript of a Facebook Messenger conversation between Ms. Keithley and the account, the scammer repeatedly played on Ms. Keithley\u2019s Christian faith to get her to send more money.\u201cAre you good Christian with god fears?\u201d the Linda Ritchey account asked. \u201cCan you trust me and also have believe in me?\u201dOver the next month, Ms. Keithley received not only Facebook messages but a call from a Mr. Zuckerberg impostor who assured her the lottery was real. She even heard from a Facebook account masquerading as Eileen M. Decker, the former United States attorney in Los Angeles, asking for $205 to process her winnings.The Times found at least five Facebook accounts posing as Ms. Decker and advertising government grants, another known scam. Ms. Decker told The Times that she has tried to get Facebook to remove the accounts, but the site wanted a picture of her government-issued identification to do so. She refused. \u201cTo me, they\u2019re not a trusted source,\u201d she said. She added that she had contacted the F.B.I. and hired a lawyer.Ms. Keithley\u2019s scammer ordered her to open new credit cards and bank accounts, and even to get a loan using her husband\u2019s 2001 Ford Taurus as collateral. Midway through the month, she said she had a minor stroke from the stress.By April 2016, she had used her family\u2019s tax refund and loans from relatives to pay the scammer $5,306.43 \u2014 much of it in money transfers to the name Ben Amos in Lagos, Nigeria.\u201cIt just devastated the whole household,\u201d said her husband, Tim Keithley, a security guard who was making $10 an hour at the time.The ordeal was so costly, Ms. Keithley said, the family\u2019s telephone service was shut off. They also had to go to a food bank.While Ms. Keithley still gets messages from accounts claiming to work for Facebook, she said she is now wiser. \u201cLord as my witness, no one\u2019s getting any more money from me,\u201d she said.After they are duped, victims may struggle with what to do next. Mr. Bernhardt, the retired forklift driver, said he didn\u2019t know how to report the scammers to Facebook. Ms. Keithley said she had called a number for Facebook she had found online, though she was not sure the number was authentic. She also reported the scam to local police, who said they couldn\u2019t help, and the Pennsylvania attorney general. A spokesman for the Pennsylvania attorney general said the office did not have a record of Ms. Keithley\u2019s report, but that it planned to contact her.Kathryn Schwartz, 55, from Lodi, N.J., said she has been in credit-card debt since she lost $1,742 trying to claim bogus Facebook lottery winnings in 2016. She said she has since been barraged by scammers and regularly reports them, including in messages to the real Mr. Zuckerberg.One Facebook account named Mary Williams recently messaged Ms. Schwartz, saying it would help her claim her winnings. A review of the account showed that in March it had renamed itself, purporting to be a Boise, Idaho, native who works at Facebook. Years of posts before that depicted a man in Nigeria.When Ms. Schwartz posted on Facebook last week that Mary Williams was a con artist, the account left a comment: \u201cYou think you are smart but you are not. If you were smart why were you scammed.\u201d The emojis tacked at the end of the message were crying with laughter.Mr. Bernhardt said that since he wired his last payment to the Mr. Zuckerberg masquerader in January, he has heard from two other Mark Zuckerbergs, one Sheryl Sandberg and other accounts promising him winnings in return for more cash.No conversations have gone as deep as with his original scammer. \u201cI thought we were getting real close,\u201d Mr. Bernhardt said. \u201cHe started calling me Mr. Gary and I started calling him Mr. Mark.\u201dHe said he had told his scammer about growing up in a foster home and his dream of owning a house on a lake.\u201cThey sucked me in because they knew my dreams,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Promises Strike on Syria and Warns Russia Against Backing Assad", "Date": "2018-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump put Syria and Russia on notice Wednesday morning in a Twitter post, promising that missiles fired at Syria \u201cwill be coming, nice and new and \u2018smart!\u2019\u201d and telling the Kremlin that it should not partner with a \u201cGas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it!\u201d After the threat, the president said in a separate tweet that relations between the United States and Russia are worse than ever.Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria. Get ready Russia,  because they will be coming, nice and new and \u201csmart!\u201d You shouldn\u2019t be partners with a Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it!The president appeared to be reacting to reports on Tuesday that the Russian ambassador to Lebanon, Alexander Zasypkin, warned the United States and its allies that any missiles fired at Syria would be shot down. He made those comments in an interview with Al Manar Television.With American strike intentions so clearly forecast by Mr. Trump, the Syrian government has moved key aircraft to the Russian base near Latakia, and is taking pains to secure important weapons systems, military analysts said.Pentagon officials said that even if Syrian warplanes manage to elude an American-led strike campaign, the United States and its allies can still seek to so damage Syrian airfields \u2014 across the country \u2014 that it would hamper Mr. Assad\u2019s ability to use them to launch future chemical weapons attacks.That kind of damage, though, would require a sustained campaign \u2014 likely over a number of days. It was unclear whether the United States, France and other allies involved have made a decision to extend a bombing campaign beyond one night.But the president\u2019s subsequent tweet struck a different tone. After he warned Russia what it would be up against in Syria, Mr. Trump lamented that relations between the two countries were worse than during the Cold War, a decades-long geopolitical and ideological rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union when both were armed for, and prepared for, nuclear war.The attack on Saturday in the Damascus suburb of Douma has not been confirmed to be the result of a chemical weapon.Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Wednesday that the United States is still assessing the intelligence on the suspected chemical attack, but that military planning was proceeding.\u201cWe stand ready to provide military options if they\u2019re appropriate, as the president determined,\u201d he said.The World Health Organization said on Wednesday that there were reports of about 500 people in the Damascus suburb of Douma who have symptoms similar to people exposed to toxic chemicals. It said about 70 people had died while taking shelter in basements and 43 of them had signs of being exposed to \u201chighly toxic chemicals.\u201dLater on Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump clarified his assessment of the poor relations with Russia in another tweet, blaming the decline in Washington-Moscow ties on the ongoing investigation into Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election.The president repeated his frustrations about the ongoing inquiry, which he said was led by Democrats or others who worked for former President Barack Obama.After Mr. Trump\u2019s series of tweets Wednesday morning, Mr. Putin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said, \u201cWe don\u2019t participate in Twitter diplomacy. We advocate serious approaches.\u201d Mr. Peskov\u2019s comments were reported by the Interfax news agency.But publicly discussing American military plans is in contrast to how he has said he would conduct himself as commander in chief.During tensions with North Korea in April of 2017, he said in an interview on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d that he would not say whether he would order a strike if the rogue nation continued conducting missile tests.\u201cI don\u2019t want to telegraph what I am doing or what I am thinking,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI am not like other administrations, where they say, \u2018We are going to do this in four weeks.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t work that way. We\u2019ll see what happens.\u201dThat was the kind of message that Mr. Trump repeatedly delivered as a presidential candidate, mocking former President Barack Obama for giving adversaries too much information by setting timelines for withdrawal from combat zones.While Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet did not disclose the exact date and time of an American missile strike, Mr. Assad\u2019s allies are lining up to back the Syrian regime.The top adviser to Iran\u2019s supreme leader said on Wednesday that Tehran would support Damascus against any foreign aggression, Iran\u2019s state television reported.\u201cIran backs Syria in its fight against America and the Zionist regime,\u201d Ali Akbar Velayati, the supreme leader\u2019s adviser, told state television during a visit to eastern Ghouta in Syria. Iranian officials call Israel \u201cthe Zionist regime.\u201d Mr. Velayati said of the United States, \u201cTheir habit is to threaten constantly and the only thing they know how to do is bombing, haven\u2019t Syria and Iran been bombed before?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Marriage Used to Prevent Deportation. Not Anymore.", "Date": "2018-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey had shown the immigration officer their proof \u2014 the eight years of Facebook photos, their 5-year-old son\u2019s birth certificate, the letters from relatives and friends affirming their commitment \u2014 and now they were so close, Karah de Oliveira thought, so nearly a normal couple.Then the officer reappeared.\u201cI\u2019ve got some good news and some bad news,\u201d he said. \u201cThe good news is, I\u2019m going to approve your application. Clearly, your marriage is real. The bad news is, ICE is here, and they want to speak with you.\u201dICE was Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the federal agency charged with arresting and deporting unauthorized immigrants \u2014 including, for the moment, Fabiano de Oliveira. In a back room of the immigration office in Lawrence, Mass., two agents were waiting with handcuffs. Her husband was apologizing, saying he was sorry for putting her through all of this.Ms. de Oliveira kissed him goodbye. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever I can to get you out,\u201d she said.For decades, marriage to a United States citizen has been a virtual guarantee of legal residency, the main hurdle being proof that the relationship is legitimate. But with the Trump administration in fierce pursuit of unauthorized immigrants across the country, many who were ordered deported years ago are finding that jobs, home and family are no longer a defense \u2014 not even for those who have married Americans.In a growing number of cases, however, immigrants with old deportation orders that were never enforced are getting the go-ahead after an interview by United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency that handles residency and citizenship, only to be arrested by ICE.\u201cIt\u2019s like playing dice in Las Vegas or something,\u201d said William Joyce, a former immigration judge who now practices immigration law in Boston. \u201cIt\u2019s not 100 percent, but you\u2019re playing with fire if you go to that interview. You can walk in, but you won\u2019t be walking out.\u201dMr. de Oliveira and his wife had been dating for eight years, ever since Ms. de Oliveira\u2019s sister introduced them and they started working next door to each other \u2014 he at a pizza place, she at a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts. They had a son three years later, but he waited until 2016 to marry Ms. de Oliveira, a Massachusetts native, partly because he did not want her family to think he was angling for a green card.After the wedding, all the things they could not do while he lacked legal status became obvious: Not being able to go on their honeymoon, because he could not fly. Not being able to get a joint credit card. Not being able to get car insurance.\u201cHe got caught because he was trying to do the right thing,\u201d Ms. de Oliveira said of her husband\u2019s arrest on Jan. 9. \u201cIt was like a setup.\u201dIt took a month for her husband to be released. Because she did not know what else to say when their son asked, Ms. de Oliveira told him that his father was working out of town.In the later years of the Obama administration, the government mostly left people without criminal records alone, focusing instead on immigrants who had only recently arrived or had been convicted of serious crimes.But the Trump administration emphasizes that everyone living here illegally is fair game for deportation, a policy that has bumped up immigration arrests by more than 40 percent since the beginning of 2017. Those who were ordered out of the country years ago are especially easy marks for an agency with limited resources for enforcement \u2014 especially if they walk straight into an immigration office.Most who have been arrested under the Trump administration\u2019s policies had scant prospects of ever achieving legal status, whether through marriage to a citizen or another route.People like Mr. de Oliveira, on the other hand, were well on their way.Getting a green card through spouses and relatives had become far easier in recent years for those who were living in the country illegally. Until 2013, undocumented applicants had to leave the country and wait out the application process from abroad, in some cases for as long as a decade, before returning with green cards.Now, however, it is risky simply to show up for an interview.\u201cFor many individuals, it\u2019s sort of this Sophie\u2019s choice of remaining in the shadows, without formal immigration status,\u201d or hazarding arrest, said Genia Blaser, a staff attorney at the Immigrant Defense Project, a New York-based group that has been fielding calls from immigrants concerned about the new policies.Immigration lawyers in New England, in particular, say there has been an unmistakable swell in the number of clients arrested at marriage interviews over the past few months. In the past, they said, U.S.C.I.S. officers had routinely alerted their counterparts at ICE to marriage applicants with old deportation orders, but only since President Trump took office had immigration agents begun to arrest those people at interviews. (A few such cases had occurred under the Bush administration as well, they said.)Several lawyers said that they could no longer in good conscience encourage their clients to go to their marriage interviews, even if staying away would mean throttling a process that had already swallowed up months, if not years, and perhaps thousands of dollars in legal and application fees.\u201cSo you end up with a situation where, all right, you don\u2019t go to the interview, you don\u2019t get the petition approved, so there\u2019s no way forward,\u201d said Mr. Joyce, who said at least five clients of his firm had been arrested in the middle of applying for a marriage-based green card over the last year, including two who were later deported.An ICE spokesman, John Mohan, said that ICE has always worked with other government agencies to gather information for enforcement purposes.\u201cICE does not exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement,\u201d he said. \u201cAny individual determined to be in violation of U.S. immigration laws may be subject to arrest, detention and removal from the United States.\u201dSome remain undeterred. Leandro Arriaga, 43, had been warned by his lawyer that he might be detained at his marriage interview because he had been ordered deported years ago. But he decided to go anyway, determined to get legal papers. Without them, \u201cYou can\u2019t do nothing, you can\u2019t go to college, you can\u2019t do things in your own name,\u201d Mr. Arriaga said. \u201cI said, \u2018I don\u2019t want to be illegal anymore. I\u2019ve got to do something.\u2019\u201dMr. Arriaga had arrived illegally from the Dominican Republic in 2001, settling in the Boston area. He married a citizen, had three children, divorced, married another citizen and had another child, building a good business buying and fixing up old properties along the way.After talking it over with his wife, Katherine, he decided to take a chance on the marriage interview, which was scheduled for March 2017 at the immigration office in Lawrence, Mass. An immigration officer certified his marriage, clearing him to move to the next step toward legalization. But before he could leave the office, he was detained, along with four other marriage applicants who were interviewing that morning, at least two of whom also had their petitions approved that morning.It took until the end of May for him to get out of detention \u2014 more than two months of legal motions, court hearings and negotiations. The government ultimately released him with an ankle monitor, leaving Mr. Arriaga free to continue pursuing his application for a green card.Nearly a year later, though he was still chasing paperwork, he did not regret having walked into the immigration office. \u201cI really think that I did the right thing,\u201d he said.Many people, though, are heeding their lawyers\u2019 advice and postponing any application for legalization \u2014 even those who are likely to be deemed eligible. The risks are too great.Natalia and Junior Roveda, who have been together seven years, managed to make it through their marriage interview last year in Massachusetts without incident. Mr. Roveda had come to the United States illegally from Brazil in 2005 and evaded a subsequent deportation order. He was moving into the next stage of the legalization process when he was arrested outside their apartment in the town of Framingham. In November, he was deported to Brazil, where he is now living with his parents.Since then, his marble and granite business has gone dormant. Ms. Roveda, 25, gave up their apartment, sold the furniture and started working 20 extra hours a week at her job as an aesthetician and makeup artist to help support him in Brazil. When she can, she makes the long journey to visit him.Still, Mr. Roveda is pursuing his green card from abroad. Their lawyers have told them it could take up to a year, and Mr. Roveda fears being stuck there, away from his wife and his faltering business, for much longer.\u201cIt is not fair,\u201d he said. \u201cI was already approved and everything.\u201dSandra Garcia contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Homeless in Seattle, and Marrying Under the Overpass", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVowsThree days before their wedding ceremony, Michelle Vestal\u2019s dress and Bob J Kitcheon\u2019s suit were stolen. Most couples would have panicked, but they took it in stride. \u201cThings get taken all the time out here,\u201d Mr. Kitcheon said with a shrug. He and Ms. Vestal live in a tent by the side of a parking lot in the south of Seattle, a few minutes\u2019 drive from downtown.Mark Lloyd, a local resident and volunteer, and now friend to the couple, stepped in. He gave Mr. Kitcheon a shirt and drove them both to a Goodwill store. As is the way in their relationship, the couple helped each other choose new clothes.Ms. Vestal, 50, and Mr. Kitcheon, 61, met six years ago under the King Street station clock in Seattle. This past February, back under the same clock tower, Mr. Kitcheon proposed. When they first met, he was up from Phoenix, where he then lived, for Seattle\u2019s annual Hempfest. Ms. Vestal told Mr. Kitcheon she had some marijuana to sell him and he gave her $10. She said that at the time she was addicted to crack cocaine; she stole his money.But that didn\u2019t put off Mr. Kitcheon. A month later, after asking her to hang out, they spent a few hours together at a laundromat. \u201cThe thing I remember most was his smell,\u201d Ms. Vestal said. \u201cIt still makes me feel wooshy now.\u201dMs. Vestal, who was born in Barrow, Alaska, was adopted at birth. Her biological father \u201cwas not cool with me\u201d and her mother \u201cwas a dope fiend.\u201d Her adoptive parents, who she refers to as Mom and Dad, lived in a remote part of Alaska with no roads. Her mother was the president of a newspaper, her father president of an oil company.\u201cI was raised by a good family,\u201d she said. \u201cI had a nanny, but I wasn\u2019t spoiled. My mom and dad never yelled at me, they never spanked me, but I had a rough life.\u201d She said she was sexually abused by her grandfather, who is now deceased. She has two younger sisters and speaks to her family regularly. Her older and only brother died from a drug overdose 17 years ago.Ms. Vestal, who had dreams of being a veterinarian, was introduced to \u201clife outside\u201d her sheltered upbringing when she was 18. \u201cI went buck wild and told my parents, \u2018You can\u2019t tell me what to do no more.\u2019\u201d It was at this point that she met a man who introduced her to crack cocaine. A 30-year addiction to the drug began.In 1985, Ms. Vestal moved to Seattle, where she has lived, and been mainly homeless, since. She has been married five times previously and has eight grown children: one in Seattle; the others, including two sets of twins, are in Anchorage. \u201cThey are all being taken care of,\u201d she said. Aware of the judgments that might be made about some of her life choices, she added, \u201cThis doesn\u2019t make me a bad person, because I\u2019m not.\u201dMr. Kitcheon (who said he has never used hard drugs; \u201cI just smoke weed and drink beer\u201d) was married once before. His first wife died 25 years ago. After her death, he couldn\u2019t bear to stay in the home where they had raised their 10 children. He put up a tent in the backyard, and much to the confusion of his children, slept outdoors. Mr. Kitcheon said he still owns the five-bedroom Phoenix property where his daughters now live.\u201cI\u2019m really not homeless,\u201d said Mr. Kitcheon, a Los Angeles native. \u201cI could leave this city any time. I just don\u2019t worry about anything.\u201d He misses his \u201cbabies\u201d but has led a transient life for years. \u201cI tell my kids all the time, \u2018Pops got to go,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut I raised them well.\u201d He said he has four sons: two in the Army, one in the Marines, one in the Navy; and six daughters, all nurses.The morning of their wedding marked 84 days clean from crack cocaine for Ms. Vestal. It\u2019s the first time that she has tried to stop using the drug. \u201cI would never have done it if it wasn\u2019t for him,\u201d she said, referring to Mr. Kitcheon. \u201cIt was really hard, and it\u2019s really hard right now, but knowing that I\u2019m loved and that I\u2019ve got somebody with me, has made it possible.\u201dMr. Kitcheon said, \u201cI asked her, \u2018Do you want that dope or do you want me?\u2019\u201d He promised that if she was willing to try to quit, he\u2019d help her through it. \u201cI believed in her and she believed in me.\u201dMs. Vestal says she was raised by her father to always help others. \u201cThis woman would take the jacket that she\u2019s wearing and give it to anyone,\u201d Mr. Kitcheon said. \u201cMy mother was the same way. She used to feed the street people before she fed us.\u201dThe practical challenges of living on the street bring the couple closer. \u201cHe does everything for me,\u201d she said. \u201cHe makes sure I eat, that I\u2019ve got clothes on my back. He paints my toenails.\u201d They\u2019re often giggling and whispering. \u201dWhatever she wants, I\u2019ll do it,\u201d Mr. Kitcheon said.But with the difficulties of drug abuse, the relationship has had challenges. Mr. Kitcheon has a construction job, working eight hours a day. \u201cI used to lie to him and every time he got a paycheck, I\u2019d steal from him,\u201d Ms. Vestal said. Mr. Kitcheon, however, said he knew he could always make more money and in spite of addiction, their love persevered.Last Thanksgiving, Ms. Vestal and Mr. Kitcheon visited her family in Alaska. He said the family house \u201cis huge, with helicopter pads in the backyard,\u201d and added that he impressed her parents when he made a jerk goose for dinner.When asked what had spurred his proposal this past February, he said, \u201cBecause I can trust her.\u201dA five-minute walk from where the couple live, a group of around 20 local residents, including Mr. Lloyd, hold a Sunday lunch for homeless people called the Rainier Pop-Up Kitchen. \u201cWhen they told us they wanted to get married, the whole group got giddy about them doing it here,\u201d Mr. Lloyd said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been having email and Facebook threads to plan the day.\u201dEvery week for the last year, volunteers bring dishes to serve on a sidewalk beside a busy road under an Interstate 90 bridge, where around 100 diners eat at folding tables and chairs.Ms. Vestal and Mr. Kitcheon are regulars. \u201cMichelle\u2019s a lot of fun because she\u2019ll always tell you what she thinks,\u201d Mr. Lloyd said. \u201cAnd Bob\u2019s a cool guy. We\u2019re the same age and we like to talk about the \u201960s.\u201dOn Sunday, March 18, after everyone had eaten, the couple were married by Vicki Butler, another local volunteer and an associate dean at the City University of Seattle, who was ordained by the Universal Life Church. (It was while meeting at her house to plan the wedding that the couple\u2019s clothes were stolen.)Because of health concerns for Ms. Vestal\u2019s mother, her family was not able to travel to the wedding, but the bride, using Ms. Butler\u2019s phone, called one of her sisters to tell her about her wedding day.Volunteers and diners had erected and decorated a gazebo frame with blue and white paper garlands and strings of battery-powered lights. Mr. Lloyd bought new white tablecloths. Other volunteers provided tea lights, boutonnieres and flowers, and sparkling cider to toast the couple.Ms. Vestal\u2019s flower girl, Adelaide, 2, is a regular at the weekly lunches. She and her parents, Leslie and Austin Dekle, and their infant daughter, live in a tent. The family, originally from Georgia, has been on the road since July 2015.Just before the ceremony, the groom asked the bride if she had cold feet \u2014 quickly followed with, \u201cI\u2019ve got some hand warmers you could put in your boots if you do.\u201dMs. Butler\u2019s husband, Larry Butler, who works as a Santa Claus for a Seattle mall, gave away the bride. Everyone knew him from his appearance at the Christmas meal. Adelaide, held by her mother, followed them to a small podium in the gazebo. Sue Alexander, a volunteer, made the wedding cake and also stood in for the maid of honor, who was injured by a camping fire the night before.

{"Headline": "Escapes, Riots and Beatings. But States Can\u2019t Seem to Ditch Private Prisons.", "Date": "2018-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn Arizona in 2015, a riot broke out in a private prison where previously three inmates had escaped and murdered a vacationing couple.After order was restored, the state revoked the contract of Management & Training Corporation and hired another private prison firm, the GEO Group.Three years earlier, the GEO Group had surrendered its contract to run a Mississippi prison after a federal judge ruled that the inmates had not been protected from gang violence. The replacement: Management & Training Corporation.Private prison companies can be found at every level of government, housing 9 percent of the nation\u2019s prisoners. They emerged in the 1980s, when the number of inmates was quickly outstripping capacity, and they have an outsize influence in certain states, including Arizona, Florida, Hawaii, Mississippi and New Mexico.The trial concluded on Monday; the judge has yet to issue a decision.Even states that have sworn off private prisons, or tried to cut back on their use, have found it difficult to extricate themselves. After the prisoners escaped in Arizona, the state tried to reduce the number of inmates held in that prison. But MTC claimed the state was violating its contract, which guaranteed a certain number of beds would be filled. Arizona had to pay the company $3 million. MTC still operates a facility in the state.States that use private prisons can find themselves limited to a few big players. The largest are GEO Group, based in Florida; CoreCivic (formerly Corrections Corporation of America), based in Tennessee; and MTC, based in Utah. Two of the past four directors of the Federal Bureau of Prisons were later hired by CoreCivic.George Zoley, chief executive of GEO Group, made $9.6 million in 2017 \u2014 almost double his 2016 earnings, according to S.E.C. filings. Damon T. Hininger, CoreCivic\u2019s chief executive, earned $2.3 million in total compensation in 2017, according to the records.GEO Group and CoreCivic, which are publicly traded, had revenues last year of $2.3 billion and $1.8 billion. Much less is known about MTC, which is privately held. A company spokesman declined to answer a number of emailed questions about its operations and revenues, but said the company was dedicated to helping \u201cat-risk individuals\u201d gain the tools for success.The companies employ a variety of strategies, including hiring former corrections officials in high-level positions and giving what are sometimes enormous campaign contributions. GEO Group and CoreCivic gave close to half a million dollars to support Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy and inauguration. After he was elected, their stock prices soared.Industry officials say they provide cost-effective ways to house inmates, and that they continue to expand into rehabilitation programs as more states seek alternatives to prison. CoreCivic says about 10,000 people in its facilities have obtained high school equivalency diplomas in the past five years, reflecting the company\u2019s efforts to improve the ability of inmates to re-enter society.But some lawmakers say the claims of cost savings and other benefits do not check out. \u201cThere is no convincing argument of why we should have private prisons,\u201d said Mike Fasano, a former Republican state senator from Pasco County, Fla., who voted against a 2012 measure to privatize much of Florida\u2019s prison system.In Mississippi, the state\u2019s three private prisons were once operated by GEO Group and are now run by MTC.A fourth, Walnut Grove, was closed in 2016, four years after a federal judge wrote that the prison \u201cpaints a picture of such horror as should be unrealized anywhere in the civilized world,\u201d and placed the prison under federal oversight.But the state is still paying for it. In the 1990s, Mississippi issued bonds to pay for prison construction, including some facilities intended to be privately run. It still owes $91 million for Walnut Grove, according to state documents.Cecil McCrory, a former state legislator, was also convicted in the scandal. He did consulting work for both GEO Group and MTC, which paid him $12,000 a month, according to the indictment.Both companies have denied wrongdoing in the case.The state declined to settle a separate lawsuit filed on behalf of inmates at the East Mississippi facility by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Southern Poverty Law Center. For the past two months, the resulting trial has presented evidence of rampant violence and chronic neglect amid shortages of guards and medical staff. Although four out of five inmates there are mentally ill, East Mississippi has not had a psychiatrist on its staff since November.Inmates have testified that rival gangs were the prison\u2019s de facto rulers, even deciding which cells new inmates were allowed to occupy. Last year, an inmate with a mobile phone \u2014 available on the prison\u2019s black market for $800 \u2014 filmed himself beating another inmate and posted the video on Facebook. MTC gives guards less pay and training than government correction officers receive.Still, Pelicia E. Hall, the state prison commissioner, testified that she had no plans to cut ties to MTC.Some states have found themselves with few alternatives when they have tried to curb their use of private prisons.Hawaii, which sends a quarter of its prisoners to a private prison in Eloy, Ariz., sought to bring them home after the murder of two Hawaiian inmates and allegations of abuse in 2010. One inmate had been stabbed 140 times.Neil Abercrombie, a Democrat who was governor of Hawaii at the time, declared that the policy of sending prisoners away \u201ccosts money, it costs lives, it costs communities.\u201d But Hawaii\u2019s largest prison is filled to capacity, so the state has continued to send inmates to Arizona.Mike Brickner, senior policy director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio, said the prospects for a privatization plan in his state dimmed after the state sold a prison to a private company and assaults on prison staff and other inmates rose sharply. The frequency of assaults declined in subsequent years.Much of the industry\u2019s power, critics say, is linked to campaign donations. GEO Group and CoreCivic have given nearly $9 million over the past fifteen years to state candidates and parties across the United States, with the overwhelming majority to Republicans, according to the National Institute on Money in State Politics.The two companies have also spent between $3 million and $4 million annually on lobbying, according to data from the institute and from the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics.Steve Owen, a CoreCivic spokesman, said the magnitude of lobbying and campaign contributions was not unusual for an industry of its size.The industry also promises savings. But such claims have been disputed, partly because many contracts allow the private prisons to cherry-pick the healthiest inmates while leaving those who need more care to publicly run facilities, making private prisons appear to be cheaper to run, critics say.The Justice Department\u2019s inspector general concluded in 2016 that it could not accurately compare costs, partly because of \u201cthe different nature of the inmate populations and programs offered in those facilities.\u201dThe department ordered a phasing-out of private facilities that year, saying they \u201ccompare poorly\u201d with government prisons and citing a lack of substantial cost savings. One month after Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, the department rescinded the decision.Mr. Owen of CoreCivic said his company never insists on terms allowing it to cherry-pick inmates, that its contracts reflect what states want, and that they provide ways for states to withdraw from the arrangement, as some have done.In some communities, private prisons have become such large taxpayers and employers that backers have forecast economic doom in arguing against their closing.Perhaps no town is now as dependent as Eloy, Ariz., where four private prisons pay $2 million of the town\u2019s $12.5 million annual operating budget, according to the city manager, Harvey Krauss.One unit, which houses people detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, has come under scrutiny for inmate deaths.In 2015, The Arizona Republic found that at least five people had committed suicide at that facility since 2003, while none of the almost 250 other detention centers across the country had had more than one suicide in that time. Overall, the newspaper reported, 9 percent of all deaths in detention during that period had occurred at the Eloy center.While there can be a stigma attached to prison towns, the fiscal impact cannot be overstated, Mr. Krauss said.\u201cWe would be in a world of hurt without them,\u201d he said.Susan Beachy contributed research.Advertisement"}

Each signature was an original creation. Although I\u2019m pleased by how quickly I can pay my bills now, every time I open the bank app on my phone I feel my identity eroding, replaced by routing and account numbers.Some years ago I decided to organize a lifetime\u2019s worth of papers, which included handwritten notes, letters and postcards from my parents, my first girlfriend and first boyfriend, as well as some famous folks, including Senator Joe Biden, Mayor John V. Lindsay of New York and the tennis champ Billie Jean King. Each of them had its creator\u2019s unique signature.I particularly treasure the letters from my maternal grandmother. At the upper left of each envelope she would write out her name, Marjorie L. Straus, in classic cursive. Even before I could read I knew those curves and curlicues equaled my grandma. The dozens of cards and notes from her are all signed exactly the same way, \u201cLove, Grandma.\u201d The \u201cL\u201d and the \u201cG\u201d were original to her hand.

How we watched \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show\u201d together on Saturdays. Her nightly Scotch and soda (which she always let me sip).Grandma died in 1973; she lives on eternally through her penmanship.I also still have the five-page letter my mother wrote me in 1981, shortly after I told her I was gay. She starts out in her usual formal hand, but as she goes on the pen quivers and she strays outside the lines. That told me so much more about her inner monologue \u2014 her fears for me \u2014 than her actual words.The same message in an email would have provided no clues as to her state of mind. By the time she penned a jittery \u201cLove, Mom,\u201d I knew that her caring was very real even if she hadn\u2019t yet accepted my sexual orientation.According to one Mastercard executive, \u201cthe signature has really outrun its useful life.\u201d Granted, technological advances long ago made our scrawls obsolete as a protector of personal security. But not for a moment do I believe the signature has no life left in it.To credit card companies, a chip is about to become my identity, with no signature necessary.

{"Headline": "Lost in Battle, Found by Amateur Sleuths: An \u2018Unknown\u2019 Marine", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "Digitized records and DNA tests are allowing civilian volunteers to pitch in and help put correct names on unidentified remains in American military cemeteries.Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A mystery that went unsolved for 73 years began when Herman Mulligan threw a grenade.In the thick of some of the most vicious fighting of World War II, on the island of Okinawa, Private First Class Mulligan\u2019s grenade clattered into the dark maw of a Japanese bunker and blew up a cache of ammunition. The huge explosion obliterated most of the hillside, and blasted the 21-year-old Marine beyond recognition.Amid the chaos, his unidentified body was buried in a hasty battlefield grave, while the Marine Corps listed Private Mulligan as missing in action. In the years after the war, he was reclassified as \u201cunrecoverable,\u201d and the family that knew him gradually died off, until his memory was almost as lost as his bones.The private\u2019s story could have ended there, among the roughly 72,000 American troops from World War II who have not been accounted for. But the ending has been rewritten by a black-and-white snapshot found in a Marine veteran\u2019s trunk.The photo inspired an informal network of volunteer sleuths to track down survivors of the battle, pore over forgotten maps and comb through yellowed files until they had traced Private Mulligan\u2019s likely remains to a burial plot under a marble cross in Manila. Then they found a cousin, James Patterson, who could provide DNA for matching.In March, Marines in dress uniform knocked at the Patterson home near Charlotte, N.C., where the private\u2019s Purple Heart and dog tags have been on display for years near the front door. Private Mulligan, they said, had been found.In many cases, it turns out that the dead are not missing, just their names. American military cemeteries like the one in Manila hold 8,500 unknown remains, most from World War II, but the Accounting Agency generally does not focus on those cases. Troops in cemeteries, even if unidentified, have at least been buried with honor, the agency argues, so it concentrates instead on locating remains that never made it to a cemetery: infantrymen lost in a jungle ambush, say, or aircrews scattered by a mountainside plane crash.That has left thousands of open cases that attract amateur investigators.\u201cA lot of these guys are pretty easy to sort out, but the agency has other priorities,\u201d said John Eakin, a Vietnam veteran who waged a five-year legal battle with the agency, trying to compel it to test the remains in a grave in the Philippines where he believed his cousin was buried. (He turned out to be right.)The accounting agency, with an annual budget of more than $130 million, has long been criticized for clearing few cases. On average it identifies only about 100 remains a year; the figure rose to 201 in 2017 mainly because it started exhuming more unknowns like Private Mulligan.The agency said in a statement that \u201cstaff are systematically reviewing unknown files to see if a case for exhumation can be made,\u201d and that to go ahead, officials must be persuaded the remains are \u201cmore likely than not\u201d to be positively identified.The search for Private Mulligan started with a blood-flecked Japanese flag that Dale Maharidge, a Pulitzer Prize-winning author who teaches journalism at Columbia University, found among his father\u2019s things after he died.Mr. Maharidge\u2019s father had been a Marine on Okinawa, and the flag was a souvenir taken from the brow of a dead Japanese soldier and signed by more than a dozen Marines. His father had come home from the war haunted by combat and unwilling to talk about it, but for the rest of his life, he kept a dog-eared snapshot of a buddy he lost in combat \u2014 Private Mulligan.Mr. Maharidge decided to track down the men of the flag, and ultimately the man in the snapshot.\u201cI thought by finding Mulligan, maybe I could finally understand my dad, and put some of his demons to rest,\u201d Mr. Maharidge said.Private Mulligan worked in a textile mill as a teenager in Greenville, S.C., before the war, and lied about his health to get into the Marines, hiding his hemophilia. He saw fierce fighting in Guam and then hit the beach on Okinawa, where his regiment fought for weeks to pry Japanese defenders from the hillside tombs that they used as bunkers.On May 30, 1945, Private Mulligan threw his fateful grenade into one of the tombs, not knowing it was packed with explosives.\u201cThe whole hillside blew out at him,\u201d a veteran told Mr. Maharidge. \u201cHe got hit in the face.\u201dA few men remembered carrying the bloodied private to an aid station, but did not know what happened to him after.Mr. Maharidge asked the accounting agency for help finding Private Mulligan in 2011, but \u201cI just ended up getting shuffled around,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one ever did anything.\u201dBy the time he published \u201cBringing Mulligan Home\u201d in 2013, the title had changed from a quest to a metaphor \u2014 a reminder that the past can be as acrid and hard to grasp as battlefield smoke. His failure to find answers left him so drained that he didn\u2019t write again for more than a year.But once in the public eye, Private Mulligan\u2019s story took on a life of its own.An amateur genealogist in Virginia named Bridget Carroll heard Mr. Maharidge give a radio interview and sent him an email offering to help. \u201cI love a mystery,\u201d she told him.Before long, she had found Private Mulligan\u2019s cousin, James Patterson.\u201cWe had his Purple Heart sitting here in the house, but didn\u2019t know a thing about it,\u201d said Mr. Patterson\u2019s wife, Jean. \u201cBut then I read the letters of his family trying to find him after the war, and it broke my heart.\u201dShe joined the search. The family provided DNA to the agency that could identify Private Mulligan, and urged the agency to begin a search, but she said the agency seemed to do little. Two years later, she spotted a Facebook post announcing that dozens of Marine remains had been recovered by independent researchers on the island of Tarawa, and posted a comment saying she hoped Private Mulligan was among them.Robert Rumsby, a former Army lieutenant who had worked on the Tarawa excavations, saw her comment and responded. He had developed a passion for World War II, and though he was only 26 at the time, he had already spent years indexing unknown graves from the war.\u201cThis guy was a nobody, just a grunt everyone had forgotten,\u201d Mr. Rumsby said of Private Mulligan. \u201cBut that\u2019s why we had to find him. Nobody deserves to be left behind.\u201dAfter the war, the Army recorded details of each set of unknown remains in records known as X files that are now digitized and widely shared by researchers. The files showed that X-35 had been exhumed and sent to Saipan to be identified, along with thousands of others. Although the grave contained socks stenciled with the name Mulligan, no match was made, and the remains were reburied in 1950 in an American cemetery in Manila.Pressed by the family and their senators and congressmen, the agency exhumed X-35 in the spring of 2017 and sent a section of tibia to the military\u2019s DNA lab in Maryland to be compared with the sample supplied by James Patterson (he died in July 2017). The results were a match.\u201cI don\u2019t believe in closure, I don\u2019t think we ever really get over anything,\u201d Mr. Maharidge said a few days after hearing the news. \u201cBut this feels pretty good.\u201dEarlier this month, Mr. Maharidge, the author who started the quest, walked through the ghostly marble headstones of Arlington National Cemetery with Mr. Rumsby, the researcher who had connected the crucial dots. They stopped at the grave of Mr. Maharidge\u2019s father and Mr. Maharidge produced a bottle of respectable 10-year-old bourbon.There was an empty plot three spaces to the north, where they hoped to bury Private Mulligan. The sun was setting, and in the distance, a bugler sounded taps at the Tomb of the Unknowns.Mr. Maharidge poured glasses of bourbon, then paused to splash a bit from the bottle onto the grass.\u201cThe dead drink first,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

I am a member of the community websites in the towns of Saugerties and Woodstock, where I had been looking for a place, and I can tell you it is far better than owning.I especially enjoyed March. There were four blizzards, trees down on mountain roads, black ice and power outages, and I sat in my cozy, well-lit Greenwich Village apartment and thought, \u201cI do love a good snowstorm.

I joined the Woodstock community group last summer when I was renting in the area with the usual new-in-town yearnings: a good gym, live music and a seasonal romance, though if it turned into something longer I would certainly have contacted the Guinness Records people.I was delighted to find what a great way these online groups are to discover the soul of a community. The Woodstock group was very welcoming and helpful. This is a town where if Fluffy goes missing, you will get more expressions of sympathy than if your life partner dies. It\u2019s also a good place for channeling the natural healing wisdom of the universe, exploring about 300 schools of yoga and being a champion of wildlife, even if it is eating your tomatoes.There were also a lot of postings about bears, which had become something of a nuisance, spotted in town, attending readings at the Golden Notebook bookstore. I suspected that soon, like everybody in Woodstock, they would be doing Airbnb and sure enough, last week, under Unique Properties, I saw something listed as \u201cDen.\u201d The pictures concerned me because all they showed were mountain views, but the views were stupendous, so I messaged the host.\u201cThere are no photos of the bathrooms because there are no bathrooms,\u201d he replied. \u201cI\u2019m a bear.

BTW, two things I insist on: no dogs and you scatter your garbage out front every night.\u201dAlso, when I went out in the real world, trying to find a real house, I was depressed. I was crunching numbers, applying for bank loans, trying to figure out how to carry two homes as a single person who never sold arms to Afghanistan. It was doable, but only if I cut out food. Plus, thinking about it all the time made me feel poor. Poor me. I have worked my entire adult life, have no debt, have savings, and yet I cannot spend $350,000 for a second home.But on the community message boards, as fall turned to winter, I felt better and better. It wasn\u2019t just the beautiful photos of the changing countryside, it was the ebb and flow of homeownership: catastrophe in, money out. I had heard over the years of the perils, but it is never so vivid as in the monetized first-person present.Just moved up to the area and was horrified that my electric bills are $200 to $300 a month. Is that normal?And then the ominous, Greek-Catskillian chorus. There were about 40 voices in this particular number:Utilities are very expensive here. I had a small three bedroom and the cost in January for baseboard heat, washer and dryer was $1,100.My throat went dry, reading these posts, my heart pounded.Eleven hundred dollars a month! That\u2019s more than I pay for Verizon! I\u2019d have to empty my IRA and move into the gutter sooner than expected.Also, I kind of enjoyed it. It was my first taste of the pleasure of nonownership, a thrill I can compare only to watching Janet Leigh being stabbed in the shower in \u201cPsycho.\u201d You\u2019re shocked and repelled and want to turn your face away but there is also a great relief that it\u2019s not you bleeding out through a dozen wounds and falling down dead.And heating bills were not the only thing to fear. There was flooding. There were fallen trees damaging roofs. There were three chimney fires in 10 days in one house, which left a couple entirely without heat. A wood-burning stove started that. You look at those things and think, \u201cOh, quaint, a wood-burning stove, now I can swing an ax as I\u2019ve always dreamed or hire someone to do so,\u201d but using that stove is like bringing Norman Bates into the house. It has issues you cannot imagine.So once again, this summer, I\u2019ll be renting. I found a beautiful Airbnb outside Woodstock with an outdoor grill, a big dining-room table and plenty of room for guests. Some electricians were there when I drove up to check it out, making repairs, and a plumber was expected. I insisted the owner tell me all about it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Trump Lashed Out at OPEC: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Friday morning. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Wells Fargo takes another hit.\u2022 What AT&T\u2019s Randall Stephenson said on the stand.\u2022 What Takeda has to weigh in its pursuit of Shire.But why has President Trump made the international oil cartel his latest b\u00eate noire? One potential reason: It makes life more difficult for many Americans, weighing on the benefits of the Republican tax cuts.The context: OPEC and Russia agreed two years ago to cut \u2014 and maintain \u2014 oil production caps to bring prices back up in the wake of U.S. shale boom. So far, that strategy has worked:With oil above $73 now, even after Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet, fuel prices are at reaching two-year highs as the U.S. gets into the summer driving season. More importantly, Americans are preparing to spend more on fuel, eating into whatever savings they are expected to receive on average from the tax cuts.Americans are expected to spend an average of $400 per household more on fuel this year than in 2016, as the rebound in crude prices is reflected in the cost of petrol at the pump. By contrast, middle-income US households will on average gain $930 each from the tax cut bill passed at the end of last year, according to the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.And Michael Lynch of Strategic Energy & Economic Research had this to say to Bloomberg:\u201cNinety-eight percent of what politicians say about oil should just be disregarded immediately and this falls in there.\u201dIn February, the Justice Department issued demands to AT&T, Verizon and the G.S.M.A., a mobile industry standards-setting group, for information on potential collusion to thwart a technology known as eSIM, said two of the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details are confidential.The technology lets people remotely switch wireless providers without having to insert a new SIM card into a device. AT&T and Verizon face accusations that they colluded with the G.S.M.A. to try to establish standards that would allow them to lock a device to their network even if it had eSIM technology.The investigation was opened about five months ago after at least one device maker and one wireless carrier filed formal complaints with the Justice Department, two of the people said.Representatives for the Justice Department, AT&T, Verizon and the G.S.M.A. declined to comment.\u2014 Cecilia KangShares of General Electric jumped nearly 4 percent Friday after the company reported better-than-expected earnings and reaffirmed its guidance for the year.Though G.E. reported a first-quarter loss on Friday, there were also signs that the struggling industrial giant is beginning to stabilize its business.G.E.\u2019s big power-generator division continues to drag down the company\u2019s overall performance, and it is still burdened with financial liabilities that linger from the conglomerate\u2019s pared-back finance arm, GE Capital.But G.E.\u2019s other major industrial divisions, led by aviation and health care, delivered solid results in the quarter. That should provide some assurance to investors as the company charts a future dependent on its industrial lines.Especially heartening for investors, G.E. reaffirmed its profit outlook for the year, predicting earnings per share of $1 to $1.07, though likely at the lower end of that range. Analysts had been skeptical that G.E. could do that well. The average analysts\u2019 forecast for the year was 95 cents a share, as compiled by Thomson Reuters.To recap: Wells Fargo has already paid $185 million over its fake accounts scandal and set aside $4.25 billion for liabilities tied to other infractions. And the Fed has prevented the bank from expanding its balance sheet.Yes, the upcoming $1 billion fine is the most stringent bank penalty imposed by the Trump administration to date. (The C.F.P.B., under pressure from Mick Mulvaney to go easier on financial firms, is involved here.)But Mr. Stewart writes, \u201cAt this point it\u2019s hard to imagine what more Wells Fargo can do (or how much more it can spend) to make amends.\u201dThat\u2019s the contention of the reporter Jonathan Greenberg, who, as a Forbes reporter in 1984, spoke with \u201cJohn Barron\u201d about Donald Trump\u2019s net worth. Mr. Barron \u2014 a now well-known alter ego of the real estate executive \u2014 contended that Mr. Trump had bought out most of his father\u2019s stake in their business.Over time I have learned that he should not have been on the first three Forbes 400 lists at all. In our first-ever list, in 1982, we included him at $100 million, but Trump was actually worth roughly $5 million \u2014 a paltry sum by the standards of his super-monied peers \u2014 as a spate of government reports and books showed only much later.Mr. Greenberg writes that the White House and the Trump Organization declined to comment.The Justice Department, which wants to block the deal, argued that AT&T is different because it\u2019s also a broadband internet provider, and that relations with Silicon Valley are chummier than Mr. Stephenson asserts.A big takeover would give Takeda more scale \u2014 the combined company would have some $30 billion in annual sales \u2014 and a bigger international footprint. But it would also be the company\u2019s biggest takeover by far, and perhaps too expensive.The Japanese drug maker said it intended to maintain its credit rating, which could be difficult if it bids too high \u2014 or is pressured to do so by yet another suitor.With its $16 trillion economy and reputation for tough negotiating, the E.U. could have been the immovable object in President Trump\u2019s trade fight. But that is looking less likely, Peter Eavis writes.Among the lessons if the E.U. concedes: The U.S.\u2019s large trade deficits can give it leverage.The sometimes controversial data consultant cut its teeth working for the Pentagon and the C.I.A. Now it\u2019s hoping that its latest product will attract more commercial clients.The company needs to figure out how to be rewarded on Wall Street without creeping out Main Street. It might not be possible. For all of Palantir\u2019s professed concern for individuals\u2019 privacy, the single most important safeguard against abuse is the one it\u2019s trying desperately to reduce through automation: human judgment.Victor Orlovski, Fort Ross\u2019s founder and managing partner, told Michael that the current state of U.S.-Russian political relations should not affect his firm\u2019s ability to operate. \u201cThe nature of start-ups is all about risk,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a political tension, but not when you\u2019re talking to start-ups.\u201dThe tech flyaroundThe only potential obstacle: Arturo Di Modica, the artist who made the bull, doesn\u2019t want it moved.An earlier version of this article, relying on information in a Bloomberg report, misstated the amount of Sumner Redstone\u2019s compensation that a court ruled CBS shareholders could challenge. It is less than $4 million, not more than $13 million.Advertisement"}

Carter Journalism Institute at NYU.When my mother and I got there, after passing through a Secret Service checkpoint, we knocked on the front door, fully expecting a butler of some type to answer. Instead, Mrs. Bush flung the door open herself. She was wearing a simple dress, pearls and comfortable shoes. She was beaming. She said: \u201cRuth! I\u2019m so glad you made it!\u201d They talked all afternoon, then spent the next day together.They had a lot in common. Between them, they\u2019d raised 18 children. Mommy\u2019s children were black. Mrs. Bush\u2019s were not. Neither cared about that. They were, ultimately, mothers.I\u2019ve thought a lot about that since Mrs. Bush died. About that common ground. And about where we all live now.I do not know enough about American politics to venture informed opinions about power, other than I wake up every day since the last presidential election feeling as if I\u2019m living a nightmare. But Mrs. Bush was beyond politics. She represented a far greater power. She represented the power and grace of a mother\u2019s love.Mother love is an unwieldy, cumbersome thing, hard to differentiate and quantify, yet powerful as the curve of an egg. It goes deeper than any political party. It is rooted in the idea of family and the underlying belief that here in America we can do better, ought to do better, should know more, strive for more, and most of all, love more. Mrs. Bush defined that feeling. She was, in a way, the great American woman we would all like to be.She was outspoken and honest. She said things that needed to be said, and occasionally things that ought not be. She carried the load, nursed the babies, drove the cars, prepared the food. She taught the children to walk, and when the children became adults, stood them up when they could no longer stand. Like any mother, she would take a bullet for those she loved \u2014 her husband, her children, her grandchildren. And like too many mothers, she suffered the immeasurable grief of losing a child when her 3-year-old daughter, Robin, died of leukemia. She and her husband, George Bush, were at Robin\u2019s bedside when the child passed peacefully. \u201cI never felt the presence of God more strongly than at that moment,\u201d she wrote in her memoir.Like all mothers, she worked. After her husband graduated from Yale and left the Navy following World War II, the couple moved to Odessa, Tex., where George began his career as a warehouse sweeper and oil parts assemblyman. They lived in a tiny flat attached to a hothouse next door, with a shared bathroom.Her neighbors were not the \u201cforgotten blue-collar working class\u201d that the press likes to talk about these days, but rather oil workers and friends whom Mrs. Bush would recall with fondness the rest of her life: the Casselmans, Smitty the Oklahoma salesman who gulped bourbon from the bottle, the customers at Pinky Roden\u2019s liquor store, and the oil company employee who gave her husband \u2014 a happy soul who dragged all sorts of characters back to their crowded house \u2014 a ride home in the back of his pickup truck on Christmas Eve after the company offered an open bar for its oil workers. \u201cHe dumped George in the yard and drove away,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt was a long time before I let George forget it.\u201dDuring her husband\u2019s eight years as vice president, she traveled 1,629 days, visited 50 states and 65 foreign countries and covered 1.3 million miles, which is 54 times around the world. She mothered her kids in every kind of living quarter imaginable \u2014 cheap inns, well-heeled mansions, hotel rooms, apartments and the back of a station wagon that she drove from Maine to Texas every year. She hosted 1,192 events at her house and 1,232 events in Washington. Yet she still answered her own front door. Her smile was genuine, her delight infectious. Mrs. Bush liked to laugh, and she could converse as easily with a Mexican mother of seven as she could with a head of state. It made no difference. She was a true Christian. My mother admired her.She was not without fault. Her public statements sometimes caused controversy. She recalled wearing sneakers to meet the prime minister of Greece. When she was a young bride-to-be and was called upon to cook for Mr. Bush\u2019s younger brothers, her future mother-in-law bragged to Mrs. Bush\u2019s mother that Barbara was a wonderful cook. Her mother, shocked, responded, \u201cOh?\u201d Peanut butter and jelly was the actual menu. It didn\u2019t matter. The menu was love, something Mrs. Bush learned from her own mother, whom she would lose in an auto accident after she married, unable to attend the funeral because she was living in California and very pregnant with her second child and, ironically, her own duties as a wife and mother prevented it. There was nothing to do. Family comes first.And what a family she raised. In the tight-knuckled, bare-fisted world of Washington politics, the Bushes proved over the years that they could hit as hard as anyone. Some did not like it. Still, you will not find a more loyal family. Republican, Democratic, black, white, Latino, North, South, Dixie, New England \u2014 you won\u2019t have to look far down the Bush family line to find some of this, or that, or the other. They\u2019re a real American family, flawed as all families are, shaped by a matriarch who understood, even as a young woman, that in all the ways of life, the importance of a mother\u2019s love is paramount. It is the last line of reason and discourse in a planet gone seemingly mad. It is our last breath and greatest hope. Motherhood defines a society.Barbara Pierce Bush defined every single bit of it. In the last years of her life, she dragged her octogenarian body onto planes and buses and into cars from one end of the country to the other, raising money for her literacy foundation. She despised ignorance. She despised it because she knew it was wrong.And if you loved her and what she represented, you\u2019ll go out and get a book. And you will read it. You will turn off that TV and pay attention. And cut the tweeting. And cut the Facebook chatter and all the other nonsense. And you will get busy doing what Barbara Bush spent a majority of her life doing. You will fight ignorance. You will learn to love. And in doing so, you will do what she did.You will change the world.James McBride is an author, musician and Distinguished Writer in Residence at the Arthur L.

{"Headline": "They Did 30 Years for Someone Else\u2019s Crime. Then Paid for It.", "Date": "2018-04-07", "News": "More than $1 million in compensation was supposed to help two brothers rebuild their lives. Instead, the money made them a target.Supported byFAYETTEVILLE, N.C. \u2014 The state of North Carolina paid $750,000 to Henry McCollum in 2015 to compensate him for the 30 years that he, an innocent man, spent on death row.Seven months later, he was broke. Mr. McCollum, who is intellectually disabled, then began borrowing money at 38 percent interest. He kept his financial plight hidden from friends and supporters from his death row years.But last fall, he briefly and wearily opened up when he was handed documents showing he owed $130,000 on $65,000 in recent loans.\u201cSometimes I feel like I shouldn\u2019t be out here,\u201d he said.Mr. McCollum and his half brother, Leon Brown, who is also intellectually disabled, were demonized and convicted in one of the state\u2019s most notorious rape and murder cases. Their decades in prison and their disabilities would have made for a difficult return to society under the best circumstances.By the time a federal judge intervened in the spring of 2017, no trust had been set up for the brothers and money intended for their care had been spent on predatory loans, exorbitant legal fees, multiple cars, women\u2019s jewelry and children\u2019s toys.Jeffrey Deskovic, an exoneree who established a foundation to help the wrongfully convicted, said he had advised about 60 other exonerees on how to manage compensation and the unwanted attention it brings. The experiences of Mr. McCollum and Mr. Brown are extreme, he said, but the underlying dynamics are common.\u201cAll were hit up for money by family and friends or were targets of scammers,\u201d Mr. Deskovic said.The brothers\u2019 tragic story began decades earlier. Schools had identified Henry McCollum and Leon Brown as mentally challenged: Mr. McCollum read at a second-grade level when he dropped out of high school; his younger brother could barely read or write.In 1983, the body of 11-year-old Sabrina Buie was found in a soybean field in Red Springs. The killer had jammed her underwear down her throat with a stick.A schoolgirl\u2019s rumor prompted detectives to interrogate the brothers, then 19 and 15, who confessed to the crime.Both soon recanted, saying they were coerced, but to no avail. They became two more convictions for District Attorney Joe Freeman Britt, listed as the deadliest prosecutor in the Guinness Book of World Records.A jury sentenced both to be executed, and Mr. Brown, at 16, became the youngest person on death row. After the State Supreme Court ordered separate retrials, Mr. McCollum returned to death row and Mr. Brown was sentenced to life in prison with the label of child rapist.Then, in 2014, the North Carolina Innocence Inquiry Commission announced that new DNA testing of a cigarette butt found at the crime scene matched the DNA of Roscoe Artis, who had lived next door.While the brothers were in jail awaiting trial, Mr. Artis raped and strangled an 18-year-old woman one mile from where Sabrina Buie was killed. Mr. Britt tried and convicted Mr. Artis for that crime before he put Mr. McCollum and Mr. Brown on trial. Police investigated Mr. Artis as a suspect in Sabrina\u2019s murder, but never told defense lawyers.In September 2014, a judge declared Mr. McCollum and Mr. Brown innocent, sending a packed courtroom into pandemonium.The brothers knew the wrongs done to convict them. It\u2019s less clear they understand the wrongs they have suffered since their exonerations.Nobody was more elated by the exonerations than Ken Rose, Mr. McCollum\u2019s lawyer. Mr. Rose had been visiting his client on death row for 20 years: \u201cEvery time I saw him, he\u2019d say, \u2018I don\u2019t belong here, I\u2019m innocent, when can I go home?\u2019\u201dBefore the brothers could qualify for the maximum $750,000 in state reparations, Mr. Rose needed to obtain an official pardon from the governor.In the meantime, the brothers went home to the care of Geraldine Brown, Mr. Brown\u2019s sister and Mr. McCollum\u2019s half sister. In the 30 years the men were in prison, Ms. Brown had visited Mr. Brown once; she never went to see Mr. McCollum.She had no job or car, and relied on funds raised by Mr. Rose\u2019s nonprofit law center for rent and utilities. Sometimes social workers took the men shopping. They said they learned that if they entrusted the sister with cash, the bills went unpaid.Months passed with no pardon and no compensation. A cousin mentioned the brothers\u2019 plight to Kimberly Weekes, an Atlanta woman who said she was an advocate who worked on voter registration, food drives and recycling campaigns.After speaking with Ms. Brown, Ms. Weekes contacted an instructor at Metropolitan College in New York who she said was her business partner. Ms. Weekes and the partner, Deborah Pointer, then drafted a contract for \u201cadvocacy and civil rights.\u201d The brothers would owe Pointer & Weekes Inc. a cut of any reparation: 10 percent of loans, 5 percent of state compensation and 1 percent of lawsuit settlements.Ms. Brown signed and Ms. Weekes began searching for a lawyer to take over the case.Mr. Rose soon received a fax from Ms. Brown saying that he should step aside and that Ms. Weekes represented the family \u201cin all or any of the Civil/Litigation.\u201dMr. Rose viewed the fax as nonsense. But he didn\u2019t view the women as cranks: \u201cI think they were very serious in taking whatever they could from my clients.\u201dOn Feb. 27, Ms. Brown and her brothers finalized a contract with Patrick Megaro, a lawyer based in Orlando, Fla., to take over from Mr. Rose and other lawyers suing the police. Leon Brown signed with an \u201cX.\u201d The contract specified that the family owed Mr. Megaro 33 percent of awards, even if they fired him. Legal experts said the contingency clause probably violated state bar rules.Ms. Weekes and Ms. Pointer secured money for the brothers \u2014 and for themselves \u2014 from a firm that lends to plaintiffs in anticipation of a settlement or jury award.Mr. Megaro approved two $100,000 loans, one for each brother, with an annual interest rate of 41.6 percent and a $5,000 fee wrapped into the principal. The loan documents show that Mr. Megaro authorized the payment of $20,000 to Ms. Pointer and Ms. Weekes.Mr. Megaro sent a letter to Mr. Rose and the legal team suing the police, demanding their files and stating that he alone represented the brothers. The coup stunned the lawyers, but they could see no way to challenge the contract.After her $10,000 payout arrived, Ms. Weekes made one trip to North Carolina. She said she helped the family with shopping and found a nicer rental home. Ms. Pointer never met the brothers. She set up a Facebook page and a change.org petition, and had her students at Metropolitan College call the governor\u2019s office to demand a pardon.In June 2015, the governor pardoned the men. A publicist for Ms. Pointer and Ms. Weekes touted them as \u201cthe two female power execs\u201d behind the men\u2019s freedom.In September 2015, an administrative law judge approved the $750,000 payouts to each brother. Mr. Brown did not attend the hearing. He had been admitted to a psychiatric facility, his seventh since his release.Mr. Brown had had psychotic breaks in prison, which were now getting worse. His sister could not get him to take his antipsychotic medications. She said he had talked about being raped by inmates and tied to his bunk by guards. He worried that God wouldn\u2019t forgive him. He rocked in place and refused to eat or drink for days.The day before the administrative hearing, Mr. Megaro requested that Ms. Brown be named Leon Brown\u2019s guardian, despite her inability to manage his mental illness or her own finances. Creditors have filed at least 16 liens against her; she has been evicted three times. Nevertheless, the guardianship was granted.In October, North Carolina wrote Mr. Megaro a check for $1.5 million, half intended for each client, tax-free. Mr. Megaro took more than one-third of each brother\u2019s compensation, according to Mr. Brown\u2019s court files and Mr. McCollum. Payment on the high-interest loan took another $110,000. Each brother was left with less than half of his award.Mr. Megaro declined to discuss his fees, the loans, the payments to the advocates or making Ms. Brown guardian.In an April 2017 interview, he denied taking advantage of his clients.\u201cI like these guys,\u201d Mr. Megaro said. \u201cThey are nice people, even if they are mentally disabled. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dMr. Rose, who worked pro bono on the pardons, had planned to protect the brothers\u2019 money in trusts that guaranteed fixed payments for life, about $3,000 a month each, based on the $750,000 awards.That has been the practice in North Carolina: Exonerees keep their entire compensation. Lawyers are typically paid by taking a cut of settlements with the police.For his part, Mr. Megaro did not set up trusts, even after admitting in court that his clients needed protection from \u201cfraudsters and frivolous spending.\u201d After taking his cut, Mr. Megaro distributed the remainder to Mr. McCollum and began sending money to Ms. Brown, as Leon\u2019s guardian.Mr. McCollum was soon broke and borrowing with Mr. Megaro\u2019s approval. He would not discuss where the money went.His brother\u2019s finances, supervised by the court, have more of a paper trail. Although guardians can legally spend money only on their wards, Ms. Brown bought women\u2019s jewelry and shoes, diapers and toys.Motor vehicle records show she also acquired a Dodge van, 2010 Mustang, 2004 BMW and 1995 Lexus.The court ultimately stripped her of the guardianship and cut off access to her brother\u2019s money. At a hearing, Ms. Brown admitted she had also asked Mr. McCollum for thousands of dollars and had taken out a $25,000 high-interest loan in Leon Brown\u2019s name, also with Mr. Megaro\u2019s approval.The judge found her in contempt of court and ordered her jailed.\u201cWhy you would take advantage of a poor soul like that, I do not know,\u201d the judge said.Ms. Brown replied: \u201cI\u2019m sorry you feel that way.\u201dShe conceded in an interview that she should have never been made guardian. When it comes to lawyers, loans and contracts, Ms. Brown said: \u201cI\u2019m incompetent too. I\u2019m not going to stand here and lie.\u201dLast spring, Mr. Megaro filed court papers saying he had reached a settlement with the Red Springs police. Each client would be awarded $500,000.Judge Terrence Boyle of Federal District Court announced he would not approve any settlement before determining whether Mr. McCollum was competent to sign the contract with Mr. Megaro. Judge Boyle appointed a guardian to investigate.The guardian discovered the predatory loans. He learned Mr. Megaro had not set up a trust or estimated his clients\u2019 future medical needs. After Mr. Megaro\u2019s fees and loan payments, Mr. McCollum would net $178,000 and Mr. Brown $308,000 from the police settlement.At the next hearing, Mr. Megaro angered the judge by repeatedly refusing to reveal his fees for the earlier state compensation.He insisted that Mr. McCollum was competent to hire his own lawyer.Judge Boyle zeroed in on this claim when Mr. Rose took the stand: \u201cIs it your impression that the same vulnerability that subjected him to a false confession and 31 years of death row imprisonment is now operating on his claims for recovery, that he\u2019s subject to manipulation and control?\u201dMr. Rose responded: \u201cThere\u2019s no question in my mind, your honor, that\u2019s true.\u201dAt the next hearing, Judge Boyle declared that the brothers were incompetent and that their contracts with Mr. Megaro were void.The judge said he would approve the police settlement, $500,000 for each brother, and would determine Mr. Megaro\u2019s fees. Court-appointed guardians would put the money in trust and the brothers would not be obliged to repay their loans out of the settlement.Mr. Megaro agreed to the terms but the case is far from over. The State Bureau of Investigation and the Robeson County Sheriff\u2019s Office still face lawsuits.Mr. McCollum lives in Virginia with his fianc\u00e9. On Monday, a judge there appointed a guardian to protect Mr. McCollum\u2019s finances and recover any misappropriated money.Mr. Brown lives in a North Carolina group home, where his sister visits regularly and sometimes takes him home on weekends. In a phone call, Mr. Brown said he didn\u2019t belong in a group home. \u201cA judge put me here,\u201d he said. \u201cI want my freedom.\u201dAs for Ms. Pointer and Ms. Weekes, they said they were still owed $75,000 from the state compensation and may sue Mr. Megaro. Asked if she had any regrets, Ms. Pointer said she was offended by the question.\u201cWe came into this with pure hearts to help two brothers who had suffered,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s typically what is taught around seventh grade, but Marte\u2019z Alexander is 20, Emily Spencer is 22 and Bernice Larson is 68. In fact, everyone in the class is over 18 years old.These classmates have little in common except one thing: None of them completed high school. And the work sheets they were puzzling over don\u2019t just represent dry grammar, but a second chance \u2014 at a high school diploma, a better-paying job, maybe college. A second chance to prove to their children and parents, and most important, to themselves, that they can shed the label high school dropout.I dropped out of high school and got pregnant at 17. I went to like seven G.E.D. courses, but it was so hard. I have 25 grandkids \u2014 they\u2019re my pride and joy, and my grandson needed help with algebra, and I couldn\u2019t do it. That made me feel real bad.  When I first came here in 2015, I couldn\u2019t do any of it. I was frustrated; I would just get mad at the teachers. I stayed away once about a week or so and said I\u2019m not coming back, stop calling me. But I had to. The teachers and the coach would call me, and the coach would say, \u201cMs. Karen, don\u2019t give up.\u201d I\u2019m a C.N.A. (certified nursing assistant), but I want to be a counselor for abused women. I wanted to be educated. Three of my children graduated from high school, three didn\u2019t. One is going to school here with me.Karen Johnson, 59, who graduated on Feb. 16 from the Excel Center at University Heights in Indianapolis.Five more, four in Missouri and one in Muncie, Ind., are scheduled to open by 2019.Each school provides life coaches, who serve as a combination guidance counselor and social worker, drop-in child care, transportation assistance and other benefits. Students work toward a regular diploma and dual college credit or industry-recognized vocational certification in any number of fields, such as pharmacy technician, information technology or welding. And any Excel Center in any state is required to incorporate all those elements.Rigorous research has shown that that kind of wraparound support \u201chas the potential to have the most impact,\u201d said Elizabeth Zachry Rutschow, a senior research associate with MDRC, a nonprofit research organization. \u201cThis comprehensive support model is very unusual. Adult education programs are often really strapped for funding.\u201dAlthough most of the students dropped out in high school, the average student has a fourth-grade reading and math level.It was a struggle. In 2015, his Goodwill opened an Excel school in Memphis, with Goodwill funding the bulk of the program and private philanthropists helping out. Goodwill lobbied hard for a change in state law, which was approved late last year; now adult learners receive the same financing as traditional students, and the state will pick up most of the funding for the Memphis center.About 400 students have graduated or are expected to graduate from the Memphis school by June, and Mr. Martini hopes to open six to 12 centers in Memphis over the next six yearsOne reason politicians like these schools is that employers like them.Luke Kenley, a recently retired Indiana state senator, a Republican and appropriations chairman, was a strong supporter of the Excel Center.\u201cThis is a looming problem in Indiana like everywhere else in the country. Where do you get people educated for today\u2019s work force?\u201d he said. When Goodwill, which already ran a free traditional charter school in Indianapolis, came forward seeking funding for the Excel Center, \u201cI knew they were an exceptionally capable nonprofit in terms of social issues, and the problem has become so large \u2014 getting people prepared for good jobs \u2014 that government funding appeared to be necessary.\u201d I was bouncing around through foster homes; I was 17 when I dropped out. I made it through to senior year and didn\u2019t have any of my credits because I was going from school to school because of foster care. I called Goodwill for the G.E.D. program, but they had done away with it, and they invited me to Excel. I was one of the first students who walked through the door. It wasn\u2019t easy \u2014 I worked all day, every day. A couple of times I wanted to give up. (Some staff members) took me on college tours. They got me amped up, and I took the ACT. I\u2019ve been working full time at night as a maintenance mechanic for about seven years, and I also went to Marian (University in Indianapolis) and graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree in business administration. I\u2019ll be going back to get an engineering degree. I want to move from fixing machines to more the engineering and design.Jamieson Brewer, 26, was one of the Excel Center\u2019s first graduates, in 2011.The first Excel Center opened in 2010 in Indianapolis, and it was something of a failure. About 300 students attended the school, but the curriculum was online, and it just didn\u2019t work. Only four students graduated.The staff rethought its approach and moved from online to almost entirely in-class instruction. Each school offers five eight-week terms annually, and students can enter at the beginning of any term. They are tested before entering to determine their level of English and math. Students who fail a subject can retake it in the next eight-week term \u2014 and the next.The core classes are also offered morning, evening and sometimes at night, so a student can work and attend classes.The teachers, many of whom taught in public schools before joining the Excel Centers, and the life coaches know all too well the obstacles facing their students\u2019 quest for a diploma. Children or parents get sick or in trouble, the car breaks down or the bus doesn\u2019t come, the family\u2019s breadwinner loses a job or goes to prison. The teachers and life coaches cajole, praise, encourage, and if a student who has been on track suddenly disappears, they call, text, reach out on Facebook and even show up at their door. Teachers have taken homework to hospitals when a student gets sick.But there\u2019s a fine line between helping the students, many of whom are struggling with multiple financial and family problems, and doing too much.\u201cWe\u2019re loving them, but also challenging and pushing them,\u201d said Dionne Leard, the director at the Excel Center University Heights in Indianapolis.While the average student graduates within 18 months, some, like Karen Johnson, a recent graduate, take much longer. Arriving barely able to read, she took English 2 six times.\u201cAs long as they are making progress they can stay,\u201d Ms. Leard said.Tera Price, 21, fusses over her month-old daughter in a car seat next to her \u2014 the infant is too young to go to the child care center. Nicole Gosha, 42, and her son Rickey, 29, sit next to each other joking with some other students.\u201cI\u2019m just glad I came,\u201d Ms. Gosha said, \u201cand I gave a speech, which isn\u2019t something I normally do.\u201dHer son leaned in. \u201cI gave the best speech. I did research on bed bugs.\u201d The graduation rate at Excel Centers in Indiana is about 20 to 25 percent; while that appears low, the model of eight-week terms makes traditional measurements difficult.At the start of a term, most of the students are full of hope and enthusiasm, proud they showed up the first day.But it\u2019s hard to know who will end up with a diploma and who won\u2019t. Who will power straight through, who will disappear forever and who will reappear after months away. Two weeks after the first class, Tera Price stop showing up. A month in, the Goshas, mother and son, had near-perfect attendance.I had to start paying bills for our household. My mom has a lot of health issues, and my dad has a lot of problems with his back, so they weren\u2019t making the money to make ends meet to pay the bills.  I dropped out in eighth grade; my sister dropped out in high school. We were skidding. We drove around and picked up wooden pallets and cashed them in for the money I always felt bad about dropping out. I got pregnant with my daughter when I was 19, and one of the things mainly pushing me toward getting my diploma was my daughter kept asking me why I didn\u2019t graduate. She was having a problem. She didn\u2019t want to go to school. She asked me, \u201cWhy do I have to go? You never finished.\u201d Right there it hit me. She\u2019s looking at me, and I don\u2019t want her to follow in my footsteps.Amber Parrish, 27, expects to graduate in June from the Excel Center.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will Bank Earnings Flash Any Warnings?: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Good Thursday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 The big banks are getting ready to report first-quarter results.\u2022 Larry Fink believes robust global growth and earnings will support stocks.\u2022 There\u2019s a consensus that Facebook must be regulated. The question is, how?\u2022 What Paul Ryan\u2019s exit means for business.\u2022 Jack Ma argues that a trade war would hurt the U.S.Headwinds and tailwinds are blowing through the financial markets and the global economy.The strength of these crosscurrents can be gauged, in part, by examining the results of the big banks, three of which report their first-quarter earnings on Friday. They are JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, which have large operations around the world and big Wall Street businesses, as well as Wells Fargo, which is more of a traditional lender focused on the United States.At the start of the year, the big banks had the wind in their backs. The global economy seemed to be on a clear growth path, the United States had just enacted large tax cuts and the Trump administration was expected to loosen bank regulations. But the threat of a trade war between the United States and China helped plunge the stock markets into correction during the first quarter. The banks\u2019 results, as well as comments from their senior executives, could signal whether the tumult is seeping into the real economy. Here are some things to watch out for:\u2014 Peter EavisAmid the steep drop in its stock price, perhaps it was only a matter of time before Micro Focus drew an activist investor. Elliott Management was a logical candidate. Now, as the $34 billion activist investor has taken a stake in the software maker, here\u2019s what it could push for:\u2022 Potentially go private altogether\u2022 Potentially sell off Suse Linux, a popular maker of the Linux operating system that Micro Focus acquired as part of its takeover of AttachmateOne possibility is that Elliott will push to be involved in a sale of some or all of the business through its private equity team, Evergreen Coast Capital.A spokesman for Elliott declined to comment, while a spokeswoman for Micro Focus declined to comment.Despite one of more volatile quarters in recent years, the chief executive of BlackRock believes that robust global growth and stellar earnings results will be enough to keep the stock market from spiraling downward.But he concedes that worries over trade wars and increased political uncertainty \u2014 at home and abroad \u2014 has made for a riskier investing environment.\u201cMy optimism has abated somewhat,\u201d Mr. Fink said in an interview on Thursday. \u201cBut economically the world is in good shape.\u201dBut for all the turmoil and noise, the market is about flat for the year, he pointed out.The investment giant reported first-quarter earnings Thursday. Helped by continuing inflows into the firm's passive funds, better performance by its actively managed funds and a more favorable tax rate, earnings per share grew 28 percent compared with a year ago.\u201cThis quarter validates us institutionally,\u201d Mr. Fink said, making the point that BlackRock could attract money even when investors are in a jittery mood.Even though many investors yanked money out of the market over the past two months, BlackRock had $55 billion of net inflows for the quarter, with its fast-growing exchange-traded funds comprising $34 billion of that figure.Assets under management grew by 17 percent annually and now stand at a record high of $6.3 trillion.Critics\u2019 cornerIt would seem pretty serious.\u201cWillow initially not only hated the idea but put her foot down because she thought it would be highly destructive to our family and to our lives.\u201dThe idea kept nagging at him and his wife gave her reluctant permission.\u201cThe thought I had was coming from the patriot in me, growing up at a time when we respected our politicians not only for what they stood for but because of what they accomplished. I am horrified at the state of politics in America today, and I will throw stones in multiple directions. Dialogue has given way to disdain. I, maybe a bit naively, believed that there was a need for someone in high elected office to be more open-minded and willing to not only govern from the middle but to try to shame everyone else into going to the middle.\u201dAlso from the piece, Oprah Winfrey thought he would have been the ideal candidate.\u201cBob is one of the people I respect most in the world. That\u2019s a very short list. He is infinitely capable of multiple categories of expertise, and he has created an environment where you can disagree with him\u2014and that\u2019s not just because I\u2019m Oprah. I really, really pushed him to run for president, so much so that I said to him, \u2018Gee, if you ever decide to run for office, I will go door to door carrying leaflets. I will go sit and have tea with people.\u2019\u201d\u201cBerkshire\u2019s present intention is to vote against the four directors proposed by management,\u201d Mr. Buffett\u2019s assistant, Debbie Bosanek, said in an email.Two weeks ago USG rejected Knauf\u2019s $5.9 billion, or $42-a-share, offer. The rejection came despite Berkshire, which controls more than 30 percent of USG, saying it would take Knauf\u2019s offer if the German company agreed to buy the rest of USG for at least $42 a share.Knauf had called on USG shareholders to withhold support for USG\u2019s board nominees in an effort to bring USG to the table.Shares of USG rose 2.8 percent on the news.\u201cIt is therefore ironic that the U.S. administration is waging a trade war at a time when the largest potential consumer market in the world is open for business.\u201dShe seems to be trying to dial back that threat: National Amusements, the Redstone family holding company that controls CBS and Viacom, said in a statement that it has \u201ctremendous respect\u201d for Mr. Moonves, \u201cand it has always been our intention that he run a combined company.\u201dBut in a deal process that is playing out unusually publicly, consider the gantlet thrown.Through its $100 billion Vision Fund, SoftBank has pushed into businesses as wide-ranging as augmented reality, online commerce and dog walking. But the rationale for an investment like this one appears more elusive, other than being a play for lucrative sports content.\u201cIt is safe to say it is one of the largest tax bills on earned income in history.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "After 90 Years, a Broadway Headliner Is Getting a Headstone", "Date": "2018-04-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut Ms. Bayes, a notorious diva who demanded star billing and treatment, was unceremoniously stored away in a receiving tomb where bodies are often kept while burial arrangements are made.As countless other bodies cycled through, she remained in the receiving tomb for 18 years. In 1946 she was finally buried in a Woodlawn grave, but to this day it is unmarked.After Mr. Friedland died in 1946, his second wife, Louise Clarke Friedland, bought a plot at Woodlawn so that he and his famous first wife could be buried side by side. Ms. Friedland never placed a headstone to mark the pair, and never joined them when she died in 1973. She was cremated elsewhere.Ms. Friedland never explained publicly why she had purchased a plot large enough for five coffins, just to bury those of her husband and Ms. Bayes together, with no apparent intention of being buried there herself, said Susan Olsen, the cemetery historian.\u201cWe have people buried here with ex-wives, with multiple wives,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes the placement of the remains tells the story in itself.\u201dThere was no mention of burial or funeral arrangements in Nora Bayes\u2019s will, said her youngest grandchild, Ginny Bayes, 58, of Colorado Springs.Family speculation was that it may have been Mr. Friedland\u2019s wish to be buried at the same time as Ms. Bayes, \u201callowing him to spend eternity alongside his beloved first wife,\u201d Ginny Bayes said.Ms. Friedland may have purposely left the graves unmarked because she \u201cdid not share his enthusiasm\u201d for this arrangement, Ginny Bayes said, or it simply may have been the wish of Nora Bayes, who was very private about parts of her personal life. Ultimately, Ginny Bayes said, \u201cIt was a mystery then and is still a mystery today.\u201dGinny Bayes said her father, Peter Bayes, the youngest of Ms. Bayes\u2019s three adopted children, attended the 1946 burial. But perhaps because he was so upset by his mother\u2019s death, he may never have visited the grave after that and may not have known that it remained unmarked. Ginny Bayes said the issue of the unmarked grave never came up among his six children, whom he raised in Colorado, until she realized it while doing genealogical research several years ago.Without a headstone, Ms. Bayes remained largely left off the cemetery\u2019s long lists for visitors of notables, which include Duke Ellington, Miles Davis and Irving Berlin.A group Mr. Cumella took to Woodlawn last summer was moved when he placed a Victrola beside Ms. Bayes\u2019s grave site and played \u201cTurn Off Your Light, Mr. Moon Man,\u201d which Ms. Bayes wrote with her second husband, Jack Norworth. (Mr. Norworth also wrote the lyrics to \u201cTake Me Out to the Ballgame,\u201d which was first performed by Ms. Bayes.)Prodded by Mr. Cumella\u2019s monthly emails, Woodlawn officials told him a headstone would be created. After a renewed effort, they secured permission from a relative of Ms. Friedland\u2019s, Ms. Olsen said.She noted that Woodlawn had prominent figures who spent decades in unmarked graves, including the journalist Nellie Bly and the jazz luminaries King Oliver and Sonny Greer. And many people have spent long periods in Woodlawn\u2019s receiving tombs while their monuments were constructed, including Miles Davis (nine months), the financier John Harbeck (eight years) and F. W. Woolworth (two years), according to Ms. Olsen.But, she said, Ms. Bayes is \u201cpretty much the record-holder.\u201dDuring her lifetime, Ms. Bayes had a Broadway Theater named for her on West 44th Street. She was depicted in the 1944 biographical film \u201cShine On, Harvest Moon\u201d and was played by Frances Langford in the 1942 movie about Cohan, \u201cYankee Doodle Dandy\u201d with James Cagney.Mr. Cumella called the headstone the fulfillment of a graveside promise to the spirit of Ms. Bayes last year.\u201cI communed with her for a moment and made a pledge that I would see what I could do,\u201d he said.\u201cI said, \u2018Let\u2019s just do it, because she deserves it,\u2019\u201d he added. \u201cI didn\u2019t let it go.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Royal Wedding: Frequently Asked Questions", "Date": "2018-04-06", "News": "Nope. Buckingham Palace is in London. Windsor Castle is in Windsor, a picturesque old town some 20 miles west of London. Windsor is also known for its proximity to Eton College, which is the boarding school Harry and William attended.The non-invitees were able to congregate around the town of Windsor with other eager to catch a glimpse of the couple.There were a number of predictable attendees: Harry\u2019s grandparents, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip; his father and stepmother, Prince Charles and Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall; various cousins, like Zara and Peter Phillips and Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice; and of course his brother and sister-in-law, William and Catherine, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.Then, of course, there were members of royal families from other countries. They\u2019re all on a big royal-family-wedding circuit, traveling around to one other\u2019s ceremonies. And, since this is as much public celebration as private service, guests will include representatives from British charities, churches and armed forces; government officials, past and present; and dignitaries from other countries.As for nonroyals, Harry has a posse of boisterous friends \u2014 Guy Pelly, Tom Inskip and Thomas van Straubenzee, among others.And there were celebrities: Serena Williams, Priyanka Chopra, Oprah, Victoria and David Beckham, Elton John, Amal and George Clooney and Carey Mulligan were among them.Nope!No, not even him (or Michelle). See above.All weddings are a-swirl with all manner of uninformed gossip about the guests: Who knows whom, why they are sitting in their particular spots, which ones slept with/dated/still pine for the bride or the groom. Even better, it will be a prime occasion to revisit the talk about the intrigues, allegiances and feuds within the royal family itself.The couple made it clear that they were responsible for much of the overall tone of the day. That said, the Lord Chamberlain\u2019s Office, which is the department of Buckingham Palace responsible for all public events \u2014 state visits, palace garden parties and the like \u2014 oversaw all the necessary logistical and ceremonial details. The office is comparable in many ways to that of the White House social secretary.Royal weddings usually follow a rigid script of words and rituals based on the traditional Anglican wedding ceremony prescribed in the Book of Common Prayer.They say they met in London in July 2016, on a blind date organized by a mutual friend. A few weeks later, he whisked her off to Botswana, where they \u201ccamped out with each other under the stars,\u201d Harry said afterward in an interview with the BBC (see below). They then had a few months of long-distance dating, visiting each other in Britain and in Toronto, where Meghan was filming \u201cSuits.\u201dWatch this post-engagement interview with the BBC:It was not important. For one thing, Harry is currently only sixth in line for the throne, after the birth of Kate and William\u2019s third child, Prince Louis Arthur Charles, on April 23. Barring the unlikely event that all the people ahead of him \u2014 the current monarch, Queen Elizabeth;Prince Charles;Prince William;and William\u2019s two children, Prince George andPrincess Charlotte,as well as their third child, Prince Louis\u2014 are eliminated in some sort of \u201cKind Hearts and Coronets\u201d scenario, he has no chance of ever being king. And to be honest, British monarchs have nothing like the kind of power that they used to.Because Harry, being unconstrained by the responsibilities that burden his older brother, William, has recovered from some earlier lapses in judgment to bring a delightfully racy and joyously improvisational approach to his royal life. And because Meghan is so different from most royal brides-to-be: She is American, biracial (her mother is African-American and her father is white), divorced and 36, which makes her three years older than her Harry.People of color are underrepresented in British politics and not represented at all in the royal family. Many have said they are thrilled to see someone like themselves in Meghan\u2019s position.By all accounts, the soon-to-be sisters-in-law get along just fine. They\u2019re neighbors at Kensington Palace and have appeared happily together on several occasions since Meghan and Harry\u2019s engagement was announced.Meghan did not have a maid of honor, because she is simply too popular and all her friends love her: \u201cShe has a very close-knit circle of friends and she didn\u2019t want to choose one over another,\u201d said the spokesman. When the Duchess of Cambridge had her younger sister Pippa Middleton as her maid of honor, that was more of an exception than a rule. Royal weddings rarely feature adult female bridesmaids.Born and raised in Los Angeles, Meghan is a true California girl.British weddings usually feature fruitcakes.The displays will use flowers and foliage taken from the gardens of the royal palaces and Windsor Great Park, and reflect the wild and natural landscapes from which many of the plants will be picked from, and Ms. Craddock will work alongside a team of florists from St. George\u2019s Chapel and Buckingham Palace.\u201cWorking with them has been an absolute pleasure,\u201d Ms. Craddock said of the royal couple, calling the creative process, \u201chighly collaborative, free-flowing, creative and fun.\u201dThe presence of peonies was no major surprise: Meghan has previously said on social media that peonies make her \u201cendlessly happy.\u201d White roses meanwhile, were a favorite flower of Princess Diana.A Christian gospel group, the Kingdom Choir, was also at the ceremony and sang a rousing version of \u201cStand by Me.\u201dThe Royal Family pays for the wedding itself \u2014 the service, the flowers, the music and the reception. The bride typically pays for her dress. The British public pays for security.If you have to ask, you can\u2019t afford one.It reportedly cost $34 million, of which went to security \u2014 and was paid for by the British taxpayers. This amount is equal to:Meghan was already a Protestant, so it was not a huge stretch.In many ways, young royals are just like us: they drive cars, go to supermarkets, drop kids off at school and work out at the gym. But while some have day jobs \u2014 Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, for instance \u2014 it\u2019s unlikely that Meghan will take on a 9-to-5 job after her marriage. There will be numerous public engagements to attend (exactly what kind will be clearer once she has outlined the causes and charities she plans to support), and you can expect a royal tour abroad with her new husband in the first year or two. Got to keep the fans happy, after all.For one, she\u2019ll have to get used to sitting in royal ranking order. At events attended by a large number of royal persons, members must enter in reverse order of who\u2019s next in line to the throne, from most junior to most senior, with the queen last of all. Partners stay together, so Meghan and Harry will enter first, followed by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge (William and Kate), the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall (Prince Charles and Camilla), and lastly Queen Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh (Prince Philip). Her Majesty will then be seated in the middle, with the family ordered around her.We may never know.Here\u2019s Meghan and Harry\u2019s list:If you\u2019d told King Henry VIII that one day the sixth in line to the British throne would be marrying a star of USA Network\u2019s \u201cSuits,\u201d he probably would have had questions: Does this mean England and Scotland have been united into a single state? What does \u201cUSA\u201d stand for? How are you using \u201cstar\u201d in that sentence? But he certainly would not have asked about her public social media profiles. All of which is to say, anything is possible.While some American airline companies now offer Wi-Fi on select transatlantic routes, British Airways has yet to jump on that bandwagon. So you may miss out on the first hourish of the wedding, unless you catch a favorable tailwind. (And, besides, the onboard reception can be seriously patchy at the best of times.) But fear not: There are sure to be endless televised reruns of key moments in the hours and weeks following the big day.Unlike the wedding ceremony, the receptions (one thrown by the queen, the other by Prince Charles) will not be televised, leaving the public to conjecture about the colors and shades of various items present.He is 6-foot-1, or 1.86 meters tall. (William is a little over 6-foot-2, or 1.91 meters.)Click on the questions, Karen!Depends on what you consider fun, really. The wedding service lasted an hour and wasn\u2019t a barrel of laughs. Officially, however, the royal family enjoys fun. A statement about the wedding from a royal secretary said that \u201cthe crowds that have turned out in Nottingham, Cardiff, Brixton, Edinburgh, Birmingham, Belfast, Bath and elsewhere have given Ms. Markle a welcome to the United Kingdom marked by warmth, enthusiasm and a real sense of fun.\u201d Sounds fun!No. They started arriving around 11:20 a.m. William and Harry arrived together by foot. Protocol dictates that the queen be the last member of the royal family to arrive, and she was.Had it rained, the couple would have taken the Scottish State Coach, which is enclosed by glass windows.Milford Haven, Sir Basil, Storm and Tyrone.It is true that divorce was once a deal-breaker for royal marriages (leaving aside Henry VIII). There\u2019s no law against it, but as the head of the Church of England, a British monarch is expected to set, and enforce, high moral standards. The allergy to divorce lasted until fairly recently, thwarting the hopes and dreams not just of Edward VIII, but also of Princess Margaret, the queen\u2019s late sister, who in 1955 was given the unsavory choice of giving up either her royal title and privileges, or the divorced man she loved. (She kept the privileges, gave up the divorced man, married someone else, and ended up divorcing him, anyway.) But no matter how upset Queen Elizabeth might be by divorce, she can\u2019t escape the fact that three of her four children \u2014 Prince Charles, Prince Andrew and Princess Anne \u2014 all divorced their spouses. So this one falls into the \"times have changed, and we have changed with them,\" category.If there is one, you can be sure they won't release the details publicly! That said, neither Prince Charles nor Prince William had prenuptial agreements, and there are no examples of prenuptial agreements elsewhere in the British royal family. Chances are Harry won\u2019t stray from that precedent. In fact, instances of royal families signing prenups remain relatively few and far between. One came in 2010, when Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden married her former fitness instructor, Daniel Westling.

{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Privacy Changes Leave Developers Steaming", "Date": "2018-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For years, Cubeyou made a business out of personal data on Facebook. The company had unfettered access to Facebook users\u2019 information, which it gathered up through quizzes and later sold as reports to clients.Federico Treu, Cubeyou\u2019s chief executive, told The New York Times that his company had done nothing wrong, and that it had followed Facebook\u2019s rules in disclosing that it was using profile data for both academic and business purposes. He said Cubeyou was just collateral damage as Facebook has overzealously scrambled to show that it cares about data privacy.\u201cFacebook threw us under the bus,\u201d said Mr. Treu, who added that he intended to boycott a Facebook event for developers this week. \u201cFacebook became what it was because of us developers. Now they want to blame us for everything that has happened to them.\u201dSome, like Cubeyou, said they have been unfairly blocked from accessing Facebook users. Tinder, the dating app, discovered that its users were no longer able to log into the app using their Facebook accounts. Pod, a calendar syncing app, found that its users could no longer see Facebook events within their calendars. And Job Fusion, a jobs app that allowed users to see where their Facebook friends worked, announced that it was not longer able to offer its services within Facebook.Facebook said it expected roughly 5,000 people \u2014 a record high \u2014 to be at the developer conference, which is known as F8. But the company also said it has tweaked the event with an eye toward data privacy. For example, the social network canceled the announcement of a Facebook smart home speaker to challenge Amazon\u2019s Echo and Google\u2019s Home amid worries that the device would raise more questions about the amount of data the company collects.Ime Archibong, Facebook\u2019s vice president of product partnerships, said developers are \u201cincredible partners\u201d for the company, but also added that it must \u201cstrike the right balance between creating compelling social experiences, protecting people\u2019s data, and supporting an innovative developer ecosystem.\"Bhaskar Chakravorti, senior associate dean at The Fletcher School at Tufts University, said Facebook had to walk a fine line. \u201cThey have taken a blunt instrument approach, which is the right thing to do from a public relations standpoint,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now they need to reach out to developers and smooth things over.\u201dFacebook announced a series of privacy changes in early April. Under the new measures, developers can only see a Facebook user\u2019s name, profile photo and email address; previously, the could see more information, like users\u2019 Facebook posts. Facebook is also cutting off developers\u2019 access to user accounts if someone has not used their apps for three months or longer. That policy is intended to prevent developers from collecting information in the background for months or years after people stop using their apps.Facebook also announced that it was investigating apps that had gained access to large amounts of its data in the past, and said it was conducting an audit of any company that it believed has shown suspicious activity.Cubeyou got caught up in the dragnet in early April. At the time, CNBC reported that the company, which is based in Redwood City, Calif., had collected users\u2019 Facebook information for academic purposes and then sold the data to commercial firms without informing users. Facebook said it was conducting an audit of Cubeyou to determine if there was any wrongdoing.Mr. Treu said Cubeyou fully complies with Facebook\u2019s requirements of disclosing the data it collects and what that data is used for. He added that Cubeyou strips out any personally identifiable information that it gets from Facebook. Cubeyou is simply being singled out as part of \u201ca witch hunt\u201d by Facebook, he said.\u201cWe did everything by the rules, and we are ready to prove that,\u201d said Mr. Treu, who said his company has repeatedly reached out to Facebook to talk. \u201cThere is no way to talk to them, to find out anything.\u201dAn earlier version of this story misstated the given name of CubeYou\u2019s chief executive. He is Federico Treu, not Frederico.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Highlights From Zuckerberg\u2019s Day 2 Testimony: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Wednesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Mark Zuckerberg is back on Capitol Hill.\u2022 Why would a trade war with China be good for the United States economy?\u2022 Has Facebook opened itself up to regulation?\u2022 Bank of America\u2019s move on gun sales.\u2022 Why did the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of N.Y. recuse himself from the Michael Cohen raid?Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s second day of Congressional grilling lifted its shares again.The stock rose 0.8 percent, even as the broader market dropped 0.6 percent.While it remains to be seen whether Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s performance will keep regulations at bay, his testimony was certainly a tonic for investors. Facebook\u2019s two-day rise of more than 5 percent added over $24 billion to its market capitalization, according to Bloomberg data.\u201cZuckerberg appears willing to work with lawmakers on possible regulations, which may create a barrier to entry in the social network space and help Facebook maintain its market leadership.\u201d\u2014 Matt PhillipsMark Zuckerberg is back on Capitol Hill for a second day of congressional testimony.Here are some highlights :\u2022 Representative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon and chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee, kicked off the hearing by declaring that \u201cwhile Facebook has certainly grown, I worry it has not matured.\u201d Mr. Walden floated the prospect of regulation, saying that \u201cI think it is time to ask whether Facebook may have moved too fast and broken too many things.\u201d\u2022 Mr. Walden also asked: \u201cWhat exactly is Facebook?\u201d The definitions matter. If Facebook is viewed as a telecommunications service that is more like a utility, it may be regulated by the Federal Communications Commission. If lawmakers define Facebook as a publisher, it could also fall under regulations at that agency. \u201cI consider us to be a technology company,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg answered. \u201cThe primary thing we do is have engineers that write code and build services for other people.\u201d\u2022 Representative Frank Pallone, a New Jersey Democrat, pressed Mr. Zuckerberg on whether Facebook would agree or refuse to change Facebook\u2019s default settings to minimize collection and use of users\u2019 data. \u201cThis is a complex issue that deserves more than a one-word answer,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg answered. \u201cThat\u2019s disappointing to me,\u201d Mr. Pallone responded.\u2022 California Democrat Anna Eshoo put it more bluntly, asking Mr. Zuckerberg: \u201cAre you willing to change your business model to protect users\u2019 privacy?\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg was noncommittal, saying: \u201cCongresswoman, I\u2019m not sure what that means.\u201d\u2022 Representative Joe Barton, Republican of Texas, pressed Mr. Zuckerberg on why Facebook has been allegedly censoring content from conservative organizations and Trump supporters such as Diamond and Silk. Mr. Barton also asked Mr. Zuckerberg if he would agree that Facebook would work to ensure it is \u201ca neutral public platform.\u201d \u201cI do agree that we should give people a voice,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.\u2022 Rep. Gene Green, a Texas Democrat, and Jan Schakowsky, an Illinois Democrat, pressed Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s promise to give users worldwide the same privacy controls required by a tough new data protection law which will go into effect in the European Union next month. Mr. Green also asked Mr. Zuckerberg if Facebook planned to comply with the provision in the European law that allows individuals to obtain a copy of the data companies hold about them.\u2022 A number of lawmakers have tried to draw a comparison between the Obama campaign\u2019s use of a Facebook app to scrape data from users and their friends in 2012 and Cambridge Analytica. Those lawmakers have failed to mention one very important distinction between the Obama campaign\u2019s app and Cambridge Analytica\u2019s app: The Obama app was actually on Facebook itself, and it was very clear about who and what the data would be used for. The app used to scrape data for Cambridge Analytica was accessed through a personality questionnaire hosted on a site outside of Facebook, and it appeared to users to be for academic research, not for a political data company owned by a wealthy Republican donor and dedicated to reshaping the American electorate.Mr. Musk told co-host Gayle King:\u201cI think whenever something is \u2013 whenever there\u2019s something that affects the public good then there does need to be some form of public oversight. \u2026 I do think there should be some regulations on AI. I think there should be regulations on social media to the degree that it negatively affects the public good. We can\u2019t have like willy-nilly proliferation of fake news, that\u2019s crazy. You can\u2019t have more types of fake news than real news. That\u2019s allowing public deception to go unchecked. That\u2019s crazy.\u201dAndrew writes: These were the most important words from Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s five-hour testimony: \u201cI agree we are responsible for the content.\u201d They may come back to haunt him, given his previous rejection of calling Facebook a publisher. He later backtracked and called his business a tech company, but his acknowledgment may fundamentally shift the conversation \u2014 and how the company operates. (All in all, Mr. Zuckerberg did better than anyone had expected.)Lawmakers now seem much more aware of how much power large technology companies have. This was encapsulated in questions posed by Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina. He framed Facebook as a monopoly and brought up the possibility of regulating Facebook, asking Mr. Zuckerberg: \u201cBut you as a company welcome regulation?\u201dAnd Facebook may now only be one big scandal away from a more stringent government response.Critics\u2019 corner\u201cUnder a symbiotic U.S.-China relationship, America became a preeminent technology leader, and its brands are today the envy of the world. China improved the standard of living of its citizens with a tenfold increase in per capita gross domestic product over the past 20 years.\u201dBut that relationship will change over the next two decades, Mr. Ma said:\u201cChina is shifting its economy from the world\u2019s largest exporter to the world\u2019s largest consumer. Chinese citizens now have the wealth and income to pursue discretionary spending. They want to buy high-quality imported food, cosmetics, fashions and health and wellness products for themselves and their children.\u201dMr. Ma goes on to write:\u201cIt is therefore ironic that the U.S. administration is waging a trade war at a time when the largest potential consumer market in the world is open for business. Is America going to forfeit this opportunity?Instigating a trade war is the wrong solution because it will only provoke retaliation. The Chinese government responded to U.S. tariff threats with its own tariffs on American agricultural products, such as soybeans. China is the largest export market for American soybeans, worth $14 billion annually and accounting for 65 percent of all U.S. soybean exports.The U.S. has been a consistent defender of free and open markets, but this time it is resorting to protectionism that will not improve American competitiveness. Any country seeking to increase exports would do better to focus on developing good products and channels to access foreign markets rather than putting up trade barriers.\u201dShari Redstone, whose National Amusements controls CBS and Viacom, is seeking to combine the two media companies.From Reuters:\u201cHer longtime friend and business ally, powerful CBS Chief Executive Les Moonves, has emerged as one of the biggest obstacles to a potential CBS-Viacom tie-up, according to people familiar with the matter. Concerns are that his objections could either doom the transaction or that he might not lead the new entity, the people said.\u201cMoonves is chafing at Redstone\u2019s insistence on installing Viacom\u2019s CEO as his second-in-command and likely successor of a merged company, the people say.\u201dBank of America works with \u201cjust a handful\u201d of such manufacturers, according to its vice chairwoman Anne Finucane. Their reactions? \u201cMixed,\u201d she said.It\u2019s not exactly a surprise. SoftBank\u2019s Masa Son bought control of Sprint planning to merge it with T-Mobile, the better to fight Verizon and AT&T. And most analysts agree that both companies need to become bigger to survive.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gender and #MeToo in Australia: Where Do We Begin?", "Date": "2018-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter 53______This back and forth is vital. It\u2019s what journalism in a networked world can and should look like.Also, just to explain how I pick which emails to include in these roundups \u2014 I generally look for trends in the feedback, ideas or thoughts contributed by more than one reader.In this case, many of you wrote about how \u201cgendered\u201d Australia is, splitting off men and women from a young age, which is why I\u2019ve included more than one comment about that.I also look for a mix of perspectives and backgrounds, and I try to mix up the tone in a way that reflects the mood and range of reader feedback.Sometimes I lightly edit for space or clarity; there\u2019s never enough room for everyone\u2019s comments (sorry about that). But generally, my goal is to give you back a curated and interesting version of what you, as a group, gave us.Think of it as a thoughtful conversation in your inbox \u2014 because that\u2019s what this newsletter aims to be.The more this Letter grows, the more the conversation will deepen.Now for your answers to our questions about #MeToo in Australia, gender and where it\u2019s heading next, followed by stories of the week, and a call from our food critic for restaurant recommendations in Perth.You mention the defamation laws, which is one reason why, but I also believe it\u2019s because we don\u2019t have a strong female leader advocating for women\u2019s rights. Don\u2019t get me wrong, there are some excellent investigative journalists exposing serious issues (Tracey Spicer, Kate McClymont etc.), but we don\u2019t have a Rose McGowan or Ashley Judd \u2014 someone who is willing to speak out not just about their own experience but about the broader discrimination and harassment issues facing women.As a result the #MeToo movement relies on investigative media stories for attention and when the news moves on, #MeToo gets left behind.I think the other constraining factor is a cultural one. Many Australians like to say \u2018we\u2019re nothing like the U.S.\u2019 For example we\u2019re not (or at least we think we aren\u2019t) as litigious, we don\u2019t love guns and our politics isn\u2019t as brash or cultlike (I\u2019m thinking of all the clapping when a politician gives a speech).This gives Australians an excuse to say #MeToo is really an issue for Americans, not us. I don\u2019t believe this, but it\u2019s a belief that sits below the surface for many. A local leader of the movement could address this.Gender progress here is the same as everywhere else. The #MeToo movement has brought to light the unacceptable and appalling behavior of many men. However, this reflects only what\u2019s above the surface. It\u2019s what\u2019s below the surface that needs to be addressed if we want real, long-lasting change.And what sits below the surface is the gendered way we treat girls (and boys) from the day they are born. We accept and excuse certain behaviors for boys (I\u2019m thinking of boisterous loud and aggressive behaviors).If as a society we can look at a behavior and say it is acceptable or not, and take the gendered bias away, then we would have a fairer world. Girls and boys will grow up expecting the same behavior from each other, and call each other out when they don\u2019t.Alas, I have grown up in a world that hasn\u2019t done this, and I see my 6-year-old daughter facing the same bias.\u2014 Pip NagyIf the world thinks of us as a particularly macho country, it\u2019s the inertia of our popular cultural image. It\u2019s a \u2018Crocodile Dundee\u2019 vision of Australia as rough-speaking, rugged, rural and masculine. But Australia is changed and changing, shedding its caricatures.Today, more than a third of Australians were born overseas. Two-thirds of us live in capital cities and women outnumber men in all but one of them. Not to mention Paul Hogan hasn\u2019t lived in Australia since last century.There will always be Australians who maintain and proclaim our so-called macho image. However for many, and for the majority of younger people, this image is an anachronism. Gender progress reflects this change, demonstrated in the #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up conversations flourishing in Twitter feeds and public spaces.The global wave of accountability has had an impact beyond public panels and television specials.If the ripples in Australia have not matched the tidal wave seen in the States, it may only be a matter of time until a critical mass of Australian voices joins the global conversation. For the moment, whether our hopes are too high or expectations too low depends on who is being asked the question.\u2014 Jill MastersWhat Francesca observed is the two Australias.We got right on board with #MeToo. We were primed to do so by a strong debate around domestic violence that had been riding high since Rosie Batty was Australian of the Year. In a way, our shift in psyche was not as severe as it was in other countries.Smaller towns in the area like Inverell have domestic violence and sexual/indecent assault rates as much as two and half times the state average. There are few local supports for domestic violence and sexual assault victims. The communities are so small and social pressure so high that most crimes of this nature remain unreported.In the city, and even larger coastal towns, there is a refusal to accept such behavior; support services are provided; and #MeToo resonated strongly. #MeToo was heard in places like New England, but they didn\u2019t join in \u2014 to do so would have meant social death.With such small populations, spread out over such vast land spaces, you need your neighbors, you tolerate abuse, and you don\u2019t speak out about such troubles. You keep the peace so you can stay living in your town \u2014 the next town might be two or three hours\u2019 drive away, not 10 minutes, and there\u2019s certainly little to no public transport to get you out of town if you needed it.Given that, you won\u2019t be surprised to learn that more young women than young men leave their rural communities and do not return.\u2014 Raphaella Kathryn CrosbyThe change in the role of women due to second-wave feminism in the 1960s is the key cause of Australia\u2019s negative birthrate and the aging of the population. On this basis feminism is biologically dysfunctional whilst patriarchality is biologically functional. Therefore the promotion of feminist sexual equality in politics, business and society in Australia is not the way for the greatest number of young women to find happiness in marriage and children or in the best interests of Australia.So how do we change our currently biologically dysfunctional culture to one in which the maximum number of young women can find happiness in marriage and children and restore a positive birthrate? I don\u2019t know the answer, but if there is one, I suspect it will come from women, not men \u2014 and from women born in the 21st century.In the interim, helping Australians understand the negative impacts of feminism and not supporting or promoting it further would seem a prudent course.When a society uses its young women for wealth creation, rather than procreation, it eats the seed corn of its future. As a result of feminism women are no longer pregnant and barefoot in the kitchen but now are increasingly well heeled and childless in the boardroom.\u2014 Paul McFadyenI am a junior in college in the U.S. and am currently studying in Australia for the semester, in Brisbane.Before I left, I was under the impression that the cultural norms of gender would be similar to what I had experienced in the U.S. \u2014 not perfect but actively seeking ways to improve itself for the most part, or at least in my opinion. News such as the legalization of gay marriage and the extent of the #MeToo movement here along with other stories you had mentioned convinced me of this.But the first thing I noticed when I got here was how gendered everything was. The floors of my dorm were gendered, my orientation week consistently paired people only in opposite genders, the police officer who came in to talk about sexual assault proposed that the girls play up their feminine stereotypes to trick the assumed sex-obsessed males in order to prevent rape. In my residential college of over three hundred people, I can only name one person who is openly gay.During dinner, one of the freshmen asked me if it was true \u201cif the United States really had people who didn\u2019t believe in male or female, and called themselves they instead\u201d as the rest of the table snickered.In general, I find that the men are overwhelmingly masculine and the women are overwhelmingly feminine in a polarizing sort of way. This is all while I take classes at the university in anthropology in which we talk openly about the same topics in gender and sexuality as I did in those classes back home.To summarize, I have found through living here that the external culture and internal culture of gender and sexuality have not quite aligned in the way I had assumed. This might just be the demographic I am most exposed to, or the city I am living in, but it truly has been quite surprising.\u2014 Ann Bisognano______Federal investigators in the United States raided the office of President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer this week. You probably already knew that.It\u2019s the best bit of explanatory context you\u2019ll find anywhere.______If this doesn\u2019t answer every question you have about the Meghan-Harry nuptials, well, that\u2019s on you.

Or Is She Fake News?", "Date": "2018-04-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was another terrible day for Facebook and the company had dispatched Campbell Brown, its head of news partnerships, to do some damage control.\u201cIf it were me, I would have probably not threatened to sue The Guardian,\u201d Ms. Brown said, with a Southern lilt in her voice and the easy charm of a onetime broadcast anchor. \u201cProbably not our wisest move.\u201d\u201cIs she on her way out?\u201d Emily Bell, a professor at Columbia Journalism School who had been on stage with Ms. Brown, wondered later. \u201cShe is one of the few people from Facebook who will voice what sounds like disappointment.\u201dMs. Brown, 49, wasn\u2019t out at Facebook. Yet she has long had to grapple with questions about whether she really has influence at the social network.Since joining the Silicon Valley company in 2017 to repair its frayed relationship with the news media, many have considered the former CNN and NBC anchor as little more than window dressing. Others see her as a more insidious figure \u2014 a telegenic personality with close ties to conservative figures who can offer Facebook\u2019s outreach the veneer of journalistic credibility. To them, she is an ambassador from a dictatorship, willing to deliver bad news with a smile and some canap\u00e9s. No matter their view of her, almost all question what influence she has at a company where the chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has viewed news \u2014 both making it and displaying it \u2014 as a headache.Facebook \u2014 with its reach of more than 2.2 billion users \u2014 already holds enormous power over the news that people consume. But now it is making its first venture into licensed news content. Facebook has set aside a $90 million budget to have partners develop original news programming, and Ms. Brown is pitching publishers on making Facebook-specific news shows featuring mainstream anchors, according to two people involved in or briefed on the matter, who asked not to be identified because the details were confidential.Ms. Brown is also pushing paywalls for publishers on the social network, another first for a company that has long avoided circulating any content that users would have to pay for.Ms. Brown declined to speak on the record but some Facebook colleagues spoke about how she has navigated the relationships with the news media and inside the company, even as the social network\u2019s own rapport with journalism remains uneasy.\u201cCampbell leads a critical piece of our business,\u201d said Dan Rose, Facebook\u2019s vice president for partnerships. \u201cShe\u2019s been incredibly effective, and she\u2019s just getting started.\u201dMs. Brown was born into a tight-knit Catholic family in 1968 in Ferriday, La., population about 5,000. Her father, a local politician and state insurance commissioner, once served a prison stint for lying to the F.B.I. during an investigation related to an insurance company.In her youth, Ms. Brown was kicked out of an all-girls boarding school for sneaking off campus to a party. She spent two years at Louisiana State University before attending Regis University, a small Jesuit school in Denver. Afterward, she moved to then-Czechoslovakia for two years to teach English before returning to the United States and beginning a television news career, going from a local station in Topeka, Kan., to Richmond, Va., then Baltimore.Her approach on camera was confrontational, yet likable. In 1996, she got a call from NBC News.Some said her behavior now, seemingly throwing Facebook\u2019s strategy of silence under the bus, mirrors that letter.But after leaving CNN, Ms. Brown did shed her journalistic skin, and turned herself into a political animal.\u201cShe was a celebrity in ed reform,\u201d said Eva Moskowitz, the founder and chief executive of the Success Academy Charter Schools, where Ms. Brown is a board member. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t have people of her prominence before.\u201dBy then, Facebook was in crisis mode over how it handled news.Many in the news business were immediately skeptical about what Ms. Brown might do.\u201cIf you wanted to deeply understand American journalists, having a TV personality is not really the first place you would go,\u201d said Tom Rosenstiel, executive director of the American Press Institute, a nonprofit that supports news media with research and training.At Facebook, Ms. Brown became part of an informal cadre on the company\u2019s business side known as the FOSSes, or \u201cFriends of Sheryl Sandberg.\u201d But close association with a powerful figure within the company does not assure her of success.When it comes to decisions related to publishers, the power at Facebook has traditionally been more with the product staff, who tend to be aligned more with Mr. Zuckerberg and cloistered from meetings with partners, according to several media executives. Google, in contrast, has a similar power dynamic but, publishers said, a more robust partnership structure and easier contact with product teams.\u201cShe\u2019s smart, but we\u2019re different beasts,\u201d Richard Gingras, the vice president for news at Google, said of Ms. Brown. \u201cI\u2019m in a fortunate position where I\u2019m involved with the product. I can make change. I feel for her, I really do.\u201dWhile Ms. Brown has helped Facebook mount its charm offensives at industry events, her efforts to remake Facebook\u2019s relationships with publishers has meant cutting back her visibility to the broader public.\u201cThere was a time you couldn\u2019t turn on a T.V. and not see Campbell Brown,\u201d said Ben Winkler, chief investment officer for OMD, a global media agency. \u201cSince she went to Facebook, Campbell Brown is where?\u201dThe answer, it turns out, was close to home. Editors talk about Facebook as an authoritarian regime or perhaps an ideological cult, and they call Ms. Brown its emissary to the city.At these events, attendees are met with wine and hors d\u2019oeuvres (seared tuna, and a cheese and cracker buffet). Guests describe Ms. Brown as \u201ca hoot\u201d with a sharp humor. When she calls the party to order, the group sits around her living room on leather cowhide seats and polished wooden stumps.Ms. Brown typically has a guest of honor from Facebook, such as the chief product officer Chris Cox, and allows questions. If she deems a question too challenging for the guest, she pushes back against the inquisitor \u2014 her go-to is some form of the retort, \u201cReally?\u201dThe gatherings are frequently a who\u2019s who of the news media, mixing long-established outlets with digitally focused newcomers. The guest lists have included Ben Smith, the BuzzFeed editor in chief; David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker; Nick Thompson, the editor of Wired; and the Vox publisher Melissa Bell. One editor, who asked not to be identified because these gatherings are off the record, said he felt \u201chumiliated\u201d afterward, having been reminded that the power of traditional publishers is waning.The gatherings are the first outreach Facebook has made to the New York media world \u2014 a world that is increasingly beholden to the company\u2019s power.\u201cI know a lot of publishers there, they have to manage good relationships in order to survive, let alone thrive,\u201d said Jason Kint, chief executive of Digital Content Next, a trade association serving digital content companies. \u201cIt\u2019s not getting better.\u201dSome said Ms. Brown has had more influence on Facebook than they expected, citing the introduction of paywalls and the prospect of the company paying for content.\u201cI think she\u2019s been a stronger figure in that role than any platform has ever had,\u201d Mr. Smith said.As much as those soirees may include needling from her, Ms. Brown\u2019s daytime summits with publishers tend to be more overtly contentious. At one recent meeting, two publishers complained about having lost a lot of online traffic after changes to Facebook\u2019s News Feed. According to one publisher who was present, Ms. Brown told them the company would give them more traffic if they stopped doing clickbait.Still, the media industry has been so beaten down by Facebook that some said they were happy to just have someone in the company who talks to them.\u201cWe see some small movement in the right direction in terms of at least improving transparency,\u201d said Jim Bankoff, chief executive of Vox Media. There had not been \u201creal movement in terms of providing better business opportunity,\u201d he added. \u201cBut at least we\u2019re being listened to.\u201dMs. Brown recently helped arrange a meeting between Mr. Zuckerberg and several members of The Washington Post management team: Martin Baron, the editor; Fred Ryan, the chief executive; and Shailesh Prakash, the chief product officer. The group discussed whether a Facebook user should hit a paywall on Post content after clicking on three, five or 10 articles. Mr. Zuckerberg said 10, but The Post executives wanted a paywall to start after 3 articles, according to a person who was in the meeting.Ms. Brown went for the middle ground, pushing Mr. Zuckerberg to give The Post a test run of paywalls that kick in after three and five Post articles are read. She won. Since March 1, The Post has been doing just that, according to Mr. Prakash.\u201cShe\u2019s helped us,\u201d Mr. Prakash said.But Ms. Brown\u2019s biggest project is developing a news apparatus within Facebook\u2019s premium video section, called Watch.She is negotiating with BuzzFeed, Vox, CNN, Fox News and others to partner on creating about a half-dozen Facebook-exclusive shows, which will launch in May and June.Building off these shows, Ms. Brown is pushing to create a curated breaking news destination and envisions a cohesive daily Facebook newscast using partner content highlights \u2014 paid for by Facebook, made by media partners, and edited by a growing editorial team, according to a person familiar with her thinking.Discussing Facebook\u2019s reticence to put paywalls in and engage with publishers transparently, Ms. Brown said at the February media and tech conference that it had taken too long for the social network to come around to a workable news strategy.\u201cI\u2019m having a hard time with patience right now,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I know publishers are too.\u201dAn earlier version of this article erroneously included a reference to Palestinian actions as an example of the sort of far-right conspiracy stories that have plagued Facebook. In fact, Palestinian officials have acknowledged providing payments to the families of Palestinians killed while carrying out attacks on Israelis or convicted of terrorist acts and imprisoned in Israel; that is not a conspiracy theory.Advertisement"}

We tried.For 36 hours last week I lived on Bitcoin alone. Surviving on the cryptocurrency, even in one of the world\u2019s financial capitals, wasn\u2019t easy. It required long subway rides to far-flung vendors where I was often the first Bitcoin-paying customer.Coinbase also canceled my first attempt to buy the volatile currency because the price had fluctuated in the 10 seconds or so it took me to check out.I went to bed and woke up with Bitcoin worth $50.14 in my digital wallet and a list of things to accomplish: grocery shop, do laundry, buy socks, work out and get a haircut.But first, I needed coffee.After pulling a shot of cold brew for 0.00014486 BTC, or $1, the barista called up a QR code on an iPad. I scanned it with an app on my phone, but it didn\u2019t work. He began coaching me like a child patiently setting up Grandpa\u2019s Facebook account, and then gave up.But eventually I figured it out, the payment went through and I became his third Bitcoin-paying customer of the day.Paying with cryptocurrency was like that: exciting, fraught and never the same twice.And like an obsessive day trader, I would check my digital wallet and watch as the value went up and down by a few cents every few minutes.It was fun, until I got hungry.Circa 2013, he said, he\u2019d process dozens of Bitcoin purchases a week, but as the currency became more valuable and volatile, that\u2019s dropped to zero. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to part with their Bitcoin,\u201d he said.I couldn\u2019t find anyone to sell me less than $200 worth of socks or a gym that accepted Bitcoin. By the time lunch rolled around on Day 2, I was ready to throw in the towel.Here\u2019s what else is happening:We\u2019d pay a pretty penny for better weather.We could see two inches of rain, and thunder may rumble through the morning.They were the only survivors of the Titanic, which had sunk on April 15, claiming over 1,500 lives.The Titanic left its mark on other places in the city as well.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Craft Distillers, Facing Lower Taxes, Invest in Themselves", "Date": "2018-04-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySmall craft distillers across the country have been on a spending spree since the turn of the new year.The reason for all the spending isn\u2019t a sales spurt or newly opened markets. It\u2019s the Craft Beverage Modernization and Tax Reform Act, an amendment that quietly found its way into the omnibus tax bill that President Trump signed into law in December. The measure lowers the federal excise tax that producers pay to $2.70 per proof gallon (a gallon of spirits that is 50 percent alcohol), from $13.50, for the first 100,000 gallons of distilled spirits produced or imported annually.That\u2019s a reduction of 80 percent. \u201cIt\u2019s a windfall for every single distiller,\u201d said Lance Winters, master distiller of St. George Spirits.But the tax cut is having its biggest impact with small craft distillers, most of which turn out less than 100,000 gallons a year and struggle to compete with larger companies. And it is evidence of their growing political clout as distilling becomes a significant source of jobs and tax revenue in every state.The backing for the move attested to that geographical and political reach. By the time the amendment \u2014 introduced by a bipartisan group of lawmakers from Minnesota, Missouri, Oregon and Wisconsin \u2014 was adopted in a final version by Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, it had collected 304 co-sponsors in the House and 56 in the Senate.The victory was not achieved without a great deal of legwork. Dozens of distillers joined in a multiyear effort to win over Congress members to the idea. The Distilled Spirits Council estimated it organized thousands of visits to the Hill.\u201cWe encouraged our members small and large to invite their local officials at all levels of government to take a tour,\u201d Mr. Coleman said. \u201cMany have done so, in the process learning about how spirits are made, how they fit into the agricultural economy.\u201dIn two visits to Washington, Christian Krogstad, the founder of House Spirits, spoke with several lawmakers during appointments and what he called \u201cdrop-ins.\u201d\u201cI was surprised by how accessible senators and congressmen are,\u201d he said.The bill brings federal taxes on spirits into line with those for the wine and beer businesses, which won similar reductions. To achieve that, the three industries \u2014 normally rivals \u2014 combined their lobbying forces.\u201cThis was an unprecedented collaboration by spirits, wine and beer producers,\u201d said Mark Gorman, a senior vice president of the Distilled Spirits Council.Allen Katz, a founder, wanted to get Perry\u2019s Tot, its \u201cNavy strength\u201d gin, into more bars and consumers\u2019 homes. The tax cut allowed him to reduce the wholesale price, per bottle, to $18 from $29. With by-the-case discounts, the wholesale price drops further, to $14, and some merchants have cut retail prices to as low as $23.\u201cI would say the reaction from our industry peers has been jaw-dropping,\u201d Mr. Katz said. \u201c \u2018You\u2019re offering it at what price?\u2019 \u201d In March, sales of Perry\u2019s Tot doubled. (The company has also hired its first full-time salesman.)The excise-tax break for spirits is set to expire after two years. Because it may not be renewed, few distillers have gone so far as to lower prices. \u201cI think that\u2019s reckless,\u201d Mr. Winters said. \u201cIf the tax break goes away, than the price break goes away.\u201dMr. Katz doesn\u2019t see it that way. \u201cThe driving force will be increased sales,\u201d he said, \u201cand from that revenue, we will further invest in equipment and other aspects in our business.\u201dThere is a chance, however, that the break will be made permanent. In May, the lobbying campaign will begin anew, with distillers flooding Capitol Hill once more.\u201cWe\u2019re going to go to D.C. to show them all the good stuff we\u2019re doing,\u201d said Paul Hletko, the founder of Few Spirits.Advertisement"}

I also joined a 5-kilometer night run in full abaya with Riyadh Urban Runners, the city\u2019s first female running club, to encouraging cheers from passers-by. I visited Sama\u2019s Creative Hub, an art gallery and store focused on drawing together local creatives via art and design lessons and Saudi artist exhibitions. And I ate a traditional Saudi meal of jeerish and saleeg, best described as variations on savory rice pudding, with pickled lemons and slow-cooked meats, as part of a mixed-gender lunch on Al Bujairi Square with Prince Saud bin Sultan, who spoke with hopeful enthusiasm on the impending issue of tourist visas, a step that might finally open up a country whose borders have long been impenetrable to much of the outside world.\u201cThere is so much to see in Saudi Arabia, so much to explore, but few foreigners have been able to visit here beyond Muslims headed to Mecca on pilgrimage. Now we want this to change \u2014 and slowly, we are making sure that it does,\u201d he said.Most people I spoke to were cautiously optimistic about the transformation. And while some were critical of the government at times, there was a deep pride in being Saudi, as well as frustrations over misconceptions about their lives as perpetrated by foreign news media. \u201cYou focus on the bad, but there is also things that are good,\u201d said one woman who had studied in the United States. \u201cTry also here to see that we aren\u2019t as behind as newspapers like it to look.\u201dCertainly in Riyadh, far more conservative than the more liberal port city of Jeddah, I was surprised to find many women had been traveling unaccompanied around town for some time (a change catalyzed by the arrival of Uber), or wearing abayas in color or with prints. Hundreds of women attended a high-profile soccer match while I was there, posting images on Instagram and Facebook with glee. Although the fashion week proved somewhat chaotic, the sense of delight and achievement was plain.But toward the end of the assignment I also had to read between the lines. While every woman I spoke to supported the rights of women to wear more liberalized fashion trends, most remained in black abayas \u2014 including at the fashion shows.\u201cSaudis are seeing the positive side of embracing change, and that is why most are not resisting it or the arrival of an event like this,\u201d said the stylist and influencer Hala al-Harithy, from beneath a glittery veil, designer shoes poking out from beneath her skirt. \u201cOur first fashion week might seem small to some, but it feels like a milestone to many.

Hector Marrero asked.Moments before Lieutenant Marrero posed that question, a large Rottweiler had sniffed out a shady patch of grass in Bronx Park, and taken a squat.Lieutenant Marrero, an undercover officer with the Department of Sanitation, had caught a glimpse of the dog, made a U-turn in his unmarked white Ford Fusion and sped toward the scene of the crime. But he arrived after the dog had finished his business and moved on.Unable to prove it was the Rottweiler that had done the deed, he gave its owner a lesser summons for having the dog off its leash.Before the city really heats up, and our noses remind us of the refuse ripening in our streets, we strapped on a bulletproof vest and went on patrol with Lieutenant Marrero and Officer Steven Aponte, two of the Sanitation Department\u2019s 305 agents and officers.The officers are recruited from within the department. Lieutenant Marrero spent two years driving garbage trucks in Far Rockaway, Queens, before becoming an officer. They carry guns and can make arrests.On a windy afternoon this month, we set off with the officers in the Bronx, on the lookout for scofflaws.

{"Headline": "Coroner\u2019s Error in Canada Bus Crash Brings Hope to One Family, Despair to Another", "Date": "2018-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySASKATOON, Saskatchewan \u2014 One family\u2019s hope was extinguished and another\u2019s was renewed on Monday, after Saskatchewan\u2019s coroner\u2019s office acknowledged that it had mixed up the identities of a survivor and a victim of a violent bus crash that has shaken this province and all of Canada.Early Monday morning the Office of the Chief Coroner for Saskatchewan said in a statement that it had incorrectly declared Xavier Labelle, an 18-year-old defenseman, as dead. He is in a hospital in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. No information about his medical condition has been made public.The coroner said Parker Tobin, the team\u2019s goalie, had not survived.During a brief meeting with reporters in Regina, Saskatchewan, Drew Wilby, a spokesman for the province\u2019s Ministry of Justice, apologized for the mistake.\u201cWe\u2019ve been in touch with the families,\u201d Mr. Wilby said. \u201cI want to apologize to both of those families on behalf of the chief coroner and the government of Saskatchewan for the error that was made.\u201dHe said the error was discovered late on Sunday when \u201cnew information was brought to light.\u201d But he did not say specifically what that information was.\u201cAs you can imagine, with a collision of this nature, there is significant trauma,\u201d Mr. Wilby said. \u201cThe way to 100 percent confirm this is through dental records. And dental records take time.\u201dBut Mr. Wilby said dental records were not used to correct the identification.\u201cA lot of these boys looked alike,\u201d he said, adding that the players all had similar builds and had also all dyed their hair blond as a playoff ritual.He also said members of Mr. Labelle\u2019s family had been involved in the incorrect identification process, which took place on Saturday in a temporary morgue established in Saskatoon. But he did not explain how the family members were involved. The family could not immediately be reached for comment.Paul Labelle, the father of Xavier, is an emergency medicine doctor in Saskatoon. He was traveling behind the team bus on Friday as it was making its way north from Humboldt for a playoff game in Nipawin, according to news reports. But emergency crews did not allow Dr. Labelle to assist, the reports said.While the coroner\u2019s office was sorting out the victims\u2019 identities on Sunday, a social media movement began to take hold in Canada and elsewhere as people left hockey sticks at the front doors of their houses as a memorial to the players, and then posted photos of them online.An estimated 5,000 people, more people than the town\u2019s official population, poured into Humboldt\u2019s arena and a series of overflow venues on Sunday night for a vigil to honor the dead players. Among those who attended was Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Golden State Killer Is Tracked Through a Thicket of DNA, and Experts Shudder", "Date": "2018-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGenetic testing services have become enormously popular with people looking for long-lost relatives or clues to hereditary diseases. Most never imagined that one day intimate pieces of their DNA could be mined to assist police detectives in criminal cases.Even as scientific experts applauded this week\u2019s arrest of the Golden State Killer suspect, Joseph James DeAngelo, 72, some expressed unease on Friday at reports that detectives in California had used a public genealogy database to identify him. Privacy and ethical issues glossed over in the public\u2019s rush to embrace DNA databases are now glaringly apparent, they said.\u201cThis is really tough,\u201d said Malia Fullerton, an ethicist at the University of Washington who studies DNA forensics. \u201cHe was a horrible man and it is good that he was identified, but does the end justify the means?\u201dComing so quickly on the heels of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which Facebook data on more than 70 million users was shared without their permission, it is beginning to dawn on consumers that even their most intimate digital data \u2014 their genetic profiles \u2014 may be passed around in ways they never intended.\u201cThere is a whole generation that says, \u2018I don\u2019t really care about privacy,\u2019\u201d said Peter Neufeld, a co-founder of The Innocence Project, which uses DNA to exonerate people who were wrongly convicted. \u201cAnd then they do, once there is a Cambridge Analytica. No one has thought about what are the possible consequences.\u201dThe trail of the Golden State Killer had gone cold decades ago. The police had linked him to more than 50 rapes and 12 murders from 1976 to 1986, and he had eluded all attempts to find him.In the years since, scientists have developed powerful tools to identify people by tiny variations in their DNA, as individual as fingerprints. At the same time, the F.B.I. and state law enforcement agencies have been cultivating growing databases of DNA not just from convicted criminals, but also in some cases from people accused of crimes.The California police had the Golden State Killer\u2019s DNA and recently found an unusually well-preserved sample from one of the crime scenes. The problem was finding a match.But these days DNA is stored in many places, and a near-match ultimately was found in a genealogy website beloved by hobbyists called GEDmatch, created by two volunteers in 2011.Anyone can set up a free profile on GEDmatch. Many customers upload to the site DNA profiles they have already generated on larger commercial sites like 23andMe.The detectives in the Golden State Killer case uploaded the suspect\u2019s DNA sample. But they would have had to check a box online certifying that the DNA was their own or belonged to someone for whom they were legal guardians, or that they had \u201cobtained authorization\u201d to upload the sample.\u201cThe purpose was to make these connections and to find these relatives,\u201d said Blaine Bettinger, a lawyer affiliated with GEDmatch. \u201cIt was not intended to be used by law enforcement to identify suspects of crimes.\u201dBut joining for that purpose does not technically violate site policy, he added.Erin Murphy, a law professor at New York University and expert on DNA searches, said that using a fake identity might raise questions about the legality of the evidence.The matches found in GEDmatch were to relatives of the suspect, not the suspect himself.Since the site provides family trees, detectives also were able to look for relatives who might not have uploaded genetic data to the site themselves.On GEDmatch, \u201cit just happens they got lucky,\u201d said Dr. Ashley Hall, a forensics science expert at the University of Illinois in Chicago.23andMe has more than 5 million customers, and Ancestry.com has 10 million. But the DNA in databases like these is relevant to tens of millions of others \u2014 sisters, parents, children. A lot can be learned about a family simply by accessing one member\u2019s DNA.\u201cSuppose you are worried about genetic privacy,\u201d Ms. Murphy said. \u201cIf your sibling or parent or child engaged in this activity online, they are compromising your family for generations.\u201dDNA profiles can be held indefinitely, and the data can be handed over to police who have warrants or subpoenas. You may never commit a crime. But how should you feel if your DNA was used to locate a distant relative who did?On a Facebook page dedicated to genealogy, hobbyists debated this new use of DNA data.\u201cI\u2019ll volunteer to give my DNA and out any of my cousins who may be rapist/murderers. So much drama over nothing,\u201d wrote Stu Pike, who said he had used GEDmatch to track down relatives.But others expressed outrage. \u201cMy relatives consented for their data to be used for genealogy but not for criminal investigations,\u201d wrote Leah LaPerle Larkin, who adjusted her settings to make sure her family\u2019s data was private on the GEDmatch site.The founder of DNA Detectives, a group that helps adoptees find their biological parents and reunite long-lost relatives, Ms. Moore said that she has been approached numerous times by law enforcement asking her help in solving murder and rape cases.She declined, she said, \u201cbecause I was still wrestling with the ethical questions of using genealogy databases for criminals.\u201dIt\u2019s not clear how often law enforcement turns to burgeoning DNA databases. Andy Kill, a spokesman for 23andMe, said the company has \u201chad a handful of inquiries over the course of 11 years,\u201d and that no data were \u201cgiven out in any circumstance.\u201dIt is unlikely that the apparent success of the method in the Golden State Killer case will spur a rush to use genealogy databases to solve crimes.\u201cUsing a database of this kind will generate an extraordinary number of leads, and running them all down using both nongenetic and genetic information requires a lot of police power,\u201d Ms. Murphy said. \u201cSo I doubt it will be run of the mill any time soon.\u201dBut it clearly is time for a wider discussion about law-enforcement access to stored DNA, Mr. Neufeld said. \u201cWhat really needs to happen is for ethicists, lawyers and minorities likely to be disproportionately affected to think of the unintended consequences of this genetic data.\u201dAdvertisement"}

(Related: I need to get out more, and possibly take up yoga.)But despite the wall-to-wall news of the past few weeks, lots of important things are happening in the tech world that don\u2019t involve Facebook. So let\u2019s run down a few of them?Second, the Google-Pentagon incident is a revealing story about the leverage that Silicon Valley engineers have over their companies. Because the labor market for engineers in the Bay Area is so tight, and because companies live and die on their ability to attract and retain talent, these employees have much more say in how a company like Google governs itself than, say, regulators or outside activists. If an antiwar group protests outside Google\u2019s headquarters, it\u2019s an annoyance. But if 3,000 engineers walk out, it\u2019s a crisis. And as the tech industry goes through its moral reckoning, executives of these companies should bear in mind that their biggest risk isn\u2019t regulation, it\u2019s rebellion from within.It\u2019s a tragic reminder that social platforms aren\u2019t just websites anymore. They\u2019re powerful economies unto themselves, and even seemingly minor policy decisions can alter the lives of millions of people, a few of whom might be disturbed enough to act on their darkest impulses.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Quarterback of the Kitchen? It\u2019s Not Always the Chef", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYou\u2019re most likely to notice it in the abstract, if you notice it at all. The work of a good expediter is in the pacing of your dinner. It\u2019s in the steadiness of the room. It\u2019s in the sense that everyone in the restaurant is moving to a single, unbreakable rhythm.The expediter sets that rhythm, managing the workflow of the kitchen like an air traffic controller. Though they may be unknown outside their restaurants, expediters are vital to smooth service. They fire dishes \u2014 signaling cooks exactly when to push ahead and finish a dish \u2014 and they keep time, continuously planning the next move.The role may be played by the chef or the sous-chef, or a dedicated expediter fixed at the pass, the counter where dishes are picked up and hurried out to the dining room. Exact responsibilities may vary, but the most valued traits are universal.Chefs say expediters should be precise, strategic and terrifically organized, with an uncanny, up-to-the-minute knowledge of all of the restaurant\u2019s moving parts, and an ability to communicate with ease, clarity and speed.Most important, they should possess a sense of total unflappability and persistent sang-froid in the face of chaos.Mr. Kim, 40, described expediters as conduits between the front and back of the house, pulling the teams closer to work as one. If an expediter panics and breaks down, so does that harmony.\u201cEverything could be crumbling around you, but the expediter has to be able to stay calm under pressure,\u201d he said. \u201cNo matter what\u2019s happening, you\u2019ve got to be the exact same temperature: very cool.\u201dIn practice, every kitchen has its own idiosyncratic system, and the expediter fits into it differently.At Noodle Bar, the chef and expediter both review the printed tickets bearing each diner\u2019s orders. Meanwhile, the manager roams the floor, talks with diners and relays where various tables are in their meal \u2014 say, a party of six has almost finished their small plates and are now in a hurry to get to a show; three parties of four with various food allergies are all about to order entrees.The expediter processes all the information coming from the chef and the manager and fires sequences of dishes accordingly, keeping in mind exactly how long each dish will take to finish, and how much each cook is already juggling.Some kitchens have multiple ticket machines, so cooks can see the orders as they come in. But Noodle Bar\u2019s cooks, who don\u2019t have tickets to reference, listen for the expediter\u2019s spoken cues. They cook blindly, as Mr. Kim put it, on trust.The pass has no heat lamps, and since the kitchen is open, diners can often see if food is waiting. \u201cOur margin of error for time is so thin,\u201d he said.At Stone Barns, the fine-dining restaurant where Ms. Raben works, every table has an almost completely different tasting menu based on the diners\u2019 interests, as well as on the quantities of what\u2019s available that day.\u201cWe might just have three fish heads in, but if we find the right table of three that night that will appreciate it, then it\u2019s game on,\u201d Ms. Raben said.The lack of a standard menu makes the role of expediting especially complex. The executive chef, Dan Barber, writes out each table\u2019s ticket by hand, with a thin Sharpie, on a long strip of paper. As Ms. Raben expedites and helps with plating, she uses colored pens to mark the ticket with the time each course is fired, and the time it leaves the kitchen.In some cases, Mr. Barber puts a question mark on the ticket \u2014 for a dish to be determined spontaneously, later in the evening. This can make it difficult for the expediter to plan ahead.\u201cWe have no idea what could happen next. It\u2019s madness, to be honest, it\u2019s absolute madness,\u201d said Ms. Raben, with clear delight. \u201cMy job is to organize that madness, so it all goes out seamlessly.\u201dSome expediters speak of recurring dreams in which time compresses, and they race against it. The machine jams, or prints out endless streams of paper. They walk into a familiar kitchen, but it\u2019s full of unreadable tickets.The work of an expediter can be a thrill, but it\u2019s also high-pressure, competitive and comes with major responsibilities. \u201cIf one guest is sitting at their table without food, that\u2019s not on the cooks,\u201d Ms. Raben said. \u201cThat\u2019s on you.\u201dIf an expediter at Noodle Bar misses a shift, Mr. Kim said the team finds ways to fill in, but it\u2019s a challenge. \u201cThere\u2019s this very funny, comical dance that happens between manager and chef because we\u2019re both doing two halves of the job,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re a step behind, we\u2019re just not as on it as we should be.\u201dIn some cases, no expediter may be preferable to a disorganized expediter, unfamiliar with the kitchen and its systems, who relays incorrect notes to servers about table positions, or forgets about an allergy.\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty big hiccup\u201d anytime someone new jumps into the role, he said. \u201cTables will lag, people will complain about the food taking a long time. It can be rough.\u201dBut in a restaurant they know inside and out, great expediters can peek into the dining room, peer across a full board of tickets, then organize the data in their heads and see directly into the future.\u201cI like to stay really organized, but also work with a kind of intuition,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you see the restaurant is starting to turn over, or you just sent out a lot of main courses, then you know the pantry station is about to be hit with desserts and appetizers, so you can start doing things to help them move faster.\u201dA good expediter doesn\u2019t rush customers through their dinners, but a sluggish meal is no good, either. Ms. Kimura observes, checks in with the host and adapts.\u201cEverything is really circumstantial,\u201d she said. \u201cWe usually strive to fit into a two-hour dining window and to have the appetizers out in 15 minutes and the protein course on the table by 45 minutes. But the line can get pushed to its limit, especially when we do 200 covers.\u201dWhile she\u2019s expediting, Ms. Kimura also provides an extra pair of hands for plating or grabbing ingredients from the walk-in refrigerator.There are few structured ways to learn an expediter\u2019s skills, other than on the job. And though some restaurants train all their cooks in the basics of expediting, chefs say it\u2019s a particularly hard role to teach because it requires such a deep understanding of every facet of the restaurant.Many expediters were thrown into the work by chance, when staff was short, or picked up on it instinctively while cooking, or taking food to tables, simply by observing. If they were lucky, they got to practice during slower, low-pressure shifts before the rush of a big night.Ms. Kimura learned to expedite as a cook by paying attention to the sous-chefs, as well as to Joule\u2019s executive chef, Rachel Yang.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s 200 or more covers, it feels so smooth and calm the whole time when Rachel\u2019s expediting,\u201d Ms. Kimura said. \u201cShe has this intrinsic knowledge of how to fire things, how to pace things. And it\u2019s her energy, too \u2014 she\u2019s one of the calmest people in the kitchen.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s our takedown dish,\u201d he said. He plans accordingly.\u201cBut when it\u2019s really busy, you\u2019ve got to go, go, go, and the tables just have to turn,\u201d said Mr. Ramirez, who serves up to 200 people on a Friday night (and almost 300 when the outdoor seating is open).Servers are supposed to help time orders at Llama Inn, letting the kitchen know when their tables are ready for the next course. But when they get in the weeds, Mr. Ramirez says, they may forget.So the expediters, like any others, just have to stay on their toes, keep an eye on the ticket board, and be aware, at every moment, of just how much time is flying.Advertisement"}

A beloved tradition shouldn\u2019t be abandoned for the sake of variety, and, in my estimation, perfectly cooked pasta with the right amount of tomato sauce is an uplifting experience.One example: I remember a garden party a few years ago, where the host had come up with a brilliant, simple menu of a tray of lasagna and a giant bowl of salad \u2014 both stellar family recipes. For dessert, we had Klondike bars, straight from the freezer. It was an easygoing affair, and the lasagna delicious.But there are some types of pasta \u2014 improvisational, perhaps \u2014 that can be expressions of a season\u2019s beginnings. These are the pastas I prefer just now, which are, for the most part, vegetable focused.The other day, I came upon fresh peas in the pod and the first few bunches of new garlic shoots. While West Coast cooks have been blessed with these, and many other vegetables, for several weeks already, we on the East Coast are thrilled to finally have these harbingers of spring arrive at the market, especially this year, when winter\u2019s end has seemed more delayed than ever.With that in mind, I set about to make pasta with peas. Normally, I would have been pleased to serve it with just a pat of butter and a bit of Parmesan, but a few other words came to mind, like pappardelle and pancetta. Then a little bunch of tender mustard greens caught my eye, so off they went into the basket, too.Pappardelle is a great choice here: saucy juices like to cling to those wide, delicate ribbons. I could have made my own, but I was pressed for time. Thankfully, there are tasty imported dried versions sold in boxes, and fresh ones available at my local Italian deli.Finding pancetta \u2014 Italian bacon, usually unsmoked \u2014 can be a bit more difficult, but regular smoked bacon is a fine substitute. While not essential, a few lardons of pork give pasta with peas a nice boost. Whichever I use, I often simmer it in water for a minute or two, which tones down the smokiness a bit and renders some fat. Lemon zest and a quickly made herb pesto with basil, mint and parsley could round out the pasta\u2019s flavor, and a bit of fresh ricotta adds a creamy quality without adding richness.Temperatures plummeted again the next day. But for our dinner, at least, spring had begun in earnest.And to drink ...cookingAdvertisement"}

However, he has brought thousands of new supporters to the party, confounded critics by running a much more successful election campaign last year than expected and has since tightened his control of the Labour apparatus.Schooled in left-wing, protest politics, Mr. Corbyn\u2019s worldview seems to have remained much as it was when he entered Parliament in 1983, at the beginning of a long period on the fringes of the Labour Party.\u201cHis has an implacable, binary, worldview,\u201d Professor Fielding said. \u201cHe sees Israel as Zionist, and Zionism as part of imperialism, and imperialism as the part of the enemy.\u201dThe latest questions over anti-Semitism began more than a week ago when a Labour lawmaker, Luciana Berger, asked questions about Mr. Corbyn\u2019s endorsement, in 2012, of a campaign to save a mural in east London that caricatured Jewish bankers playing Monopoly on the backs of the poor. Mr. Corbyn\u2019s office took hours to produce an equivocal response, before eventually issuing an apology.A protest by Jewish groups outside Parliament was followed by the resignation of Christine Shawcroft, the chair of Labour\u2019s internal disputes panel, after the leak of an email suggesting that she had supported a local candidate who was suspended over accusations of anti-Semitism.Opponents both inside the party and outside it have benefited politically from the crisis, which comes as the fortunes of Prime Minister Theresa May seem to have improved. It has also opened other divisions with one of the groups that campaigned for Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, Leave E.U., arguing that Labour was uninterested in combating anti-Semitism because it relied on votes from Muslims.Nevertheless, senior leaders in the Labour Party appeared to have realized the damage the issue was inflicting, which may be why Momentum issued a declaration on Sunday acknowledging worries about anti-Semitism.These, it said \u201cshould not and cannot be dismissed simply as right-wing smears, nor as the result of conspiracies.\u201dMomentum added that it was not a case of a \u201cfew, extreme \u2018bad apples,\u2019 \u201d but an unconscious bias that \u201cis more widespread in the Labour Party than many of us had understood even a few months ago.\u201dBut the impact of that unequivocal statement of intent to root out anti-Semitism was clouded by Mr. Corbyn\u2019s decision to break bread with Jewdas members, allies seen as sharing his worldview.\u201cJeremy Corbyn is a man of his political era and hasn\u2019t got the intellectual flexibility to move on from that, and to question some of his views,\u201d Professor Fielding said.\u201cThat can be a strength. That\u2019s why a lot of people joined the Labour Party under his leadership,\u201d he added. \u201cBut it can also be a weakness, and it is frustrating to supporters of the wide project they hope Jeremy Corbyn can advance.\u201dAdvertisement"}

These lights are supposed to be Smart, with a capital S, responding to my whim as all Smart things do.Of course, there\u2019s a chance she might feel lonely, and randomly decide to talk about the weather, as she does in the middle of the night with Sarah Coffey, an editor for Dow Jones Newswires, who lives in Maplewood, N.J. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why Alexa is speaking to me at 3 in the morning,\u201d Ms. Coffey, 44, said. But she is.We could blame Ms. Coffey\u2019s husband, Ben Berkowitz, 39, a vice president for digital at WNBC in New York, for turning the family\u2019s home into a techie wonderland. Along with that Echo, the family has Google Home, digital home security, a lock with keyless entry, and a Nest thermostat that insists on keeping the internal temperature at a crisp 62 degrees even when people are home.Ms. Coffey has so many apps on her phone monitoring her home that she has lost track of all the things they do. \u201cI appreciate his efforts to computerize our house,\u201d she said of Mr. Berkowitz. \u201cI just wish I could turn on a light without having to ask my phone to do it.\u201dLight bulbs are just the beginning. I could get a Colgate Connect toothbrush to map my mouth and give me pointers; a Roomba vacuuming robot to clean up after me; or a smart refrigerator to warn me that the milk might curdle. I could swap out my doorbell for one with a camera, delivering me live footage of the UPS driver dropping off a Bluetooth-enabled Instant Pot that can monitor how quickly the rice cooks.Would my life be easier if I could keep track of dinner on my iPhone? I don\u2019t know. But it probably would be more monitored. Even as we are in the midst of a collective freakout about the data that Facebook has been gathering and sharing without our permission, many of us are busily installing equipment that potentially bugs our homes and tracks our movements, conversations and routines.But anxiety alone hasn\u2019t been a deterrent, since we keep buying the stuff. We rationalize this uncomfortable truth because smart technology does have the potential to make life easier and, perhaps, safer.Affix a smart sensor to your water heater and you could be alerted to an impending flood. Install a smart lock on your door and you could remotely let a neighbor in to feed the cat, or get an alert at the office when your teenager gets home from school.As for me, I live in an old house with few overhead light fixtures. It seems like a banal problem, but filling my bedroom with lamps that turn on with an iPhone means I don\u2019t have to call an electrician to drill holes in my ceiling and walls to install permanent lighting. I certainly enjoy the convenience, and savings, even if it means I have yet another reason to stare at my phone.Advertisement"}

Even his treasured border wall got virtually nothing.At its core, the bill was simply another exercise in kicking the can down the road with a new twist: Congress blasted through longstanding spending caps, dispensing goodies to all.While proponents of more military spending got their wish, to win needed Democratic votes the Republicans were compelled to permit a similar increase in domestic spending.The consequence: a huge blow to the Trump administration\u2019s goal of dramatically shrinking the federal government.Spending has been held down for years by the past failure of efforts to more fundamentally reorder the government\u2019s fiscal policy. This time around, the pressure cooker exploded, at least partly.As the chart below shows, total discretionary spending (which doesn\u2019t include entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare) will rise in the current fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, by 12.9 percent, the largest increase in at least four decades.In effect, Congress nearly obliterated all the efforts in recent years to hold down spending. Outlays this year will be only 3.4 percent below what was projected in March 2011, before the budget cutting began.What\u2019s perhaps even more striking is the extent to which Congress simply ignored the budget submitted by the president just a few months earlier. As the chart below shows, many agencies that Mr. Trump sought to dramatically downsize instead were rewarded with increases.Indeed, every cabinet department and significant agency got a spending increase, many of them substantial.A flotilla of Trump targets \u2013 including the Internal Revenue Service, the Census Bureau and the National Institutes of Health \u2013 also received raises. An extra $1 billion was allocated for rural airports and another $1 billion went into the Highway Trust Fund. New programs were also created; a plan to bring high-speed internet to rural areas received $600 million. And on and on.And then there were the agencies and programs that Mr. Trump wanted to eliminate altogether. Not a single one ended up on the chopping block, and many saw their budgets increase:Community Development Block GrantsNational Endowment for the ArtsNational Endowment for the HumanitiesCorporation for Public BroadcastingOverseas Private Investment CorporationFood for PeaceU.S. Trade and Development AgencyParticularly noteworthy was the resolution of the impasse of the Gateway rail tunnel to connect Manhattan with New Jersey. Led by Senate minority leader Charles E. Schumer, the Democrats wanted $900 million appropriated to begin work; Mr. Trump wanted zero.Outcome: Mr. Schumer gets $540 million, enough to tide the project over until the next round of budget discussions.\u201cI\u2019m getting tired of all this winning,\u201d Matt House, Mr. Schumer\u2019s communications director, tweeted.Then there\u2019s the wall with Mexico, yes, the one that Mexico was supposed to pay for. With no support forthcoming from our southern neighbor, the Trump administration requested $25 billion to begin work on the wall.The amount appropriated: $1.6 billion, of which only $38 million can be used for planning for the wall. The balance is for new technology, repairs to existing barriers and 33 miles of fencing that was authorized in 2006.This legislative fiasco underscores the need for more fundamental reform of the nation\u2019s budgeting process. Between the tax cut voted last December and the spending increases that were just approved, the deficit for the current fiscal year will grow to an astounding $753 billion, up from $665 billion last year.And that\u2019s just the start. For the first time in history, we are now looking at projected budget deficits of more than $1 trillion as far as the eye can see. That means that the national debt, which sits at $20 trillion, could rise to $29 trillion or more over the next decade.Moreover, even keeping deficits to these irresponsible levels assumes continued economic growth at roughly current levels \u2013 no recessions, no hiccups, no bumps between now and 2028.The president seemed to understand the magnitude of his defeat, threatening in a tweet to veto the bill before capitulating and signing it. In that tweet, the President had an idea for how to improve the budgeting process: Congress should give him a line-item veto.Unfortunately, what the president didn\u2019t seem to know is that the line-item veto was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, and Congress doesn\u2019t have the authority to override that decision.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Times Journalists on Covering the Toronto Attack: The Canada Letter", "Date": "2018-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe next hours were a flurry of motion by nearly a dozen Times editors and reporters. Before hopping on a plane to Toronto, I picked up some quotes from live television interviews and some information by email and sent it off to Liam Stack, who was already writing the first online version of the story. Liam is a member of the Times\u2019s Express Team, a department in New York that jumps on breaking news.Dan Bilefsky, our correspondent based in Montreal, flew in to help with the reporting. Megan Specia in New York sorted through the social media torrent. Catherine Porter, our Toronto bureau chief, who was on assignment in Calgary, explored the actions of the Toronto police officer who got the suspect to surrender without force. Also in New York, Rick Gladstone melded the reporting from me, much of it typed on my phone, and Dan into a single cohesive piece. And, as always, we were all indebted to the editors on the International Desk.Below are thoughts about covering the tragedy from members of the team.While the Canadian authorities have all but ruled out terrorism, I noticed a striking parallel between the aftermath of the Toronto attack and others I have covered: people getting on with their lives, unbowed by fear. Within hours of the attack, Torontonians were huddled in bars, cheering at hockey matches, jogging near the scene, commuting to work.While I moved away from Toronto for a time, I settled back there. It is my hometown.But I wasn\u2019t there when one of the city\u2019s worst mass murders was unfolding. I was on a plane headed for Calgary.I learned the news like most readers, when I finally turned my phone back on and was overwhelmed by news alerts.On the cab to my hotel, I worked my phone to report. If I couldn\u2019t be in Toronto, at least I would contribute to the unfolding story from afar.When I returned, the city already seemed to be healing. The radio newscast mentioned the victims, and moved on to local parking regulations. The world\u2019s interest moved on, too. But I\u2019m on my way to the memorial sites \u2014 not just as a journalist, but as a Torontonian.Part of my job as an editor on the International Desk is to help weed fact from fiction in the deluge of graphic imagery and to determine what we can, and cannot, say about an attack like this as seen through social media.So what began in the morning as a news story about Mr. Minassian\u2019s appearance in court, where he was charged with 10 murders, soon morphed into a profile of him. We also used the expertise of our social media reporters in New York, who helped us connect the dots between Mr. Minassian\u2019s last Facebook posting and a 2014 killing rampage by a 22-year-old man in California that had become a perverse beacon of inspiration for misogynists.Writing the story became an exercise in filling in the blanks without going beyond what we knew. It took a barrage of email exchanges, phone calls and text messages to nail down Facebook\u2019s confirmation that the misogynistic posting was Mr. Minassian\u2019s. It took at least three phone calls and reporting in Toronto to specify what we could say about the genders of the victims.It was only after the adrenaline and tension began to ease toward the end of the day that I realized we had assembled a real-life horror story.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cambridge Analytica and the Coming Data Bust", "Date": "2018-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn TechnologyThe queasy truth at the heart of Facebook\u2019s Cambridge Analytica scandal, which is so far the company\u2019s defining disgrace of 2018, is that its genesis became scandalous only in retrospect. The series of events that now implicate Facebook began in 2014, in plain view, with a listing on Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk service, where users can complete small tasks for commensurately modest sums of cash. In exchange for installing a Facebook app and completing a survey \u2014 in the process granting the app access to parts of your Facebook profile \u2014 you would get around a dollar. Maybe two.This was a great deal, at least by the standards of the time. Facebook users were then accustomed to granting apps permission to see their personal data in exchange for much less. It was the tail end of a Facebook era defined by connected apps: games like FarmVille, Candy Crush and Words With Friends; apps that broadcast your extra-Facebook activities, like Spotify and Pinterest; and apps that were almost explicitly about gathering as much useful data as possible from users, like TripAdvisor\u2019s Cities I\u2019ve Visited app, which let you share a digital pushpin map with your friends.Most of these apps, when installed, demanded permission to access \u201cyour profile info,\u201d which could include things like your activity, birthday, relationship status, interests, religious and political views, likes, education and work history. They could also collect information about users\u2019 friends, multiplying their reach. In providing a marketplace for such apps, Facebook made it easy for users to extend their extraordinarily intimate relationship with the site to thousands of third-party developers. One of them turned out to be connected to Cambridge Analytica, which was using the data for right-wing political campaigns \u2014 a fact that was lucidly and widely reported as early as 2015 but promptly lost in the roiling insanity of primary season. (As of Facebook\u2019s most recent admission, data was collected on as many as 87 million users.)Not that more exposure in the news cycle would have mattered much back then. It was self-evidently absurd to grant a virtual-farming game access to your religious views, but that\u2019s just how the platform worked at the time, and so we got used to it, much in the same way we got used to conducting our private lives on any other corporate platform. (When Gmail first started in 2004, the fact that it placed ads based on the contents of users\u2019 emails was considered invasive. That feeling passed; Google continued scanning consumer email until 2017, and Gmail now has more than a billion users.) Still, these individually trivial decisions never gave us cause to confront just how much we had come to trust Facebook.Whenever you sign up for any free service, you\u2019re aware, in the loosest terms, that you\u2019re giving up something. It usually includes a license to use the content you create \u2014 be it capital-C Content, like public posts, or things you would intuitively understand as more private, like your direct messages and which profiles you look at \u2014 however the service pleases. You could imagine the problem with all this, if asked: You\u2019re giving up your privacy to a company that owes you nothing and could end up doing basically anything. But a user concerned about how ad-supported web services would infringe on his privacy is trapped in a sort of predictive hell: always right, but always feeling wrong; never quite able to say what will happen, but always expecting it; both constantly vindicated and yet feeling he\u2019s crying wolf.And its users unwittingly took part in a social-data boom and are only now starting to feel the consequences. The ease and speed with which internet users trust tech companies with the data they crave are wildly out of proportion with the risks they\u2019re assuming in doing so, in no small part because, out of negligence or institutional blindness, the companies couldn\u2019t anticipate the risks themselves. After all, Facebook spent years fortifying itself against hackers and spammers only to be rolled by political actors posing as app developers.This pattern \u2014 a boom based on credible-seeming promises that are a little too good to be true, followed years later by a bust confirming that they indeed were \u2014 is familiar from a different world: finance. The financial crisis was materially devastating in a way that a privacy crisis couldn\u2019t be; poor stewardship of user data isn\u2019t going to evict people from their homes. But among the lingering and underrated consequences of the collapse of the global financial system was a total loss in trust in the institutions that were supposed to prevent it. The disorienting and thoroughly unsatisfying Cambridge Analytica saga is a preview of what trailing indicators of the collapse of the data boom might look like: revealing signs, evident years later, that something was rotten with these arrangements, arriving too late to be actionable but soon enough to foster resentment against companies and services on which we\u2019ve come to depend.Experiences that test our trust of the free-services-for-personal-data internet are accumulating and threaten to become more personal: the failure of Twitter to ban someone who harassed or threatened you; a small but embarrassing email hack resulting in a scammer asking old friends for money and concluding with an admonishment from your provider that you just needed a better password; an identity theft, a suffering credit score and then news of a hack at Equifax, a service to which you never even chose to provide data. Or it could be nothing more than an eerily well-targeted ad, one that suggests that a certain service \u2014 maybe one you never even meant to interact with \u2014 knows things about you that you don\u2019t remember telling it.The wider consequences of these arrangements are harder to quantify and sometimes even to see. They are: a social-media ecosystem that has annexed the news and the public sphere; nascent but increasingly assertive systems of identity and social currency that seek to transcend borders while answering only to investors; billions of lives\u2019 worth of trustingly volunteered data in the hands of companies that might want to make money from it, or that might have no need for it anymore, or that might go out of business, change ownership or simply forget what they had in the first place. Perhaps someone \u2014 a new partner, an enterprising researcher, a repressive government \u2014 might, one day, discover new uses for the data.A loss of faith in tech companies as semipublic infrastructure would also arrive simultaneously with an understanding that that\u2019s what they had been all along: services that we depended on, ones we gave ourselves to, and that revealed themselves to be \u2014 or merely became \u2014 the sorts of services we\u2019d rather not. They\u2019re not too big to fail in the banking sense. But they\u2019re similarly hard to budge, having constructed entire modes of interaction, consumption and identity verification that are now intimately interwoven with our lives, so all-encompassing that they\u2019ve practically become invisible. To stop using these products is to leave the internet, and these companies made it their mission to make sure there isn\u2019t anywhere else to go.In a recent conference call with reporters, Mark Zuckerberg, the company\u2019s chief executive, confessed that Facebook ought to do a better job of putting privacy tools in front of users, but in the same breath he encouraged people to use the tools and to \u201cmake sure that they\u2019re comfortable with how their information is used on our services and others.\u201d It was a gesture at dusty old user agreements \u2014 an emphasis on the fact that we technically consented to this, and that if he was expected to hold up his end of the deal, we should be too. It called to mind a line of the financial industry\u2019s post-crisis defense: Borrowers should have read the fine print. But for the tech industry, this posture is even more of a stretch: It\u2019s an argument for honoring the status quo, coming from the people who have made it their mission to destroy it.John Herrman is a technology reporter for The Times.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Protests Erupt Anew in Armenia Amid Political Deadlock", "Date": "2018-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe resumption of public protests and the deployment of the police around the headquarters of the ruling Republican Party threatened to shift the tenor of what has so far been a peaceful movement for change in the small, southern Caucasus nation of about three million people.Although Mr. Pashinyan lacks a party and an established constituency, he has won widespread support, mainly among young Armenians who are fed up with corruption and nepotism in the elite group of pro-Russia politicians and their allies who have long commanded the government and the economy.Street demonstrations began on April 13 after Mr. Sargsyan, having reached his two-term limit after a decade as president, was abruptly named prime minister by a Parliament dominated by his Republican Party. In 2015, the Constitution was changed to transfer most presidential powers to the prime minister and the Parliament.Mr. Sargsyan conceded on Monday that he had made a mistake, saying in a statement that he was bowing to public opinion and stepping down.Various political factions are now locked in tense standoff over how to proceed. While there is a consensus that snap parliamentary elections are likely, opposition leaders are adamant that they should not be run by Republican Party officials, whom they deeply distrust.The acting prime minister, Karen Karapetyan, said that he had asked Armen Sarkissian, the new president, to organize a meeting of all political factions to discuss the next steps. Mr. Sarkissian issued a statement saying he would begin consulting with political leaders on Wednesday.Mr. Karapetyan, a Sargsyan ally, was scheduled to meet with Mr. Pashinyan on Wednesday but canceled late Tuesday, saying in a statement that he would not accept unspecified preconditions that the opposition had demanded. He also acknowledged that new elections were likely.\u201cIf Pashinyan is the people\u2019s choice, the people can elect him,\u201d said Mr. Karapetyan, who had previously been prime minister, after working as an executive for Gazprom, the Russian energy giant.Mr. Pashinyan, who has said he is ready to be prime minister, rejected the idea of holding elections under the supervision of the Republican Party, which controls 58 of the 105 seats in Parliament. It pushed through the change from president to prime minister for Mr. Sargsyan. The opposition parties are small and prone to bickering, however.\u201cThe Republican Party is thinking about exploiting Serzh Sargsyan\u2019s resignation and wants to keep power,\u201d Mr. Pashinyan said in a statement on Facebook. \u201cWe cannot agree on the appointment of this party\u2019s representative as prime minister, and we cannot allow this corrupted system to continue to exist.\u201d\u201cThere will be more of us here with every day until we take power,\u201d he was quoted as saying by local news outlets.Armenia declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 but has remained a close partner with Moscow. Russia, which maintains a military base in Armenia, has indicated that it will not intervene and has called for a peaceful transition of power. It has said the demonstrations were an internal affair, and has not accused Western powers of fomenting them, as it did in Ukraine.But on Wednesday, a court in Moscow fined 29 protesters who had gathered outside the Armenian cathedral in the Russian capital in support of the demonstrations in Yerevan.Advertisement"}

Here are brief profiles based on news and social media accounts.Ms. D\u2019Amico, 30, worked at the Canadian head office of Invesco, an investment management company based in Atlanta. Her family described her in a statement as the \u201cdefinition of altruism.\u201d\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t stop until she went the extra mile for others,\u201d her family said.Since the age of 12, Ms. D\u2019Amico volunteered at the Rogers Cup, a professional tennis tournament played in Montreal and Toronto.

{"Headline": "For Gaza Protester, Living or Dying Is the \u2018Same Thing\u2019", "Date": "2018-04-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGAZA CITY \u2014 No one would ever pick out Saber al-Gerim from the crowds of Palestinians demonstrating against Israel along the heavily guarded fence that has helped turn the Gaza Strip into an open-air prison.Not for his youthful appearance. At 22, he wears ripped jeans and white sneakers, has a modish haircut and carries a few extra pounds from too many months without work.Not for his anger. Screaming \u201cAllahu akbar!\u201d and hurling stones with a sling, or straining to pull a cable hooked onto Israel\u2019s barbed-wire barrier in hopes of tearing it apart, he is just one in a fevered multitude, a protagonist in nobody\u2019s drama but his own.Not even for his willingness to risk death, or his dream of going home to a patch of land he has never seen and cannot really visualize.But zoom in on this man: A beggar\u2019s son, just a few yards from Israel, and squarely in the line of fire. Soldiers, the only Israelis Mr. Gerim has ever seen this close, can be spotted through the smoke of burning tires, moving about in their foxholes atop tall sand berms, occasionally launching tear-gas barrages, sometimes using live fire. Over a loudspeaker, one warns Palestinians to retreat or risk death.Mr. Gerim, well within range, and resting between slinging stones, shouts back: \u201cWe want to return!\u201dSay what you will about root causes and immediate ones \u2014 about incitement and militancy, about siege and control, about who did what first to whom \u2014 one thing is clear. More than a decade of deprivation and desperation, with little hope of relief, has led thousands of young Gazans to throw themselves into a protest that few, if any, think can actually achieve its stated goal: a return to the homes in what is now Israel that their forebears left behind in 1948.In five weeks of protests, 46 people have been killed, and hundreds more have been badly wounded, according to the Gaza health ministry.With its 64 percent unemployment rate among the young, Gaza, under a blockade maintained by Israel and Egypt for years, presents countless men like Mr. Gerim with the grimmest of options.They can seek an education in preparation for lives and careers that now seem out of reach, and hope for a chance to eventually emigrate. They can join groups like Hamas or Islamic Jihad, devoting themselves to armed conflict with Israel in return for a livelihood and a sense of purpose and belonging. Or they can stay home, staving off boredom by smoking shisha, a tobacco-molasses mix, or stronger stuff, and wait for things to change.Mr. Gerim considers himself neither a terrorist nor a freedom fighter. He is not much for prayer or for politics; he says he does not belong to Hamas or Fatah or any other faction. He is a young man with nothing to do, for whom the protests have offered a chance to barbecue with friends late into the night, sleep late most mornings, make himself useful while singing songs of love or martyrdom or an end to suffering, and lash out at a hated enemy all afternoon.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter to me if they shoot me or not,\u201d he said in a quiet moment inside his family\u2019s tent. \u201cDeath or life \u2014 it\u2019s the same thing.\u201dThe protests, with an outdoor festival\u2019s schedule of fun and games, performances and creative programming \u2014 and carnage every Friday \u2014 is meant to build to a climax on May 15, the day Palestinians mark the Nakba, or catastrophe, of their flight and expulsion when Israel was established 70 years ago.The protest, which grew out of a young activist\u2019s Facebook page and was a grass-roots initiative before being embraced, organized and publicized by Hamas, the militant Islamist group that rules Gaza, has hardly scared the Israelis into altering their basic policy. Israel continues to treat the tiny coastal enclave like a deadly virus to be quarantined and, other than that, more or less tunes it out.Mr. Gerim is typical in another way: He does not think of Gaza as his home, but he has no idea what home is.His grandmother, Haniya al-Kurdi, 80, was a little girl when her family left what is now Ashdod, Israel, in 1948. She has never been back, but has heard that there is a coffee shop next to where her home was. The closest anyone else in the family has gotten was in 2013, when Mr. Gerim\u2019s sister, Sabreen, now 26, contracted cancer and was allowed to spend a year in Tel Aviv getting treatment. On the way there, her mother, Iktimal al-Gerim, asked their driver to point out Ashdod to them from the highway.For Mr. Gerim, the family\u2019s old property is an idea more than a place he can actually picture.Israelis themselves he has had more experience with. When he was about 10, before the Israelis evacuated their Gaza settlements in 2005, Mr. Gerim climbed a tree outside his grandfather\u2019s house to get a better look at the soldiers a few hundred yards away. Then he fell to the ground and broke his right hand.He has been as enterprising, and as ill-starred, ever since.He used to raise pigeons and chickens on his family\u2019s roof, for fun and for food \u2014 until an Israeli airstrike hit a neighbor\u2019s house and it collapsed on the coop, killing all of his birds.He sometimes dreams of working in an automobile-manufacturing plant, of traveling overseas to learn how to build cars, then coming back to Gaza to make them. But the closest he has ever gotten is loading tuk-tuks \u2014 motorcycles with cargo beds \u2014 or handling a pushcart to distribute sacks of donated flour, sugar and other staples to his fellow refugees.In the autumn, Mr. Gerim sometimes harvests olives. When there is construction work, he looks for chances to lay bricks or pour concrete. He has never had a regular job.He is stoic for a 22-year-old, though this may be an acquired response to adversity: His father is mentally ill, Mr. Gerim says, given to flying into destructive rages over the slightest disappointments. His family \u2014 two younger brothers, their sister and their parents \u2014 all share a single room with a tile floor and blankets but no beds. The kitchen floor is sand. The family\u2019s debts are choking them, he says.Mr. Gerim\u2019s industriousness shows at the protests, as does his stoicism.On Thursday, he arrived early at his family\u2019s tent, a roomy contraption that was provided to them by the protest\u2019s organizers, and set about sweeping the tarpaulin floor for the first of several times, before building a fire and cooking eggplants and tomatoes that city workers were distributing to the needy.At lunch, a charity handed out meals of chicken and rice, and then Mr. Gerim swept the floor of crumbs and bones, singing a love song as he did.He has no girlfriend, and no hopes of marrying. \u201cThere is no money, no work,\u201d he explained. \u201cMarriage is not free.\u201dAfter lunch, he walked up to the fence for a quick look across at the Israeli soldiers, then foraged for firewood. He dragged a six-foot log more than a quarter-mile back to the tent, and broke it apart with his hands and feet.Later, he assembled kites from sticks, clear plastic and paper \u2014 and talked about attaching soda cans to them stuffed with gasoline-soaked rags, to sail over the fence and maybe set something or someone on fire.At 10 p.m., he and his friends began barbecuing a feast for 12. It didn\u2019t end until 2:30 a.m. It takes a long time to cook 22 pounds of chicken wings on a grill about 18 inches across.Sitting around the fire, a friend named Abu Moaz, 25, said he wanted to use a kite to drop leaflets in Hebrew and Arabic warning Israeli soldiers to \u201cevacuate your houses and return to the countries from which you came.\u201dEveryone liked the sound of that.Mr. Gerim went home to sleep, but was back at the tent at 8 a.m. on Friday, sweeping again, building the wood fire, drinking tea with his neighbors.He went to Friday Prayer, then ate a falafel sandwich.At 2:30, he was crouching behind the barbed-wire barrier, whirling his slingshot like a helicopter rotor, aiming in vain at Israeli soldiers again and again.Around 5 p.m., he saw a group of men a few hundred yards to the south, and ran to see what they were doing. They had breached the barbed wire, and were trying to get to the main fence marking Israeli territory. Mr. Gerim hung back, and did not try to join them.Near him, a man fell, hit in the stomach by what seemed like a grenade fragment, Mr. Gerim said.He was not shocked by this, he said afterward.\u201cI could be shot or killed anytime,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dNight had fallen now; the protesters were headed home. And soon Mr. Gerim was singing again \u2014 this time a Lebanese tune of weariness with conflict.\u201cEnough is enough,\u201d he crooned softly in Arabic. \u201cEnough for miseries, promises and words. School students, church bells, a soldier, a knight and the calls of prayer \u2014 all pray for prevailing peace.\u201dIyad Abuheweila reported from Gaza, and David M.

{"Headline": "They Survived a Massacre. Then the Lawyers Started Calling.", "Date": "2018-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was late one night in February when a barrage of Facebook messages started lighting up Christopher Hansen\u2019s phone. Each one included an image of a stranger whose life had been upended by a mass shooting. Just like Mr. Hansen\u2019s.\u201cWe need this one,\u201d Mr. Groff wrote, according to screenshots provided by Mr. Hansen. \u201cReach out to him.\u201dMr. Groff sent a link to a news story about a woman whose eye had been shot out in Las Vegas.\u201cI want this case,\u201d Mr. Groff wrote.The shooting rampages that have terrorized communities across the country have spurred lawsuits from the ever-growing ranks of victims and survivors seeking a measure of justice. And many survivors say that within days of the traumatizing events, they face relentless pressure to sign representation contracts.\u201cWe\u2019ve all gotten a thousand phone calls from lawyers,\u201d said Chad Robertson, who survived the Las Vegas shooting and helped administer a handful of survivor support groups on Facebook.But even in the high-pressure world of solicitations, Mr. Hansen and other survivors\u2019 experiences with the firm they hired after Orlando stand out as unusual. Clients described Mr. Groff going to extraordinary lengths to snag more business for his firm. Two men also said that while they were being asked to solicit more clients, Mr. Groff sent them sexually charged messages.In the weeks after that shooting in June 2016, Mr. Hansen said he was approached by Mr. Groff, who said he was with the Law Offices of Conrad J. Benedetto, a Philadelphia-based plaintiffs\u2019 law firm. The firm also has offices in New York, New Jersey, Michigan and Arkansas, according to its website.The firm\u2019s work has ranged from personal injury cases to environmental contamination, civil rights complaints and bankruptcies. But it has also pursued mass shooting cases after attacks at the Pulse nightclub, the Las Vegas concert and at a church in Sutherland Springs, Tex. The firm\u2019s website touts its work on shooting cases. It has filed at least one lawsuit so far stemming from a mass shooting, joining with other firms to sue a security company that once employed the Pulse gunman.Hundreds of families have turned to the legal system after mass shootings at Columbine, Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook, Las Vegas and more. Often, they find themselves facing a multiyear legal crusade, with slim chances of success.The primary people responsible \u2014 the gunmen \u2014 are often dead or do not have nearly enough wealth to compensate even a fraction of their victims. Federal laws insulate gun makers from legal liability.Despite these hurdles, some victims say they go to court to expose safety flaws, law enforcement lapses or negligence at a theater or concert venue where gunshots erupted. Others sue to pry open the private internal records of gun makers. A lawsuit can become one more way of speaking for the dead.Two survivors of the Valentine\u2019s Day shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., have sent letters of intent to sue to the school district as well as local and federal law enforcement agencies over the response to the shooting and the multiple unheeded warnings about the gunman.States write their own rules governing how lawyers can solicit business, sometimes requiring them to wait 30 days after a wrongful death or personal injury before approaching potential clients. California law does not allow firms to solicit people who may still be too physically or mentally scarred to make reasonable decisions about hiring a lawyer.Jamie Lynn Gallegos, who survived the Vegas shooting, said she was still in shock when her phone started ringing about two weeks after the attack in October. From 6:30 a.m. to 11 p.m., calls poured in for her and her husband, their sons and others who had gone together to the Route 91 festival, she said.\u201cThey were relentless,\u201d said Ms. Gallegos, who with her husband transported Las Vegas gunshot victims in the bed of their pickup truck.Getting involved with the Benedetto firm forged an accidental brotherhood for Mr. Hansen and a few other Pulse survivors who signed up as clients. They appeared together on a rainbow-colored float at Boston\u2019s gay pride parade last June.This year, they went on cross-country trips organized by the firm to meet other mass-shooting survivors in Las Vegas and California. They ate at glittering Las Vegas restaurants and saw the Grand Canyon.But three of the men said they began to feel more like sales executives, sent to draw more business for the firm by making promotional videos and appearing at meetings with other mass-shooting survivors.\u201cThey were using our story,\u201d Mr. Hansen said in an interview.The men said they did not raise their concerns with anyone at the law firm at the time, including Mr. Benedetto, the owner, or with any state agencies that regulate professional conduct.Mr. Benedetto said his firm treated all of its clients with professionalism and respect. In an interview, he said that his clients have his cellphone number and \u201ccan call me to voice any complaints.\u201d That never happened, he said.\u201cIt would be unfortunate if any unsubstantiated and false allegations have been wrongfully spread through the community,\u201d Mr. Benedetto said in an email.He added: \u201cWe represent victims who have been seriously injured and emotionally distressed and we respect them and will always support them to the fullest moral, ethical and legal standards.\u201dBrian Nunez, a client who left Pulse moments before the shooting and felt traumatized by survivors\u2019 guilt, joined up with the firm and flew to Las Vegas in January for what he believed was a support meeting with victims of the massacre there.\u201cWhen we got there, the setting changed completely,\u201d Mr. Nunez said. \u201cIt was, \u2018You guys, you do your job and get other people to sign up.\u2019 That\u2019s it.\u201dMr. Nunez said he was asked to record a promotional video for the Benedetto firm, \u201csaying who we are, what our tragedy was and what they\u2019ve done for us.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t even feel comfortable recording it,\u201d Mr. Nunez said, though he went through with it.Javier Nava, a restaurant manager who was shot in the abdomen during the Pulse attack, signed up with the firm and joined the Las Vegas and California trips, also believing the meetings were aimed at helping survivors share their stories and connect with one another. But he said the gatherings felt like recruiting seminars.\u201cThey wanted me to share my history, but get more clients,\u201d Mr. Nava said. \u201cThis is the deal. They are using me.\u201dMr. Groff, the law firm\u2019s office manager, is also listed as an administrator of a private Facebook group called Survivors of Mass Shootings whose mission is to \u201chelp each other through our healing process, rather it be a few days or a lifetime.\u201dMany of the state rules that regulate legal advertisements require that direct mail and advertising circulars include prominent disclaimers to make clear they are soliciting business. But often, those rules make no mention of Facebook groups, online messaging, friend requests and other everyday modes of communication.It was during the trips with other survivors that two of the men said they also began to have uncomfortable interactions with Mr. Groff, who they said arranged their travel, took them out to meals, provided their tickets and drove them from meeting to meeting.Mr. Groff is not a lawyer, but he served as a primary contact with shooting survivors, clients said. He could be personable and funny, and spent hours with the men, traveling and talking and winning their confidence, they said.But Mr. Nunez and Mr. Nava provided screenshots showing Mr. Groff had sent them sexually charged messages.In February, Mr. Groff took the Pulse survivors on a trip to California, and the text messages between him and Mr. Nava grew increasingly sexual until he offered to perform oral sex on Mr. Nava, according to a screenshot. He persisted as Mr. Nava declined several times.Mr. Nunez and Mr. Nava said they were shaken by the exchanges, calling them a betrayal of a professional relationship. They said they have not spoken recently with Mr. Groff and have since hired a new lawyer.Mr. Benedetto did not respond to questions about the allegations of sexual harassment, or to an email detailing questions about Mr. Groff\u2019s background, behavior and role with clients. Mr. Groff did not respond to multiple phone messages or social media messages seeking comment.There have been previous complaints about Mr. Groff\u2019s behavior. In December 2015, a former client, Javier Carrasquillo, filed a lawsuit in Camden County, N.J., saying that Mr. Groff had traded sex with Mr. Carrasquillo and his girlfriend in exchange for legal services after Mr. Carrasquillo was arrested.The lawsuit was settled. Matthew Wolf, the lawyer for Mr. Carrasquillo, said he could not comment publicly about the case.The lawsuit brought some public notice to Mr. Groff\u2019s criminal history. Since the 1990s, he has been convicted of charges relating to passing bad checks and \u201ctheft by deception,\u201d according to New Jersey court records.The Pulse survivors who worked with Mr. Groff\u2019s employer, the Benedetto law firm, said they knew none of this when they signed up, and said they were still largely in the dark about the lawsuits being filed in their names.Orlando Torres, a Pulse survivor who also signed up with the Benedetto firm, said he had been surprised to see his name listed among the plaintiffs on a federal civil suit filed in March 2017 against a security company that had employed the gunman.\u201cI was unaware of it till I saw it on the news,\u201d said Mr. Torres, adding that he cut ties with the firm last September.The law firm, meanwhile, appears to have moved forward. In a March 15 post on its Facebook page, it announced that it was taking clients from the Florida high school shooting. \u201cPlease register with us,\u201d the post said. \u201cWe\u2019re here to help.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Their vast size requires you either to commit or to share, and they\u2019re not the kind of thing you\u2019d casually toss into your bag on the way out the door. Grapefruits can also be somewhat bitter, which may turn off people accustomed to honey-sweet tangerines.But dessert is different. That\u2019s when the acidity and bitterness of grapefruit is precisely what makes it so appealing, especially in confections that lean cloying. Like crumb cake.With its mound of brown sugar nuggets blanketing a moist, sour cream-enriched cake, crumb cake often walks the line between luxury and overkill. But adding grapefruit segments on top of the batter pulls it back from the sugary abyss, each bite releasing a burst of bracing, tangy juiceBefore adding the fruit segments, you have to remove the membranes that surround them, which interfere with flavor and texture. (This technique is known as supreming the fruit.) Once the membranes are removed, the segments will fall apart, and that\u2019s perfectly fine. You\u2019re aiming for a scattering of the pulp, each tiny juice vesicle remaining distinct until it hits your teeth.I also sprinkle a few grains of sea salt on top of the grapefruit. It does wonders to mitigate the fruit\u2019s inherent bitterness. But be restrained: You don\u2019t want it to go the way of salted caramel. Here, the salt is a more subtle contribution.The cinnamon in the topping is de rigueur, but I also add cardamom because I like the vaguely Scandinavian way it tastes with almonds. Ginger works wonderfully with the grapefruit, so feel free to substitute that if you like it better.You can also substitute other sweet citrus fruit, trading oranges or tangerines for grapefruit. Really, any tangy fruit will work. Pineapple, raspberries, nectarines and sour cherries all have enough acidity to zip up the heavy molasses flavor and texture of brown sugar. Just skip the salt sprinkle, which isn\u2019t necessary without the bitterness of grapefruit to subdue. And stay away from the likes of blueberries, sweet cherries, peaches and pears, which are too sweet for this supremely sugary dessert.After all, balancing bitter, sweet, salty and acidic is the key to all good cooking \u2014 and, in this case, baking.cookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russia Tried to Shut Down Telegram. Websites Were Collateral Damage.", "Date": "2018-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Russia\u2019s communications watchdog was locked in an intensive game of whack-a-mole on Wednesday with Telegram, the popular and highly secure messaging app, as its stuttering attempts to block the service inadvertently knocked out the websites of scores of small businesses.Alexander Zharov, the head of the watchdog agency, Roskomnadzor, acknowledged that it had obstructed millions of IP addresses in an attempt to shutter Telegram. Roskomnadzor took that step after the company declined to provide encryption information, which would enable the agency to identify users and see the content of messages.The watchdog agency was granted authority to block the app on Friday by a Moscow court. But the clumsy, unprecedented effort to follow through, which started Monday, caused a widespread outcry after the unintended consequences became apparent.A member of the band Pussy Riot organized a small public protest. Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor who leaked American surveillance documents and now lives in Russia, expressed support for the company. Even some usually staunch Kremlin supporters called the ban misguided.Internet experts in Russia saw a greater menace in the effort beyond Telegram, speculating that if the government succeeded in silencing the app with some 13 million Russian users, it might pursue bigger fish next.\u201cIf you have a government agency being so brutal attacking Telegram, taking down millions of IP addresses, after that you can do what you want,\u201d said Andrei Soldatov, one of the authors of \u201cThe Red Web,\u201d a history of the Russian internet. \u201cAfter they have faced this much heat, they can go after Facebook and Google.\u201dTelegram tried to thwart the blockage by shifting its service to two giant American web hosts, Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services, while at the same time repeatedly changing its IP address to skip ahead of Roskomnadzor.In response, rather than chasing individual IP addresses \u2014 a unique set of numbers that identifies a computer, smartphone or other device connected to the internet \u2014 the watchdog agency elected to shut down enormous blocks of addresses, called subnets.The collateral damage hit a variety of other sites, like Viber, another messaging app, as well as small businesses including a language school and a courier service, all of which suffered financial losses.Volvo dealerships could not access their service records, according to press reports, and Kremlin museums had to suspend ticket sales. Roskomnadzor said it unblocked individual sites as soon as the agency became aware of a problem.The Agora group of human rights lawyers, which represents Telegram in Russian courts, said in a statement that it had received 73 complaints about blocked websites. The organization planned to file a formal complaint with the prosecutor general\u2019s office.Telegram has been sending messages to users encouraging them to use alternative means, including Virtual Private Networks, which effectively connect to the internet outside Russia, to evade the ban.The app\u2019s founder, Pavel Durov, who fled Russia after losing control in 2014 of VKontakte, the Russian version of Facebook that he created, sent a message to Telegram users saying that he would continue to engage in \u201cdigital resistance.\u201dHis supporters included Mr. Snowden, who wrote on Twitter that resistance to the \u201ctotalitarian demand\u201d for backdoor access to private communications \u201cis the only moral response, and shows real leadership.\u201dMaria V. Alyokhina, a political activist and member of the Pussy Riot collective who has been jailed for previous demonstrations, helped to organize a protest that consisted of tossing paper airplanes outside the Moscow headquarters of the F.S.B., the secret police. She was sentenced to 100 hours of compulsory community service, according to Mediazona, a courtroom news agency.The paper airplane is the corporate symbol of the Telegram app. The F.S.B. has been leading the effort in Russia to gain backdoor access to all private communications in Russia, saying it was necessary to combat terrorism.Telegram was widely used within the Russian government, including by President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s press office, to communicate with the public and the media. Some government agencies and press offices continued to use Telegram despite the ban.Igor Lebedev, the deputy chairman of the Russian Parliament and the son of nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky, accused the government watchdog agency of \u201cincompetence.\u201d\u201cIt targeted Telegram but hit Russian business,\u201d he wrote on Twitter, saying it should be illegal to limit access to such popular sites. \u201cWe must defend Russian citizens from pointless bans!\u201dThe Kremlin has also come in for criticism on several other fronts: It has suggested using older, slower apps as an alternative, especially one owned by a Putin crony; it shut down LinkedIn and managed to limit some access to Zello, a voice messaging app used to organize truck driver protests; and it finds itself accused of paying lip service to the idea that Russia should develop cutting edge technology while busily undermining Telegram, one of the few Russian I.T. brands to achieve global success.The office of the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, an active Telegram user, said he had shut down his account to set the example. The decision was \u201cin line with safeguarding national interests and removing the monopoly of the Telegram messaging app,\u201d the ayatollah\u2019s last Telegram stated, according to Iran\u2019s government-run Press TV news website.Internet experts suggest that what the Kremlin really wants is leverage to order the internet platforms to remove things that it does not like.\u201cThey want a hotline that they can pick up to call someone to do something,\u201d said Mr. Soldatov. \u201cIt is a very Soviet approach.\u201dFollow Neil MacFarquhar on Twitter: @NeilMacFarquhar.Oleg Matsnev and Sophia Kishkovsky contributed reporting in Moscow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sex and Shame: What Incels and Jihadists Have in Common", "Date": "2018-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMr. Cottee is a criminologist who studies\u00a0terrorism.Mr. Minassian is obviously a deeply troubled individual. And mass murder is driven by a variety of psychological factors. But much of Mr. Minassian\u2019s trouble seems to have been fueled or exacerbated by the frustration and shame that accompanied his lack of sexual contact with women. This would have made him feel unfulfilled and indignant, and also weak and unmanly. The sense of shame from not being able to perform a culturally approved sex role may be a key to understanding his murderous rage. It may also be another thread connecting him to other violent actors whose ideology is different from his own, yet whose actions are similar. It is not difficult to spot parallels with the world of jihadism, where women and sex are similarly fixated on to an extraordinary degree.The core emotion that animates \u201cincels\u201d is sexual shame. It\u2019s not just that these men are sexually frustrated; it\u2019s that they are ashamed of their sexual failure. At the same time, they are resentful of the sexual success of others, which amplifies their own sense of inadequacy. This explains why they gravitate toward an online subculture that strives to rationalize their shame and redirect the blame for their failure onto women.According to Professor Juergensmeyer, \u201cNothing is more intimate than sexuality, and no greater humiliation can be experienced than failure over what one perceives to be one\u2019s sexual role.\u201d Furthermore, he argues, such failures \u201ccan lead to public violence,\u201d which is performed to cancel out feelings of shame and reassert the claim to manhood.It\u2019s possible that Mr. Minassian\u2019s ramming attack in Toronto was just such a performance, and that what he most wanted was to make himself visible to all those women who had, in his mind, made him feel worthless and invisible. However confused and hallucinatory, it was a claim to his virility as a man, as well as an indictment on a sexually promiscuous world from which he had been excluded. That\u2019s a claim that many jihadists would no doubt understand, if not indeed sympathize with.Advertisement"}

Garfield, the president of the Information Technology Industry Council, which represents big technology companies like Amazon, Dell, Facebook, Google and IBM. \u201cWe are now at a place where about 90 percent of the companies we represent now have a presidential Twitter strategy in place.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s no laughing matter,\u201d he said.For many companies, that strategy comes down to waiting out the storm. In recent days, Amazon has all but ignored the president\u2019s taunts, which he issued in a flurry of tweets.\u201cThere\u2019s no real advantage going toe-to-toe with him,\u201d said Joe Lockhart, a press secretary for President Bill Clinton who was a spokesman for the National Football League, another favorite target of Mr. Trump. \u201cAnd his attention span is so short, he will move on. He\u2019ll find another target.\u201dLikewise, the president\u2019s interest in the AT&T merger with Time Warner largely stems from his repeated clashes with CNN, a subsidiary of Time Warner, which he regards as biased against him.As a private citizen, Mr. Trump has attacked companies, including calling several times for boycotts. The remarks served to raise his profile and fed the image of a no-holds-barred businessman who was unafraid to rebuke his rivals or his critics. But in those days, such comments had little ability to move stock prices or affect sales.As a candidate and as the president, Mr. Trump also uses his verbal assaults on companies to bolster his populist message that he is on the side of workers, not big business. (Still, Mr. Trump secured a large tax cut last year for corporate America.)Mr. Trump\u2019s most ardent supporters say they appreciate his willingness to criticize the corporate establishment.\u201cHe continues to go directly after the companies and not care about political correctness,\u201d said Terry Bowman, a former Trump campaign organizer who works at a Ford Motor parts factory in Ypsilanti, Mich. \u201cHe says things that a polished politician would never say. He says things that come directly from the American worker.\u201d\u201cThat is the height of irresponsibility,\u201d Mr. Obama said in 2009 without identifying specific companies. \u201cIt is shameful.\u201dMr. Clinton\u2019s Justice Department aggressively pushed to break up Microsoft on the grounds that it was abusing its monopoly position in personal computing to dominate the internet.President John F. Kennedy avoided naming individuals during a fight with the steel industry in 1962. He criticized \u201ca tiny handful of steel executives whose pursuit of private power and profit exceeds their sense of public responsibility.\u201dPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt on occasion assailed business executives as \u201cmalefactors of great wealth,\u201d attributing the memorable phrase to his cousin, Theodore Roosevelt. Neither president made a practice of identifying specific companies or executives.Mr. Trump has had no such reticence.\u201cA report just came out. They said $1.47, I believe, or about that for every time they deliver a package, the United States government \u2014 meaning the post office \u2014 loses $1.47,\u201d the president said.He added, ominously: \u201cSo Amazon is going to have to pay much more money to the post office. There\u2019s no doubt about that.\u201dWhen Merck\u2019s chief executive, Kenneth C. Frazier, quit a presidential business council last year in protest of some of the White House\u2019s policy positions, other members were initially reluctant to come to his defense for fear of a verbal attack by Mr. Trump. The council eventually disbanded but only after much internal negotiation among members to quit in force.The multiday decline of Amazon\u2019s stock price after Mr. Trump\u2019s repeated jabs at the company has exacerbated such fears, said Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management and president of the Chief Executive Leadership Institute.\u201cOther business leaders don\u2019t want to catch the contagion,\u201d he said.But he added that refusing to engage could also be risky. He said that Mr. Bezos\u2019s silence had hurt the company, leaving it exposed to Mr. Trump\u2019s accusations that it received subsidies from the Postal Service and was not paying its fair share of taxes.\u201cThe right answer for C.E.O.s is not to engage in a mud fight but to come with facts,\u201d Mr. Sonnenfeld said. \u201cU.P.S. and FedEx have their facts, but we haven\u2019t heard from Amazon.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Where are the technologies transforming the way we deal with physical reality?Well, there is one area of physical technology, renewable energy, in which we really are seeing that kind of progress \u2014 progress that can both change the world and save it. Unfortunately, the people Thiel supports are trying to stop that progress from happening.Not that long ago, calls for a move to wind and solar power were widely perceived as impractical if not hippie-dippy silly. Some of that contempt lingers; my sense is that many politicians and some businesspeople still think of renewable energy as marginal, still imagine that real men burn stuff and serious people focus on good old-fashioned fossil fuels.But the truth is nearly the opposite, certainly when it comes to electricity generation. Believers in the primacy of fossil fuels, coal in particular, are now technological dead-enders; they, not foolish leftists, are our modern Luddites. Unfortunately, they can still do a lot of damage.And that\u2019s what businesses are learning to do, via a series of incremental improvements \u2014 better design, better materials, better locations (offshore is where it\u2019s at). So what we\u2019ll be seeing in a few years will be 850-foot turbines that totally outcompete fossil fuels on cost.To paraphrase the science-fiction writer William Gibson, the renewable energy future is already pretty much here; it\u2019s just not very evenly distributed.True, there are issues of intermittency remaining \u2014 the wind doesn\u2019t always blow, the sun doesn\u2019t always shine \u2014 although batteries and other energy storage technologies are also making rapid progress. There are also some energy uses, especially transportation, where fossil fuels retain a significant advantage in cost and convenience. And exactly how we\u2019re going to have carbon-neutral air travel is still, well, up in the air.For now, however, the problem isn\u2019t technology \u2014 it\u2019s politics.In the long run, these tactics probably won\u2019t stop the transition to renewable energy, and even the villains of this story probably realize that. Their goal is, instead, to slow things down, so they can extract as much profit as possible from their existing investments.Unfortunately, this really is a case of \u201cin the long run we are all dead.\u201d Every year that we delay the clean-energy transition will sicken or kill thousands while increasing the risk of climate catastrophe.The point is that Trump and company aren\u2019t just trying to move us backward on social issues; they\u2019re also trying to block technological progress. And the price of their obstructionism will be high.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Report for America Supports Journalism Where Cutbacks Hit Hard", "Date": "2018-04-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA group of journalists have decided to do something about the diminution of newsrooms at the local level. They\u2019re making reporting part of a national service program.Report for America, a nonprofit organization modeled after AmeriCorps, aims to install 1,000 journalists in understaffed newsrooms by 2022. Now in its pilot stage, the initiative has placed three reporters in Appalachia. It has chosen nine more, from 740 applicants, to be deployed across the country in June.\u201cI felt like I needed to give something back to a place that has given a lot to me,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd journalism is the way for me to do that.\u201dMs. Born now lives in Williamson, a town of roughly 3,000 along the Tug Fork River, and covers the state\u2019s southern coal fields for West Virginia Public Broadcasting.\u201cIt\u2019s important to have reporters based in parts of America where some people feel misunderstood,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just helps us get a greater understanding of who we are and who our neighbors are.\u201dReport for America fellowships last one to two years, and the pay is about $40,000, with half covered by the program and the rest split between participating news organizations and donations. Two media veterans, Steven Waldman and Charles Sennott, started the project with funding from sponsors.\u201cPeople are applying for the same reason people want to go into the Peace Corps: There\u2019s an idealistic desire to help communities, and there\u2019s a sense of adventure,\u201d Mr. Waldman, 55, said. \u201cThey want to try and save democracy. People keep saying that.\u201dHistorically, reporters would start their careers at small publications and move on to progressively larger ones. These days, young journalists tend to find work right out of college \u2014 but the jobs they end up with often don\u2019t require them to spend time talking to story subjects face to face or learning about different communities.\u201cMaybe they have done that Brooklyn thing, where you spend a year or two in a cubicle working for a blog,\u201d Mr. Sennott, 55, said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not the same as being on the ground doing the real work, knocking on a door and walking into someone\u2019s kitchen.\u201dIn 1990, daily and weekly newspaper publishers employed about 455,000 people, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By January 2016, that number had fallen to 173,000.Before the creation of Report for America, Mr. Waldman ran Beliefnet, a site dedicated to faith and spirituality, and worked for the Federal Communications Commission as a senior adviser. In 2015, he wrote a paper funded by the Ford Foundation arguing for the creation of a national service program for journalists.\u201cI was focused on reporting on divided societies and struggling democracies,\u201d Mr. Sennott said. \u201cThen I realized we live in one.\u201dBecause they had seen how Facebook and Google contributed to the destruction of the advertising-based business model that had long kept local newspapers afloat, they asked them to kick in to their project. While Google has committed money and training, Facebook has yet to sign on.\u201cMark Zuckerberg could solve the local news problem with the money that\u2019s falling between his couch cushions,\u201d Mr. Waldman said. \u201cFolks like Facebook and Google and the other winners have the money to solve this problem, and it is a solvable problem.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need a 20-year veteran investigative reporter to have this impact,\u201d Mr. Waldman said. \u201cIt\u2019s so barren out there that just being on the ground can have a really big impact.\u201d\u201cHe showed up,\u201d Mr. Sennott said. \u201cHe was just there.\u201dFor the nine reporter slots, 85 newsrooms applied asking for corps members, describing a crucial beat that needed filling. Reporters who make the cut start with eight days of training before joining their host newsrooms. They must also fulfill a service requirement, such as working as mentors to student journalists, during their stints.The founders refer to those who take part in the program as \u201ccorps members,\u201d rather than fellows, an attempt to signal that Report for America is not meant to be simply a chance to burnish a r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\u201cIt\u2019s not a reward for bright young graduate students,\u201d Mr. Sennott said. \u201cIt\u2019s a call to get in there.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the surname of a co-founder of Report for America.

{"Headline": "In Moscow, a Sense of Relief After a Limited Syria Attack", "Date": "2018-04-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Moscow met the limited American-led airstrikes against Syria before dawn on Saturday with plenty of bluster and heated rhetoric, starting with an uncharacteristically quick response from President Vladimir V. Putin condemning the attack and accusing the United States of aggravating the humanitarian situation.But there was also a palpable sense of relief.The sun was barely up before the Defense Ministry, not famous for speedy reactions, pumped out a statement underscoring that none of the thousands of Russian troops garrisoned in Syria had been threatened by the American, British and French attack and that none of its air defense systems had been mobilized.Mr. Assad has become something of a \u201chuman shield\u201d limiting Russia\u2019s options, noted Vladimir Frolov, an independent foreign affairs analyst and columnist for Republic.ru, \u201cbut it was a choice that Moscow made.\u201dMr. Putin called for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council to discuss the attack. Other than that, however, he limited himself to repeating Russian claims that no chemical attack had taken place to warrant the onslaught, and that Washington was only worsening a dire humanitarian crisis.\u201cRussia condemns in the strongest possible terms the attack against Syria, where Russian military personnel are assisting the legitimate government in its counterterrorism efforts,\u201d Mr. Putin said in the statement. \u201cThrough its actions, the U.S. makes the already catastrophic humanitarian situation in Syria even worse and brings suffering to civilians.\u201dLike Mr. Assad, Russia condemns all opponents of the Syrian government as \u201cterrorists.\u201dThe calmer tone was a noticeable change from preceding weeks, when many commentators suggested that the United States and Russia were slouching toward a replay of the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, which brought the two Cold War adversaries to the brink of a nuclear confrontation.Some Russian news outlets, while trying to make light of the panic mode, also provided practical advice, like which Moscow metro stations were the most secure against nuclear attack and how much water people should take with them to a bomb shelter.In the weeks before the attack, Moscow issued repeated warnings, particularly from Gen. Valery V. Gerasimov, the chief of staff for the armed forces, that the Kremlin would \u201ctake retaliatory measures.\u201d The general hinged his warning on the important caveat that Russia would attack missiles and the platforms from which they were launched only in the event that Russian military personnel were placed in danger.The attack was barely over before the Defense Ministry rushed out its statement stressing that its two main installations in Syria \u2014 the air base at Hmeimim and the naval base at Tartus \u2014 had not been threatened.\u201cWe believe that this strike is not a response to an alleged chemical attack, but a reaction to the successes of the Syrian armed forces in the struggle to liberate their territory from international terrorism,\u201d he said.If anything, the Kremlin may have been somewhat pleased, albeit secretly, that the United States had hit targets well away from the primary areas of Russian control, one analyst suggested.\u201cRussia has its own zone of interests in Syria, which is on the shore of the Mediterranean,\u201d said Aleksei V. Makarkin, of the Center for Political Technologies.\u201cThe U.S. hit targets that are outside of this zone,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course Russia is upset, but this is just an element of the new Cold War, only one element among several, including sanctions, which are a much more serious problem for Russia.\u201dIn one telling sign of the lack of urgency regarding Syria, the Federation Council, the upper house of the Russian Parliament, put out a statement saying it would discuss the airstrikes \u201cnext week.\u201dAt home, of course, the bluster will continue. \u201cFor the domestic audience, everything will be covered by tough statements,\u201d said Mr. Golts, the military analyst, noting that few in Russia will complain that the Kremlin did not follow through on its threats to attack the United States military assets in the region.While the Russian military has undergone an overhaul in recent years and has developed some high-tech cruise missiles and other weapons, a direct confrontation with the United States forces in Syria risked a humiliating walloping, he noted.The secretive Russian mercenary forces in Syria already lost \u201ca couple of hundred\u201d fighters in a skirmish with American-backed Kurdish forces in February, the C.I.A. director and secretary of state nominee, Mike Pompeo, said in Senate testimony last week. Russia had no desire for a similar confrontation involving its regular forces.Mr. Putin has twin goals in Syria. First, he is staunchly opposed to regime change fostered by outsiders of the kind that brought chaos to Iraq and Libya.Second, he sees Syria as leverage to restore Moscow not only to its role as a power broker in the Middle East, but to the status of world policeman that it shared with the United States in Soviet days. The fact that Mr. Trump has started to criticize him and Russia more openly for allying with Mr. Assad has yet to dent those hopes.American officials called the sites \u201cfundamental components\u201d of Syria\u2019s chemical weapons program.In his speech Friday night, Mr. Trump said Russia and Iran should not want to be associated with a \u201cmass murderer\u201d like Mr. Assad, and \u2014 as he did after a more limited attack on Syria for the same reason a year ago \u2014 declared that Mr. Putin and Russia had failed to fulfill the promise to eliminate all Syria\u2019s chemical weapons.\u201cRussia must decide if it will continue down this dark path or if it will join with civilized nations as a force for stability and peace,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cHopefully, someday we\u2019ll get along with Russia and maybe even Iran, but maybe not.\u201dMr. Putin will accept limited strikes against Syria that do not indicate a sustained American effort to help the opposition, said Mr. Frolov, the foreign affairs analyst, and would avoid engaging Mr. Trump on the rest.\u201cThe Kremlin is still hoping for a summit with Trump, so it will largely ignore his comments about Putin,\u201d Mr. Frolov said. \u201cThere is still some residual hope that a good personal meeting may turn things around.\u201dThe Russians did crow that Syrian air defense systems had managed to shoot down a dozen or so cruise missiles, using equipment \u201cmanufactured more than 30 years ago in the Soviet Union,\u201d according to the Interfax news agency. The United States military did not confirm or deny the assertion.The Russian Foreign Ministry greeted the missile attack with its habitual sarcasm. Without naming the United States specifically, Maria Zakharova, the spokesman for the ministry, zeroed in on the claims of moral leadership and exceptionalism among the allies who launched the attack.\u201cYou have to be really exceptional to shell Syria\u2019s capital at the moment when the country is getting a chance for a peaceful future,\u201d she wrote on Facebook.In a news briefing on Saturday, a spokeswoman for the United States Defense Department, Dana W. White, said, \u201cThe Russian disinformation campaign has already begun.\u201d She noted, \u201cThere has been a 2,000 percent increase in Russian trolls in the last 24 hours.\u201dEven with the immediate threat of a confrontation out of the way, several Russian analysts noted that the proximity of the two sides in Syria, not to mention the shifting positions of Mr. Trump, left plenty of room for confrontation.\u201cThe danger is that at one point something completely unexpected and spontaneous can happen \u2014 for instance a missile can miss its target and hit something sensitive,\u201d said Mr. Makarkin.An earlier version of this article misstated part of the name of a Russian current affairs magazine.

Sapna Maheshwari, a reporter who covers advertising for The Times, discussed the tech she\u2019s using.What tech tools do you use to monitor what advertisers are doing with our data on websites, apps and gadgets?More than anything, though, I do lots of phone interviews \u2014 despite what they say about millennials and phones \u2014 and meet with brand marketers and people at ad agencies and ad technology companies to hear what they\u2019re thinking about and working on.What do you like about these tools, and what could be better?The online ad tracking services are helpful for the desktop and mobile web, but I haven\u2019t yet found an effective way to sort through the many, many ads that flow through Facebook and Instagram or across various mobile apps.How has tech changed advertising, and how much is the advertising industry looking to tech these days? Tech has transformed advertising \u2014 there are so many more ways to target and reach people now than when the industry was dominated by TV, print, radio and event sponsorships.There\u2019s also so much more data being collected about our habits by an array of companies, from big tech platforms to agencies to the advertisers themselves. Huge portions of advertising dollars in the last few years have gone to the big tech giants that we read about all the time \u2014 specifically Google and Facebook and, to a lesser extent, companies like Snap. Lately, advertisers have said they\u2019re spending more money on Amazon. So there are still more major changes afoot.Advertisers are also grappling with how to measure their ads in this new world. That\u2019s a challenge throughout the industry. Think of all the ways that people watch TV shows now. I recently watched \u2014 or, more accurately, binged \u2014 NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Good Place.\u201d I watched the first season on Netflix, where there were no ads, then saw the first eight episodes of the second season through NBC\u2019s Apple TV app, where there were lots of commercials. I watched the final few on Hulu, which might have had different ads. That type of behavior \u2014 especially since I was using my parents\u2019 cable login for the NBC app \u2014 is a new kind of challenge for the people buying, selling and measuring ads.What do you think of Google\u2019s and Facebook\u2019s power in the online ad industry?It\u2019s an enormous topic within the advertising industry, which generally refers to Google and Facebook as the \u201cduopoly.\u201d It\u2019s pretty remarkable that two of the world\u2019s most valuable companies make virtually all of their money from selling online ads and dominate more than half of the American digital ad market.Their size and influence make it essential for people to really understand how the companies\u2019 business models work and the types of information they\u2019re sharing with them every day \u2014 and what makes them such powerful advertising machines.Outside work, what tech product do you love using? And I love the Bose wireless speaker that my boyfriend gave me for Diwali. I use it to listen to podcasts and talk on the phone while cooking or cleaning. I love that the speaker gets me away from my phone, which can charge in the meantime, and that I can use it throughout my apartment. It would be nice if it just did the cooking for me, though.What\u2019s your advice for those who want to prevent their data from being tracked by advertisers?It\u2019s hard to prevent, but you can take some steps to limit it. Explore the privacy settings on your smartphone, including which apps have access to your location and microphone and whether you allow ad tracking. Delete apps that you don\u2019t use anymore.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fearing Death, and Photographing the Rituals That Surround It", "Date": "2018-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLENSThe question of what awaits after death has obsessed humanity for millennia. The Korean photographer Chanho Park\u2019s fixation took root when he was 11 and his mother, who suffered from pancreatic cancer, was hospitalized. Much of his time was spent at her side, where he heard the anguished screams of the dying and their mourning families and saw the beds of gaunt patients become empty from one day to the next. \u201cI began to feel more afraid of the pain and screams that they were experiencing than the death itself,\u201d Mr. Park said. After his mother died, he was adrift and bereft. Discord with his father led him to run away from home when he was 14. By his late 30s, he fell into depression, which he sought to ease by taking pictures. Without meaning to, he found himself drawn to burial plots, ritual sites, and places of prayer \u2014 synonymous with marking the end of life or remembering those who died. While sorting through his photos, he was struck by a commonality: the image of mothers praying.\u201cTo the tree, to the stone, to the sea, to the stone Buddha, and to the tombstone,\u201d said Mr. Park, explaining that however they prayed, the women had the same wish: that their children were happy. The revelation was so powerful, he said, that it unleashed decades of pent-up pain and yearning for his mother. Afterward, he felt completely healed. But a new burden took its place \u2014 the understanding that his own death would bring a similar pain to his wife and children.\u201cWhen we recover from the trauma from the deaths of our parents, we face the reality of our own deaths,\u201d Mr. Park said. \u201cPerhaps we live a trauma of death for an entire life.\u201d \u201cI hope to search for and think about the meaning of death through the acts on death, acts of remembering death, and the record of those acts,\u201d Mr. Park said. Since most of what he sought to photograph involved rituals held on sacred ground and sometimes hidden from the outside world, it took time to find and gain access. As an outsider, Mr. Park needed to talk with the \u201cgatekeepers,\u201d people who confided heartbreaking, personal life experiences.\u201cTheir sad stories remained and accumulated in my heart,\u201d said Mr. Park. \u201cListening to them and photographing them all became too painful.\u201d He became so overwhelmed at one point, that he was hospitalized and put down his camera for a bit. When Mr. Park resumed the work, he confronted a new question: \u201cHow can we exist forever?\u201d He believes the answer to that is simply: memory. \u201cWe exist as a memory in others\u2019 mind,\u201d he explained. \u201c\u2019How are we going to be remembered?\u2019 It is the same question as: \u2018How should we live the rest of our lives?\u2019 Serious thoughts on death could turn the human life from greed and selfishness to respect and sincerity, from worshiping gold to pursuing reason.\u201dMr. Park has found solace from the small insights his work has revealed \u2014 and from the camera\u2019s therapeutic power. \u201cI believe that photography has some healing power,\u201d said Mr. Park. \u201cPhotography helps us to face the trauma. If one can face his own trauma through my works, I think it can help to heal and cure the trauma.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Fire-Scorched Oklahoma, Help Comes One Bale at a Time", "Date": "2018-04-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVICI, Okla. \u2014 The hay began arriving before the fires were out. It came stacked on pickup trucks and strapped onto semis. From a few counties away. From halfway across the country.For ranchers whose grazing land was destroyed by wildfires that tore across western Oklahoma this month, the cylindrical bales were an economic lifeline, a way to feed cattle marooned on grassless patches of charred red soil. The hay was also free, provided not by lawmakers in Washington or Oklahoma City, but mostly by strangers in other corners of rural America.\u201cIf we waited on the government, we wouldn\u2019t have it,\u201d said Leo Hale, a local business owner who volunteered for 12-hour shifts distributing hay at the Vici rodeo grounds. Vici, population 700, was hit hard in the fires that scorched nearly 350,000 acres across the region, left two people dead, and blackened mile after mile of pasture. Donated bales of hay arrived from Kansas, Texas, Michigan and other parts of Oklahoma.When wildfires strike in cattle country, the list of needs is long and expensive: Hurt cows have to see the veterinarian. Fences must be replaced. Barns need to be rebuilt.Perhaps most urgently, the surviving cattle must eat. So each time a major fire devastates the Great Plains, an informal but robust hay delivery kicks into gear, powered by Facebook messages, word of mouth and the honor system.Without the bales now arriving in Oklahoma, many ranchers would likely have to sell their herds.\u201cWe may not be able to feed the cows enough to gain weight,\u201d said Michael Kelsey of the Oklahoma Cattlemen\u2019s Association, which has been taking donations to provide hay and other supplies. \u201cBut if we can feed the cows enough to maintain, we\u2019re in good shape. That\u2019s just the reality of the disaster.\u201dRhett Smith\u2019s ranch on a gravel road outside Taloga, Okla., was directly in the flames\u2019 path. Unlike some of his neighbors, Mr. Smith saved his house and his 100 cows. But his grass was gone.So when two tractor-trailers carrying 64 bales of hay rolled down Mr. Smith\u2019s winding driveway, a sense of relief washed over him. The hay would be enough to feed his cattle and his neighbors\u2019 herds for at least a few weeks.The trucks were driven by Levi Smith and his brother, Blake, who raise cattle about 100 miles from Vici, along the Kansas-Oklahoma border. The brothers had never met Rhett Smith before \u2014 and are no relation to him \u2014 but they said they empathized with all he was going through. Their family\u2019s land burned last year, the brothers said. And donated hay had gotten their cattle through it.\u201cThey think it can\u2019t get any worse,\u201d Levi Smith said, \u201cbut when these loads of hay come in, it gives you hope.\u201dIn the sparsely populated counties where cattle roam, people rely on neighbors and take pride in giving help without being asked.Signs around Vici (which is pronounced \u201cVy-Sigh\u201d) offer free meals, free clothes, free care for orphaned calves.In nearby Lenora, hay bales are stacked along the side of a road for whoever might need them. As eager as people are to assist, they also seem reluctant to receive.\u201cNobody wants to take any help if they don\u2019t have to,\u201d said Nick Campbell, a town trustee in Vici. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get them to understand that we\u2019re there for them, whatever they need.\u201dThe Oklahoma fires, which burned an area about the size of Chicago and New York City put together, made relatively few national headlines. But in agricultural circles \u2014 and especially in places that have seen their own fires \u2014 word of the destruction spread swiftly.Prairie fires are a fact of life on the Great Plains, but recent years have brought a series of unusually strong, multiday blazes that set records and spread out of control.When Travis Brown lost much of his pasture in Montana\u2019s fires last summer, other ranchers sent hay.So when Mr. Brown heard about the new fires in Oklahoma, he and three other Montana ranchers paid about $940 each to send more than 100 hay bales to Oklahoma.\u201cI remember the feeling of just being overwhelmed after seeing so much of our livelihood burned,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cThe smoke hadn\u2019t even cleared away yet, and people are saying, \u2018You\u2019re going to be O.K.\u2019\u201dAround Vici and Taloga, where drivers greet passing trucks with a wave and the skyline is dotted with wind turbines and oil pumpjacks, the flames have subsided. But the damage remains.The fire\u2019s timing was especially cruel, coming in the midst of an extreme drought. Dead cows appear along roadsides, hooves pointed to the sky. Driveways lead to piles of rubble. When the wind blows, it smells a bit like a campfire.\u201cYou can see across the river and just see the black as far as you can see,\u201d said Lori White, a Putnam, Okla., rancher who lost a calf and about a third of her pasture in the fire, and who has been helping coordinate hay deliveries for ranchers who fared worse.Last weekend, as a much-needed rainstorm tamped down the last of the flames, Matt Schaller delivered hay to ranchers around Vici.\u201cIt\u2019s just what you do,\u201d Mr. Schaller said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Building a Connected City From the Ground Up", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetWEYMOUTH, Mass. \u2014 Kyle Corkum imagines a \u201csmart city\u201d with futuristic amenities like driverless shuttle services, heated sidewalks and a super-resilient energy grid that keeps humming through the harshest of storms.As chief executive of LStar Ventures, a developer of planned communities, he has a chance to build the neighborhood of his dreams from the ground up on the site of a long-shuttered naval air station in this town just 12 miles south of Boston\u2019s booming technology hub.LStar, based in Raleigh, N.C., has enlisted General Electric as its partner. Because they are starting from scratch, Mr. Corkum said, the companies can embed smart technology into the energy, water, lighting and transportation systems that will serve the community.Still, LStar is pushing ahead with the smart city, called Union Point. Plans include thousands of housing units and millions of square feet of high-tech commercial space on about 1,500 acres that extend into the neighboring towns of Rockland and Abington. The community\u2019s glass towers, public plazas, clustered housing, scattered parks and retail zones will be contained within 500 acres, leaving the rest as dedicated open space.So far, the community consists of about 1,200 occupied single-family homes, townhouses and apartments, as well as a nearly completed $28 million sports complex with a miniature replica of Fenway Park. A cavernous aircraft hangar will be renovated for use as the centerpiece for a downtown district with shops, restaurants and open spaces with public programming.General Electric will use Union Point as a laboratory for testing new products and as a showroom for working systems. Eric Gebhardt, the strategic technology officer at GE Power, said the community\u2019s energy plan will include micro grid technology, renewable generation and power storage. The company will also install \u201cintelligent\u201d lighting \u2014 streetlights with sensors that can track sound, light and other conditions. The data can be used to monitor traffic, help drivers find parking spaces and alert law enforcement if a gun is fired.G.E. has piloted some of its smart products in existing cities, but Union Point is an unusual opportunity because most of the infrastructure does not exist yet and the developer is open to experimentation, Mr. Gebhardt said.LStar wants \u201cthe center to be a showcase for what the city could be, a place to monitor what it is becoming, and a place to ask existential questions like, \u2018Could it be more inclusive, say, or energy efficient?\u2019\u201d Mr. Rose said.LStar also has an agreement with Optimus Ride, an autonomous vehicle start-up in Boston, to set up a self-driving vehicle service at Union Point. The company is already testing its electric vehicles at the property.Union Point\u2019s first commercial tenant is expected this spring, when Prodrive Technologies, a Dutch company that develops and manufactures products for the automotive, medical and other industries, will break ground on its 60,000-square-foot United States headquarters. The site\u2019s proximity to Boston, access to commuter rail service and ample room for expansion were crucial to the firm\u2019s location decision, said Roy Willems, the company\u2019s general manager of United States operations. He said Prodrive expected to build a second 200,000-square-foot building within three years, and increase its work force to roughly 300 people.LStar had to persuade the three host communities to approve critical zoning changes before it could move forward with the project. They also granted the developer considerable latitude over the design and layout of the community, which will take shape over 15 to 20 years.\u201cThe three towns recognized an opportunity to do something quite extraordinary\u201d on a site where previous development plans stalled, said David P. Manfredi, a founding principal at Elkus Manfredi Architects, which helped create the master plan for Union Point. \u201cThis is an alternative to what could have been suburban sprawl.\u201dUnion Point promises to bring badly needed tax revenue to Weymouth, said the town\u2019s mayor, Robert L. Hedlund. \u201cIt\u2019s the commercial build-out that we\u2019re lusting after,\u201d he said.\u201cWhat they got wrong was any sort of sense of streetscape,\u201d said Mr. Rose, who has visited Songdo. \u201cThere\u2019s no sense of patina, no authentic street life. It\u2019s super sterile. It was built as this fantasy of the future, but it\u2019s a place that humans don\u2019t want to occupy.\u201d\u201cVery few local governments have thought through the long list of public- and private-sector values and concerns that should be deployed to constrain\u201d the use of autonomous cars, as well as the technologies being used to monitor city streets, said Susan Crawford, a Harvard Law School professor. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve given a developer license to deploy total surveillance, with no public limitations, you\u2019re done.\u201dLStar has considerable leeway to test technologies at Union Point. The developer is purposely holding on to its roads, rather than asking for them to be made public ways, to maintain flexibility in testing autonomous vehicles, lighting and other technologies, said Robert Luongo, Weymouth\u2019s director of planning and community development.\u201cIf these were public ways, we might not be able to give them that flexibility,\u201d he said.Mr. Corkum said retaining ownership of the roads would enable them to play with designs for amenities like drop-off areas for driverless shuttles and heated sidewalks. \u201cIt\u2019s better for us to stay in this testing phase until we have good workable solutions,\u201d he said.As for privacy concerns, Mr. Corkum said that he believed in setting boundaries on data collection and use. There is value in using technology to improve quality of life by, for instance, alleviating traffic jams, but he said he was wary of falling prey to a \u201cpreoccupation with optimization.\u201dThe company is working with law firms and consultants on operating guidelines for gathering and anonymizing data and ensuring it cannot be hacked or used to invade privacy, he said.\u201cI don\u2019t like the Big Brother notion that we know everything about you,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will use data for the benefit of the group, not in a way to leverage the group.\u201dAn earlier version of this article described incorrectly M.I.T.\u2019s involvement in the Union Point project. M.I.T. has discussed participating in the project but there is no formal agreement in place.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rick Scott Senate Run Returns Florida to Battleground", "Date": "2018-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMIAMI \u2014 Gov. Rick Scott made official on Monday what Floridians have suspected for months: He is running for the United States Senate against Bill Nelson, the incumbent Democrat, in a premier race that will return the nation\u2019s largest swing state to its familiar role as the political vortex of a tumultuous election year.\u201cThis is going to be a lot of fun,\u201d Mr. Scott, wearing his usual Navy baseball cap, said in an announcement on Facebook Live from an Orlando construction company, before embarking on the kind of statewide tour that has become his signature over two terms as governor. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make sure that Washington works for us.\u201dWith his formal entry into the campaign, Mr. Scott, a 65-year-old Republican, made Florida a centerpiece of the midterm elections, featuring one of the most expensive Senate races in the country, as well as an open governor\u2019s race and up to a half-dozen competitive House races. The contest between Mr. Nelson and Mr. Scott alone is expected to cost $100 million, or even much more, chiefly from spending on television advertising across Florida\u2019s 10 broadcast media markets. Mr. Scott, a multimillionaire former health care executive, invested millions of his own money into his successful campaigns for governor in 2010 and 2014.Since the 2000 presidential recount, Florida has become a perennial must-win state for both parties. Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign focused heavily on the state in 2016, and Republican leaders in Congress were so fearful of losing the Senate that year that they persuaded Senator Marco Rubio, who had announced his retirement to begin his own unsuccessful presidential bid, to seek re-election.Democrats need to flip two seats to piece together a majority in 2018. They have more competitive seats to defend than Republicans and cannot afford to lose Mr. Nelson, said Nathan Gonzales, the editor of Inside Elections.\u201cIf Democrats lose in Florida, it puts pressure on the party to win in much more Republican territory \u2014 in states such as Texas or Tennessee or Nebraska,\u201d Mr. Gonzales said.Mr. Scott\u2019s candidacy leaves Democrats with no choice but to divert time and money to Florida, where elections are close even in years in which national races are not as competitive. Former President Barack Obama won re-election comfortably in 2012, but only by one percentage point in Florida, for example.\u201cI\u2019ve always run every race like there\u2019s no tomorrow \u2014 regardless of my opponent,\u201d Mr. Nelson said in a statement on Monday. \u201cWhile it\u2019s clear that Rick Scott will say or do anything to get elected, I\u2019ve always believed that if you just do the right thing, the politics will take care of itself.\u201dNational Democrats already knew they would have to invest 2018 resources into the open governor\u2019s race to replace the term-limited Mr. Scott. Democrats last held the governorship 20 years ago. Mr. Trump has endorsed Representative Ron DeSantis of Palm Coast in the Republican primary.At the House level, the party also has targeted three seats held by Republican representatives in South Florida: Carlos Curbelo of Miami, Brian Mast of Palm City and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Miami, who is retiring. Democrats consider two other Republican-held seats in play, though they would be a bigger reach for the party.Republicans, for their part, are targeting two Democrats: Representatives Stephanie Murphy of Orlando and Charlie Crist of St. Petersburg.A full list of elections for the House and Senate, including which races matter most for congressional control.\u201cThe last three midterm elections have all been referendums of the president,\u201d said Steve Schale, a Democratic strategist in Tallahassee. Mr. Schale cautioned that the dynamics of the 2018 race would be fluid until October, but added: \u201cIf you want to send a message to Trump, are you going to do it by voting for his biggest champion in the Southeast?\u201dIn Mr. Scott, Mr. Nelson, 75, faces the toughest challenger of his Senate career, which began in 2001 after stints in the House and as the state\u2019s appointed treasurer in Tallahassee. Despite his many years of political experience, Mr. Nelson remains unknown to some voters; a February poll conducted by the Jacksonville-based Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy found that 12 percent of respondents did not know the senator\u2019s name, compared with 3 percent who did not recognize Mr. Scott\u2019s.Mr. Scott was written off by the Republican establishment when he began his first campaign for governor amid a Tea Party wave. He poured $73 million into the race, and his relentless jobs message won him the governor\u2019s mansion by a single percentage point over Alex Sink. He repeated his success in 2014, defeating Mr. Crist, again by a one-point margin.But Democrats note that Mr. Scott did not crack 50 percent of the vote in either race, suggesting he failed to excite as many voters in the Republican base as past candidates in years more favorable to the party than 2018. Florida Democrats have been on a rare streak since September, winning a swing State Senate district in Miami, the mayor\u2019s office in St. Petersburg and a Republican-leaning House district in Sarasota.\u201cScott has also never run weighed down by an unpopular G.O.P. president and Congress,\u201d Mindy Myers, executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said in a statement outlining her party\u2019s case against the governor. \u201cThis dynamic is sparking a backlash against G.O.P. candidates and deprives him of his traditional campaign message.\u201dThe president has publicly encouraged Mr. Scott, though the governor did not mention Mr. Trump in his announcement \u2014 possibly to distance himself from the problematic national political environment.In Orlando on Monday, Mr. Scott continued to cast himself as a confident outsider ready to upend the political status quo, despite seven years in Tallahassee in which he aligned himself with traditional Republican interests.\u201cI didn\u2019t fit into Tallahassee because I didn\u2019t play the insider games,\u201d Mr. Scott said, surrounded by supporters and declining to take questions from reporters. \u201cI never intended to fit into Tallahassee and, guess what? I\u2019m not going to fit into Washington, either.\u201dThe governor was introduced by Luis Rivera Mar\u00edn, the secretary of state of Puerto Rico, who made the trip to Orlando, a Puerto Rican stronghold that could see thousands of Hurricane Maria refugees register to vote before November. \u201cWe will be forever grateful to you, governor, for your knowledge on how to handle an emergency,\u201d Mr. Rivera Mar\u00edn said.Mr. Scott offered a few sentences in the serviceable Spanish he learned before his 2014 re-election. Often a man of few words, he spoke for a total of about 15 minutes, without a stage, lectern or visible script. He recalled being raised by a single mother, his marriage to his high school sweetheart and his unlikely political career. He said he would run in part on setting term limits for members of Congress.\u201cI will bust my butt to win this election,\u201d he said.Follow Patricia Mazzei on Twitter: @PatriciaMazzei.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Convict History Matters in Australia. But What Else?", "Date": "2018-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter 55______Our guides gave us clues more than conclusions. They pointed to the garden for guards\u2019 families, set up to resemble an English country estate. They told us about punishment. They shared tales of individual prisoners and the British commandants who ran the place.But it was the cemetery just off the coast that lingered in my mind.Port Arthur\u2019s upper-class overseers called it Isle of the Dead or Isle de Mort, and they were buried with headstones on the island\u2019s highest point.The convicts just called it Dead Island. Their remains landed in unmarked graves near the water so their watchmen, our guide told us, \u201ccould look down on them in death as in life.\u201dSome of the convicts probably deserved it. But walking among Port Arthur\u2019s dead, it was hard to escape the sanctimonious rigidity of the English class system, made even more extreme by the culture of 19th-century incarceration.I found myself imagining a prisoner who had arrived young, grinding out a 10-year sentence under the harsh condescension of British soldiers. He\u2019d depart with a skill \u2014 Port Arthur was basically an industrial labor camp \u2014 but how could he not also leave with a deep disgust for class distinctions and authority?Here, I thought, lie the roots of Australia\u2019s egalitarian ethos, traced back to a visceral rejection of the hierarchy that defined prison settlements like Port Arthur.This, after all, was the place for castoffs. Delinquent boys as young as 9 and troubled men with wives and children (not to mention a few meddlesome Irish and American activists) were all shipped off in former slave ships and put to work here in a country that was not easy to tame.The challenges of the land required camaraderie. The British system enforced divisions, putting a small elite above a mass of rebels and rogues. No wonder that those who stayed in Australia preferred to see themselves as \u201cmates\u201d more than gentlemen.Nick Dyrenfurth, a historian who wrote \u201cMateship: A Very Australian History,\u201d has argued that convicts were the first to embrace the concept.American culture bears a similar imprint. We like to see ourselves as revolutionaries who defeated British pomp and monarchy with guerrilla war tactics and demands for equality.But, of course, history is a forever struggle. What we choose to promote and overlook often changes, and reveals more than we may intend.Tasmania\u2019s convict past was also sidestepped for decades, with Port Arthur left in ruins before becoming what it is today: an impressive apparatus for remembering, complete with a ferry, interactive exhibit for children and well-trained guides.But seeing Port Arthur transformed raises additional questions. (The mass shooting that happened here in 1996 is a subject for another day.)His critique was not with remembering the Great War\u2019s heroes, but rather with the lack of investment in other elements of the country\u2019s past \u2014 one glaring blind spot in particular.\u201cWe could ask why \u2014 if we were actually genuine about remembering patriots who have died for this country \u2014 why would we not first spend $100 million on a museum honoring the at least 65,000 estimated Indigenous dead who so tragically lost their lives defending their country here in Australia in the frontier wars of the 1800s?\u201d he said. \u201cWhy is there nowhere in Australia telling the stories of the massacres, the dispossession and the courageous resistance of these patriots?\u201dHis full argument goes beyond questions and critique (though there are plenty of both). He also offers a path forward and a measure of hope even for those who disagree with him.And it\u2019s rooted in what I observed on Dead Island, in the way that the rigidity of one era had given birth to something more fluid, more equal and new.\u201cWe pretend that our national identity is a fixed, frozen thing,\u201d Richard said. \u201cBut Australia is a molten idea.\u201dIn other words, history matters not just because it never disappears, but also because it does not dictate. It can prompt change.The question is: How?I\u2019d love to hear about your views on that \u2014 and about your experiences with Australian history.When did you connect with the past in a way that felt real and revealing? Or when have you thought the process of remembering needed to evolve?Now for some of my favorite stories this week, and a recommendation we know you\u2019ll love.______Does the past hold too much sway for all of us, or just those who romanticize a rugged cruel occupation?__________________Time to mix it up: Here are a few things I\u2019ve been reading beyond The New York Times \u2026______\u201cA Quiet Place\u201d seems to be a local and international favorite.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Takes the Punches While Rest of Silicon Valley Ducks", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Two pages of notes sitting in a binder in front of Mark Zuckerberg during his congressional testimony this week hinted at a message the Facebook chief executive rarely got a chance to deliver: We\u2019re not the only ones.Mr. Zuckerberg was prepared to say that his company accounts for just a slice of the $650 billion advertising market and that it has plenty of competitors. Google, for example, has an online advertising business more than twice the size of Facebook\u2019s. And Google also collects vast amounts of information about the people who use its online services.But as Facebook has taken it on the chin over the way it has handled the personal information of its users, the leaders of other tech companies have demonstrated that even in publicity-hungry Silicon Valley, it is entirely possible for billionaire executives and their sprawling empires to keep a low profile.What set Mr. Zuckerberg apart? The personal information of up to 87 million Facebook users ended up in the hands of the voter-profiling firm Cambridge Analytica, which worked with the Trump campaign in the 2016 presidential election. Google and the biggest tech companies \u2014 as far as anyone knows \u2014 have never made such a giant mistake.Mr. Zuckerberg was the only executive to testify in two days of hearings this week. Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, and Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, were also asked to testify by the Senate Judiciary Committee.But when that hearing combined with one from another committee, which had not asked for Google or Twitter\u2019s participation, Mr. Pichai and Mr. Dorsey were let off the hook, said company officials and congressional aides.For now, at least.The companies have until April 25 to respond. When asked whether they were concerned about congressional or regulatory scrutiny, Google and Twitter, through company representatives, declined to comment.\u201cOutside of Facebook, there is probably no company paying more attention\u201d than Google, said Jason Kint, a frequent critic of Google and Facebook and chief executive of Digital Content Next, a trade group that represents entertainment and news organizations, including The New York Times. \u201cThey\u2019re absolutely ducking for cover while the heat is on Facebook. They don\u2019t want to try to trip any alarms.\u201dLike Facebook, Google collects vast amount of data on users \u2014 including their YouTube choices, internet searches and location history \u2014 to target advertisements. Facebook has more than two billion users globally, but Google has seven products, including YouTube, Gmail and its Android software, with more than a billion users each.On Wednesday, when Representative John Shimkus, Republican of Illinois, questioned Facebook\u2019s tracking of logged-off users, Mr. Zuckerberg was quick to point out that Google and \u201cthe rest of the industry\u201d employed similar tactics. It was one of the few times Google\u2019s data practices were mentioned in the two days of hearings.Mr. Zuckerberg did not get a chance to say much more about Facebook\u2019s industry peers this week. Over two days of hearings, Google was referenced 11 times by lawmakers. Twitter was mentioned 10 times and Amazon once. Apple was mentioned three times, mostly in passing.Google employees said they had not received explicit orders from management to keep a low profile because most already understood the risk. One employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because workers were not allowed to speak publicly on the issue, said there was an understanding inside Google that the company was the obvious next target.In a statement, Aaron Stein, a Google spokesman, said the company was \u201ccompletely focused on protecting our users\u2019 data\u201d and \u201cwill take action\u201d if it found evidence of \u201cdeceptive behavior or misuse of personal data.\u201dGoogle is staying on the sidelines in other ways. Four days before Mr. Zuckerberg was set to testify, Facebook surprised many in Washington when it endorsed the Honest Ads Act, a Senate bill that would require more transparency and stricter rules for political ads on the internet. Facebook\u2019s endorsement was a reversal from its previous opposition, said a spokeswoman for one of the bill\u2019s co-sponsors, Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia.Mr. Warner and another co-sponsor, Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, called on Twitter and Google to also back the bill. Twitter quickly responded with an endorsement.

The senator pressed what he may have taken to be his advantage: Might Zuckerberg, he continued, share the names of people with whom he\u2019d recently messaged? But Zuckerberg wasn\u2019t bothered to admit that there were things he would rather not divulge for unlimited American consumption. \u201cI think that may be what this is all about,\u201d Durbin replied, in a triumphal tone. \u201cYour right to privacy. The limits of your right to privacy. And how much you give away in modern America in the name of, quote, connecting people around the world.\u201dWhat Durbin discovered is that Zuckerberg was delighted to argue on that terrain. Facebook has no trouble endorsing an argument for privacy in the terms of revelation \u2014 the revelation of location information that might be seen by a knife-wielding antagonist, at an extreme, or simply the drunken photos that might be seen by your boss. Our company, he said countless times over the course of his own interrogation, has menus upon menus of options to restrict the information other people might see and has limited third-party access since 2015. Besides, most users believe that they know what they are and aren\u2019t broadcasting: If despised billionaires don\u2019t post their hotel information, they won\u2019t be killed, and if everybody else doesn\u2019t post drunken photos, they won\u2019t lose their jobs. All of this creates the impression that the adverse consequences of Facebook usage are only matters of disclosure, and that any breaches over the past few years are probably the user\u2019s own fault.Solove proposed we relinquish our \u201c1984\u201d fixation and find metaphorical support in Franz Kafka\u2019s \u201cThe Trial\u201d: \u201ca more thoughtless process of bureaucratic indifference, arbitrary errors and dehumanization, a world where people feel powerless and vulnerable, without any meaningful form of participation in the collection and use of their information.\u201d In part this is about the difference between state and corporate power, but it\u2019s also about effects subtler and further-reaching than the simple surveillance of what we mutter in bed.We ought to worry, on his view, much less about the Thought Police and much more about how our informational profiles harden into the invisible architecture of our everyday lives. It\u2019s not that we might be observed or killed in our sleep, but rather that the availability of loans or jobs or romantic partners or upscale hotel rooms are already being silently and automatically withdrawn from \u201cpeople like us\u201d \u2014 people with our politics, people of our skin color, people with certain friends or predispositions, people without the wealth and power of Mark Zuckerberg. Or, in the case of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, it\u2019s that our political affiliations are being arranged on the basis of our greatest vulnerabilities. Zuckerberg is more than happy to grant Durbin a victory that leaves all of this potential intact.There are a variety of possible policy implications \u2014 beginning with the idea that a one-size-fits-all legal-consent model, where clicking \u201cI agree\u201d signs all your data away, should be regarded as nonsense. But the idea of contextual integrity is most immediately useful as a diagnostic aid in the absence of dead bodies, a way to render precise our otherwise vague sense of agitation. It does a lot, for example, to explain exactly what\u2019s so unsettling about the Cambridge Analytica issue, and why the congressional hearings were so unsatisfying. Many of the questions from our elected officials seemed to turn on the epiphany that what seemed like a service to connect friends was actually a service to sell ads, but most Facebook users are neither that stupid nor that na\u00efve; everybody knows at this point that if you\u2019re not paying for something, you\u2019re the product being sold. Yes, that omnipresent shoe ad might be creepy, but as autonomous subjects we feel more than capable of simply not buying the shoes. Our decision to purchase one shoe over another doesn\u2019t seem to have broad social consequences.Until all of a sudden we weren\u2019t talking about shoe ads anymore, and we weren\u2019t talking about minor personal decisions that could easily be reversed. It turned out we had been prepared to accept some intermingling of the norms of personal communication with the norms of the commercial marketplace, but even the most cynical among us didn\u2019t quite realize the implications of letting all that bleed into the political. There was at last clear evidence to support a notion of privacy as a social good rather than an individual right \u2014 and, finally, a way to talk about why privacy matters without recourse to sensationalism. The \u201cdead bodies\u201d of the privacy debate might finally be laid to rest.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mastering the Art of Beef Stew", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe quest for a perfect beef stew is, of course, a lifelong one.It takes even longer after you realize that there isn\u2019t one perfect beef stew, but constellations of them. The dish is practically universal.But red wine and beef are such an elemental combination that a stew of the two together is worth studying.Stews with wine must be cooked slowly. The alcohol, acidity and fruitiness that make wine lovely in the glass are not so nice in the serving bowl; they have to be tamed by cooking. But the tangy, syrupy taste they leave behind is an ideal counterpoint to red meat.Like red wine, red meat benefits from slow, low cooking. You can read endless treatises by food science wonks about precisely how low-temperature cooking takes meat from tough to tender and back again, not to mention the roles played by plasma, muscle fibrils and collagen in how it tastes. But you don\u2019t need to know any of that \u2014 just as your grandparents didn\u2019t \u2014 to master a beef stew.What you do need to know is how to cook on low heat, which, in a modern kitchen, isn\u2019t as easy as you would think. Preindustrial recipes assume that you are cooking on a wood-fired or coal-fed stove; for a home cook, simmering a stew to tenderness could take hours or even days.For most of my life as a cook, whether making a stew, a braise, a daube or a rag\u00f9, I found it impossible to sustain \u201cgentle\u201d cooking on my gas burners. All those delicious French words for simmering: mijoter, to murmur; fr\u00e9mir, to shiver; mitonner, to cook quietly, were out of my reach. All I could do was bouillir (boil).I\u2019d tiptoe away from a barely simmering stew \u2014 as from a baby who has finally gone to sleep \u2014 and be summoned back five minutes later to find a heaving, splattering mass. While some cooks are on an eternal quest for more B.T.U.s, hotter surfaces and bigger flames, I wish for the stovetop equivalent of a Sterno can.So the first time I baked a stew in the oven, I felt as if someone had reinvented the wheel for me.Most of us rarely set our ovens below 325 degrees, but baking a stew at 300, or even 275, is ideal. The meat softens, but never collapses or becomes stringy. The liquid and aromatics are fused into the kind of rich, complex sauce that professional chefs used to spend decades learning to achieve.It does take a good three to five hours to cook a big batch of stew this way. I am quite comfortable leaving my house with the oven on low; many people are not. But beef stew is a movable feast: You can cook it at night or over the weekend; or cook it for half the time, then refrigerate (or, in cold weather, leave it in the turned-off oven overnight). The cooking process can be completed the next evening, or beyond, and the finished stew can wait days (in the refrigerator) before being served. (Like gingerbread, dark chocolate brownies and other dishes with powerfully flavored ingredients, red-wine beef stew benefits from a rest before serving.)In the oven, heat comes from all directions, not just from below, so there is no need to stir. All you need to capture it is a heavy pot with a heavy lid, like a Dutch oven or a cocotte. Because of the tight seal between pot and lid, the pressure in the pot seems to help the liquid penetrate the meat.It is true that (unlike the Crock-Pots of yore), these machines can saut\u00e9 just as well as most skillets; possibly better. Instead of having to raise and lower the heat as ingredients are added, a good saut\u00e9 function adjusts it for you.But, he acknowledged, only the intense, circulating heat of a traditional oven produces the kind of caramelized, varied texture in the meat that makes a stew truly great.And yet. To achieve his simulacrum of a slow-cooked, wine-infused stew, Mr. L\u00f3pez-Alt adds a slurry of Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, anchovies and powdered gelatin to the cooking liquid. I have nothing against these ingredients, but I did not want to use them as a back channel to the perfect beef stew.Eating it was rather like wearing a perfect knockoff of an expensive handbag: It may look and feel the same, and you may receive just as many compliments. But you know it\u2019s not the same, and that knowledge, if not the stew itself, leaves an odd aftertaste. It\u2019s worth saving up for the real thing.And to drink ...cookingAdvertisement"}

Chorus members. The names below the title. But should they still be called gypsies?The action is prompting a combination of reflection and head-scratching in the tight-knit theater world.Already, some locutions, like the term \u201cgypsy run-through\u201d to describe an industry-only dress rehearsal, have largely disappeared from use, and a Facebook group that provides lodging advice to chorus members has dropped the name \u201cGypsy Housing.\u201dEquity, which has been increasing its focus on diversity, has decided now is the moment for the term to go. \u201cWe have to be sensitive to the words we use,\u201d said R. Kim Jordan, the chairwoman of the union\u2019s Advisory Committee on Chorus Affairs. \u201cWe appropriated the name years ago, and we appropriated it lovingly, with no malintent, but it\u2019s no longer an appropriate name to use.\u201dTo many, the word Gypsy, referring to Roma people who migrated from India centuries ago, is pejorative, no matter the context.\u201cIt is an ethnic slur,\u201d said Carol Silverman, a professor of anthropology at the University of Oregon who describes herself as \u201c a non-Romany activist-scholar.\u201dShe said she was pleased by the union\u2019s decision: \u201cThis could serve as a model for other organizations.\u201d\u201cThe word Gypsy is being phased out in many places, since the Romany voice has gained strength in recent years and is voicing its objections,\u201d said Ian Hancock, director of the Romani Archives and Documentation Center at the University of Texas at Austin.The Equity Gypsy Robe ceremony dates to 1950. On opening night for every musical with a chorus, the robe is given to the person with the most Broadway chorus credits; the recipient puts on the robe, circles the stage three times to allow the rest of the cast to touch the robe and then visits each dressing room as a sort of good-luck blessing before the curtain goes up.Each show that gets the robe adds a memento, signed by cast members, and then the robe is passed to the next show that opens; when the robes get too big, they are retired, and some are in the collections of the Smithsonian Institution and the Museum of the City of New York.The history of the usage is not clear, but Laurence Maslon, an arts professor at New York University and the author of the forthcoming \u201cBroadway to Main Street,\u201d said it appears to relate to the fact that until the early 20th century, many American actors proudly earned a living by traveling from city to city. \u201cIt was a badge of honor, not a badge of shame, that you were itinerant,\u201d he said. \u201cYou saw more people that way.\u201dThe word deeply permeated the industry. In his 1963 autobiography, \u201cMister Abbott,\u201d the Broadway producer George Abbott wrote of Broadway dancers: \u201cWe call them the Gypsies, and they call themselves that. They are homeless, wandering people for the most part, defying all the conventions.\u201dMs. Jordan said there had been no pressure on Actors\u2019 Equity to change the ceremony name. And one scholar and activist contacted for this article had a mixed reaction to the move.Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS is sticking with \u201cGypsy of the Year\u201d for two annual performances that for 29 years have celebrated a fall fund-raising campaign. \u201cWords have different meanings depending on the context in which they are used,\u201d said Tom Viola, the nonprofit\u2019s executive director. \u201cEven words that may have once been intended as a slur can be, in fact, reclaimed with pride.\u201dMr. Viola said the performances celebrate \u201cthe talent, generosity and unique skills of those performing in the ensemble.\u201d He added, \u201cIn our theatrical community, \u2018the gypsy\u2019 is beloved.\u201dThe photo caption accompanying an earlier version of this article misidentified the \u201cCats\u201d cast member wearing the Gypsy Robe.

The group rented a giant walk-in freezer where items are stored to kill mold.On a recent morning the brigade descended on a one-story, wooden ranch house wrecked by the mudflows.

Tammie Jo Shults was steering a Southwest Airlines plane toward cruising altitude, generally considered the safest part of a flight. But then the left engine exploded.The blast hurled debris into the side of the plane. A passenger window shattered. The cabin depressurized. A woman was partly sucked outside the plane. Passengers panicked and flight attendants sprang into action.In the cockpit, Captain Shults remained calm as she steadied the aircraft, Flight 1380. \u201cSouthwest 1380 has an engine fire,\u201d Captain Shults radioed to air traffic controllers, not a hint of alarm in her voice. \u201cDescending.\u201dIn an instant, Captain Shults found herself in a situation most pilots face only during training: having to land a plane after an engine goes out.For the next 40 minutes, she displayed what one passenger later called \u201cnerves of steel,\u201d maneuvering the plane, which had been on its way from La Guardia Airport in New York to Dallas Love Field, toward Philadelphia for an emergency landing.In the seats behind her, passengers sent goodbye text messages to loved ones, tightened oxygen masks around their faces and braced for impact. Flight attendants frantically performed CPR on the critically injured passenger, who later died at a hospital.But Captain Shults, 56, was in control. She learned to fly as one of the first female fighter pilots in the Navy three decades ago, piloting the F/A-18 Hornet in an era when women were barred from combat missions.At 11:20 a.m., Captain Shults steered the plane, a two-engine Boeing 737, to a smooth landing on Runway 27L at Philadelphia International Airport. The left engine looked as if it had been ripped apart.Another passenger, Alfred Tumlinson, was more direct in his praise. \u201cShe has nerves of steel,\u201d Mr. Tumlinson told The Associated Press. \u201cI\u2019m going to send her a Christmas card \u2014 I\u2019m going to tell you that \u2014 with a gift certificate for getting me on the ground. She was awesome.\u201dWhile women still make up a small percentage of commercial pilots, Captain Shults took up flying when there were far fewer in the industry and when women were often told to find other careers. In her junior year at MidAmerica Nazarene University in Olathe, Kan., she attended an Air Force event and spotted a woman in a piloting class, she told an alumni publication.She graduated from MidAmerica in 1983 with a bachelor\u2019s degree in biology and agribusiness and then set off to join the military, the university said on Wednesday. The Air Force would not accept her, she told the publication, but the Navy would. She enrolled in Navy flight school in Pensacola, Fla., in 1985 \u2014 the start of a decade of groundbreaking service.\u201cWe can confirm that Lt. Commander Shults was among the first cohort of women pilots to transition to tactical aircraft,\u201d the Navy said in a statement on Wednesday.She flew the F/A-18 Hornet, the twin-engine supersonic fighter jet and bomber. After flight school, in 1989, she was assigned to the Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron 34 in Point Mugu, Calif. During the Gulf War, her squadron was led by the first female air commander in the Navy.But despite her accomplishments, she came up against the limits placed on women in the military. She left active service on March 31, 1993 \u2014 two days before the Navy asked the Clinton administration to open combat assignments to women. She then spent about a year in reserves before leaving the military in 1994, reaching the rank of lieutenant commander.Captain Shults later became a pilot with Southwest Airlines, as did her husband, Dean M. Shults. Southwest Airlines declined to comment about her on Wednesday.In a brief telephone interview on Wednesday, Mr. Shults declined to comment, other than to say: \u201cThe media has it right \u2014 she\u2019s a hero, and I\u2019m proud to be her husband.\u201dAfter her name started to appear in news reports on Tuesday, fellow female fighter pilots started to message one another about Captain Shults. Christine Westrich, who flew the F/A-18 in the Marine Corps in the late 1990s, said she was struck by her service.\u201cShe is undoubtedly a pioneer, being a Hornet driver well before the combat exclusion law was lifted,\u201d Ms. Westrich said in an interview. \u201cShe kicks ass in my book.\u201dGet what you need to start your day.

When additional deputies responded to the restaurant, Ace China, they found both the deputies dead inside it, and the suspect \u2014 John Hubert Highnote, 59, of nearby Bell \u2014 dead in his parked car outside the restaurant with a self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to the Gilchrist County Sheriff\u2019s Office.The office said that the suspect had ambushed the deputies and that the motive was unclear. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is investigating.Sheriff Schultz identified the victims as Sgt. Noel Ramirez, 29, and Deputy Taylor Lindsey, 25. Sergeant Ramirez, who joined the department in 2016, was married with two young children, and Deputy Lindsey was unmarried but had a girlfriend.\u201cI made contact with the families, and as you\u2019d expect, you can never be prepared for something like this,\u201d Sheriff Schultz said. \u201cBut make no mistake, they\u2019re proud of their families. They understood when their loved ones pinned on the badge and they strapped on the gun that this was a possibility.\u201dTrenton, the seat of rural Gilchrist County, is a small town of around 2,000 residents, but the killing of the deputies drew the attention and condolences of national officials. Sheriff Schultz said his department\u2019s small size, with just 27 deputies, made their deaths especially painful.A candlelight vigil is planned for Saturday night in Trenton.The authorities released few details about Mr. Highnote, but property records show he lived on several acres of land off a dirt road in Bell, a town of about 450 people. His home is about 10 miles from the Ace China restaurant in Trenton.Before moving to Bell, Mr. Highnote lived in the Tampa-St. Petersburgh area. He was convicted in 1978 for a carrying a concealed weapon near Tampa but the charge was dismissed in 1980, according to court records.The authorities said on Thursday that Mr. Highnote shot the deputies through a window of the restaurant. But a spokesman for the Alachua County Sheriff\u2019s Office, which is assisting in the investigation, said on Friday that Mr. Highnote walked inside Ace China and shot them while they were sitting down.\u201cWe have no information right now that our officers were able to return fire,\u201d the Alachua County spokesman said at a news conference on Friday afternoon.The Florida attorney general, Pam Bondi, expressed her \u201cdeepest condolences and prayers\u201d and said in a statement, \u201cThe daily risk that law enforcement officers take to protect our communities is overwhelming.\u201dIn his news conference, Sheriff Schultz said his department would \u201chonor these men by doing our jobs.\u201d\u201cWe haven\u2019t been through anything quite like this before, but what makes our county unique is that we\u2019re a family,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to grieve. We\u2019re going to get upset. We\u2019re probably going to cuss a little bit. But at the end of the day, we\u2019re going to remember those two men for who they are. They\u2019re heroes.\u201dMatthew Haag and Maya Salam contributed reporting. Susan Beachy contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When There\u2019s More to the Story Than Basketball", "Date": "2018-04-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn March 2017, I was on a reporting trip, traveling through Montana\u2019s Flathead Indian Reservation. I saw a sign in Arlee, a small town in the foothills of the spectacular Mission Range, indicating that the boys\u2019 high school basketball team, the Warriors, had won a state championship. I proposed a profile of its star, Phillip Malatare, who was then a junior, to my editor at The Times Magazine, Charles Homans. The plan was to follow Phil, a Division I prospect, as he tried to reach a college program.I told Mr. Whitesell, Phil\u2019s parents and the team\u2019s coach, Zanen Pitts, that the story was about a season with the basketball team, but that if they decided to grant access I would also cover the adversity the community had faced. They all decided to welcome me. They were proud of their athletic success and wanted their story told.Over the course of the coming year, I would join Mr. Pitts at rodeos and a cattle branding; accompany Phil Malatare\u2019s father buffalo hunting; and spend months living on the Flathead reservation. The team\u2019s games were expressions of joy for the boys and gathering places for the community. The Warriors beat two different opponents by the score of 95-19. Much of my reporting centered around the efforts of Phil and another senior to get noticed by college coaches.Then, in February, one of the Warriors\u2019 opponents from another team on the reservation committed suicide. People in the community were concerned that another cluster might start.The team decided to make a prevention video. After it took off on social media, I saw a demonstrable change in many of the players. Discussing the issue seemed to be a relief. On the Monday before their championship tournament, they skipped practice to make another prevention video. (In Montana, where high school basketball is sacrosanct, the notion of skipping practice before the state tournament is unheard-of.)I remember watching Greg Whitesell\u2019s face light up as he stared into his smartphone while standing in the hallway of a hotel in Butte, Mont., before the championship tournament began. Greg was a co-captain and Mr. Whitesell\u2019s son. \u201cPretty sweet,\u201d he said as he watched the video. The team had just released it on Facebook, and the views were mounting by the thousands. The video showed Greg throwing an alley-oop to a teammate, who hung off the rim and talked about bullying.\u201cThis one a lot more kids can relate to,\u201d Greg said. Another player, a junior, said, \u201cIt feels better to get it out than to hold it in.\u201d He\u2019d struggled early in high school, failing many classes.Now the player was academically eligible and would be riling up the crowd during the state tournament. He wore a sharp button-down shirt. \u201cI\u2019m probably the happiest I\u2019ve ever been,\u201d he said.In another hotel room, Phil played Fortnite, the video game. In between blasting foes on the screen he said: \u201cBoys can\u2019t fricking hide feelings forever. Everybody has something wrong.\u201dAfter the season ended in a stunning fashion, Greg reached out to me. He wanted to talk about how he\u2019d battled suicidal thoughts earlier in the school year, before the season. He, his parents and I discussed the matter repeatedly, with me cautioning about the level of exposure the revelation could bring. But Greg thought other kids might relate to his story. \u201cI would like to have it in there,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Should Consider a \u2018Why Me?\u2019 Button", "Date": "2018-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBook\u201cOne of our biggest responsibilities is to protect data.\u201dOver the past year, the downside of social media companies \u2014 Facebook foremost among them \u2014 has become glaringly apparent. They have been platforms for information campaigns that influenced elections and endangered lives. They have failed to keep users\u2019 personal information private. And the carefully targeted ads that appear on them can be, well, creepy.It is not clear that Facebook will be able to stave off regulators, but Mr. Zuckerberg and his colleagues might want to consider this: a \u201cWhy Me?\u201d button. (Google, Amazon and others might want to take note, too.)Facebook suffers from a lack of trust because of the asymmetrical nature of the relationship users have with it. We provide it all sorts of information. But we have no idea how the information is being used, how our data is being harvested, how that data is being commingled and cross-referenced with other data sets and ultimately sold to advertisers. (Facebook already has a button, relatively buried in a list of other items, that it calls \u201cWhy Am I Seeing This Ad?\u201d It is, to some degree, a crippled version of what I\u2019m suggesting should be introduced on all of Facebook\u2019s properties.)To his credit, Mr. Zuckerberg does appear to recognize the problem that his company faces over privacy concerns. After acknowledging that protecting users\u2019 data is one of the company\u2019s biggest responsibilities, he went on to say, \u201cIf you think about what our services are, at their most basic level, you put some content into a service, whether it\u2019s a photo or a video or a text message \u2014 whether it\u2019s Facebook or WhatsApp or Instagram \u2014 and you\u2019re trusting that that content is going to be shared with the people you want to share it with.\u201dThat\u2019s where the \u201cWhy Me?\u201d button could help. This button would sit next to every advertisement and piece of content that appears before you on all of Facebook\u2019s properties, including Instagram and WhatsApp.If you saw an ad or an article pop up on your screen, you could click the \u201cWhy Me?\u201d button. Then you would see a full explanation of why that item was pushed to you.The \u201cWhy Me?\u201d explanation would not just include the name of the advertiser, but what keywords, demographics or other information the advertiser specifically targeted. It would also offer a full rundown of how your information fit into the parameters of the advertiser\u2019s request and where that information came from.Maybe Facebook saw that you had clicked on a pair of sneakers on a different service that shares information with Facebook. The \u201cWhy Me?\u201d section would show you when and where that information was collected. Did Facebook notice you searched for a new cellphone plan? Facebook would tell how it knew that, too.Did Facebook use artificial intelligence to find your face in an image without you or anyone else labeling it? The \u201cWhy Me?\u201d section would show you the images that the artificial intelligence system cross-referenced to identify you. Did Facebook scrape another site or buy information about you that it commingled with the data that you had provided? It would tell you that, too.Most important, at every point in the \u201cexplanation tree,\u201d the user would have the option to turn off or disable that specific piece of data. Facebook, of course, could \u2014 and probably should \u2014 explain the trade-offs of such decisions.The \u201cWhy Me?\u201d button could also be extended to content. When a friend or company shares a post, Facebook doesn\u2019t just display it to everyone listed as the poster\u2019s friend or follower. Facebook\u2019s algorithms choose which friends and followers see it based on all sorts of parameters, usually related to the kind of content or how you\u2019ve interacted with the friend in the past.The \u201cWhy Me?\u201d button should explain all the data points that are used in the calculation and how they are weighted.The current \u201cWhy Am I Seeing This Ad?\u201d often says something like: \u201cCompany A wants to reach people ages 18 and older who live or were recently in the United States. This is information based on your Facebook profile and where you\u2019ve connected to the internet.\u201dBut it hardly tells you the whole story. Facebook doesn\u2019t say so explicitly, but it allows companies to upload their own databases, cross-reference them with Facebook\u2019s data and use that information to serve ads to users. It also doesn\u2019t say how that other site originally got that information about who you are.In fairness, the \u201cWhy Me?\u201d button might create all sorts of problems for Facebook, and its advertisers, too. It would allow users \u2014 and rivals \u2014 to reverse engineer much of the way the system works. And advertisers would probably object to the idea of making their targeting plans public. But that would be the cost of using such large public platforms with such exact targeting.It has become something of a clich\u00e9, but in 1913, before he became a Supreme Court justice, Louis D. Brandeis said, \u201cSunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.\u201dIt could well be applied today at Facebook \u2014 and its peer companies \u2014 if it wants to avoid a governmental crackdown.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "For These Characters, Foreign Cultures Are Just Another Consumer Good", "Date": "2018-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.The Australian novelist Michelle de Kretser has made a habit of disputing the notion that travel necessarily broadens the mind. Her fourth novel, \u201cQuestions of Travel,\u201d which won Australia\u2019s most prestigious literary award, the Miles Franklin, contrasted the journeys of an asylum-seeker from the subcontinent with those of a backpacking travel-guide writer from Sydney. The characters in \u201cThe Life to Come,\u201d de Kretser\u2019s fifth novel, are similarly peripatetic. While they all eventually enjoy a comfortable life in suburban Sydney, some are dogged by memories of past lives in violent places. The memory of a stretch of wall split by the sun transports an elderly woman back to her childhood in Sri Lanka: \u201cPictures like that were always there, running invisibly under her Australian life, appearing now and again like snatches of an old videotape that a later recording has overlaid without entirely erasing.\u201dThe \u00e9migr\u00e9 is one kind of traveler, portrayed here with sympathy and lyricism. But de Kretser, who was born in Sri Lanka and came to Australia at 14, saves her startling satirical firepower for another \u2014 the expats of the global West, or those who can travel on a whim. In a novel that restlessly spans decades and continents, a woman named Pippa is as close as de Kretser gets to a protagonist. It is Pippa\u2019s friends, colleagues and acquaintances whose stories we learn via impressionistic flashbacks. In the late 1990s, when we meet her, she is an idealistic undergraduate in Sydney who announces \u201cI love India\u201d after watching a documentary on TV. Over time, she becomes a more interesting character, a full-fledged writer who seeks experiences in the world with which to animate her fiction. Yet Pippa remains na\u00efve. She preaches empathy for refugees on Facebook, but is careless of the inner lives of others.In 2010, Pippa goes to Paris on a writing fellowship. (The ensuing novel, \u201cFrench Lessons,\u201d is a flop.) Her approach to other cultures is uncomplicated. Europe, she thinks, is \u201cmomentous and world-historical\u201d; Australia, \u201ceventless.\u201d Plus, there\u2019s all that foreign food, which can be recreated at Instagram-worthy dinner parties back home. Many scenes revolve around Pippa in the kitchen, whipping up something ostentatiously multicultural: a lamb tagine with saffron, carrots and fennel for a sick neighbor; a salad of pork and ginger during a Thai phase; local prawns for her literary agent served with lemon juice, brown bread and butter. Meals like these are as familiar in Brooklyn or Portland as they are in inner-city Sydney. Call it the cult of Ottolenghi \u2014 that trendy Israeli-British chef is name-checked on more than one occasion.In one scene, the function of food as a status symbol for globe-trotting cosmopolites becomes clear. During her time in Paris, Pippa befriends C\u00e9leste, an older woman who lives alone. C\u00e9leste\u2019s father died in the aftermath of the massacre of Algerians in the French capital in 1961; her mother remarried an Australian man she met on the M\u00e9tro. The family emigrated to Western Australia, but in adulthood C\u00e9leste found her way back to Paris as a translator. (This is the kind of fractured life, filled with loss and hard-won visa stamps, that de Kretser protects from ridicule.) Relatives visiting from Perth come over to C\u00e9leste\u2019s small apartment for lunch, and she prepares gratin dauphinois, chicken in a wine sauce and asparagus from the market.The Australians, flush with money from the mining boom of the new millennium, push the meal around on their plates and talk of how they eat at home: quinoa and broad bean salad, barley with pomegranate seeds. \u201cWhy do Australians go on so much about food?\u201d C\u00e9leste asks her mother afterward on Skype. Her mother\u2019s reply is brutal. \u201cBecause they live in a country of no importance.\u201d For a novel concerned with dislocation, there\u2019s a lot of grounding humor in \u201cThe Life to Come.\u201d Most of it comes at the expense of Pippa and her ilk, but de Kretser\u2019s observations are so spot on, you\u2019ll forgive her even as you cringe.An earlier version of this review referred incorrectly to Michelle de Kretser\u2019s novel \u201cQuestions of Travel.\u201d It was her fourth novel, not her third.Amelia Lester, a writer based in Japan, is working on a collection of essays.Advertisement"}

The possibility of anything bad happening to her seemed remote and decades away. The din of midday Midtown swallowed her words. A routine exam a week earlier had found a lump, and the results from her mammogram had been concerning enough that the doctor immediately picked up the phone and called her. I left my office to meet her, unsure what to expect. Some people exude resilience and fortitude in the midst of adversity. I am not one of them. My first thought is of certain and immediate death, followed by a maudlin song orchestrating a montage of good moments. I don\u2019t call my smartest doctor friend and ask him what to do. I start writing the eulogy. Sarah and I met outside a church on Fifth Avenue, her eyes already steeled with resolve.\u201cI\u2019ve emailed my boss and will go to Germany tomorrow as planned,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll still meet me in Italy.\u201dOur honeymoon in Venice was two days away. We had planned it to coincide with one of her business trips; she would fly over first, and I would take the red-eye two days later. Even before we had the confirmation that it was cancer, we knew it was, and I immediately started thinking about a drink. It was a benchmark I had never wanted to hit, and here it was, staring me down.Sarah and I were set up on a blind date. I was in New York for work, and at one of my meetings, a man I barely knew asked me if I was seeing anyone. He was about to get married, and I was petrified this would turn into one of those exchanges in which the happy person assures the single person: \u201cThere\u2019s hope for you yet.\u201dHe had little interest in my explanation (\u201cSingle, yes, but fulfilled!\u201d) and much more interest in the truth: Yes, I was as single as single could be.\u201cI want you to meet a friend of mine,\u201d he said. \u201cI think you\u2019d get along.\u201d He swiftly arranged for us to meet that day.Later I walked into a bar off Central Park and was shocked to find a gorgeous woman, complete with perfectly styled hair and makeup, waiting at the bar. This couldn\u2019t possibly be my date. Half of my head was buzzed, and I was hanging on to my baby fat not in a baby-cute way.She ordered a club soda with a splash of cranberry. I ordered wine. Twice. The first question she asked was why I had moved from New York, and for some reason the answer that came out was: \u201cLove, but not great love, because less than a year later I was dumped naked.\u201dShe sat there politely, and I realized with growing horror that we were both picturing me getting dumped naked.\u201cI live in a sublet in Long Island City,\u201d she finally said. \u201cAnd sometimes I go grocery shopping at the Mobile Mart.\u201dShe was as kind as she was pretty. I may have been dumped naked, but at least I could get myself to a proper grocery store.We left after an hour and I went uptown, embarking on the exact kind of New York night that made me miss the city so badly. I assumed we didn\u2019t have much of a future: We were 10 years apart, shared no hobbies and I drank. What fun could possibly come from sobriety?A few weeks into our courtship \u2014 started mainly because we kept responding to each other\u2019s emails \u2014 we were walking through Chelsea Market. Our hands grazed, and as I glimpsed up at the back of her head, I had this feeling deep in my gut that I would love her. Not in that moment, not yet, but I knew in the way seasons change that I would love her before this one ended. I asked her early on why she had stopped drinking, and she described feeling as if everyone around her had known to get on a train moving forward, but she was watching from the road as these people slowly passed her by.I took stock of my life: a new relationship, wonderful friends, a rewarding job. Drinking had not kept me off the train. My heart exhaled; maybe I was safe. A few months later I was out late, propelled by a thirst to belong, and I walked unsteadily into the bathroom. The mirror caught my reflection, and suddenly I was squinting into my eyes, trying to figure out how I could be madly in love with someone but know in my core that if the person I was drinking with at this bar made a move, I would go along with it.The next morning I called Sarah. \u201cI don\u2019t have a healthy relationship with alcohol,\u201d I said, cursing myself for saying it out loud because I knew she could never unhear it. But I knew: If I drank, I would cheat, and she would leave. She had the tools and presence to move on, and I didn\u2019t. She would be the one who got away. So I stopped drinking, and my life jolted forward at an unbelievable clip: a cross-country move, a career change, cohabitation, another career change, an engagement, homeownership, marriage. Also: death, professional challenges, family politics gone awry, financial anxiety, actual anxiety and, now, cancer. Two days later I sat in the United lounge, looking at fellow travelers, the clock, my phone and my club soda. A man with a fedora sipped something brown on the rocks; a woman left smudged lipstick on what looked like a wine spritzer. A little boy watched his parents drink, his eyes moving from her red wine to his beer, his head moving slightly between the two. I saw a young couple \u2014 honeymooners, too? \u2014 toast with champagne flutes. I looked down at my club soda. The ice was mostly melted. If I drank now, could I pause my life again? Could Sarah and I go back to that first summer, when everything was still a possibility? I imagined the coldness of the chardonnay leaving an imprint on every cell as it traveled down my throat. My back would loosen, my thoughts would get fuzzy in the best way.I could call an old friend, chat about mindless gossip as I waited to board. The bartender wouldn\u2019t think twice about giving me a pour for the road. The flight attendant wouldn\u2019t cock her head when I asked if I could have both red and white with dinner. Sarah would never have to know. No one would.Except, I would know. The thing I prized most about our relationship was that Sarah knew everything about me \u2014 and loved me anyway. If I were to drink, that secret would be the first brick in a wall between us.I thought about that night in the bathroom and how scared I was that Sarah might be really sick. For me to escape into drinking now would be to leave her alone.I watched the wall grow, brick by brick. My stomach clenched at the thought of Sarah sitting in a doctor\u2019s chair, wondering where I had gone. I thought of months down the road, when we would get test results back saying she would need surgery and chemotherapy and radiation \u2014 neither of us knowing at the time that she would come through it and be fine.All I could see was Sarah reaching for my hand, and there I would be, locked up with my secrets, navigating a dark cave while wishing I had chosen the brighter path.A ding and a scratchy female voice announced that my flight was starting to board.I didn\u2019t want to escape, regardless of what may be hiding in the future. The flight passed unremarkably: I watched a movie, slept, ignored the wine cart at dinnertime. And in the morning, Sarah was waiting at my gate in Milan, cappuccino and croissant in hand.Liz Parker is a literary agent in New York City.Advertisement"}

He planned to see friends from the Canadian Naval Reserves, and had promised to bring them a local delicacy from home: Chris Brothers TNT Pepperoni.He filled a whole suitcase. \u201cI brought enough for a ship,\u201d he wrote.When he landed, the airline could not find the bag. But it arrived the next day, after he had checked into the Empress on the fourth floor. His room had no refrigerator, and he worried about keeping the meat cool.But the room had a nicely appointed window, and there was a chill in the April air. A plan formed: Why not spread the meat on a table next to an open window and on the window sill to keep it cool? So he did.Then he went for a walk.\u201cThey\u2019d been eating Brothers TNT pepperoni \u2014 I\u2019m specific with the TNT because it\u2019s hot,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThey\u2019d been eating that for about five hours, and you can imagine what the room looked like. They were carrying on their life processes in there.\u201dExcrement, feathers and pepperoni chunks were everywhere.\u201cBrothers\u2019 TNT Pepperoni does NASTY things to a sea gull\u2019s digestive system,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe smell,\u201d he recalled in the radio interview, \u201cwas overwhelming.\u201d\u201cThe shocking thing for me was the saliva,\u201d he marveled. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that sea gulls drooled. The slime was covering everything. They were whipping it up into the air. It was like a tornado.\u201dHis sudden appearance startled the birds, which tried to leave but kept crashing into the lamps and the curtains.Most people would\u2019ve probably called housekeeping then. But Mr. Burchill waded in and tried to take back his room. He said he opened all the windows to let the birds out. When one tried to return, he hurled a shoe \u2014 light brown. Shoe and bird sailed out of the window.One bird did not seem to want to leave, so he flung a bath towel over it and threw it out, as well. \u201cI had forgotten that sea gulls cannot fly when they are wrapped in a towel,\u201d he admitted.This all occurred during high tea at the hotel. Tourists were lined up beneath his window. Both the wrapped-up sea gull and the shoe landed on them.His troubles weren\u2019t over. To get to a work dinner, Mr. Burchill retrieved his shoe, cleaned it off and jammed a hair dryer into it. But the phone rang, and while he was out of the room, he said, the hair dryer \u201cvibrated free\u201d from the shoe and fell into a sink full of water, knocking out the power.Finally, sitting amid the mess, he summoned housekeeping.\u201cI can still remember the look on the lady\u2019s face when she opened the door,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI had absolutely no idea what to tell her, so I just said, \u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 and I went to dinner.\u201dWhy didn\u2019t he call for help straight away? \u201cTo tell you the truth, I thought I could handle it,\u201d he told the radio hosts.Afterward, the letter sent to his company laid out the stark terms: He was never, ever to set foot in the hotel again.In March, Mr. Burchill was across the street from the Empress when he decided to send the letter, emphasizing how much he had matured. And who knows? Maybe memories of feathered slime and pepperoni chunks had faded.Two days later, Mr. Burchill said, he received a phone call from a manager \u2014 who was laughing. The ban, at last, was lifted.\u201cI have to say, it absolutely made our week,\u201d the hotel\u2019s general manager, Indu Brar, recalled of the letter.When his story bubbled up on social media, it buoyed readers far and wide. Mr. Burchill said it might be because \u201cthe whole world is so stressed out right now that they were looking for an excuse to laugh.\u201dHe recently made a bold peace offering to the hotel staff: a pound of Brothers\u2019 TNT Pepperoni. He also asked Ms. Brar for an official written version of the \u201cpardon.\u201dShe obliged, and invited him and his family to stay at the Empress the next time they visited Victoria.Ms. Brar had one stipulation (well, two), she said by email: \u201cAs long as he leaves the pepperoni in Nova Scotia and keeps his hotel room window closed, he is welcome back any time.\u201dCatherine Porter contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Oprah, Rupert Murdoch, Harvard: Saudi Prince\u2019s U.S. Tour", "Date": "2018-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 He talked about the movie business with Michael Douglas, Morgan Freeman and Dwayne Johnson over dinner at Rupert Murdoch\u2019s house. He discussed space travel with Richard Branson in the California desert, and philanthropy with Bill Gates and technology with Jeff Bezos in Seattle. He visited Harvard and MIT, brokered arms deals with President Trump and sat down with Wall Street financiers. He even met with Oprah Winfrey.For nearly three weeks, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the 32-year-old heir to the Saudi throne, has crisscrossed the United States, on an ambitious, choreographed journey through modern American life, while under heavy guard because of his many enemies in the Middle East.The prince, who arrived in America with a reputation as an aggressive consolidator of power back home and a zealous interventionist abroad, is seeking to change the perception of Saudi Arabia from an opaque and conservative kingdom, where mosques promote extremist ideology and women are relegated to second-class status, to a modernist desert oasis.Prince Mohammed also has sought to attract American investors for industries going well beyond Saudi Arabia\u2019s Aramco petroleum giant. He is pressing what he has described as a transformative economic agenda, to wean the kingdom from reliance on oil and diversify its economy through public infrastructure investments and development of an entertainment industry \u2014 including theme parks along the lines of Six Flags and Disney.\u201cI think it\u2019s brilliant and I will tell you why,\u201d said Adam Aron, the chief executive of the movie theater chain AMC, who has met with the prince. \u201cThe crown prince is aware that Saudi Arabia has had a difficult image in the United States, because it\u2019s been such a conservative country for so many decades. He wants to transform Saudi society in ways that will be very appealing to Americans.\u201dMr. Aron spoke this week in a reception area of the Four Seasons in Los Angeles, as attendees of a Saudi conference on the entertainment business ate from a spread of Middle Eastern dishes \u2014 lamb kebabs, hummus, tabbouleh. They were entertained by an oud player. Officials spoke about plans to open up the country to concerts, jazz festivals and movies, all an attempt, in the words of one Saudi official, to \u201cdrive happiness\u201d in the kingdom, where 70 percent of the population is under 30, and many are glued to their smartphones.Mr. Aron said men and women would be able to attend films together, a revolutionary step in Saudi Arabia, where public space has long been strictly segregated by gender. He said Hollywood films would be censored in the same way they were in other places across the Middle East: sex out, violence in.\u201cEven then, the scope wasn\u2019t what you see today,\u201d said Mohammed K. Alyahya, a Saudi expert at the Atlantic Council in Washington. \u201cThis is really across the board. It signals that there is deep cooperation beyond just security for oil.\u201d\u201cFor the longest time the Saudis wouldn\u2019t explain themselves, and explain why things were happening in their country,\u201d Mr. Alyahya added. \u201cThat is changing dramatically.\u201dThe prince\u2019s American tour followed a similar visit to Britain, where he soaked in the royal treatment and dined with the queen. And as in the United States, local lobbying and public relations firms helped present an image of the prince as an economic and social reformer. In London, ads appeared on billboards and the sides of black cabs: \u201cHe is bringing change to Saudi Arabia.\u201d \u201cHe is empowering Saudi Arabian women.\u201d \u201cHe is opening Saudi Arabia to the world.\u201dFor decades, the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia could be distilled into one proposition: access to oil for the Americans, and a guarantee that the Americans would protect Saudi Arabia from enemies, especially its chief rival, Iran.Prince Mohammed\u2019s trip began in Washington, where he met with President Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who share the prince\u2019s antipathy for Iran and have deepened relations with the Saudis to counter Iran\u2019s growing influence in the Middle East.The trip ends this weekend in Texas, where the prince meets with oil executives and two former presidents, George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush.Prince Mohammed also has been sharply criticized by human rights activists for waging a bombing campaign in Yemen, where thousands of civilians have been killed, and for cracking down on dissent by jailing bloggers. And in playing to an American audience the prince has faced longstanding concerns over the efforts of Saudi Arabian clerics to export extremist Islamist ideology, beliefs that underpin terrorist groups like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State.Part of the prince\u2019s rebranding of his nation \u2014 and his attempt to address the issue of religious extremism for a country that was home to 15 of the 19 hijackers in the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 \u2014 is a piece of revisionism, say analysts. The prince has argued, in interviews around his trip, that extremism in Saudi Arabia is traceable to the 1979 revolution in Shiite Iran, whose rivalry with Sunni-dominated Saudi Arabia has inflamed sectarian tensions that divide the Middle East.\u201cIt\u2019s really a rewriting of Saudi history,\u201d said Karen E. Young, an expert on Saudi Arabia at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. Ms. Young said that conservative Muslim strains had always coursed through Saudi society, but that drawing a line between before 1979 and after \u201cplays into this rhetoric of the world against Iran.\u201dIt also plays to the sentiments of the Trump administration, which has taken a tougher line and has threatened to tear up the 2015 deal the Obama administration negotiated to curtail Iran\u2019s nuclear program.For the most part, human rights concerns have not overshadowed the prince\u2019s American journey. At the dinner at Mr. Murdoch\u2019s house, for instance, where guests \u2014 but not the prince himself \u2014 drank wine from the media mogul\u2019s vineyard, the prince spoke about empowering women in Saudi Arabia, where they will soon be able to drive for the first time in decades, and movie investments in the kingdom. He was not pressed on human rights issues, said one attendee, who described the evening as informal and the prince as \u201ccarefully candid.\u201dMayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles was one of the few Americans who met with Prince Mohammed and in public stressed human rights issues. In a statement, the mayor said he \u201curged the Crown Prince to continue his efforts to advance women\u2019s rights, and raised concerns about human rights and the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Yemen.\u201dIn Los Angeles, Prince Mohammed\u2019s visit drew a smattering of protests. \u201cHe\u2019s coming here under the guise that he\u2019s some great reformer and changing the country,\u201d said Michelle Modglin, 67, a retired nurse, demonstrating outside the Beverly Hills office of the William Morris Endeavor talent agency, which recently received a $400 million investment from Saudi Arabia. \u201cBut we know that\u2019s not true as long as he\u2019s bombing Yemen and killing innocent people.\u201dLater that evening, hundreds of Saudi students from nearby universities \u2014 many of whom receive educational scholarships from the Saudi government \u2014 packed a ballroom at the Beverly Hills Hotel for a TED-style event put on by the Misk Foundation, a nonprofit founded by Prince Mohammed. During the Misk Talk, successful Saudi men and women representing technology, entertainment and other industries sought to impart wisdom and inspiration to the young crowd.And on Tuesday night, Misk hosted an art exhibit in an industrial-style event space in the arts district of downtown Los Angeles, where women in miniskirts and leather pants mixed with young Saudi women in head scarves, while young Saudi men who live in Los Angeles worked as volunteer guides to Saudi art.Hala Alzuhayri, a Saudi woman at the University of San Diego who attended the Misk Talk, praised the prince for opening up the economy and said she was pleased about the new prospects for women, even as she worried about the pace of change. \u201cBut we are a Muslim society, so these kinds of big steps have to take time,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just shock society with big steps one after another. It\u2019s hard.\u201d\u201cIt was very disorganized,\u201d said Ms. Young, of the start of the trip. \u201cThere was a real lack of coordination.\u201dBut the operation soon stabilized, with a tightly controlled message managed by the Saudi Embassy in Washington with assistance from American lobbying and public relations firms. Almost daily, news releases were issued about the crown prince\u2019s dizzying schedule of meetings.\u201cIt sent a message that this could go very wrong,\u201d she said, of the early chaos. \u201cBut to their credit it\u2019s gone very well.\u201dReporting was contributed by Brooks Barnes and Louis Keene from Los Angeles, Nate Schweber from New York, Jack Nicas from San Francisco, and Kimiko de Freytas-Tamura from London.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Man Behind the President\u2019s Tweets", "Date": "2018-04-16", "News": "FeatureUnraveling the mystery of Dan Scavino, the White House social media director, whose job is to help @realDonaldTrump stay unpresidential.Supported byThough @realDonaldTrump reads like the unabridged representation of a singular man\u2019s impulses, three other defendants were named in the suit, which is expected to be ruled upon in the Southern District of New York in the coming months. One of them was Hope Hicks, long a public face of Trump World, the 29-year-old former model who spent the past three years as Trump\u2019s media liaison before leaving the White House in late March. A second was Trump\u2019s press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the president\u2019s designated mouthpiece. But the third, unlike Hicks and Sanders, was someone most Americans have never heard of: a man named Dan Scavino Jr.Scavino was another of the \u201coriginals\u201d on Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, and I saw him numerous times on the trail, but I could never quite ascertain what he was doing to further his boss\u2019s presidential ambitions. Aggressively nondescript, Scavino could often be seen in a suit at the side of the stage, taking photos of the immense rally crowds with his iPhone and later, while scowling at his laptop aboard Trump\u2019s 757, posting the images to Facebook. The other fixtures on Trump\u2019s plane \u2014 Hicks, the campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, the policy adviser Stephen Miller and the security director Keith Schiller \u2014 had roles that, in a famously unorthodox campaign, at least seemed familiar. But Scavino\u2019s sole task, from what I could tell, was to document Trump\u2019s popularity.My perplexity over Scavino deepened after Inauguration Day, even as he got an official title: assistant to the president and director of social media, a position that had never existed before and one that paid him the maximum White House staff salary of $179,700. The Trump White House continued to employ an official photographer (Shealah Craighead) as well as a chief digital officer (Ory Rinat). This small digital team shared a suite across the street, in the Executive Office Building. But Scavino got an office on the ground floor of the West Wing, just down the hall from the leader of the free world.The only official function Scavino filled that might justify his salary and his prime White House real estate was detailed in the lawsuit\u2019s stipulation of facts. \u201cScavino,\u201d both parties to the lawsuit agreed, \u201cassists President Trump in operating the @realDonaldTrump account, including by drafting and posting tweets to the account.\u201d No one else, besides Trump himself, had access to the most consequential and controversial social media account in the world.A couple of months after the lawsuit was filed, I paid a visit to the White House to inform Hope Hicks that I wanted to write about Scavino and his value to the president. Hicks was not enthusiastic. The story had already been done, she maintained vaguely, before adding that Scavino was himself unlikely to pull back the curtain any further about his life \u2014 and besides, she hastened to assure me, there really wasn\u2019t much of a curtain to pull back. (Scavino declined to be interviewed for this article.) Dan, she said, was simply a selfless public servant who worked tirelessly for the president of the United States. As to his actual value, Hicks offered a curious descriptor I would also hear from several others: Scavino was \u201cthe conductor of the Trump Train.\u201dFor those who have forgotten the history of that particular phrase, the \u201cTrump Train\u201d began early in the campaign as a quixotic rallying cry. At the time, Trump\u2019s presidential ambitions seemed like a populist burlesque rather than anything that could seriously be called a political movement. But the reality-TV star\u2019s fan base continued to grow, in defiance of polling and Beltway groupthink and in direct proportion (or so it seemed) to his mounting pile of scandals and outr\u00e9 policy proposals. The Trump Train, it soon became clear, was a juggernaut, and before long the phrase became second only to \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d as Trump fans\u2019 most cherished meme.In hindsight, the phrase\u2019s rise is also a good illustration of why Scavino, as the behind-the-scenes cheerleader and relentless documentarian of the Trump movement, deserves significant credit for its success. Perhaps the most profound effect of Scavino\u2019s countless iPhone videos and photos is that they served as proof to so-called \u201cshy Trump supporters\u201d that they were not alone \u2014 that they were in fact (regardless of what the mainstream media reported) poised to make history. As Jason Miller, the campaign\u2019s senior communications adviser, puts it: \u201cYou could make the case that without Dan fulfilling his core mission of conveying the excitement, people wouldn\u2019t have realized that they were part of a movement. It was absolutely critical in encouraging people to turn out.\u201dBut now that they had turned out for Trump and he was America\u2019s 45th president, what did he still need Scavino for? I spent the next six months trying to find out, even as the ranks of \u201coriginals\u201d dwindled. Keith Schiller left in September. Soon after Hope Hicks exited the building on March 29, Scavino \u2014 now the longest-tenured Trump employee in the White House \u2014 took over her office, just outside the Oval. By these measures, he was one of the most powerful people in Washington, despite the fact that no one could explain what Scavino did for a living.\u201cSimple!\u201d he wrote. \u201cI would not be where I am today w/o him. Thank you @realDonaldTrump!!\u201dScavino was then leading the placid life of a suburban striver. Together with his wife of 13 years, their two sons and two Portuguese water dogs, he lived in a four-bedroom house in Dutchess County, N.Y., looking out onto the sixth hole of the neighborhood golf course. An English schoolteacher\u2019s son, he had played tight end and defensive end on his high school football team the year they won state and had kissed the ring of Pope John Paul II. He had in fact twice finagled front-row seats to see the pope, just as he had talked his way into a sales job at Coca-Cola while polishing the company president\u2019s golf clubs during his summer employment as a caddy. His genial hustling had earned him minor celebrity upstate: Scavino frequently dropped in on the studio of the K104.7 \u201cWoodman in the Morning\u201d radio show, and as a philanthropically minded Catholic, he could be counted on to judge a charity cupcake contest and to walk the runway in a \u201cBest Legs in the Hudson Valley\u201d competition.But what propelled Scavino\u2019s ascent more than any other factor was his relationship with Donald Trump. The two first met in 1990, when Scavino was a teenage caddy at a Westchester County course that Trump would eventually purchase and rename the Trump National Golf Club. Scavino carried Trump\u2019s clubs, earning a $200 tip from the developer \u2014 who later in the club\u2019s Grille Room told the caddy, \u201cYou are going to work for me one day.\u201dScavino went on to major in communications at the State University of New York in Plattsburgh; he did a six-month internship at Walt Disney World, then later got a job with the Texas-based Galderma Laboratories as a pharmaceutical rep; he married and settled down. But throughout it all, he held onto the two hundred-dollar bills that Trump had given him. When that same Westchester golf club, which now bore the billionaire\u2019s name, offered Scavino a job as an assistant manager in 2004, he accepted. Four years later, he was the club\u2019s general manager, whizzing around America in the big man\u2019s private plane. After a brief and not altogether successful stint running his own consulting firm, Scavino reached out to Trump\u2019s son Eric in November 2014 to see if he could come back into the fold. On Nov. 8, having heard the rumors of a possible presidential bid, Scavino buttonholed his old boss at Eric\u2019s wedding and said, \u201cWhen you run, I\u2019m in.\u201dWhat Scavino was offering were the services of a registered independent who had no experience in politics. He had only one qualification: He was a Trump die-hard. Lewandowski hired him on the spot. In June 2015, the two men, along with Hicks and the political adviser Sam Nunberg, moved into a cramped office on the 24th floor of Trump Tower. Scavino\u2019s first assignment was to try to find big-ticket contributors to Trump\u2019s campaign, an effort that proved fruitless, as the Republican donor class did not take his candidacy seriously. Scavino would later be enjoined to cultivate relationships within the Republican National Committee, which at that time viewed the bombastic New York businessman and reality-TV star with eye-rolling skepticism. He had no luck with that effort either.A more suitable job for Scavino materialized shortly after Trump\u2019s formal announcement of his candidacy on June 16, 2015. The campaign had been trying to curry favor with the powerful publisher Joe McQuaid, whose endorsement in The New Hampshire Union Leader was among the most highly coveted in the early primary states. But this charm offensive threatened to come undone when, during Ivanka Trump\u2019s visit on June 24 to announce the opening of a campaign office in Manchester, McQuaid\u2019s daughter was unable to get her photo taken with the socialite. Trump was infuriated when he learned of this. To prevent similar dust-ups in the future, Scavino had another duty added to his portfolio: going to the early primary states to tend to the needs of the local kingmakers.In this new role, as with so many of his roles for Trump over the years, Scavino continued to serve as a kind of caddy. He went on food runs for the candidate to McDonald\u2019s and KFC. He faithfully typed out Trump\u2019s tweets as the candidate dictated them. He also wandered the events, climbed the rafters and snapped smartphone pictures, which he then posted on both his and the campaign\u2019s various social-media accounts. It happened that the campaign already had a professional photographer on the payroll. But this was becoming a liability, in that she tended to take hundreds of images at each event, and the candidate would insist on spending hours of valuable time poring over every last one of them. The campaign did nominally have a social media specialist \u2014 Justin McConney, son of the Trump Organization\u2019s controller \u2014 but he lacked Scavino\u2019s instinct for the base, and in any event, McConney was stationed back at Trump Tower, away from the real action on the campaign trail. By early 2016, Scavino had become in essence both the Trump campaign\u2019s traveling photographer and its social media chieftain. And because the self-funding candidate had no intention of spending a dime on media coverage, Scavino with his Facebook videography also became the closest thing the Trump campaign had to an in-house ad maker.Scavino\u2019s willingness to take on other people\u2019s online grunt work made him indispensable to the campaign. Early in the primary, the candidate\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, argued to Trump that Facebook was much more powerful than his preferred platform, Twitter. \u201cEvery Facebook user is probably worth 10 to 12 times more than one of your Twitter followers,\u201d Kushner told him. \u201cAnd look, I think your Facebook page is totally underutilized.\u201d The candidate responded, \u201cCongratulations, then \u2014 you\u2019re now in charge of my Facebook.\u201d Kushner turned around and handed over that job to Scavino.Even as Scavino\u2019s deployment of campaign imagery onto Facebook helped accelerate the Trump Train, it was Twitter, with its visceral impact, that remained Trump\u2019s abiding love. \u201cSomebody said I\u2019m the Ernest Hemingway of 140 characters,\u201d he crowed during an event in South Carolina in November 2015. (The \u201csomebody\u201d was most likely one of his employees.) On his plane or in limousines, he would dictate tweets for Scavino to post. Others, including Scavino, would goad Trump with their own suggestions. (Hope Hicks would supply the choicest put-downs, recalls a former campaign official: \u201cShe\u2019d have absolute daggers.\u201d) Trump would give his missive a final read to make sure that it had not been watered down, and Scavino would hit \u201cTweet.\u201dNow and again, Trump would enlist Scavino \u2014 whose followers today exceed 475,000 \u2014 to act as a proxy, attacking the campaign\u2019s enemies from his own account. At other times, Scavino took the initiative himself. Before long, the personal feed that had once been a totem of cornball folksiness included harsh attacks on Megyn Kelly, \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d Cruz and other perceived antagonists. In March 2016, Scavino retweeted a conspiracy video purporting to demonstrate that Cruz was having an affair with a former aide, Amanda Carpenter. Carpenter, who is married with children, went on the air and heatedly denied any impropriety. She also condemned Scavino by name, calling his attack a \u201csmear job.\u201d\u201cIt was a campaign, and they fight dirty, and they didn\u2019t mind if I was collateral damage in the process,\u201d Carpenter told me. \u201cAnd they won. And no consequences. What Scavino did to me and what he still does to others would get any other professional fired. In Trump\u2019s universe, it\u2019s a qualification. A willingness to engage in lies and smears on behalf of Donald Trump is a sign of loyalty that Trump treasures.\u201dStill, nothing in Trump\u2019s earliest social media forays would prefigure the towering role that Twitter eventually played in his political branding. Trump opened his @realDonaldTrump account in March 2009, only to ignore it for the better part of two years. Giving in to the urging of his political advisers Roger Stone and Sam Nunberg, Trump began to tweet about his hotel properties and his TV show. Soon he offered up sundry nuggets on his importance to the Yankees (\u201cThey always win when I am there\u201d) and on how to succeed in life (\u201cShow me someone without an ego, and I\u2019ll show you a loser\u201d). Like a fading matinee idol, Trump had an embarrassing tendency to preen, particularly once his musings turned to politics, around the run-up to the 2012 election. \u201cMy daughter Ivanka thinks I should run for president,\u201d he tweeted on Jan. 25 of that year. \u201cMaybe I should listen.\u201d (\u201cHe\u2019d be phenomenal!\u201d Ivanka exclaimed in the linked Hollywood Life article.)Of course, at that point the microblogging platform played a marginal-at-best role in American political life, even less so in presidential politics. Barack Obama was a reluctant pioneer in this regard. Tweets from his @POTUS account would undergo a policy and legal vetting process, and it could sometimes take days or even weeks before they were finally posted. The thought of using Twitter as a political cudgel \u201cwould have been completely against our values,\u201d says Macon Phillips, Obama\u2019s first digital director. \u201cI think I would have left. I think a lot of us would have.\u201dAt the time he announced his candidacy in the summer of 2015, Trump himself was unsure of the role Twitter would play in his campaign. His tweets then seemed to demonstrate only the fundamental unseriousness of his presidential ambitions. As the campaign wore on, however, the candidate\u2019s online disparagements no longer suggested a man bent on self-immolation. Rather, they reinforced the campaign talking point that here, at long last, was an honest politician who did not bother to conceal his lesser angels. His incessant howling of personal grievance only helped to show that the aloof titan of Fifth Avenue, mythologized in \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d had a tender underbelly. In baring his smallness, the billionaire New York developer managed to collapse the differences between his gilded life and that of white Middle America.Today Trump has not so much drained Washington\u2019s swamp as convulsed it with daily electroshocks of presidential id. Journalists now routinely awaken to the sound of a notification on their smartphones, telling them that the president is already up and driving the news in 280-character gonzo fusillades. A far more common spectacle today than a legislative signing ceremony is the image of House Speaker Paul Ryan facing the microphones and, with a mortician\u2019s smile, trying to explain away his party leader\u2019s latest tweet: \u201cIt\u2019s what he does. We\u2019ve kind of learned to live with it.\u201d (Or maybe not: Ryan made it less than halfway through Trump\u2019s first term before announcing his retirement from Congress.) The question of whether Trump\u2019s social media outbursts constitute actual news has been rendered moot by his front-page-worthy announcements on Twitter: that his secretary of Veterans Affairs has been replaced, that he considers his own attorney general \u201cbeleaguered,\u201d that \u201ctrade wars are good,\u201d that \u201cDACA is dead.\u201d The Trump presidency\u2019s defining feature \u2014 its resolute abnormality \u2014 is above all the handiwork of @realDonaldTrump. It therefore stands to reason that Trump\u2019s most valued aide is the one whose job description has no precedent.One of Scavino\u2019s main roles is the care and feeding of his boss\u2019s ego. He has learned how to fend off any negativity with a ready supply of superlatives. While Hope Hicks would inform Trump about how some matter might be playing in the mainstream media, Scavino, Hicks told me, would \u201ctell him how things are playing with his people. That\u2019s a gauge for him that the president takes seriously.\u201d Checking in with the base is as easy as looking at his phone. Scavino\u2019s old friend offered an example: \u201cDan would scroll through his Twitter feed and if Franklin Graham says something particularly complimentary, he\u2019ll say, \u2018Look what Franklin Graham just wrote.\u2019 Or if [CNN show host] Brian Stelter says something particularly stupid, he\u2019ll run over and say, \u2018Look what Fake News is doing.\u2019\u2009\u201dMore than anyone else in the White House, the director of social media spends his day online, monitoring the #MAGA congregation. \u201cDan talks to the base more than anybody else after the president,\u201d one senior White House official told me. \u201cHe\u2019s the conductor of the Trump Train, and these people know he\u2019s true blue, and he also knows all the influencers.\u201d A year ago, the former chief strategist Steve Bannon shared a West Wing office with Scavino. \u201cHe has his hands on the Pepes,\u201d Bannon recalls, referring to the cartoon frog that serves as mascot to the alt-right. \u201cHe knew who the players were and who were not. He\u2019d bring me Cernovich \u2014 I didn\u2019t know who Cernovich was until Scavino told me.\u201d Bannon was referring to the alt-right blogger Mike Cernovich, who has frequently promoted debunked and scurrilous conspiracy theories.When I asked Cernovich about his relationship with Scavino, he claimed they had none. \u201cNo, never met him, never emailed with him, never D.M.\u2019ed with him, and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s ever tweeted at me,\u201d Cernovich said. In fact, by Cernovich\u2019s standards, the Trump social media director was something of a lightweight. \u201cScavino\u2019s not an ideologue,\u201d he said disapprovingly. \u201cI don\u2019t think he wakes up and says, \u2018Holy hell, I want to break things today \u2014 who do I go after?\u2019 It\u2019s more, \u2018I like my job and the Trump family.\u2019\u2009\u201d Still, Cernovich acknowledged that Scavino had most likely served as a conduit between the alt-right and Trump, if only through his eagerness to bring passionate fans to his boss\u2019s attention.Since arriving in the nation\u2019s capital, Scavino has kept attacking President Trump\u2019s opponents from his own Twitter account: Nancy Pelosi, Bill Kristol, Kathy Griffin. Last April, he went after Justin Amash, a Republican congressman from Michigan and frequent critic of Trump. Calling Amash \u201ca big liability,\u201d Scavino\u2019s tweet urged, \u201c#TrumpTrain, defeat him in primary.\u201d Not easily intimidated, Amash replied, \u201cBring it on.\u201d But what instead was brought on was an investigation by the Office of Special Counsel, which concluded that Scavino had violated the Hatch Act, the law that forbids engaging in political activity while acting in your capacity as a government employee. On June 5, the O.S.C. disclosed that it had put Scavino on notice. Though its statement made clear that future violations could result in harsher punishment, it neglected to say that only one individual could mete out that punishment: the president of the United States.The full extent of Scavino\u2019s role in Trump\u2019s Twitter regimen has never been fully disclosed. White House officials initially maintained to me that he only typed and posted verbatim what Trump dictated to him, while occasionally contributing anodyne tweets relating to the president\u2019s schedule. (\u201cNews conference at the White House concerning the Omnibus Spending Bill. 1:00 P.M.\u201d) Somewhat begrudgingly, one senior official did not deny that Scavino also sometimes corrected Trump\u2019s spelling errors. But the Knight Institute lawsuit had named Scavino, Hicks and Sanders because, as communications staff members, they are likely to \u201csuggest content\u201d for Trump\u2019s tweets, just as Trump\u2019s subordinates did during the campaign.In particular, said one individual who witnessed this interactivity on the campaign trail and another who saw it in the White House, Scavino frequently supplied the litany of details in Trump\u2019s tweets about, say, claims of Crooked Hillary\u2019s various malfeasances or of the F.B.I.\u2019s corrupt activity. \u201cFifty percent of the time, Trump is ripping these out himself, and 50 percent is going to Scavino,\u201d one of them told me.Evidence of Scavino\u2019s active participation in Trump\u2019s tweets emerged last autumn. On the morning of Oct. 4, Scavino posted to his own account one of the social media director\u2019s usual rants against the media: \u201cNBC news is #FakeNews and more dishonest than even CNN. They are a disgrace to good reporting. No wonder their news ratings are way down!\u201d One minute later, the identical message was posted on his boss\u2019s account as an original Trump tweet. Scavino hastily deleted his first tweet, but not before eagle-eyed users took screen shots.None of this should be so controversial, of course. No one believes that Trump writes the speeches he delivers any more than they believe he wrote \u201cThe Art of the Deal.\u201d And in the end, only a fool would suggest that his tweets represent the essence of someone other than Donald J. Trump. All the same, my suggestion to a senior White House official that Trump might have some help in producing his mini-masterpieces was met with heated indignation. I was insulting the president\u2019s capabilities. I was engaging in rank speculation. I was rewriting American history.Still, the White House official did not once categorically state that Trump was the sole author of every word of his tweets. And in the meantime, Scavino, in the manner of any caddy who knows his place, continually avoided taking credit. He refused to answer even my basic question: What, exactly, did he do?He has outlasted Hope Hicks, who used to steam the president\u2019s pants, and Keith Schiller, who \u2014 as I once witnessed backstage at a campaign event in Buffalo \u2014 used to help apply hair product to the postmodern sculpture atop Trump\u2019s head. Managing Trump\u2019s Twitter account, as it turns out, is an even more intimate act, something only Scavino has ever been trusted with. \u201cI told Dan many times during the campaign, \u2018Once we win, you\u2019ll have an entire team,\u2019\u2009\u201d Corey Lewandowski recalls. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him many times since then, and it\u2019s still a one-man operation.\u201dOn a recent Monday in late March, I dropped by the West Wing to have one last in-person visit with some of Scavino\u2019s colleagues and hopefully catch a glimpse of the social media director. The evening before, Yashar Ali of The Huffington Post had broken the news that Scavino\u2019s wife, Jennifer, had filed for divorce several weeks earlier. I had heard rumors of the split from a former White House staff member who, while praising Scavino\u2019s crazed work ethic and fealty to Trump, casually added, \u201cBy the way, it also destroyed his marriage.\u201d Scavino had long struggled to balance his ambitions with caring for his wife, who suffers from chronic Lyme disease. That day in the West Wing, he was nowhere to be seen by the time I arrived. Scavino had boarded Air Force One with Trump and flown to Manchester to capture images of the president somberly proposing the death penalty for opioid dealers.The personal toll of being Trump\u2019s social media director may not end at Scavino\u2019s marriage. Last December, The Washington Post reported that an executive with Vkontakte, Russia\u2019s version of Facebook, had twice emailed Scavino and Donald Trump Jr. during the presidential campaign, offering to promote Trump\u2019s candidacy on the platform. According to an email read to The Post, Scavino\u2019s response to the American intermediary, Rob Goldstone, was effusive: \u201cPlease feel free to send me whatever you have. Thank you so much for looking out for Mr. Trump and his presidential campaign.\u201dA month after the Post story, Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote Scavino a four-page letter. Noting media reports that Scavino is a \u201cconstant presence at Trump\u2019s side,\u201d Feinstein speculated that Scavino would know about the president\u2019s decision to fire the F.B.I. director James Comey, as well as Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election. The senator therefore was writing \u201cto request documents and to schedule an interview with you in January 2018.\u201dScavino retained the services of an attorney, who informed Feinstein that Trump\u2019s social media director would not be responding to her requests. Without bipartisan prodding from the Judiciary Committee, and with Trump\u2019s backing, he was free to ignore the Senate inquiry. Still, Scavino\u2019s tweet from November 2013 proved prescient in ways he had not expected: He would not be where he was today without @realDonaldTrump.Robert Draper is a writer at large.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Ice Cream Sundae Must Be Stopped", "Date": "2018-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookTo eat out in New York is to drown in choices. Which neighborhood? Which cuisine? Updated or traditional? Speedy or stately? Loud or just moderately loud? Menus are getting busier, surrounding the usual appetizers and main courses with snacks and raw bar items and \u201clarge-format\u201d platters.Sometimes you will have a choice of desserts, but not always, and, it seems to me, the choices are fewer than you had a few years ago. More and more new restaurants offer just one or two desserts. And when you go out as often as I do, you start to notice that the one dessert you can count on seeing almost everywhere is an ice cream sundae. In many places, it\u2019s the only dessert.If you can recognize the sundae template in Ms. Prida\u2019s frozen yogurt (ice cream plus sauce plus bits of what a pastry chef would call \u201ctexture\u201d), then you will start to see it in desserts served all over town. Generally it is found in restaurants that have a healthy sense of their own self-worth but don\u2019t have too many bells and whistles to show for it: the wine bars, the gastro pubs, the all-day cafes, the 28-seat, no-reservations spot opened by a young chef who has cooked in Paris or Copenhagen.They will almost certainly not tell you that their only dessert is a sundae. They will say it is mascarpone ice cream with salted caramel sauce and chocolate crumble; or sweet cream ice cream with maple syrup and the remains of some brown-butter wafers; or beer ice cream with pretzels and, I don\u2019t know, an espresso reduction.Have you had one of these? You generally find it in a shallow bowl or even on a plate, held in place by a patch of stale cake crumbs. I\u2019ve had about a hundred of them over the past few years, and I doubt there\u2019s a single one I could pick out of a police lineup.Dessert was put on this planet in order to surprise us. When did it become so numbingly predictable? It is as if every chef in town had decided that the only appetizer left standing would be the iceberg wedge.You may be asking yourself: What kind of sociopath complains about ice cream sundaes? I am wondering about this, too. I just know that when I see one, I am almost never as excited as the servers seem to think I ought to be.They get very emotive, servers, when they deliver the not-very-remarkable news that you can order a sundae. For dessert! In a restaurant! And when they announce that you, the customer, get to assemble it \u2014 pour a sticky sauce over the ice cream and glam it up with candy, peanuts, pretzels, breakfast cereal, week-old bagels \u2014 they get that look that Oprah Winfrey has when she starts giving away cars.But enough about the barren, echoing tundra that passes for my soul. Let\u2019s talk about the future of New York restaurants.According to Shuna Lydon, who has worked in or led some large and famous pastry kitchens as well as some small and obscure ones, you can learn everything you need to know about the sundae invasion by reading the help-wanted ads on Craigslist.\u201cThe restaurants that used to be looking for pastry chefs are looking for pastry sous-chefs,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s all the same duties, all the same hours, all the same physical labor, but they can now pay you $30,000 or $40,000 less a year because you\u2019re not a chef, you\u2019re not in charge.\u201dAs you may have heard, times are tough for local restaurants. Health insurance costs and the minimum wage have gone up, and the rent was already too damn high. Diners get skittish if prices are raised often or suddenly. Operators looking to cut expenses have targeted pastry chefs, and replaced them with pastry sous-chefs who may be just out of culinary school, who may have little or no background in baking and almost certainly have no experience running a department that can turn out half a dozen thoughtful, inspired desserts every night.Ice cream can carry almost any flavor you want to give it \u2014 fruits, vegetables, herbs, spices, even alcohol and vinegars. It is like a blank canvas on which you can paint anything, if you know what you\u2019re doing.\u201cOur flavor list is up to 275 now,\u201d Mr. Snyder said. In sales to restaurants, though, \u201cclose to 40 percent is vanilla. Which is pretty crazy. But the fact is that vanilla pairs with anything, practically, and it works with sundaes.\u201dWith the recent spike in vanilla-bean prices, he said, a few restaurants have defected to even more neutral flavors: mascarpone, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, yogurt, fior di latte. But vanilla is still supreme.It\u2019s the other kind of sundae that really has me worried about the future, the kind with a sauce that anybody who has held a whisk could make, and a depressing display of cake scat and cookie droppings. Because these aren\u2019t really desserts. They\u2019re ice cream in a wig.A friend who writes for television says her writers\u2019 room has an expression for any trite, overly familiar idea \u2014 basically, anything that feels too much like TV. She calls ideas like that \u201ctied with a chive,\u201d after those inane bundles of green beans that caterers used to serve. Something that is tied with a chive is manipulated in order to express elegance and care, but in fact only communicates their absence. That\u2019s how I feel about most of the sundaes in New York now.Prune does not have a pastry chef. It doesn\u2019t have a pastry sous-chef. It for sure doesn\u2019t have a pastry kitchen. But it has a sense of how important it is for the last course to reflect the same sensibility that made the first two worth eating.By the way, neither dessert contained any ice cream.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Months Before Deadly Crash, Helicopter Pilots Warned of Safety Issues", "Date": "2018-04-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor months before an open-sided helicopter capsized in the East River, drowning five passengers who had been strapped inside, pilots for the company that operated the flight warned their bosses about dangerous conditions, including equipment that could make escape difficult.The pilots repeatedly requested more suitable safety gear, with one pilot writing in an email to company management that \u201cwe are setting ourselves up for failure\u201d by using sometimes poorly fitting harnesses. That pilot made a series of recommendations \u2014 including one four days before the fatal accident \u2014 for new tools that would allow passengers to more easily free themselves in case of an emergency, according to company emails, other internal documents and interviews.The internal documents reviewed by The New York Times indicate that executives for the company, FlyNYON, bristled at the pilots\u2019 concerns, insisting that the operation, which offered the chance to snap selfies while leaning out over the city, was safe.\u201cLet me be clear, this isn\u2019t a safety issue with the harnesses,\u201d Patrick K. Day, the chief executive of FlyNYON, said in a January email exchange with pilots who had raised concerns.Mr. Day, in a statement to The Times, rejected the idea \u201cthat anyone at FlyNYON did not heed issues raised by pilots at Liberty Helicopter\u201d \u2014 an affiliated company that owned and operated the helicopters used in FlyNYON flights \u2014 \u201cand that we failed to respond to safety concerns.\u201dLess than two months after the email exchange, on March 11, a FlyNYON flight splashed in the East River after losing power and quickly rolled over, trapping its pilot and five passengers upside down in the frigid water.The internal documents, and interviews with people familiar with FlyNYON\u2019s operation and Mr. Vance\u2019s account, paint a portrait of a company that at times appeared to put business concerns ahead of safety concerns as it scrambled to meet surging demand for a daring form of aerial tourism that it pioneered.Multiple pilots who have worked with FlyNYON and Liberty Helicopters \u2014 including the pilot who warned of the harnesses in the email \u2014 are seeking whistle-blower protections in order to speak out. They have retained a Washington lawyer who specializes in whistle-blower matters, Debra Katz. She has asked the New York attorney general\u2019s office to investigate FlyNYON, and she sent a letter to the F.A.A., claiming that the pilots were subject to retaliation.As a result, she wrote, \u201cthere is a pervasive feeling among Liberty pilots that if they provide truthful information to the F.A.A. and the N.T.S.B. and speak out about the lax safety culture and practices at FlyNYON, they will face blackballing in the industry and other forms of career-derailing retaliation.\u201dThe New York attorney general\u2019s office has begun a consumer-protection investigation into FlyNYON\u2019s business practices and demanded that the company cease promoting doors-off flights, according to a person who had been briefed on the investigation.Mr. Day, in his statement to The Times, pointed out that the F.A.A. had performed a site inspection of FlyNYON\u2019s facility on Oct. 31, at which \u201cinspectors observed the harness and tethering process and continued to permit their use on Liberty and FlyNYON operated flights without issue.\u201dThe F.A.A. confirmed that it conducted \u201croutine oversight\u201d of Liberty\u2019s operations on Oct. 31 and \u201cobserved supplemental harnesses outside a helicopter.\u201d But a spokesman for the agency said that its inspectors would not have rendered judgment on the harnesses because supplemental restraints are not subject to inspection. Liberty Helicopters declined to comment.Like some air-tour companies in other tourist destinations, FlyNYON offered flights on helicopters with the doors open or removed to allow passengers to take unobstructed photographs of the landscape below. But FlyNYON went a step further by putting passengers in harnesses attached to tethers that would let them lean out of \u2014 or dangle their legs over \u2014 the edge of the cabin.It was an experience that previously had been available mostly to professional photographers, who booked private flights where they were often the only passengers and, therefore, could be more closely monitored by the pilots. Mr. Day and his partners recognized the potential profit in offering such an experience more widely in an era when social media users are willing to pay handsomely for activities that produce thumb-scroll-stopping photos.The company encouraged its customers to post shots of their feet suspended over landmarks like the Statue of Liberty or the Empire State Building \u2014 images the company called \u201cshoe selfies\u201d \u2014 on Instagram and other social media platforms. And remember, its workers requested, to please tag the company in those posts, helping to spread the word about FlyNYON\u2019s service.The social-media strategy was working, drawing more and more people to an industrial section of Kearny, N.J., on the edge of the Port of Newark, from which FlyNYON helicopters depart for flights over Manhattan. New York City officials had prohibited sightseeing tours from flying over land, or flying at all on Sundays. But FlyNYON got around the restrictions by departing from New Jersey and designating its flights as aerial photography missions rather than tours with defined itineraries.Mr. Day boasted in an internal email in February that FlyNYON had defied its doubters, whom he called \u201cdinosaurs,\u201d and had increased its business last year by 400 percent. The company was charging as much as $500 a seat for five-passenger flights lasting 30 to 40 minutes over New York, Miami, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and San Francisco. By December, it was booking as many as 28 flights a day, the emails said.Some experienced pilots, like Bill Richards, saw what FlyNYON was doing and considered it reckless. Mr. Richards, who flies camera crews in helicopters around New York to film for movies and TV shows, said, \u201cIt looked crazy to all of us who do this for a living.\u201dHe said at one point he provided a store-bought harness for professional photographers to wear while leaning out of his helicopter. But he abandoned that practice long ago, he said, and has since kept his passengers in their seats or on a camera mount approved by the F.A.A.On a Sunday afternoon in mid-February, six loads of FlyNYON customers were aboard helicopters trying to get pictures of the city at sundown, according to emails between company officials. The crowd of thrill seekers was overwhelming FlyNYON\u2019s resources, the emails show. At times, the company did not have enough harnesses, tethers, carabiners or headsets to outfit one group of passengers while another was in the air, delaying liftoff, one FlyNYON official complained in a February email with the subject line, \u201cmore gear needed.\u201dPilots complained that the harnesses were too big to properly fit smaller customers, including many women and children, according to the emails. They show that FlyNYON staff members were instructed at one point to use zip ties to achieve a tighter fit.And to keep those harnesses and passengers\u2019 seatbelts from unbuckling accidentally in flight \u2014 which would not have released the harnesses completely \u2014 FlyNYON staffers often used tape that Mr. Day referred to as \u201cNYON blue safety tape,\u201d according to three pilots who have worked with FlyNYON. But the \u201csafety tape\u201d was just common painters\u2019 tape, said the pilots, one of whom wrote the email warning about the harnesses and is among those being represented by the whistle-blower lawyer. The pilots requested anonymity because of fears of retaliation and because they did not want to jeopardize employment in the close-knit helicopter community.Mr. Day, in his statement to The Times, minimized the concerns, pointing out that under F.A.A. rules, pilots have responsibility for the safety of their flights. He said \u201cif these handful of Liberty pilots had issues that they deemed detrimental to the safety of the operation, they should have ceased operations and addressed the issue with Liberty management.\u201dThe three pilots said FlyNYON brushed aside many of the concerns they did raise, though the company did make some changes based on their complaints.After pilots expressed concern about the tape, they were told in December that FlyNYON had \u201cput an order in for thick rubber bands which will hold the front buckle in place,\u201d according to the minutes of a pilots\u2019 meeting. \u201cThis will eliminate the need for the \u2018blue tape\u2019 on the harnesses.\u201dAccording to emails and interviews, pilots preferred a different model of harness that could be adjusted to fit passengers of varying sizes without the use of zip ties. The harnesses, which were blue, were considered safer partly because they connected to the tethers in a place that passengers could more easily reach to try to detach themselves. And the blue harnesses were approved by the F.A.A. for some uses, though not specifically open-door helicopters flights, which had not been explicitly addressed in F.A.A. rules.FlyNYON intended to eventually replace all the yellow harnesses with blue ones, according to emails in November. And a company official told pilots in a January email that the \u201cblue harnesses should take priority over yellow harnesses.\u201dYet, when pilots insisted on blue harnesses for some smaller passengers, in one instance delaying a flight by requesting a switch, Mr. Day responded testily. In a January email, he wrote that \u201cthe yellow harnesses are stunt/construction harnesses that are designed for human safety hanging off buildings at 1,000 feet-plus. The blue harnesses are F.A.A. approved but that isn\u2019t a requirement for a doors-off flight. The yellow harnesses are just as legal/safe as the blue.\u201dAt the time of the crash, the company had only a few blue harnesses in use.Likewise, the company\u2019s pilots raised concerns about the tethers used to secure the passengers, via their harnesses, to the interior of the helicopters. It was difficult for passengers to reach the point at which the tethers fastened to their yellow harnesses, and, even if they could reach the connection, it would be difficult for them to disconnect the carabineers that connected the tethers to the harnesses on their own, according to the pilots who worked with FlyNYON. So each passenger was provided a hook-shaped blade, marketed as a seatbelt cutter, that they were instructed to use to sever the tether in case of an emergency that required them to extricate themselves.A safety video played for passengers before they went on trips showed people using the cutters to easily slice through the tethers, according to people who viewed it. But the tethers in the video were not the same ones being used by FlyNYON. And when employees tested the equipment that was in use in November, they found it extremely difficult to sever the tether using the cutter, according to the former FlyNYON official.Managers from FlyNYON were present for the test, the former official said. But it was not until February that the company began formally considering a plan to order new tethers and cutters that would allow for easier slicing, according to the emails. The minutes of a late February meeting highlight a discussion about \u201cresearching and procuring a new cutter for the tethers which we will be testing shortly. There is also a new style of tether we are looking into as well. This will need to be included in the safety video.\u201dOn March 7 \u2014 just four days before the crash \u2014 the company planned to discuss a \u201cfinal decision\u201d on the new tethers and cutters, according to the emails.It is unclear if FlyNYON purchased the new equipment, but, even if it did, the new tethers and cutters were not deployed on the fatal March 11 flight. Instagram videos posted by the passengers before liftoff show them wearing the yellow harnesses.While hovering over Central Park, he told them, the single-engine helicopter, an AS350 B2 model made by Airbus, suddenly lost power. When he reached down to cut the flow of fuel as he prepared to put the aircraft down in the river, he saw that the fuel cutoff lever had been tripped and the tether of his front-seat passenger was under it. That observation suggested that the passenger\u2019s movement may have caused the crash, though federal investigators have not reached a conclusion about the cause.After the crash, Dave Matula, a pilot who used to fly for FlyNYON who stopped last year, wrote on Facebook that the fatalities were a \u201chorrible but 100 percent preventable event.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Don\u2019t do any of this without first doing some research on the reputations of these vendors and their business models.Here are some examples of when unknown brands did us wrong \u2014 and the lessons we can learn.Here\u2019s the kicker: The truth was always laid out in the privacy policy, which said that \u201cwe may collect, use, transfer, sell and disclose nonpersonal information for any purpose\u201d and that data could be used \u201cto build anonymous market research products and services.\u201dIn response to the backlash, Unroll.me said it was \u201cheartbreaking\u201d to see that people were upset and pledged to be more transparent about its use of data. The app continues to operate.\u201cWe all need to know that whenever you\u2019re not paying for the thing, then you\u2019re paying for the thing in a nonmonetary way,\u201d Mr. Tien said.Last year, an app called Soniac was available for Android phones on the Google Play app store. Soniac marketed itself as a messaging app \u2014 and indeed, it included features for sending text messages. The less obvious features: The app was also capable of silently recording audio, taking photos with the camera, placing phone calls and downloading call logs among other features.Lookout, a security firm that follows malicious software for Android devices, alerted Google about Soniac\u2019s hidden abilities last year, and the app was quickly removed from the Play app store.The company that offered Soniac, Iraqwebservice, had published other spyware apps on the Play store. All of its apps have been removed from Play, but Lookout warned that the spyware would probably resurface in the future.For another, when installing an app, take a close look at what data it is accessing. Smartphone apps will ask for permission for access to certain data and sensors. If an app is asking for data that is unrelated to the product, don\u2019t install it. For example, you can reasonably expect a mapping app to ask for your location data, but it shouldn\u2019t need access to your camera.\u201cIf something seems outside of the scope, like if a calculator app tells you it needs to use your webcam, say, \u2018What, why?\u2019\u201d said Adam Kujawa, the head of malware intelligence at Malwarebytes, a security firm.Third, avoid downloading apps from unofficial app stores and sites that are not affiliated with large brands. And keep in mind that alternative app stores are particularly ripe for malware, because just about anything can be distributed there, similar to a flea market.Parents, beware: A number of internet products have specifically collected data about children. EchoMetrix is a notorious example. In 2009, the company issued a news release bragging that it had predicted the winner of that year\u2019s \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d singing competition.How did it do that? By looking at children\u2019s private information. The company started in 2004 with the name SearchHelp, offering a parental control app called FamilySafe for parents to monitor their children\u2019s online activities. Five years later, it rebranded itself as EchoMetrix and released Pulse, a tool for providing insight to third-party marketers on youths, by aggregating data from millions of teenagers\u2019 chat transcripts and blog posts, among other sources.Perhaps the most important lesson is to acknowledge that you don\u2019t know anything about the vast majority of brands you engage with on the internet. So tread carefully.\u201cThese threats aren\u2019t going away,\u201d Mr. Tien said. \u201cWith the expansion of data collection and the expansion of what\u2019s possible to collect, it\u2019s just going to continue to proliferate.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The New Power Structure", "Date": "2018-04-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistOnce upon a time, power was held in the hands of a small elite. This elite occupied the commanding heights of society and controlled big, top-down organizations. It dropped products and messages from on high, and the rest of us passively consumed them.Then along came the internet. Suddenly, information was dispersed across self-organizing, open-source networks of citizens who had the ability to collaborate, share and shape their world. Hierarchies were smashed, the wisdom of crowd was applied and transparency reigned.O.K. That didn\u2019t really happen. The first dreams of the tech revolution didn\u2019t come true. Sometimes it seems power was just redistributed from one set of massive organizations to others \u2014 Amazon, Facebook, Spotify.But something has changed. We have seen an explosion of new social organisms that don\u2019t look like the old ones: Airbnb, Etsy, Black Lives Matter, #MeToo, Blockchain. If power in the Greatest Generation looked like Organization Men running big institutions, and power for the boomers looked like mass movements organized by charismatic leaders like Steve Jobs and Barack Obama, power these days looks like decentralized networks in which everyone is a leader and there\u2019s no dominating idol.Timms thought that after the consumerism of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, there should be a day to give back. The normal thing would have been to put the 92nd Street Y logo on the effort and organize charities and other organizations around a consortium. Instead, he and his team established the meme Giving Tuesday, created a web page and some tools for people who wanted to organize, and they let the crowd take over.There are now Giving Tuesday or Giving something organizations in over 100 countries. Local organizers talk directly to one another and reshape the movement as they wish.Even more than technology, what\u2019s changed is people\u2019s attitudes toward authority. They don\u2019t trust it. They want to see people who look like them running things. Any movement that earns legitimacy has to spread ownership around. The Ikea effect applies: People value what they helped build.Many organizations profiled in \u201cNew Power\u201d are decentralized but have wrestled with the challenges of decentralization, like: How do you establish unity of purpose amid the cacophony of voices? How do you maintain standards of excellence amid the democratization of control? How do you get loosely affiliated people to commit long term, so your movement won\u2019t fizzle out, the way the Ice Bucket Challenge did?Heimans and Timms emphasize that the best organizations try to blend old and new power structures.These organizations are often founded by what you might call disappearing organizers. Somebody comes up with a compelling concept, like TED or Black Lives Matter. The concept gives people a sticky group identity; many people think of themselves as Tedsters. The core idea is spreadable, actionable and connected \u2014 it allows participants to subcreate in local and flexible ways. Tedsters organize and attend over 20,000 local TEDx events. The founder doesn\u2019t dominate the network so much as manage the community.Successful movements create what Marilynn Brewer calls \u201coptimal distinctiveness\u201d \u2014 as Heimans and Timms put it, \u201cmaking people feel like they are part of it and that they can stand out in it.\u201dThe concepts binding these movements are clear, emotional and concrete and have an implied communal narrative (MeToo). But the successful organizations also feature some structural innovation. They tend to have very low barriers to entry \u2014 no dues, no loyalty pledge up front. But they have ways to incentivize members up the participation ladder, offering premiums for super-participants who adapt, organize and share. The Lego company sets up special events and an ambassador network for its highly dedicated AFOLs (Adult Fans of Lego).At the Dutch news organization De Correspondent, journalists share story ideas with subscribers before they write them, so they can harvest community knowledge. Heimans and Timms point out that Donald Trump also blends old and new power. He may talk like an authoritarian \u2014 only I can fix this \u2014 but his actual campaign structure was a loose network of self-organizing activists. Trump is what they call a \u201cplatform strongman\u201d \u2014 someone who marshals dispersed participants on behalf of centralizing ends.The last few decades have been a social trust apocalypse. The only remaining bonds of trust are local and particular. But people are ingenious. They are figuring out how to build on those ties to weave and redeem the broader social fabric.I realize my column these days is bipolar, wildly optimistic or pessimistic. But I guess that\u2019s appropriate, since the forces tearing society apart are powerful and the people bringing it together are, too.Advertisement"}

His bedroom wall is covered in photos of scientists. When he grows up, he wants to be a science communicator like Neil deGrasse Tyson. And for a moment at age 12, when he recorded a video about vaccines on an iPad in his backyard in northeast Mexico, it seemed like he was off to a good start.\u201cEvery single bit of evidence there is in the observable universe that vaccines do cause autism is inside of this folder,\u201d he says in the nearly two-year-old video. Then, in mock shock, he starts pulling out blank pieces of paper. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d\u201cI look back on it and see that I was actually quite rude,\u201d Mr. Zozaya, now 14, said during a video call. \u201cBut everyone went crazy for it.\u201dScience communication is the art of making science accessible, and thanks to the internet, science is more accessible than ever. More research and original data is being posted publicly online, and a new generation of science ambassadors \u2014 in the tradition of Mythbusters or Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan \u2014 has found a large audience on social media. But they face a conundrum: the platforms that help get their message out sometimes favor a style that inflames as much as it informs.Science enthusiasts have built enormous audiences online not only because they appeal to human curiosity, but also because they have a flair for entertainment.\u201cThere are a lot of really wonderful science communicators on YouTube that find a way to break down science concepts; they do these long form videos,\u201d she said. But she says the videos that really go viral are, \u201cshort punchy ones that seem to be taking a swing at things that we hate, or that we\u2019re trying to combat in sci-comm or in the skeptic universe.\u201dSome of this trend may result from algorithms that promote certain types of content over others, often to maximize the time users spend on a site.\u201cThe algorithm is trying to make people react, trying to make people engage,\u201d said Guillaume Chaslot, a former YouTube engineer who now advocates for greater accountability for tech platforms. \u201cWhen you have these very combative videos, it\u2019s very efficient at getting people to watch.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t just for the views, although he admits that aspect was gratifying. As a devotee of empiricism, Mr. Zozaya felt compelled to push back against the discredited autism-vaccines link. He also empathized with the autism community.\u201cThink about it from their perspective,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s people who are like, \u2018I would rather have my child die of X deadly disease and be contagious and put everyone else in danger than have my child get this condition that you were born with.\u2019\u201dAs it happens, he later found out he is on the autism spectrum himself.Mr. Zozaya realized he wasn\u2019t convincing anyone by picking fights, nor was he doing much to further human understanding. But when he shifted toward more informational videos \u2014 like an analysis of the role snakes play in the environment \u2014 his viewership plummeted.\u201cI was really disappointed,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought I had a following mostly made up of people who loved science, because that is what I originally wanted to build on. I wish honestly that people were as much into science as they are into shutting people down.\u201dThere is a real concern in the science communication community about how best to handle the tide of pseudoscience.Emily Gorcenski is a data scientist and activist who has studied how fake science spreads on the internet. In her view, snark or cheeky videos are not the problem: If people are really committed to a piece of pseudoscience, a video from someone like Mr. Zozaya will not convince them otherwise, no matter how respectful. Rather, she\u2019s more concerned with how much science is locked up behind university doors or in paid journals.\u201cWe live in a time of deep polarization on many fronts,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re partly in this position that we\u2019re in because scientific communication, scientific writing, is deeply inaccessible. If there is something that makes it more accessible for people, then I\u2019m all for it.\u201dMr. Zozaya believes he can build the kind of audience he wants: People who love science. It might just take a little longer.\u201cI will definitely keep making videos,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

And on Wednesday evening, student protesters gathered outside the chancellor\u2019s house, then marched to the campus chapel for a second forum. Along the way, they chanted \u201cRelease the video\u201d and \u201cWe\u2019re tired of being sick and tired.\u201dBy the time the march began, Mr. McMonagle said, there were 300 people in the group chat being used to organize it. The forum extended late into the evening, and on Thursday morning, organizers reconvened to put the finishing touches on a campaign that Mr. McMonagle said was meant \u201cto be much larger than just Greek life and hopefully much larger than Syracuse.\u201dThat treatment routinely includes slurs, Mr. McMonagle said in an interview.\u201cNow today there\u2019s a video, and today it\u2019s on social media, and today it\u2019s proven,\u201d he said, and he and his fellow organizers want to \u201cuse this opportunity to say: \u2018Look, here it is.

{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Fix Facebook. Replace It.", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Wu is the author of \u201cThe Attention Merchants: The Epic Struggle to Get Inside Our Heads.\u201dThe right question: What comes after Facebook? Yes, we have come to depend on social networks, but instead of accepting an inherently flawed Facebook monopoly, what we most need now is a new generation of social media platforms that are fundamentally different in their incentives and dedication to protecting user data. Barring a total overhaul of leadership and business model, Facebook will never be that platform.Every business has its founding DNA. Real corporate change is rare, especially when the same leaders remain in charge. In Facebook\u2019s case, we are not speaking of a few missteps here and there, the misbehavior of a few aberrant employees. The problems are central and structural, the predicted consequences of its business model. From the day it first sought revenue, Facebook prioritized growth over any other possible goal, maximizing the harvest of data and human attention. Its promises to investors have demanded an ever-improving ability to spy on and manipulate large populations of people. Facebook, at its core, is a surveillance machine, and to expect that to change is misplaced optimism.What the journalist Walter Lippmann said in 1959 of \u201cfree\u201d TV is also true of \u201cfree\u201d social media: It is ultimately \u201cthe creature, the servant and indeed the prostitute of merchandizing.\u201d But social media itself isn\u2019t going away. It has worked its way into our lives and has come to help satistify the basic human need to connect and catch up. Facebook, in fact, claims lofty goals, saying it seeks to \u201cbring us closer together\u201d and \u201cbuild a global community.\u201d Those are indeed noble purposes that social media can serve. But if they were Facebook\u2019s true goals, we would not be here.The ideal competitor and successor to Facebook would be a platform that actually puts such goals first. To do so, however, it cannot be just another data-hoarder, like Google Plus. If we have learned anything over the last decade, it is that advertising and data-collection models are incompatible with a trustworthy social media network. The conflicts are too formidable, the pressure to amass data and promise everything to advertisers is too strong for even the well-intentioned to resist.So what stands in the way of building a genuine alternative? It isn\u2019t the technology. A good Facebook competitor needs merely to build a platform that links you with friends and allows posting of thoughts, pictures and comments. No, the real challenge is gaining a critical mass of users. Facebook, with its 2.2 billion users, will not disappear, and it has a track record of buying or diminishing its rivals (see Instagram and Foursquare). But as Lyft is proving by stealing market share from Uber, and as Snapchat proved by taking taking younger audiences from Facebook, \u201cnetwork effects\u201d are not destiny. Now is the time for a new generation of Facebook competitors that challenge the mother ship.One set of Facebook alternatives might be provided by firms that are credibly privacy-protective, for which users would pay a small fee (perhaps 99 cents a month). In an age of \u201cfree\u201d social media, paying might sound implausible \u2014 but keep in mind that payment better aligns the incentives of the platform with those of its users. The payment and social network might be bundled with other products such as the iPhone or the Mozilla or Brave browser.Another \u201calt-Facebook\u201d could be a nonprofit that uses that status to signal its dedication to better practices, much as nonprofit hospitals and universities do. Wikipedia is a nonprofit, and it manages nearly as much traffic as Facebook, on a much smaller budget. An \u201calt-Facebook\u201d could be started by Wikimedia, or by former Facebook employees, many of whom have congregated at the Center for Humane Technology, a nonprofit for those looking to change Silicon Valley\u2019s culture. It could even be funded by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which was created in reaction to the failures of commercial television and whose mission includes ensuring access to \u201ctelecommunications services that are commercial free and free of charge.\u201dWhen a company fails, as Facebook has, it is natural for the government to demand that it fix itself or face regulation. But competition can also create pressure to do better. If today\u2019s privacy scandals lead us merely to install Facebook as a regulated monopolist, insulated from competition, we will have failed completely. The world does not need an established church of social media.Tim Wu is a law professor at Columbia, the author of \u201cThe Attention Merchants: The Epic Struggle to Get Inside Our Heads\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

Well, for one, it took place on Monday night, the fourth night of the holiday and not one on which the traditional dinner is called for.But that\u2019s showbiz: Some of the 100 guests, and most of the evening\u2019s performers, were Broadway actors, composers, producers \u2014 and Mondays are when Broadway theaters are dark, meaning casts and crews are available for socializing.It took place in a large downtown apartment in a prewar building, decorated with billowing scarves, bright pillows and hanging palm branches to replicate a Bedouin tent. The usual holiday prayers and songs, which commemorate the biblical exodus of Jews from slavery, were replaced by a high-caliber revue of poetic and musical performances from stars of some of the biggest current Broadway shows, including \u201cHamilton,\u201d \u201cDear Evan Hansen\u201d and \u201cFrozen.\u201d\u201cThe idea is to look at the Passover story about the passage from slavery to freedom and to contextualize it for 2018,\u201d Mr. Kantor said.As guests (of many ethnicities and faiths) arrived, they found small round tables, like tree stumps in a pillow forest, on which small dishes of olives, horseradish and parsley were set by stacks of matzo. Around the periphery of the room, jazz singers, piano players and Broadway performers were stationed, ready. But for what?\u201cI\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m supposed to do here,\u201d said Katie Couric, when she walked into the room, red wine imported from the Galilee region of Israel in a plastic cup in her hand.Ronan Farrow, a reporter for The New Yorker, was equally perplexed. \u201cI feel like this is an Agatha Christie novel we\u2019ve all walked into and someone is not going to be able to leave,\u201d he said.This one may have been the best programmed. After settling in many months ago on Mr. Al Samawi\u2019s story as \u201cthe clothing line\u201d that would extend throughout the night, Mr. Kantor said before the Seder began, \u201cwe have been talking about what we can drape from it.\u201dEach of the Seder performances connected to Mr. Al Samawi\u2019s story, which was told by him and Daniel Pincus, 39, a Jewish businessman and philanthropist who helped him escape Yemen, and whose apartment was the setting for the dinner.Mr. Al Samawi was raised a Muslim, and taught to hate Jews, Christians and Americans. He eventually committed himself to multifaith advocacy and found himself in grave danger amid violence in Yemen brought on by Al Qaeda and other extremist groups. Three years ago, Mr. Al Samawi hid alone in a bathroom, posting about his plight on Facebook. Four virtual American strangers responded and spent the next two weeks trying to save a man they barely knew. \u201cJews and Christians saved my life,\u201d he said.\u201cI was hiding in a small bathroom waiting to be killed and now I\u2019m here,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misstated the timing of Daniel J. Watts\u2019s appearance in \u201cHamilton\u201d on Broadway. It was in 2015 and 2016, not currently.An article on Saturday about a star-studded Passover Seder incorrectly described the writers of the song \u201cOver the Rainbow.\u201d They were children of Jewish immigrants to America; they were not immigrants themselves.Advertisement"}

And when the couple\u2019s three children, who range from kindergarten to middle-school age, beg them for a bigger home where they could have their own rooms, Ms. Panjvani\u2019s answer is always the same: \u201cI tell them I\u2019m not leaving the neighborhood.\u201dSyosset is in the town of Oyster Bay, surrounded by the villages or hamlets of Oyster Bay Cove, Laurel Hollow, Woodbury, Plainview, Hicksville and Muttontown.The area is five square miles, with a population of 18,829, according to the 2010 census. East Asian and South Asian residents compose about 22 percent of the population; 4 percent are Hispanic or Latino.The hamlet is informally divided between north and south, with an invisible boundary at the train station. Above, in north Syosset, homes tend to be older and have more character. \u201cOriginally there were a lot of farms out there,\u201d Ms. Pascullo said. Even after estates were subdivided and developed, a few houses remain from the 1800s on lots of more than an acre.South Syosset, which extends below the Long Island Expressway, is more cookie-cutter. This is the land of starter homes at entry-level prices (beginning at about half a million dollars for a house in a less desirable location or one that needs work).Three retail areas offer conveniences. In addition to the downtown business district and shopping centers at the intersection of Oyster Bay Road and South Woodbury Road, the east-west Jericho Turnpike is a major commercial strip.\u201cThe nice thing is that you can purchase as a first-time home buyer, and you can upgrade many times without leaving the community,\u201d Ms. Pascullo said. Residents even have the option of moving to nearby towns while remaining in the school district.The tricky part is breaking into the market, which has grown competitive with the incursion of New York City residents driven east by rising home prices. Buyers also have to contend with builders who snap up modest houses in cash deals, enlarging or replacing them with expensive properties.Not only is the situation shutting out young would-be homeowners, \u201cit\u2019s also changing a little bit the landscape of the community,\u201d Ms. Pascullo said. \u201cYou have these cute older Capes built in the \u201950s or split-levels or small ranches. As soon as they come on the market, they\u2019re getting scooped right up.\u201dAccording to the real estate website Trulia, as of August 2017, the median price of a home in Syosset was $865,000, a year-on-year increase of 18 percent, based on 944 transactions.Annual property taxes start in the neighborhood of $11,000 and can reach $50,000 on the larger estates.The wonder of Syosset is how quickly suburban subdivisions give way to wooded hillsides. One moment you\u2019re driving past a strip mall; the next, you\u2019re watching horses graze in someone\u2019s backyard.Syosset has 10: seven elementary schools, two middle schools and one high school. The school district teaches coding to grade-schoolers and is celebrated for its music programs. \u201cWe try to make sure kids are not only well educated but well rounded,\u201d said Mr. Rogers, the superintendent.Among the institutions is South Grove Elementary School, at 60 Colony Lane, which enrolls about 415 students in kindergarten through fifth grade. On 2016-17 state tests, 81 percent met standards in English versus 40 percent statewide; 83 percent met standards in math versus 45 percent statewide.H.B. Thompson Middle School, at 98 Ann Drive, enrolls about 870 students in sixth through eight grades. On 2016-17 state tests, 71 percent met standards in English versus 40 percent statewide; 61 percent met standards in math versus 27 percent statewide.Syosset High School, at 70 South Woods Road, enrolls about 2,160 students in ninth through 12th grades. It received a 2017 U.S. News and World Report ranking of 24 in New York and 174 nationally, based on test scores and college preparation. Average 2017 SAT scores were 620 for reading and 640 for math compared with 530 and 528 statewide.Travel time on the Long Island Rail Road\u2019s Port Jefferson line to Pennsylvania Station at rush hour is about one hour. Commuters in south Syosset often use the station in Hicksville, where the service is more frequent and faster (the trip to New York City takes less than 50 minutes at rush hour).In the mid-19th century, Syosset was a farming community called East Woods, although some used the name Buckwheat, referring to a local crop. When the Long Island Rail Road began to extend its main line between Hicksville and Cold Spring Harbor in 1854, East Woods lay along the route.But when the plan fizzled out, the community was left with a stretch of rail that ended abruptly. The railroad built a terminus at the spot and called it Syosset, which is believed to be a corruption of the Dutch \u201cschout,\u201d or sheriff. (Seventeenth-century Dutch settlers had named nearby Manhasset Bay \u201cSchout\u2019s Bay.\u201d)Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Amazon\u2019s New Headquarters Could Mean for Rents", "Date": "2018-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWinning the contest could mean a steeper increase in local housing costs over the next decade, a study finds. Nashville is already contemplating the impact.To some locals, Amazon represented something else: more people, more traffic and, most of all, higher rents in a city where a rising share of residents were already struggling to afford a place to live.Other cities could also see big increases if Amazon picks them. Monthly rents in Boston and Los Angeles could jump by even larger amounts in dollar terms \u2014 albeit from a higher starting point \u2014 reflecting a shortfall in rental housing construction. Denver \u2014 like Nashville, a midsize city that has seen brisk population growth in recent years \u2014 could see its already rapid rate of rent increases hit nearly 6 percent per year, triple the overall rate of inflation.Some potential locations would be less severely affected. Atlanta and Chicago, big cities that have made it relatively easy to build new housing in recent decades, would see only a small rent increase if they won the Amazon project. And Indianapolis, where population growth has been slow and housing is plentiful, would see no effect on its rents at all, according to Zillow\u2019s model. Even in those cities, however, neighborhoods near the Amazon campus would most likely see significant rent increases. (The study did not look at the effect on prices of owner-occupied homes.)Zillow cautions that its estimates are rough, based on a simple model that looks at how rents in each city have responded to past influxes of workers. If the cities respond differently to Amazon\u2019s arrival \u2014 for example, by building more housing \u2014 the impact on rents could be smaller than Zillow\u2019s model estimates. But there are also reasons to think Zillow\u2019s analysis could understate Amazon\u2019s potential impact. The model looks only at the effect of the jobs that the new campus is expected to create directly. If Amazon\u2019s presence draws other businesses to the area, rents could rise even faster.That\u2019s what has happened in Seattle, where a mini-Silicon Valley has sprung up around Amazon\u2019s downtown campus. Facebook, Google and other internet giants have opened satellite offices nearby, and start-ups \u2014 including Zillow itself \u2014 have their headquarters there. \u201cWhat\u2019s so important is once a city is selected that they start to get ahead of the curve,\u201d Mr. Terrazas said.In Nashville, the debate over HQ2 has gotten caught up in a broader discussion of gentrification, race and the consequences of growth. Residents long described Nashville as a small town disguised as a big city. But over the last decade, the city\u2019s tourism industry has taken off, and some of those tourists liked Nashville enough to stay. For years, the Nashville metropolitan area grew by more than 100 residents per day, with many of them moving into newly built downtown apartment complexes.\u201cIf we\u2019re only addressing housing, then I don\u2019t think we\u2019re getting to the root of the issue,\u201d Ms. Harris said. \u201cWage growth is critical in this conversation.\u201d\u201cWe welcome technology, we welcome great jobs to the city, and I think people would even welcome Amazon, but it would have to be a trade-off there,\u201d Mr. Bedne said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to sign a suicide pact.\u201dAmazon, Ms. Schuetz added, should also take housing costs, traffic congestion and related issues into account. After all, she said, Amazon won\u2019t benefit if its workers can\u2019t find places to live, or if they are viewed by existing residents as a hostile force.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long-term relationship,\u201d Ms. Schuetz said. \u201cTo retain good workers over the long haul, you should care about what housing costs could be.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Oklahoma Teachers End Walkout After Winning Raises and Additional Funding", "Date": "2018-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySaying it had achieved all that it could with a walkout, Oklahoma\u2019s largest teachers\u2019 union on Thursday called for educators to return to the classroom and to shift their efforts to supporting candidates in the fall elections who favor increased education spending.At a news conference, Alicia Priest, president of the Oklahoma Education Association, characterized the nine-day walkout as \u201ca victory for teachers,\u201d even as it fell short of its goals.In a deep-red state that has pursued tax and service cuts for years, teachers won a raise of about $6,000, depending on experience, while members of schools\u2019 support staff will see a raise of $1,250.But the biggest pieces of legislation passed before the walkout, not during it, and Ms. Priest acknowledged that many of the protesters\u2019 demands for more schools funding would not be met, because, she said, Republicans in the State Senate would not consider additional revenue sources.\u201cWe got here by electing the wrong people to office,\u201d Ms. Priest said. \u201cWe have the opportunity to make our voices heard at the ballot box.\u201dTeachers had initially demanded the repeal of a capital-gains tax exemption, which applies to wealthy individuals. Instead, many of the new taxes will be paid by average Oklahomans.To fund the measures, as well as some limited new revenues for schools, the Republican-controlled Legislature and Gov. Mary Fallin instituted new or higher taxes on oil and gas production, tobacco, motor fuels, and online sales. The state will also allow ball and dice gambling, which will be taxed.\u201cThe big win happened before the walkout started,\u201d said Brent Bushey, executive director of the Oklahoma Public School Resource Center, which provides administrative services for small school districts. \u201cIt is a short-term win, but my focus is how do we turn this into a long-term focus on education.\u201dGregg Garn, the dean of the college of education at the University of Oklahoma, said that who won or lost is yet to be determined. \u201cThe teachers clearly were able to make some good strides,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the long run, if candidates that support education get elected, that\u2019s what will determine who won or lost.\u201dSome teachers seemed ambivalent about ending the walkout.\u201cI don\u2019t want to say I agree 100 percent with us stopping this walkout, but I do understand,\u201d said Cory Williams, a teacher at George Washington Carver Middle School in Tulsa, who participated in days of protests at the Capitol. \u201cWe are going to get to the point where it is an unstoppable force meets an unmovable object. It is hard to fight against that without changing your tactics.\u201dThe recent wave of teacher protests, which has rocked several conservative states, began this year in West Virginia, where teachers won a $2,000 raise from lawmakers. The outcome of the struggle in Oklahoma was being watched carefully in Kentucky, where some school districts will be closed on Friday as teachers demonstrate in favor of education funding, as well as in Arizona, where a teacher movement calling itself #RedforEd is demanding raises and more money for schools.[Read more on how teacher walkouts in conservative states are threatening Republican control at the state level.]In Arizona, Gov. Doug Ducey, under pressure from teachers who have threatened a walkout, announced on Thursday a plan to provide teachers with a raise by 2020, which he said could be accomplished without raising taxes.In Oklahoma, some rank-and-file educators expressed displeasure on social media that the union was calling off the walkout, and were discussing whether teachers could continue the work stoppage on their own.Nevertheless, the new taxes in Oklahoma represent a victory for teachers in a state that, over the last decade, has pursued some of the deepest tax and public-service cuts in the nation.The oil and gas industry, long favored in the state, was among the groups disappointed by the new taxes.Chad Warmington, president of the Oklahoma Oil & Gas Association, said the industry supported an increase in education funding, but should not have been made to shoulder the burden. He said that because oil and gas prices are volatile, the new production tax was \u201ca raw deal for teachers\u201d and pointed to other areas where taxes could have been raised.Allies of the industry may try to introduce a ballot referendum to reverse the increase in production taxes.As in West Virginia, rank-and-file teachers started the walkout movement by organizing on Facebook, at first without much help from unions. The Oklahoma Education Association gave legislators until late April to provide new revenues or face a walkout, but teachers protested and pushed the union to adopt an April 1 deadline. In Oklahoma, union membership is optional for teachers. Still, the large rallies, marches and lobbying that developed around the walkout would not have been possible without the muscle of state and national labor organizations.Parents, too, participated in protests. Lanae DeArman of Sulphur, Okla., joined picketing teachers at the Capitol, lobbying her representatives to raise taxes to fund education. She had never been involved in politics before, she said, but the condition of her three children\u2019s schools \u2014 aging textbooks, broken furniture \u2014 drove her to act.\u201cIt has gone too far,\u201d she said of the state\u2019s tax cuts. \u201cYou want to be able to keep what you make, but where\u2019s the line? I myself, personally, would be willing to pay a little more if it meant adequate funding for our schools.\u201dMs. DeArman said she planned to vote this year and would be carefully considering candidates\u2019 education platforms.Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, which represents educators in Oklahoma City, said the movement could shake up national politics. \u201cA lot of people in these states, including some of our teachers, voted for Trump,\u201d she said. Now, she added, unions hope to spread the message that conservative policies lead to the school budget cuts that teachers and parents have been protesting.\u201cThe not-so-sleeper issue in this next election is public education,\u201d Ms. Weingarten said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When the Aftermath of a Shooting Is as Devastating as the Crime", "Date": "2018-04-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFictionMaggie doesn\u2019t have the luxury of past righteousness. When she hears the news of the shooting, she can only vaguely recall her former student until another student from Nathan\u2019s composition class writes a Facebook post stating his lack of surprise and recalling the \u201creally weird\u201d nature of Nathan\u2019s essay. The post goes viral, and Maggie\u2019s neighbors suddenly have an object for their anger in the professor who was asleep at the lectern.Maggie\u2019s supervisor informs her that his staff is now expected not only to teach but to function as something between a trained psychologist and the thought police, sniffing out evidence before there is any crime. \u201cAny material that alludes, directly or indirectly, to feelings of sadness, anxiety, anger, violence, hopelessness,\u201d he tells Maggie, will warrant an official alert. But that\u2019s every student, every paper, Maggie reminds her boss. Moreover, the \u201cpersonal experience\u201d essays that are central to English composition classes depend on the mining of painful memories and vulnerabilities. Maggie doesn\u2019t thrive on intimacy, and doesn\u2019t thrill to her students\u2019 secrets and revelations. She is, however, a devoted and excellent teacher: \u201ctough but affectionate, never breaking character, for 90 minutes focused on nothing but the lesson, on the welfare of the bright young people assembled before her.\u201d At a moment when people invite castigation for being chummy with their charges, it\u2019s refreshing to consider a teacher who is faulted for respecting boundaries.Juska, the author of several other novels, including \u201cThe Blessings\u201d (2014), neatly lays the groundwork for a character who would be liable to miss flagrant warning signs. When Maggie\u2019s husband of 17 years left her for another woman, he accused Maggie of having been blind to his misery. Her teenage daughter, Anna, has a history of anxiety and disordered eating, and in the book\u2019s sections told from Anna\u2019s point of view, we learn that Maggie is only dimly aware of her daughter\u2019s continued struggles. Yet as the story moves through its many layers, Maggie\u2019s initial response to Nathan becomes problematic in a different way. As she tells her students, \u201cRemember, fact and truth are two different things.\u201d Nathan\u2019s essay is disturbing \u2014 especially in hindsight \u2014 but where do you draw the line? Nearly all personal writing betrays an element of sadness, shyness or emptiness. And when living behind screens becomes the norm, aren\u2019t even the most successful and well adjusted among us a little bit awkward and isolated?In keeping with a novel about a writing instructor, Juska\u2019s prose is clean and straightforward. She strikes a cozy tone that is the literary opposite of toxic masculinity. In the opening pages, we learn that Maggie lives in a home with \u201chigh beamed ceilings, the soft pile of logs by the wood stove, the sun-bleached pillows piled in the window seat.\u201d We are also introduced to the loose-shingled red barn that \u201clooks romantic from a distance,\u201d and serves as the repository for Maggie\u2019s students\u2019 old essays. The pace can drag, and no novel needs so many descriptions of the color and cast of the sky. But in our age of political rancor and tweet storms befitting our state of emergency, there is something radical about a take on the gun problem that concerns itself more with raising questions than ire.Darkness suffuses \u201cHow to Be Safe,\u201d Tom McAllister\u2019s heady and unsettling exploration of America\u2019s gun violence epidemic. A mass shooting hits the Rust Belt town of Seldom Falls, Pa., once a leading producer of elevator parts and now a pocket of the nation where opportunity has dried up and \u201cguns were gifts you got for 13-year-old boys.\u201d The book\u2019s primary narrator is Anna Crawford, who was recently suspended from her job as a teacher at the school for her negative attitude and unstable behavior. When news of the shooting breaks, she is briefly considered a suspect, and neighbors and friends are all too willing to buy into the idea of Anna as villain. \u201cReports cited anonymous sources talking about everything I\u2019d ever done wrong \u2014 shoplifting, taking too many smoke breaks at work, knocking over a neighbor\u2019s mailbox after an argument. An ex shared nude photos of me, because, he said, anyone who could kill kids had lost her right to privacy.\u201d Anna is quickly cleared of the crime, but people still avoid her. Even her online therapist blocks her.While those surrounding Anna go through the motions of healing, she does not grant herself forgiveness. She is steadfast in her sadness, perhaps the one thing she has claim to. Staggering about town, often half-drunk by midafternoon, she serves as a docent to tragedy and all that follows: the media swarms, the rallies, the memorials, the political infighting, the blip of a presidential visit, the hashtags. In a sadly Delphic feat, McAllister imagines a Friday morning student reflection program called \u201cNever Again.\u201dYet this is far more than a ripped-from-the-headlines story. McAllister, the author of the melancholic novel \u201cThe Young Widower\u2019s Handbook\u201d (2017), delivers here a portrait of a nation vibrating with failure and humiliation. Anna\u2019s history with abusive men long predates the shooting, which partly explains her willingness to serve as sponge for a fresh cycle of misogynistic vitriol. She contends with jeers and emailed threats, only to empathize with her abusers. One of the book\u2019s greatest successes is its exploration of the overlapping forces and impulses behind our nation\u2019s sexual-harassment and firearms crises. Anna visits a confession booth that has popped up on her town\u2019s main street. \u201cI said I was lazy and unfocused and I understood why I was unlovable, but I still wished it weren\u2019t so. Then I said sometimes at night I think maybe I\u2019m actually the one who did the shooting.\u201dMcAllister is a writer of poetic inclinations, and his prose occasionally trips over itself with Werner Herzog-esque beats meant to impart resonance to a story that doesn\u2019t need it. In a section where Anna\u2019s ex-boyfriend Robbie makes her bacon and eggs, we learn: \u201cEggs are chickens that haven\u2019t been born yet. You eat them and then inside you they are born and your body is filled with birds.\u201d On the whole, though, the writing sears \u2014 and reminds us of literature\u2019s power to fill a void that no amount of inhaling the vapors of Twitter will satisfy. \u201cWhat I envisioned was this: No memorial at all. No stone. No American flags every three feet. No ribbons. No priests and no Bible. No symbolic floral arrangements to represent vitality or youth or rebirth. No poet reading a poem about rising from the ashes. No obelisks, for God\u2019s sake. Just dig a huge hole and fill it with guns.\u201dLauren Mechling, a contributing editor at Vogue, has written for The Wall Street Journal and The New Yorker.com.

{"Headline": "San Francisco Earthquake Risks: Questions and Answers", "Date": "2018-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia has a seismic dilemma. A severe housing shortage is forcing the state to build densely and vertically. But building this way increases seismic risks. The proliferation of high-rises in San Francisco adds to the complexity of the city\u2019s earthquake preparedness.Chile and Japan have approaches to seismic resilience that are significantly different from America\u2019s. It\u2019s both a difference in building codes and, perhaps more important, custom. Chile tends to build high-rises in heavy, stiff concrete. Japan\u2019s high-rises in general have steel frames that are less flexible and stronger than American high-rises of similar heights.The city\u2019s building code does not protect its people from earthquakes nearly as much as you might think.Peter Yanev, a San Francisco-based structural engineer and the founder of EQE, a pioneer consulting firm in the field of seismic risk, has spent a lifetime visiting post-earthquake disaster zones. His takeaway from examining building collapses is that structures in seismic zones need redundancy \u2014 walls and beams that offer secondary and tertiary support. For the most part, he admires both Japanese and Chilean building practices.America\u2019s building practices are much more robust than many other countries. But some experts argue that we have so much to lose that we should strengthen the codes even further.Soft soils amplify ground shaking, which is one reason to build on rock. Parts of downtown San Francisco, especially the South of Market area, used to be part of the Bay. The sand and clay used to fill that area comes with the risk of liquefaction, in which the ground becomes quicksand after an earthquake. Some skyscrapers, like Salesforce Tower, are built in areas of soft soils but with construction piles extending to the bedrock deep beneath the surface. This strengthens the building, but the area around it could still suffer significant damage from liquefaction and shaking.Here is Ron Hamburger, one of the country\u2019s leading structural engineers: \u201cVery few of them should fall down,\u201d he said of skyscrapers. \u201cWe would expect that most of these buildings \u2014 60 or 70 percent \u2014 would be repairable.\u201dCalifornia\u2019s building codes call for a 90 percent chance that a structure avoid total collapse. But many engineers and earthquake experts add a crucial caveat. Our newest high-rises are designed with computer models that have never been tested by a very large earthquake. And with each major earthquake we learn more about the violent ground motions that accompany them.In general, California is very underinsured when it comes to earthquakes. Only about 10 percent of homes have earthquake insurance. The state does not publish data on insurance rates for skyscrapers but experts say it can be prohibitively expensive to insure a building close to a seismic fault, as is the case with San Francisco and Los Angeles.It\u2019s been about a century since building codes incorporated earthquake risks in the United States. During that time the main philosophy of the code has remained constant \u2014 avoiding collapse and preserving the lives of those inside a building. There is now an effort among some experts to have the code go further: to mandate that buildings be strong enough to be usable after an earthquake. Lucy Jones, a former disaster specialist with the United States Geological Service, is perhaps the leading proponent of a stronger building code.\u201cThe engineers have been doing what we asked them to do,\u201d she said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t ask them to do enough.\u201dThis is a key point that Ms. Jones and others argue: that even if buildings remain standing the web of connections that make a city work are very vulnerable to earthquakes. Unlike a California suburb where households might be able to live through a reconstruction period after an earthquake with a portable toilet in the backyard, water tanks and a few propane tanks, urban living is very dependent on sewage and water connections and electricity for things like elevators.San Francisco was one of the first cities to establish a chief resilience officer whose job is to study this very question. But experts wonder how much patience residents will have after a strong earthquake. In such a mobile society, big companies could pick up and move elsewhere.Estimates of the costs to home buyers, developers and businesses of a strengthened building code vary. Ibbi Almufti, a researcher with the engineering firm Arup, estimates an added construction cost of up to 5 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Toronto Van Attack Suspect Expressed Anger at Women", "Date": "2018-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTORONTO \u2014 The man identified as the van driver who traumatized Toronto was a socially troubled computer studies graduate who posted a hostile message toward women on Facebook moments before his deadly rampage, according to accounts by the police and his acquaintances on Tuesday.The police have said that Mr. Minassian, who lived in the Toronto suburb of Richmond Hill, intentionally struck the victims in what was likely to count as Canada\u2019s deadliest vehicular assault.Government officials have said the attack did not appear to be an act of terrorism but have not ruled it out.The rampage shattered a peaceful Monday afternoon when a white Ryder rental van roared down Yonge Street, a main Toronto thoroughfare, and plowed into pedestrians along a stretch of more than a mile. Ten people were killed by the van, which the police said Mr. Minassian had rented that morning.Detective Sgt. Graham Gibson of the Toronto Police said 14 people were hurt \u2014 not 15 as the authorities had earlier reported \u2014 with wounds ranging from \u201cscrapes and bruises to terrible injuries.\u201dSergeant Gibson declined to specify the genders of the victims. Asked if the driver had been targeting women, he said, \u201cAt this stage we have no evidence.\u201dWhile the police did not disclose a motive for the rampage, interviews with former acquaintances of Mr. Minassian, witnesses and others, and his now-deleted Facebook account, portray a troubled young man who harbored resentments toward women, had a penchant for computer programming, served briefly in the military last year, and appeared determined to die.Former classmates at Thornlea Secondary School in Thornhill, a Toronto suburb, said Mr. Minassian had displayed extreme social awkwardness. But they said he had seemed harmless, had shown no propensity for violence, and that news that he was the attacker had shocked their close-knit high school community.\u201cHe was an odd guy, and hardly mixed with other students,\u201d said Ari Blaff, a former high school classmate who is now a graduate student in international relations at the University of Toronto. \u201cHe had several tics and would sometimes grab the top of his shirt and spit on it, meow in the hallways and say, \u2018I am afraid of girls.\u2019 It was like a mantra.\u201dMr. Minassian did not express strong ideological views or harass women, Mr. Blaff said, but he was isolated and others privately made fun of him.\u201cHe was a loner and had few friends,\u201d Mr. Blaff said.Josh Kirstein, who took a photography class with Mr. Minassian in high school and works in the mental health field, said Mr. Minassian had difficulty communicating and expressed fear that women could hurt him. Other classmates said he literally ran away when women approached, even female students determined to befriend him.\u201cHe would cower and avoid eye contact when he saw a girl,\u201d Mr. Kirstein said. \u201cHe would shut down completely.\u201d Mr. Kirstein added, \u201cI never saw him have a normal conversation.\u201d Classmates said he sometimes joked around with other male students.Other signs of sympathy for misogyny appeared on Mr. Minassian\u2019s Facebook account.A posting that Sergeant Gibson said the suspect had made minutes before the rampage praised Elliot Rodger, who killed six people in a May 2014 rampage in Isla Vista, Calif., before shooting himself.Mr. Rodger had posted a YouTube video describing his rage that women had rejected him and that he was a virgin at age 22.The Facebook posting by Mr. Minassian praised \u201cincels,\u201d or involuntary celibates, a term used in a Reddit group where men vented frustrations that tipped into misogyny.Mr. Rodger had referred to men who are successful with women as \u201cChads\u201d and to the unattainable women who rejected him as \u201cStacys.\u201d Mr. Rodger had also called himself an \u201cincel.\u201dMr. Minassian\u2019s Facebook account has been suspended, but the company confirmed in an email the authenticity of the posting.Mr. Minassian recently graduated from a computer studies program at Seneca College in North York, a Toronto suburb, where he had studied for about seven years.While he appeared to be skilled at computers, he did not take to military life. The Canadian Department of National Defense said in a statement that Mr. Minassian joined the armed forces on Aug. 23 of last year and quit two months later, after 16 days of basic training.While Canadian officials were not characterizing the van rampage as terrorism, it raised fears about Toronto\u2019s vulnerability to a terrorist attack. The scene evoked memories of deadly vehicle rampages carried out by extremists in a number of major Western cities in recent years, including New York, London, Stockholm, Berlin, Barcelona and Nice, France.At the court hearing Tuesday, the judge, Stephen Weisberg, asked Mr. Minassian whether he understood a court order not to contact any survivors. \u201cYes,\u201d he replied in a clear and loud voice.He was dressed in a white jumpsuit with his hands cuffed behind his back. Seven uniformed police officers watched over him in the hearing room.Mr. Minassian was represented at the hearing by a court-appointed lawyer with whom he had an extended, whispered conversation from a prisoners box.He was being held without bail and the next hearing is on May 10. It is unclear when he will enter a plea.Witness accounts and amateur cellphone videos that captured the Toronto rampage and the suspect\u2019s arrest depicted a sequence of horrific scenes.David Alce, a 53-year-old network engineer, was waiting at a traffic light at Yonge Street and Finch Avenue on his way to the park to enjoy a sunny day off when he saw a white van careening across the intersection.At around 1:20 p.m., Mr. Alce said, his initial disbelief turned to shock and then horror as the speeding van cut through the intersection, mounted the curb and began to swerve and mow people down.Mr. Alce saw the driver ram four people, he said, and then another four. One woman was thrown several feet into the air. A man was hit midsection before falling. Another was smashed in the head. The van made a roaring sound.\u201cAt first I thought the driver was having a heart attack before I realized what was happening,\u201d Mr. Alce said.\u201cI watched the car for a good two blocks,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t see the driver\u2019s face. There was a loud bang as he hit the curb. There was confusion. Some people tended to the wounded. Others were on their cellphones. One woman was sobbing uncontrollably on the corner.\u201dMr. Alce, for his part, went to see whether he could help, rolling over some of the victims to determine whether they were alive, and administering CPR.Mr. Alce, an Ottawa native, said he moved to Toronto about 20 years ago, drawn by the city\u2019s peaceful atmosphere and lack of crime. He said the attack had destroyed the innocence of a multicultural, humanistic city.\u201cThis is the first time I have seen something this horrific,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a loss of innocence. Toronto is peaceful. That is why I love it here.\u201dOther Torontonians, still in shock, were adamant that the city would quickly recover. On Tuesday morning, commuters heading to work were hunched over newspapers. \u201cCarnage in Toronto,\u201d said the front-page headline of The Globe and Mail.As well-wishers continued to gather at an impromptu memorial near the scene of the attack, hazardous material cleanup teams wearing respirators and jumpsuits were using absorbent powder to remove bloodstains from the sidewalk.Nancy Brooks, 56, who works in human resources for the Ontario government, often jogs through the area where the episode occurred. She said that in Canada, which prides itself on diversity and a spirit of tolerance, it was particularly jarring.\u201cThis is not something that happens here,\u201d she said. \u201cWe always think we are insulated from this kind of thing. We like to think we are like Switzerland.\u201dRick Gladstone contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "YouTube Shooting Puts a Focus on Workplace Security", "Date": "2018-04-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe laid-back companies of Silicon Valley are known for corporate headquarters that resemble universities, where employees mingle with tourists taking selfies and collaborations take shape out on the quad.But those generous green spaces and relaxed atmospheres come with a trade-off: They\u2019re difficult to secure.Many Google employees love the headquarters\u2019 open nature but some worry about it, according to one current and one former Google employee who declined to be named because of a company policy barring workers from speaking to the news media. There is often no barrier between employees and the public, they said. People \u2014 most likely other employees \u2014 sometimes slip into buildings behind workers with badges, they said, and neither had ever seen an armed guard on campus. Google declined to comment.The shooting this week at the headquarters of YouTube, a Google-owned company about 25 miles north in San Bruno, has highlighted the security risks of Silicon Valley\u2019s relatively open corporate campuses \u2014 particularly as tech companies\u2019 expanding influence angers more people online.But the risk is not confined to the tech sector. Many companies across the country are similarly exposed, reflecting an open-door policy that for generations has pervaded corporate America, where safety training has long focused on fire drills, earthquake-sheltering procedures and accident cleanup.\u201cI just don\u2019t know how we got here,\u201d said James D. Smith, president of the American Society of Safety Engineers. \u201cWe would never be thinking 10, 15 years ago that this would be an issue.\u201dMs. Aghdam shot the people in an enclosed courtyard where employees dined. YouTube said she had entered the courtyard through a parking garage. The gate between the parking garage and the courtyard was unlocked, according to Zach Vorhies, an engineer at YouTube. A former YouTube employee who used to handle threats from disgruntled video creators, but was not allowed to speak about it publicly, said his team repeatedly warned YouTube security about the risk of the parking garage and unlocked gate, but it was never fixed.YouTube said in a statement on Wednesday that Ms. Aghdam never entered the building itself thanks to other security protections. The company said it was \u201crevisiting this incident in detail\u201d and would be increasing security at all of its offices around the world.Workplace shootings have fueled a cottage industry of security consultants who show employees how to manage panic, when to run or hide, and how to fight as a last resort. Lesson plans identify which filing cabinets or pieces of furniture offer the best protection, and which office tools can become improvised weapons. A full day of training can cost companies thousands of dollars.Companies are sending their employees to self-defense classes and their security personnel to gun ranges to test active-shooter threats in virtual reality. Architects are designing offices with designated safe rooms. Insurance providers are offering lower premiums for corporate clients with stronger security.\u201cIf you can\u2019t protect the work force, you\u2019re putting your entire operation at risk,\u201d said Arnette Heintze, a former Secret Service agent who runs the security consulting firm Hillard Heintze, which posted record revenue in the most recent quarter.At Apple\u2019s new campus in Cupertino, Calif., visitors are required to enter through a single, guarded entrance. The headquarters have a large courtyard, but reaching it requires someone to pass through the building.One former Facebook employee who worked on the company\u2019s security protocols, who declined to be named because of Facebook\u2019s prohibition on discussing internal company matters, said the company received dozens of threats a week.In recent years, Facebook has increased security at the entrances to its headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., but its parking lots and surrounding areas remain accessible. \u201cThe safety of our employees is paramount, and we work hard every day to maintain a safe and secure environment for our community,\u201d Jamil Walker, a Facebook spokesman, said in an email.Some security experts instruct clients to shift their parking lots farther away from the main facility, giving more time for potential attackers to have second thoughts and for guards to act on a threat. Consultants recommend that executive offices remain unlabeled to make them less of a target.Companies of all kinds have stepped up security. General Mills said it made physical changes to its building in Minneapolis to better prepare for an active shooter situation, but did not provide specifics. Wendy\u2019s said it had installed upgraded security cameras throughout its headquarters in Dublin, Ohio; set up advanced access control systems that can lock down different parts of the facility; and upgraded its phone systems with emergency messaging capabilities.Hallmark and Hershey said they show employees a training video from the Center for Personal Protection and Safety that covers active shooter protocol. Some companies use a softer term \u2014 \u201chostile intruder\u201d \u2014 to describe the training, while others add customized introductions to the footage.Employees are being asked to download internal apps loaded with safety plans, maps and emergency alerts. Some are told that their bonuses will be withheld if they do not attend mandatory drills.And preventive tactics are gaining traction. Employers are hiring social media trackers and data analysts to search for warning signs in employee behavior. Accenture said it has a behavioral threat assessment team made up of human resources representatives, lawyers, on-call psychologists and others.But security remains a matter of balance.\u201cYou don\u2019t want a security program so restrictive that it hinders the company from doing the business it\u2019s in,\u201d Mr. Heintze said.Employees looking for convenience tend to prop open automatically locking doors. Some will pass a badge over a turnstile to a friend who forgot his or hers.One corporate client described its facility to John M. White, the chief executive of the Protection Management security consulting firm, as being fully secure. Within three hours, Mr. White found that he could waltz through most of the building\u2019s doors without being screened and that some were so old they would not lock.Another customer spent several hundred thousand dollars installing security cameras, only to find that their views were obstructed. Mr. White said he has spoken to employees who, in a theoretical attack, said they would be unwilling to break a window to escape out of fear of being fired later.\u201cYou can\u2019t just throw a million dollars at security and say that now the problem\u2019s gone,\u201d he said. \u201cIn some ways, it can be a facade \u2014 you could have the most secure facility in the world, and there will still be some risks you\u2019re going to have to accept and manage.\u201dSheera Frenkel contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Each Attack He Carried the Wounded. Then He Became a Victim.", "Date": "2018-04-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 He was a retired, medal-winning wrestler, often one of the first to arrive after a suicide bombing to help evacuate the wounded on the shoulders of his muscular frame.Mr. Allahdad\u2019s death punctuated the cycle of loss in Afghanistan, so relentless that survivors of one attack often end up victims of the next. In the age of social media, a Facebook post offering condolences for one bombing can often turn out to be the poster\u2019s last public words.When the bomber struck, Mr. Allahdad, 33, had been visiting a shop he had set up across from the office, where three apprentices would photocopy documents for a small fee. Two of the apprentices also were killed, and the third was battling for his life on Monday at a hospital.The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the bombing, in which most victims were members of Afghanistan\u2019s Shiite Muslim minority. The Islamic State, the Sunni Muslim extremist group, has said it is responsible for almost all attacks against Afghan Shiites in recent years.But many Afghan and American officials say there is often an overlap between the facilitating networks used in urban attacks claimed by the Islamic State in recent years and those used by the extreme elements of the Taliban, particularly the Haqqani Network, which had a long history of deadly urban attacks even before the rise of the Islamic State.As mass-casualty attacks have increased in Kabul, the country\u2019s capital, Kabul Province has become the deadliest one for civilians, surpassing Taliban-dominated southern areas where local residents have long borne the brunt of the war, now in its 17th year. Last year, nearly 500 civilians were killed in attacks in the city and 1,350 were wounded, according to the United Nations.While the violence has turned life in Kabul into a game of chance, more recently the odds have been worse for Shiites like Mr. Allahdad.His home is on a busy road in a western Kabul neighborhood. Almost every street pole is adorned with a photograph of an attack victim.\u201cHe was just a poor man\u2019s son trying to earn bread for his children,\u201d said his elderly father, Hussain Ali Allahdad, wiping his tears with a white kerchief.As visitors arrived on Monday morning to pay their respects, someone would recite another verse of the Quran before hands were raised in prayer. The father would lean back against the wall and close his eyes.Many visitors apologized for having shown up so late, busy with other funerals and burials. One had a cousin killed in the bombing, another had a brother-in-law, a third had a neighbor.The visitors tried to console the father by emphasizing that in the eyes of the Shiite community, his son was a martyr who had sacrificed his life for a noble cause.\u201cNot everyone gets the rank of martyr,\u201d said one visitor who walked with a limp.\u201cYes, he was lucky to become a martyr,\u201d said another. \u201cThat he has left us burning here \u2014 that\u2019s a separate issue.\u201dIn western Kabul where many Shiites live, Mr. Allahdad had quite a presence \u2014 not only for his reputation as a wrestler, but also as the defender of an increasingly vulnerable community. Some Shiite youths have started carrying weapons at religious gatherings, no longer trusting the authorities to protect them. They looked to Mr. Allahdad as a mobilizer and a leader.\u201cHe was my student for 20 years \u2014 he started wrestling when he was 13,\u201d said Sher Jan Ahmadi, deputy head of the country\u2019s wrestling federation.Mr. Allahdad had amassed many accolades in his wrestling career, the medals hanging at his home and office. He won domestic tournaments as a teenager, and in his youth he dominated his weight class of 214 pounds. In one of the last international tournaments he took part in, held in Pakistan, he won a silver medal.Mr. Allahdad also had an entrepreneurial ambition. He began with a small crockery business, then expanded to a travel agency that specialized in pilgrimages to Mecca, in Saudi Arabia, and the Shiite holy city of Karbala in southern Iraq. He awarded free trips to his best wrestling students.As attacks escalated against Shiite places of worship in Afghanistan, the former wrestler found a more urgent use for his strength. He became a volunteer emergency responder, often among the first at the scene.When another mosque was attacked last June, cellphone video showed Mr. Allahdad rushing a bloodied middle-aged man on his shoulder to the back of a police truck. Covered in blood again, he sat on the floor and said he might have dislocated his hip. Someone bent down to help him out.\u201cGood?\u201d the person asked.\u201cYes, good,\u201d said Mr. Allahdad as he got back on his feet and rushed back into the smoke coming from the mosque.Late on Sunday evening, hundreds of mourners gathered at the walled family cemetery, where just two weeks earlier Mr. Allahdad and two dozen relatives had planted trees to welcome spring. His body was removed from an ambulance, and after a brief prayer, lowered into his grave.Just days before he was killed, Mr. Allahdad had expressed to an older brother, Ghulam Sakhi, how tired he had been: \u201cFor three months, or six months, I just want to go somewhere where I don\u2019t hear anything.\u201dFahim Abed and Fatima Faizi contributed reporting from Kabul, and Zabihullah Ghazi from Jalalabad, Afghanistan.Advertisement"}

In its notifications, Facebook said that while the information harvested was largely limited to what was on people\u2019s public profiles, \u201ca small number of people\u201d also shared information from their Facebook timeline, posts and messages.Facebook did not specify how many people\u2019s messages were gathered and said it was taking as broad a view as possible when notifying people that their data may have been taken.How Mr. Zuckerberg publicly addresses these problems in congressional hearings on Tuesday and Wednesday will be closely scrutinized. Facebook faces possible regulation and other changes amid a backlash over the lack of data privacy.It is not clear whether the direct messages were among the data eventually provided to Cambridge Analytica. In an interview on Tuesday, Mr. Kogan told The Times that the private messages were harvested from a limited number of people, likely \u201ca couple thousand,\u201d as part of a separate academic research project and never provided to Cambridge Analytica.He said the messages were collected as part of research that he conducted at Cambridge University in 2013 and the first half of 2014, before he began working with Cambridge Analytica. The messages were collected for research into how people use emojis to convey emotions.Mr. Kogan said the messages were kept securely in his university lab, known as the Cambridge Prosociality and Well-Being Lab, and access was restricted to a small group of people.The message data \u201cwas obviously sensitive so we tried to be careful about who could access it,\u201d Mr. Kogan said. He stressed that his Facebook app collected messages only from a \u201ccouple thousand\u201d people who completed his questionnaire, not from their friends.During Mr. Kogan\u2019s later work for Cambridge Analytica, his Facebook app took data from people who took his questionnaire and from all their friends. But the data did not include private messages \u2014 it included only names, birth dates, locations and pages the users had liked, he said.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of a headline with this article misidentified the entity that improperly harvested the personal information of up to 87 million Facebook users. The information was collected though a quiz app developed by the researcher Aleskandr Kogan, not by the consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.Sheera Frenkel reported from San Francisco, Matthew Rosenberg from Washington and Nicholas Confessore from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Humble Potato Is Exalted in the Mountains of Peru", "Date": "2018-04-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChahuaytire, Peru \u2014 Gumercinda Quispe is a descendant of Peruvian Incas and here, high in the Andes, more than 12,500 feet above sea level, she has prepared a nourishing, spicy potato soup, quacha chu\u00f1o.She has made it with both fresh potatoes and chu\u00f1o, the dried, hard white potatoes that are still prepared just a stone\u2019s throw away. The ancient preservation process includes soaking them in an icy stream, stomping them by foot to remove the skins and drying them in the sun.I love potatoes. They are not a staple in my native India, as they are in Peru. In India, they are a beloved, cheap treat. Cooked in thousands of different ways, almost always creatively burnished with selective spoonfuls from a treasure chest of seasonings and spices, potatoes are served in every town and village at mealtimes and as chutney-augmented street snacks. I wanted to learn more about potatoes here in the land of their birth.In the little mountain village of Chahuaytire near the town of Pisac in southern Peru, Ms. Quispe and I sat down at a table close to the warm, sooty hearth in the rustic restaurant where she works. The sun was shining bright outside, and the sky was a clear, cold blue.\u201cPut some sauce in the soup and drink from the bowl,\u201d she said, motioning to the verdant uchucuta sauce she had prepared. \u201cUchu\u201d means \u201cchiles\u201d in the Quechua language of the Incas, and \u201ccuta\u201d means \u201cground.\u201dThe sauce, a mouth-smackingly good fresh chutney to this Indian, is not just hot from one of the dozens of chiles native to Peru, but sour from limes that came with the Spaniards, and deeply aromatic from huacatay and other wild herbs that grow in the mountains.There was a time when Incas used only wild Peruvian herbs, but today, after centuries of Spanish influence, they go to the market and buy an asnapa, a bouquet of herbs that could include the New World huacatay but also gifts from the Old World like cilantro, mint, oregano, parsley and tarragon.Potatoes come in every texture and color. You can see them in the markets: reds, blues, purples, yellows and pinks, sometimes ringed with two colors when sliced open. The texture of some varieties can be changed by putting them out in the sun for a few days before cooking them. This turns them softer and silkier.Some are shaped like a puma\u2019s paw; others, an alpaca\u2019s nose or a cat\u2019s claw. Native to the Andes in Peru and northwest Bolivia, potatoes were domesticated more than 10,000 years ago. And yet new varieties are being discovered all the time.Potato banks \u2014 like the one in the Pisac region of the Andes that stores seeds in a climate-controlled vault for 1,300 varieties of potatoes \u2014 are always searching for new varieties, as are dozens of creative Peruvian chefs on the lookout for wild and unusual indigenous ingredients.Freeze-drying the potato for chu\u00f1o was just one method used to increase its life after harvest. Running or walking was the chief mode of transportation for most ancient Andean peoples (certainly the Incas); they could easily carry dried potatoes with them and make a quick stew with local herbs, chiles and water from a mountain stream whenever hunger called.Dried potatoes in Peru come in many forms. They can look like pebbles \u2014 hard and smooth, in white or purple. They can look like large gravel, with different colors. But they can also be soft, tasting and smelling as funky as fermented bean curd or ripe cheese. Each has a different flavor and texture.The Inca guide who traveled with me through the Andes still hikes carrying dried potatoes (sometimes in a powdered form) and llama jerky, essential ingredients for a soup he considers a part of his cultural inheritance.Potatoes were given superb treatment wherever I traveled. At the Sumaq Hotel in the town of Aguas Calientes, there was pastel de papa, a meltingly soft potato cake with layers of thin-sliced potato, bacon and cheese.Papa a la Huancaina, which originated in the town of Huancayo in the central highlands and is considered by many to be Peru\u2019s national dish, was everywhere, including the cafeteria at Machu Picchu. Boiled, sliced potatoes and boiled, sliced eggs were placed on top of lettuce leaves with some olives strewn about, and dressed with a Huancaina sauce that brought the dish together. Its main ingredient was the long, aromatic orange chile, aji amarillo.Perhaps my favorite dish of all was causa. Like lasagnas, causas are layered terrinelike dishes, generally served cold, though room temperature can also work for some of them.Instead of pasta, potatoes \u2014 mashed and seasoned with an aji amarillo paste, lime juice, olive oil and salt \u2014 are the most important element in a causa. They can provide one, two or even three of the layers in the dish. The other in-between layers could include seafood salad, vegetable salad, chicken salad or, as in the Amazon region, pork-and-onion salad made with the addition of the fiery, round charapita chile.Whichever way it is served, causa is always soothing \u2014 and refreshingly delicious. For the hotter regions of Peru, it is just as cooling and satisfying as that warming soup is in the Andean mountains.Advertisement"}

The stories shared sometimes concerned workplace harassment, but they also involved lecherous doctors, relatives or boyfriends. There was a feverishness to the way women were telling them \u2014 as if it had just occurred to them how lonely they\u2019d felt.The most concrete goal of the \u201cMe Too\u201d movement has been to reform workplace culture. But the movement has also accomplished something broader, and more nebulous: It has given women the ability to talk about some of the hardest moments of their lives with less shame, stigma or fear of repercussions.It has, in other words, created room for the sort of discussions that once were restricted to, essentially, just one type of public space: advice columns. For decades, the columns were where women with creepy bosses or abusive husbands went to air their grievances.\u201cDear Miss Dix, how should a boss treat the girls under him? And what should be their attitude toward him?\u201d wrote Mother of Three Girls in a letter to an advice columnist from 1935. \u201cWhen most young girls go to work the first thing they have to learn is how to keep the boss from petting them, putting his arms around them and kissing them.\u201d The columnist, Dorothy Dix \u2014 the pseudonym used by the journalist Elizabeth Gilmer \u2014 responded that a young woman should treat her employer with respect and formality and that her boss should do the same.When Gilmer began writing for The New Orleans Picayune in 1896, most major papers published columns on so-called women\u2019s issues; the authors all had alliterative names like Fanny Fern, Jennie June or Catharine Cole. The tone of the columns tended to be syrupy and mawkish, filled with false cheer.Gilmer decided that her advice column would be different: \u201cIt came to me that everything in the world had been written about women and for women, except the truth. They had been celebrated as angels. They had been pitied as martyrs,\u201d she later wrote when describing the origins of what became her widely syndicated column. \u201cIt was time for them to shake themselves up and get busy at being practical.\u201dPractical meant that nothing ever roused Gilmer; her columns were a space for a frank discussion of the forces that shaped women\u2019s lives during the era. Gilmer received thousands of letters about unwanted pregnancies, loveless marriages and dissatisfaction with domestic life. She urged her readers to take a pragmatic attitude, to drop any romantic fantasies: Divorce laws were stringent and there were few careers available to women. Gilmer could be harsh, but at least her readers could feel some assurance that their problems weren\u2019t theirs alone.\u201cMy husband is a brute. He mistreats me. He has affairs with other women. He wants to be rid of me,\u201d a woman once wrote Dix.\u201cMy heart bleeds for you,\u201d Dix replied. \u201cBut will you be any better off if you are divorced? A beast of a husband is no worse than the wolf at the door.\u201dIf advice columns were a kind of predecessor to \u201dMe Too\u201d movement that fostered an honest discussion about womanhood, they were different in that they typically did not seek to dismantle the strictures their readers faced. Columnists generally upheld social convention; their responses gave women a gauge of what they were expected to tolerate.The twin sisters Esther Lederer and Pauline Phillips began writing their columns in the mid-1950s under the pen names Ann Landers and Abigail Van Buren. After the sisters published a letter, readers would chime in, elaborating on the original column. There were long trains of conversation about marital problems and the difficulties of being a stay-at-home mother.At the same time, Lederer and Phillips urged many unhappy wives against divorce. When they started their columns, both sisters believed that a distracted husband, a boring husband or an unloving husband were all better than no husband at all, though their views on divorce, among other social matters, progressed as time went on.Helen Gurley Brown wasn\u2019t a columnist but published a wildly popular advice book in 1962 called \u201cSex and the Single Girl.\u201d Her central point was that sex was joyful and shameless; the corollary was that she encouraged readers to treat unwanted sexual advances as flattering. \u201cAnyone who wants to kiss you or sleep with you isn\u2019t handing you a mortal insult but paying you a compliment,\u201d she wrote.According to a study by David Gudelunas at the University of Tampa, when Lederer started her column, 91 percent of letters included a question intended for her; by the 1990s, only 34 percent did. By then, many instead contained personal anecdotes or responded to a previously published question. Readers didn\u2019t appear to be looking for advice: they were looking to participate, to get things off their chest \u2014 years before there were websites set up to foster those kinds of communities.Those readers didn\u2019t want to be told by Ann Landers, or anyone else, what they had to tolerate. They craved a space where their problems and frustrations would be regarded as normal \u2014 a place where women could chime in and say, me too.Jessica Weisberg is a journalist and the author of \u201cAsking for a Friend: Three Centuries of Advice on Life, Love, Money and Other Burning Questions From a Nation Obsessed.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inside Southwest Flight 1380, 20 Minutes of Chaos and Terror", "Date": "2018-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTens of thousands of feet above the earth, the passengers clasped hands with strangers, prayed together and got ready to die.Moments earlier on Tuesday morning, they had been playing Sudoku, catching up on their reading for church and curling up together to watch funny movies as their Southwest Airlines flight climbed above 30,000 feet on its way from New York to Dallas. It was around 11 a.m., 20 minutes into a four-hour flight, as they skimmed above the clouds and waited for flight attendants to hand out drinks.Then, with a deafening roar, Flight 1380 became a midair scene of chaos and terror for the 144 passengers and five crew members on board.With no apparent warning, the plane\u2019s left engine exploded after one of its fan blades broke off. A gust of shrapnel blew out a window, partly sucking one passenger in Row 14 headfirst into the sky. Oxygen masks dropped down and the plane plunged thousands of feet in a minute.Over the next 20 minutes, the depressurized cabin air swirled with wind and debris, panic and prayers as the pilot rerouted the plane to Philadelphia for an emergency landing.\u201cI grabbed my wife\u2019s hand and I started praying: \u2018Dear Jesus, send some angels. Just save us from this,\u2019\u201d said Timothy C. Bourman, 36, a pastor from Woodside, N.Y., who was on his way to a church retreat in San Antonio. \u201cI thought we were goners.\u201dCaptain Shults was well trained to handle stress in the cockpit. She had flown supersonic F/A-18 Hornets as one of the Navy\u2019s first female pilots at a time when women were still barred from combat duty, before leaving active service in 1993. Captain Shults calmly radioed air traffic controllers in Philadelphia to discuss her approach. She told them the flight was carrying injured passengers and needed emergency medics on the ground.\u201cNo it\u2019s not on fire, but part of it is missing,\u201d she responded. \u201cThey said there\u2019s a hole and, uh, someone went out.\u201dIt had all started so normally on Tuesday morning.When the Boeing 737 took off from La Guardia Airport, it was fresh off an inspection on Sunday night, though investigators on Wednesday said the likely cause of the explosion was metal fatigue in an engine blade.Its passengers were New Yorkers heading to San Antonio or Dallas, for a meeting or a technology conference. They were Texans and New Mexicans heading home after a magical first visit to New York City, an education conference in Midtown Manhattan, or a trip to see family.They spent the morning at the airport making jokes about bag-check fees, snapping selfies on the plane, even getting into a tiff with another passenger about who got to board first. Just another day of air travel in America.But by 11:10 a.m., as the flight descended toward Philadelphia, those same passengers were scrambling to put on oxygen masks and buy internet access so they could send a last message to their children and families. Marty Martinez, 29, of Dallas, held a yellow oxygen mask to his face as he live-streamed the descent on Facebook. \u201cIt appears we are going down!\u201d he wrote.Pastor Bourman said he could not figure out how to use his mask, and decided it would not save him if the plane crashed. Instead, he sat and prayed as his wife, Amanda, managed to connect her phone to the plane\u2019s Wi-Fi. They began texting Pastor Bourman\u2019s father to tell him what had happened and to convey a message to the couple\u2019s three daughters, 6, 4 and 2 years old:Pray.Plane blew an engine.We are going to try to land.Tell the girls we love them and that Jesus is with them always.Across from the blown-out window, Sheri Sears, 43, thought about her 11-year-old daughter, Tyley. Ms. Sears\u2019s own father had died when she was 7, and she kept thinking to herself: I\u2019m not going to be there for her.Ms. Sears said she offered a thin prayer for mercy: \u201cIf this is your will, God, please let me go quickly. Don\u2019t let me suffer.\u201dHer friend and travel companion, Tim McGinty, reassured his wife and Ms. Sears that they would be fine, and tightened their seatbelts. Then he sprang up to help drag the injured passenger, Jennifer Riordan, back into the plane.Ms. Riordan was unconscious and bleeding as Mr. McGinty and another passenger, a firefighter from north of Dallas, laid her across a row of seats. A retired nurse and flight attendants rushed up and helped Mr. McGinty perform CPR all the way to Philadelphia, but it was no use.Ms. Riordan, 43, a Wells Fargo executive and mother of two from Albuquerque, was pronounced dead at a hospital of what medical examiners later called blunt trauma to her head, neck and torso. News of her death rippled through Albuquerque, where the Chamber of Commerce held a moment of silence and ranks of nonprofit leaders, arts advocates and others across the city mourned.Courtney Padilla, 34, a passenger from Albuquerque who was traveling home with her wife, mother, grandmother and aunt, said she had not met Ms. Riordan personally, but knew her by name and her reputation as a community supporter.Ms. Padilla and her family were sitting at the front of the plane when the engine exploded, and like other passengers, they stayed in their seats and held onto each other as the desperate attempt to save Ms. Riordan\u2019s life played out just rows behind them.A stranger beside Ms. Padilla assured her that she had just celebrated her 76th birthday, and that they would not be dying that day. Ms. Padilla, in turn, made eye contact to support a younger girl sitting diagonally in front of her.\u201cYou were holding on to whoever was next to you,\u201d Ms. Padilla said.On the right side of the plane, over the wing, Jim Demetros, 55, watched flight attendants carrying portable oxygen bottles thread along the aisle to make sure the passengers \u2014 who included a number of children \u2014 were secured.As they approached Philadelphia International Airport, Mr. Demetros said the plane vibrated as it made a slow turn. About two minutes before they landed, Matt Tranchin\u2019s phone got reception, so he called his wife and told her they were about to hit the ground. He figured they had a 50-50 chance of surviving.Over the intercom, the crew sternly told passengers to put their heads down and brace themselves. Ms. Sears held onto her friend in the seat next to her and wondered, \u201cWill it stop? Will it crash? Will it explode?\u201dIt landed.It landed gently at around 11:20, and with whoops and applause, the passengers pulled out their cellphones to text and call their families to report that they were all right.The cabin went quiet as medics climbed on board and carried Ms. Riordan out on a stretcher, and flight attendants checked on seven other passengers who suffered minor injuries. They talked with the captain and crew and walked off the plane to talk to investigators, watching the story of Flight 1380 saturate the television screens around the airport as they waited for their new flights home. It was hard to grasp.\u201cWe were really on that plane,\u201d Ms. Sears said. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable we made it through that.\u201dZach Wichter, Matt Stevens and Christina Caron contributed reporting.

While indigenous Oaxacan culture is celebrated by photographers from all over the world, Ms. Fabi\u00e1n wanted to capture its power. She turned to subjects she knew would make arresting images: her mother, cousins, nieces, friends. \u201cOver history, women in the world suffer discrimination,\u201d Ms. Fabi\u00e1n said. \u201cIn Mexico, being a woman and also looking indigenous puts us in a very vulnerable position. \u2018Mestiza\u2019 is a photo project to give a voice and image to the minorities, who are my people.\u201dUsing those she knew intimately as her subjects made the project a collaboration. Her subjects, her bloodline, wanted to convey her message. \u201cThey put their time and their souls in these images,\u201d Ms. Fabi\u00e1n said. \u201cI waited and I captured them.\u201d That perspective is a commingling of old and contemporary artistic sensibilities \u2014 images that look as old as a Rembrandt and as new as something you\u2019ve never seen.

Even partly nude, subjects look as though ready to take on the world. Not until she was deep in the project did she even know how it would shape up. She knew she would be creating something that veered from the current photographic trends in digital and smartphone image making. She also knew that, as always with film photography, alchemy, or the image gods, would have to be on her side.\u201cI think you create something with the simple idea to give it shape and to share it, then it grows its own legs and runs wherever others connect with it,\u201d she said.

Its social purpose is \u201cto give a voice and image to the minorities, who are my people,\u201d she said. While Oaxaca is a global tourist destination, its indigenous communities still face discrimination and misunderstanding. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s idealistic of me,\u201d she said, \u201c but I hope others see us, and that\u2019ll maybe change something, like maybe make us feel more empathetic toward other humans, other cultures, and embrace our differences.

{"Headline": "Charles Neville of the Neville Brothers Is Dead at 79", "Date": "2018-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCharles Neville, the saxophonist in New Orleans\u2019s most celebrated band, the Neville Brothers, died on Friday at his home in Huntington, Mass. He was 79.The Neville Brothers gathered New Orleans\u2019s abundant musical heritage and carried it forward. Art, Aaron, Charles and Cyril Neville formed their band in 1977 and maintained it, amid other projects, until disbanding in 2012. (They reunited for a farewell concert in New Orleans in 2015.)The group melded rhythm and blues, gospel, doo-wop, rock, blues, soul, jazz, funk and New Orleans\u2019s own parade and Mardi Gras rhythms, in songs that mingled a party spirit with social consciousness.Charles Neville was born in New Orleans on Dec. 28, 1938, the second of the four sons of Arthur Lanon Neville Sr. and Amelia Neville, formerly Landry. At 15, Charles left home to play saxophone with the Rabbit\u2019s Foot Minstrel Show.He went on to work with blues and R&B singers, including Larry Wiliams, Johnny Ace, Big Maybelle, Jimmy Reed and Little Walter. Back in New Orleans, he was a member of the house band at the Dew Drop Inn, working with local and visiting stars. After serving in the Navy from 1956 to 1958, stationed in Memphis, he went on to tour with B. B. King and Bobby (Blue) Bland.Mr. Neville began using heroin in the 1950s, sometimes shoplifting to support his drug use and serving short jail terms. It was a habit he would not completely overcome until 1986.Upon his release he moved to New York City. He became involved in modern jazz and toured with soul singers like Johnnie Taylor, Clarence Carter and O. V. Wright.Mr. Neville also recorded with Diversity, a group mixing jazz and classical musicians, and with Native American musicians in the group Songcatchers. He released an album as a leader, \u201cSafe in Buddha\u2019s Palm\u201d \u2014 the title reflected his longtime interest in Eastern philosophies \u2014 in 2008.In the 1990s he moved to rural Massachusetts, and he performed with his sons, Khalif and Talyn, as the New England Nevilles. But he returned often to New Orleans, and after the Neville Brothers disbanded in 2012 he joined Aaron Neville\u2019s touring band; he also performed in New Orleans with a daughter, the singer Charmaine Neville. Failing health prevented him from joining a Neville family reunion concert in 2017.In addition to his three brothers, he is survived by his wife, Kristin Neville; his sister, Althelgra Neville Gabriel; and his children \u2014 Charmaine, Khalif, Talyn, Charlotte, Carlos and Charles Neville; Charlene White, Rowena Alix and Charlestine Jones \u2014 as well as numerous grandchildren.An earlier version of this obituary misstated the date of Mr. Neville\u2019s birth. It was Dec. 28, 1938 \u2014 not 1939. (As the obituary correctly notes, he was 79.)Advertisement"}

Until we grapple with the disdain for women that drives these mass murderers, and the way that the killers are increasingly radicalized on the internet, there will be no stopping future tragedies.Part of the problem is that American culture still largely sees men\u2019s sexism as something innate rather than deviant. And in a world where sexism is deemed natural, the misogynist tendencies of mass shooters become afterthoughts rather than predictable and stark warnings.The truth is that in addition to not protecting women, we are failing boys: failing to raise them to believe they can be men without inflicting pain on others, failing to teach them that they are not entitled to women\u2019s sexual attention and failing to allow them an outlet for understandable human fear and foibles that will not label them \u201cweak\u201d or unworthy.Not every attack is preventable, but the misogyny that drives them is. To stop all of this, we must trust women when they point out that receiving streams of death threats on Twitter is not normal and that online communities strategizing about how to rape women are much more than just idle chatter. There is no reason another massacre should happen.Advertisement"}

Or that these services have created millions of jobs, new business ecosystems and helped fuel the rise of the digital economy that brings broad societal benefit.But it is important not to forget the learning of lessons and the hoped-for change. We are seeing some of these changes now. There is no playbook for addressing the principles at play here, and so it will not be all smooth sailing.

Lax privacy rules are indeed a problem, but denial about posts remaining private is another major problem, and unlike the lax rules, what is posted is within the direct control of every Facebook user.ETHAN ANNIS, SAN FRANCISCOTo the Editor:The Facebook brouhaha has fascinated me for one reason: When you sign up for Facebook, you aren\u2019t obligated to put any information about yourself in the sign-up. You are asked, but you don\u2019t have to reply.Several people I know have little or no information about themselves out there, and some have put in wrong birthdays and left out education, hometown and so on.My hometown is listed incorrectly.

If the data miners get it wrong, tough.TERRY SHAMES, BERKELEY, CALIF.To the Editor:We are sidestepping the larger problem of this predictable data breach.Facebook has been using \u2014 and selling \u2014 our data with little or no active consent or even active thought given by most data owners for more than a decade. This basic trade-off, of privacy for convenience, has been fundamental to the operation of social media sites over the last decade.The loss of user data to Cambridge Analytica is obviously an issue. But the bigger issue is the loss of countless hours to Facebook and other social media outlets. Compounding that issue is how screens affect our interactions with others and how social media influences our understanding and awareness of the world around us.Facebook\u2019s data breach without user consent should be a catalyst inspiring examination of our connection to screens and how screen time affects news consumption, time management and intimate relationships.To the Editor:I agree that we need better privacy rules. Here\u2019s a simple solution. Why not pay consumers for the use of their data?Instead of combing through agreements for buried data use protocols and having to \u201copt out\u201d of data sharing, consumers would \u201copt in\u201d to data sharing in exchange for a fee, depending on the extent and the frequency of data use.Much simpler, and more fair.RICHARD KATZ, BROOKLYNAdvertisement"}

Her website, which said it was quoting Western news outlets, identified her as \u201cthe first Persian female vegan bodybuilder.\u201d\u201cNow the media will be faced with a new type of Iranian female which does not fit within any of their usual categorizations,\u201d a Twitter user named Katayoon said Wednesday.\u201cThis was shocking and saddening,\u201d one Iranian, Bahare, wrote on Twitter of Ms. Aghdam. \u201cWe laughed so much but now it turns out all those videos were so serious for herself.\u201dMs. Aghdam became especially famous for one clip in which she wears a revealing purple dress, showing cleavage, and begins to slowly strip off her clothes to reveal a pair of fake plastic breasts. \u201cDon\u2019t trust your eyes,\u201d read a caption in English on the clip.After letting her go, the Mountain View police spoke to Ms. Aghdam\u2019s father and brother and let them know she was safe. The police said there was no mention in that conversation of her issues with YouTube.But in a second call, her father said YouTube had recently done something that \u201chad caused her to become upset\u201d and that may have been why she was in the area. Still, the police said, the father did not seem concerned and \u201csimply wanted to let us know that may have been a reason for her to move up here.\u201dLater Tuesday morning, Ms. Aghdam went to a nearby shooting range. Then, just after noon, she parked at a business near YouTube\u2019s offices. She walked into one of YouTube\u2019s parking garages, and then emerged into an outdoor courtyard where employees were eating lunch.Emergency officials arrived at YouTube\u2019s offices two minutes after the police received 911 calls about shots being fired. When they arrived, they found Ms. Aghdam dead. A 9-millimeter semiautomatic handgun, registered in her name, was found at the scene.By Tuesday night, YouTube, as well as Instagram and Facebook, had taken down her pages and videos.Ed Barberini, the chief of the San Bruno Police Department, said: \u201cAt this point in the investigation, it is believed that the suspect was upset at the policies and practices of YouTube. This appears to be the motive for this incident.\u201dOn Wednesday, two of the people who were shot were released from Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital. A third was still in the hospital, but his condition was upgraded to serious from critical.Ms. Aghdam dedicated several of her videos to promoting animal rights, vegan diets and healthy living. In one video, she sat in front of a screen with a rabbit, as she tried to explain in Persian the differences between vegetarianism and veganism. In another, she presented her viewers with a papaya, extolling the benefits of the fruit. \u201cEat it when it turns yellow,\u201d she said, sporting dark sunglasses and a zebra-striped cowboy hat.But Ms. Aghdam\u2019s activism was accompanied by anger at YouTube and frustration with living in the United States.Her personal website and videos posted to YouTube and elsewhere were filled with complaints about YouTube. \u201cWhen searching for my website in google, at top of link they add \u2018an error occurred\u2019 but there is no error!\u201d a website under Ms. Aghdam\u2019s name, NasimeSabz.com, said in February 2016. \u201cThey add it to keep you from my visiting my site.\u201dLife in the United States had not been good, she said in one video from March 30. \u201cThere they kill you by ax,\u201d she said of Iran. \u201cHere they kill you with cotton,\u201d referring to an Iranian expression meaning dying by something that you do not know is dangerous.In another video, she responded to viewers who had begun to wonder if she was mentally ill: \u201cI don\u2019t have any special mental or physical disease, but I live on a planet filled with disease, disorders, perversions and injustices.\u201dThe American dream appeared to be tarnished for her after she began to face hurdles in the United States.\u201cIf you are superficial, you will think it is heaven here, that you can go naked outside and have sex left and right like other animals without any morality,\u201d she said in one video in Persian. \u201cBut if you enter the system, you will see that it is worse than Iran,\u201d she said. \u201cThose who want to inform people against the system and big companies get censored.\u201dOn her channel on Telegram, a social media network extremely popular in Iran, her last post is a childhood picture of herself standing among flowers. It has no caption.Daisuke Wakabayashi reported from San Bruno, Thomas Erdbrink from Tehran, and Matthew Haag from New York.

{"Headline": "The F.B.I. and the Mystery of the Mummy\u2019s Head", "Date": "2018-04-02", "News": "A museum wasn\u2019t sure whose head it had put on display. That\u2019s when the F.B.I.\u2019s forensic scientists were called in to crack the agency\u2019s oldest case.Supported byIn 1915, a team of American archaeologists excavating the ancient Egyptian necropolis of Deir el-Bersha blasted into a hidden tomb. Inside the cramped limestone chamber, they were greeted by a gruesome sight: a mummy\u2019s severed head perched on a cedar coffin.The room, which the researchers labeled Tomb 10A, was the final resting place for a governor named Djehutynakht (pronounced \u201cjuh-HOO-tuh-knocked\u201d) and his wife. At some point during the couple\u2019s 4,000-year-long slumber, grave robbers ransacked their burial chamber and plundered its gold and jewels. The looters tossed a headless, limbless mummified torso into a corner before attempting to set the room on fire to cover their tracks.The museum staff concluded only a DNA test would determine whether they had put Mr. or Mrs. Djehutynakht on display.\u201cThe problem was that at the time in 2009 there had been no successful extraction of DNA from a mummy that was 4,000-years-old,\u201d said Dr. Freed.Egyptian mummies pose a unique challenge because the desert\u2019s scorching climate rapidly degrades DNA. Earlier attempts at obtaining their ancient DNA either failed or produced results contaminated by modern DNA. To crack the case, the museum turned to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.The F.B.I. had never before worked on a specimen so old. If its scientists could extract genetic material from the 4,000-year-old mummy, they would add a powerful DNA collecting technique to their forensics arsenal and also unlock a new way of deciphering Egypt\u2019s ancient past.Governor Djehutynakht and his wife, Lady Djehutynakht, are believed to have lived around 2000 B.C. during Egypt\u2019s Middle Kingdom. They ruled a province of Upper Egypt. Though the walls in their tomb were bare, the coffins were embellished with beautiful hieroglyphics of the afterlife.The team that discovered Djehutynakht\u2019s desecrated chamber more than a century ago was led by archaeologists George Reisner and Hanford Lyman Story. As they explored the cliffs of Deir el-Bersha, which is about 180 miles south of Cairo on the east bank of the Nile, they uncovered a 30-foot burial shaft beneath boulders. With the help of dynamite, they entered the tomb.In their original reports the archaeologists said the dismembered body parts belonged to a woman, presumably Lady Djehutynakht. Dr. De Meyer suspected the head belonged to the governor and not his wife.As Dr. Freed, the museum curator prepared the items from Tomb 10A for exhibition in 2005, she reached out to Massachusetts General Hospital. Its CT scan revealed the head was missing cheek bones and part of its jaw hinge \u2014 features that may have potentially provided insight into the mummy\u2019s sex.They now had another mystery: Why did the mummy have these facial mutilations?\u201cIt\u2019s a very specific cut they made,\u201d said Dr. Gupta, referring to the surgical removal of part of the mandible. \u201cThere\u2019s a precision to it which is what we were surprised by. Someone was actually doing coronoidectomy 4,000 years ago.\u201dSome doctors and Egyptologists doubted that ancient Egyptians could perform that complex operation with primitive tools.Still, the question of the mummy\u2019s identity lingered.\u201cThe advantage we had is that we had a hole in the neck because the head had been torn off,\u201d said Dr. Chapman.They snaked a long scope with a camera into the back of the mouth. The first tooth they targeted would not budge, so Dr. Fabio Nunes, who was then a molecular biologist at Massachusetts General, switched to a different molar. Sweating, he clamped down with dental forceps, gave it a few wiggles, then a few twists and \u201cpop\u201d \u2014 it was free.\u201cMy main concern was: Don\u2019t drop it, don\u2019t drop it, don\u2019t drop it,\u201d he said. After he successfully maneuvered out from the neck, the room exhaled and gazed upon their prize.\u201cThis looked like an absolutely cavity free, perfectly preserved tooth,\u201d Dr. Freed said. \u201cI thought maybe it was Mrs. Djehutynakht who had died in childbirth. Total speculation.\u201dFor several years, other teams of scientists tried fruitlessly to get DNA from the molar. Then the crown of the tooth came to Dr. Loreille at the F.B.I. \u2019s lab in Quantico, Va., in 2016.In the F.B.I.\u2019s clean lab, Dr. Loreille drilled into the tooth\u2019s core and collected a tiny bit of powder. She then dissolved the tooth dust to make a DNA library that allowed her to amplify the amount of DNA she was working with, like a copy machine, and bring it up to detectable levels.To determine whether what she had extracted was ancient DNA or contamination from modern people, she analyzed how damaged the sample was. It showed signs of heavy damage, confirmation that she was studying the mummy\u2019s genetic material.She plugged her data into computer software that analyzed the ratio of chromosomes in the sample. \u201cWhen you have a female you have more reads on X. When you have a male you have X and Y,\u201d she said.The program spit out \u201cmale.\u201dDr. Loreille discovered the mummified severed head had indeed belong to Governor Djehutynakht. And in doing so she had help establish that ancient Egyptian DNA could be extracted from mummies.Dr. Loreille\u2019s examination also showed that Governor Djehutynakht\u2019s DNA carried clues to another mystery. For centuries archaeologists and historians have debated the origins of the ancient Egyptians and how closely related they were to modern people living in North Africa. To the researchers\u2019 surprise, the governor\u2019s mitochondrial DNA indicated his ancestry on his mother\u2019s side, or haplogroup, was Eurasian.\u201cNo one will ever believe us,\u201d Dr. Loreille recalled telling her colleague Jodi Irwin. \u201cThere\u2019s a European haplogroup in an ancient mummy.\u201d\u201cIt was at the same time \u2018Dang! We\u2019re not first,\u2019\u201d Dr. Loreille said. \u201cBut also we\u2019re happy to see they had this Eurasian ancestry.\u201d\u201cOf course, one has to be careful to deduce too much from single genomes and only two locations,\u201d he said.Dr. Irwin also expressed caution with how the public interprets her team\u2019s results, saying that mitochondrial DNA provides, \u201cjust a very small glimpse into somebody\u2019s ancestry.\u201dObtaining mummified samples for genetic sequencing may prove difficult for researchers outside of Egypt as the country\u2019s government has barred foreign researchers from taking artifacts and ancient human remains out of the country since 1983. Many investigations will instead rely on museum samples, like Djehutynakht\u2019s decapitated head.In addition to helping lay groundwork for future exploration of ancient Egypt\u2019s migration history, Dr. Loreille and her team\u2019s work may prove beneficial to F.B.I. forensic efforts.\u201cWe are testing techniques that may in the future help them work on remains that are highly degraded, like in the desert or that are burned,\u201d she said.But for the Egyptologists and medical professionals enthralled by Tomb 10A, the biggest prize was finally solving the mystery of the mummified head.\u201cYou almost feel like it\u2019s a child, like you just identified the gender of a baby,\u201d Dr. Nunes said. \u201cIt is a boy!\u201dDr. Freed agreed. \u201cWe now know that we have the governor himself,\u201d she said. \u201cWe already show the head at the museum, but now we\u2019ll have to change the label!\u201d_____Advertisement"}

That includes the first two shows, in 1984 and 1985. The last time the show was staged in New York was in 2016.The show will be held at Radio City Music Hall on Aug. 20. The Grammys, a much larger event, was held at Madison Square Garden in January, returning to the city for the first time in 15 years.\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled because it\u2019s sort of a back-to-back win for the city,\u201d Ms. Menin said. \u201cIt certainly sends a signal that New York City is a place to have these signature awards shows and it\u2019s really the epicenter of music.\u201dWhile the Grammy Awards has deep roots in Los Angeles, including a multiyear deal with the Staples Center there, Ms. Menin said that she was hopeful that MTV may be persuaded to agree to a long-term deal to hold the show in New York City.\u201cNow that the \u2018TRL\u2019 studio is back up and running and we have a steady drumbeat,\u201d said Bruce Gillmer, an MTV executive, \u201cthe addition of the V.M.A.s gives us some kind of scale.\u201d\u201cWe are feeling a deeper connection to the city again, and while we don\u2019t have any firm plans to be in any one place with the V.M.A.s,\u201d he continued, \u201cthere are some conversations on, \u2018Is there some consistency here, can we build on this?\u2019\u201dThe V.M.A.s have also seen declining relevance over the last few years: Viewership for the award show fell to a little more than 5 million viewers last year, an all-time low \u2014 though the Facebook stream now brings in many more viewers.Ms. Menin said that she is in talks to with the organizers of other award shows to bring them to New York, but she declined to name them so as not to jeopardize the negotiations.She said that the city works with the organizers of programs like the Grammys and the V.M.A.s to streamline permits and arrange for street closings and other things to help facilitate staging events and the loading and unloading of equipment. She said the city would also help to promote the V.M.A.s by placing ads in buses and subway cars, which she said do not involve a cost to the city.John Koblin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wanted at Chinese Start-Ups: Attractive Women to Ease Coders\u2019 Stress", "Date": "2018-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 China\u2019s vibrant technology scene is searching for people like Shen Yue. Qualifications: Must be attractive, know how to charm socially awkward programmers and give relaxing massages.Ms. Shen is a \u201cprogrammer motivator,\u201d as they are known in China. Part psychologist, part cheerleader, the women are hired to chat up and calm stressed-out coders. The jobs are proliferating in a society that largely adheres to gender stereotypes and believes that male programmers are \u201czhai,\u201d or nerds who have no social lives.\u201cThey really need someone to talk to them from time to time and to organize activities for them to ease some of the pressure,\u201d said Ms. Shen, a 25-year-old who has a degree in civil engineering from a university in Beijing.The country\u2019s laws against gender discrimination are not often enforced. Many companies are direct in their job ads. Males preferred. Only good-looking women need apply. With programmer motivators, it\u2019s more explicit, putting women in subservient positions to men.In tech, men dominate the top ranks. Just one woman sits on the 11-member board of Alibaba, the e-commerce giant. At Baidu, a search company, none of its five board members is a woman. At Tencent, a games and social media conglomerate, there are none. By comparison, Twitter has three women on its nine-person board. At Facebook, two of its nine directors are women.Like many other businesses, China\u2019s tech companies are blunt about gender bias in their job ads. Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent have repeatedly published recruitment ads boasting that there are \u201cbeautiful girls\u201d working for the companies, according to Human Rights Watch, a New York-based rights watchdog.In January, Alibaba said it was seeking a sales manager for Taobao, its e-commerce platform. Women were preferred, ages 28 to 35, \u201cwith a good personal image and class.\u201dIn November, Baidu advertised for a marketing position. Men were preferred \u201cbecause of business travel\u201d and other reasons.Both companies have since removed the references to specific genders in those ads.Alibaba said that the company has clear guidelines on providing equal opportunity regardless of gender and \u201cwill conduct stricter reviews of the recruiting advertisements to ensure compliance with our policy.\u201d It also said that one-third of the 18 founders of Alibaba are women and that female leaders account for one-third of the company\u2019s management positions.Baidu said that 45 percent of the company\u2019s 40,000 employees are female, which is reflected in midlevel and senior positions. \u201cWe value the important work that our female employees do across the organization,\u201d the company said in an emailed statement.In a statement, Tencent said it values diverse backgrounds and apologized for the ads.It is unclear how many companies employ programmer motivators. According to Baidu Baipin, a job search website run by Baidu, just seven companies are currently advertising for these jobs, mostly at smaller start-ups. There used to be more. Alibaba advertised for a programmer motivator with \u201crecognizably good looks\u201d in 2015 but deleted the ad after being criticized by Chinese internet users.Ms. Shen started work at Chainfin.com, a consumer finance company, in October. She declined to disclose her salary, but Zhang Jing, a human resources executive who hired Ms. Shen, said it was around $950 a month.Ms. Shen came to Beijing from the northeastern province of Heilongjiang. She has long black hair and pale skin and wears red eye shadow to the office, where she always has a ready smile for her colleagues. They call her by her nickname, Yueyue, which translates to Joy.At Chainfin.com, the bulk of her work is tending the front desk, organizing social events, ordering snacks for tea breaks and chatting with the programmers. She may call a programmer to a conference room and ask him, \u201cDid you have to work overtime?\u201d before listening to his various frustrations.\u201cI thought it was really novel,\u201d Ms. Shen said, \u201cbecause I had never seen such a job before.\u201dOn a recent Friday, she approached Guo Zhenjie, 28, who has a foldout bed next to his desk. Ms. Shen asked whether his waist was still hurting from the long hours at his desk. He said, yes, he had been working till 10 or 11 for the past few nights.\u201cThe company\u2019s intention is for me to give you a massage, though my technique might not be great,\u201d Ms. Shen told Mr. Guo.Both of them broke out in giggles.Ms. Shen stood over a seated Mr. Guo and started kneading his shoulders.\u201cIt really does feel good,\u201d Mr. Guo said, as Ms. Shen gently whacked his back with a massage clapper device.For some start-ups, having a programmer motivator on staff is one of the many perks to attract male coders, a job that is in high demand in China\u2019s booming tech scene.Feng Zhiyi, 31, who works in research and development at Chainfin.com, said he was envious when photos of female programmer motivators fanning male employees appeared on the internet.\u201cAnd now we have one, too,\u201d Mr. Feng said.Mr. Feng said Ms. Shen had improved the work environment by organizing birthday parties and getting the programmers active with games such as tug of war or sack races.He said he was open to the idea of male programmer motivators but somewhat skeptical. \u201cA man chatting with another man, it\u2019s like going out on a date with a guy,\u201d Mr. Feng said. \u201cA little awkward, isn\u2019t it?\u201dMs. Zhang, the human resources executive who was part of the panel that hired Ms. Shen, stressed that it is important for a programmer motivator to look good. She said the applicants needed to have \u201cfive facial features that must definitely be in their proper order\u201d and speak in a gentle way.They should also have a contagious laugh, be able to apply simple makeup and be taller than 5 feet 2 inches.\u201cHer position is at the front desk, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Ms. Zhang said. \u201cIt may be that people won\u2019t be able to see her if they walk in.\u201dMs. Shen said that she does not consider her job to be sexist.\u201cMany feminist ideas are too extreme now,\u201d she said. \u201cI think women should be independent, self-reliant and have self-respect. And that\u2019s enough.\u201dXu Jiaolong, one of Chainfin.com\u2019s few female programmers, who gets massages from Ms. Shen, did not see anything wrong with the job. The way she saw it, it was a mere \u201cdivision of labor.\u201d But, with a smile, she said the company could consider hiring a man to motivate female programmers, too.China\u2019s tech industry is beginning to question such practices. Wang Jie, 40, the chief executive of Shanbay.com, an app that helps people learn English, has been vocal about the \u201cobjectification\u201d of women by other start-ups.He was so disturbed that some tech companies were using \u201cbeautiful women\u201d to draw male programmers to their companies that he wrote a post last October on Zhihu, China\u2019s version of Quora, the question and answer site, saying that Western companies would be sued back home if they posted similar ads.But Mr. Wang has found that attitudes are difficult to change. Several people responded to his post, saying he was making a mountain out of a molehill.\u201cThe men said: \u2018If there are more beautiful women, I\u2019ll be happier in my job. What\u2019s the issue?\u2019\u201d Mr. Wang said. \u201cAnd some women said: \u2018As a woman, I don\u2019t think this is a problem at all.\u2019\u201dElsie Chen contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Teachers\u2019 Revolt Spreads to Arizona", "Date": "2018-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistThe wildfire spread of the teachers\u2019 movement \u2014 in parts of the country that are singularly hostile to organized labor \u2014 is one of the more surprising and exciting developments of this otherwise bleak political moment. Conservatives are right to worry: We\u2019re seeing a citizens\u2019 revolt against their policies.There are several interrelated factors behind the teachers\u2019 movement\u2019s explosive growth. Most significant, of course, is that teachers in some red states feel backed into a corner after a decade or more of disinvestment by Republican governments. Because of a series of tax cuts, particularly over the last 10 years, Arizona teachers are among the worst paid in the nation, and they have some of the country\u2019s largest class sizes \u2014 up to 40 students to a single teacher, according to Joe Thomas, president of the Arizona Education Association teachers\u2019 union.This week, I visited a K-8 school in the scrublands of South Phoenix, a flat, dusty, wide-open area that\u2019s only a 15-minute drive from downtown but feels much farther. (The principal asked me not to identify it, or him, for fear that his school would suffer administrative reprisals for letting a journalist in.) The science teacher told me her classes have 30 to 36 students each. Aside from desks, she\u2019d either bought most of what was in her classroom, or had it donated \u2014 not just books, but also chairs and even a water dispenser, which the class needed during the seven months when the school\u2019s drinking fountains were broken.The teacher used to have a second job waiting tables, but quit when she had kids. She loves her job, but told me, \u201cAs I get older, and had a family, it\u2019s getting harder and harder to stay.\u201d She was sad and anxious about the walkout, but had voted for it out of desperation. \u201cI\u2019m at a breaking point,\u201d she told me. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the resources. I\u2019m spending more and more money out of my own pocket, and I can\u2019t have the impact that I want to have with the way things are now. Something needs to happen.\u201dThe impetus for the walkout in Arizona, like those in other states, didn\u2019t come from a teachers\u2019 union, though teachers\u2019 unions have thrown their support behind the action. Instead, it began with a Facebook group, Arizona Educators United, and a hashtag, #RedforEd, which an elementary school music teacher, Noah Karvelis, had created to encourage school employees to wear red in solidarity with their brethren in West Virginia.It\u2019s not a coincidence that the teacher walkouts have happened in states where unions are weak. When teachers lack strong collective representation, scrappy new grass-roots organizations like Arizona Educators United can quickly build followings. Further, states that immiserate their teachers eventually lose leverage over them. It isn\u2019t legal for public employees in Arizona to strike, and teachers could, technically, lose their jobs for participating in the walkout.But because of its abysmal salaries, Arizona has such an acute teacher shortage that many schools are already hiring teachers without formal education training, some with only high school diplomas. Small-government conservatives have pushed teachers to the point where many feel they have nothing to lose.Still, it\u2019s not clear how long the educators can hold out. This month, Arizona\u2019s governor, Doug Ducey, scored a public relations victory by offering teachers a 20 percent raise. Many educators didn\u2019t trust him to deliver, saying that his plan had no dedicated revenue source. Nor did it address the teachers\u2019 demand to restore education funding to 2008 levels.Some teachers, though, fear that the public won\u2019t understand why they turned down what looks, on the surface, like a reasonable offer. The rapid rise of the RedforEd movement means that much of the organizing is being done on the fly, and no one knows what the public response will look like.But as we\u2019ve seen all over the country since Donald Trump\u2019s election, protest is contagious, and builds on itself. Ducey, meanwhile, is up for re-election this year in a state that\u2019s trending blue. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m foolishly confident, but we have a ton of power,\u201d Karvelis told me. \u201cWe have the truth on our side.

But at some point, my doctors speculated, I must have eaten leafy greens contaminated by E. coli bacteria.My mother had driven me to my local emergency room in the middle of the night after several days of unbearable abdominal cramps and a startling amount of blood coming out of new and terrifying places. The doctor on call thought it was probably just a bad case of colitis.As the sun began to rise, I was asked if I\u2019d like to go home and take Imodium or if I\u2019d like to stay in the hospital. Given the severity of my pain, I was surprised that I was even given a choice. I allowed myself to be wheeled upstairs with a needle in my vein administering a steady stream of antibiotics, a common treatment for colitis.But that weekend, I took a turn for the worse, throwing up every hour until there was nothing left in my system but sticky green bile. An infectious disease doctor was called in, my stool sample tested, and I was finally given a diagnosis of E. coli infection.Doctors don\u2019t know for sure how I became infected with E. coli \u2014 at the time, last October, the outbreak tied to romaine lettuce was still several months in the future \u2014 but we do have some clues. I\u2019m a vegetarian, so we know it didn\u2019t come from eating meat. Although none of my family members got sick, my father also tested positive for E. coli. The only food we remembered sharing was a batch of arugula from a local farmers\u2019 market about five days before I became ill, making it the most likely culprit.The antibiotics were immediately stopped, as they have been linked to an increased likelihood of developing dangerous complications from the bacterial infection. But by then the signs were already beginning to show. My platelet count was dropping at a dangerous rate, my kidney function had begun to falter. I had developed hemolytic uremic syndrome, a life-threatening complication of E. coli infection.I was treated to the first ambulance ride of my life to transfer to Georgetown University Hospital, where I would remain hospitalized for the next 33 days.In the critical care unit, I was strapped into several machines that would monitor my vitals. The next morning, a doctor came in and inserted a temporary access catheter into the right side of my neck. I was wheeled down to a lower level of the hospital for the first of my six plasmapheresis treatments, a particularly draining experience in which blood was removed, cleaned and then returned to my body via a large tube in my neck.A team of hematologists, nephrologists, infectious disease specialists and a general physician visited every morning. They\u2019d ask, \u201cHow are you feeling, Frances?\u201dEveryone knows me as Maggie, but in an annoying quirk of my hospitalization, my medical records and wristband all bear my legal name, Frances. \u201cOne name for each grandmother,\u201d my mom reasoned when my parents decided to christen me Frances Margaret. An unintended consequence of their thoughtfulness is that I have spent much of my life correcting people who called me Frances. \u201cIt\u2019s Maggie, short for Margaret, my middle name,\u201d I said.But in the hospital, it helped to have a second persona. Frances put on a brave face during the hours of treatment in sterilized facilities, while Maggie drew inward, refusing books and music or anything else that reminded me of who I was outside the hospital walls. From where I sat, pinned to machines by the needles in my veins, in a body I hardly recognized, and with a label on my wrist displaying a name that wasn\u2019t mine, I couldn\u2019t be sure that it was me this was really happening to. I listened patiently as doctors and nurses and technicians came into my room to offer Frances their well wishes, draw blood, or discuss what medications she should take or what procedures might make her body strong once more.During my first week of hospitalization, the kidney doctors debated whether to begin the dialysis process, sticking to the typical \u201cwait-and-see\u201d approach. But by the end of the week there was no question. I had gained 30 pounds from all the excess fluid and could hardly stand up and walk on my own. I began my first of many three-hour-long dialysis treatments, where they siphoned off the liquid, doing the work of my kidneys that I had so long taken for granted.I had mostly avoided social media since getting sick, but one day, I logged onto Facebook to see that across the country, people I knew and people I didn\u2019t \u2014 a pair of girls I once babysat for, a football team in Rhode Island \u2014 were praying for Maggie, hoping Maggie pulled through. The more people that worried about me, the sicker I must be, I thought.The dialysis continued for three weeks with tiny but measurable results. My platelet counts began to climb, and I started to pee again. But it wasn\u2019t enough to impress the nephrologists, who decided to surgically place a catheter in my chest, to both drain and administer fluids.Doctors began discussing a kidney transplant and temporary home-care dialysis training. I was sent home for a weekend to rest up before my first training for an eventual dialysis machine to be brought to my parents\u2019 house, but we didn\u2019t get that far. I went to bed after dinner and woke up in an ambulance racing back to the hospital I had just left. My blood pressure had begun a dangerous rise as my kidneys began to start working again, and I had the first of three seizures that night.The next few days are mostly lost from memory, but some hazy images survive. Waking up in a tube to discover I was getting an M.R.I. A nurse delicately pulling glue from my hair from where the technicians had inserted sensors. My hospital bed being wheeled out of the operating room after the catheter was removed from inside my chest. The sharp lines of the white hallway walls, every corner offering a shadowy descent into someone else\u2019s hospital story.Through my half-closed lids, I see a rare pocket of sunlight at the end of the corridor. Briefly I feel the warmth of its gaze as we trek on through the seemingly endless maze of the hospital\u2019s hallways and locked doors. The dryness in my mouth is the first clue that I\u2019m back in my body, that my kidneys have begun to heal themselves at an admirable pace.My mom finds me soon after, as I\u2019m attempting to drink water from a clear plastic straw. She reaches out and holds it in place. The nurse comes in to tell us that it all went well, that Frances\u2019s vitals look good, that we\u2019ll be ready to transfer her back upstairs soon.\u201cShe goes by Maggie,\u201d my mom says.\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d the nurse says, glancing down at her chart before stepping back into the hall, \u201cMaggie.\u201dI turn to smile at my mom. It doesn\u2019t matter what they call me anymore. She holds my hand as we\u2019re guided back upstairs to my hospital room for the last time.Sometimes now, in my apartment, on the train, while walking down a crowded street, I like to run my fingers over the fresh scars lining my collarbone. Now that the toxins have left my system, now that my body has built itself back up, I have only the scars to remind me that Frances was tested, that Maggie survived. That it really happened to me.Maggie Menditto, based in Brooklyn, N.Y., is the executive administrator of the McDowell Foundation for social justice.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Setting Fires and Restoring an American Landscape ", "Date": "2018-04-23", "News": "Where development and fragmentation have disrupted natural cycles, teams run controlled burns every spring to help sustain prairies and other ecosystems that have long been shaped by fire.Supported byNorth America was once a loose, sprawling conversation between landscapes. Soft boundaries linked prairie, savanna, shrubland, forest and marsh. During a dry spell, lightning might spark a fire that burned for miles and days on end, relenting only when it hit a lake or river.Remove fire, and this dialogue gets interrupted. Weedy scrub accumulates, stifling the earth.Today, development and fragmentation have disrupted natural cycles of restoration in these landscapes. That\u2019s why Mr. Kleiman\u2019s team and many others across North America run controlled burns every spring and fall, helping sustain ecosystems that have been shaped by fire for millenniums. Here\u2019s a glimpse into one such burn in April 2017 and the life that sprung up a few weeks later.A burn day starts early, said Leslie Berns, manager of landscape ecology for the Lake County Forest Preserve District, one of 16 municipal districts designed to protect natural areas in Illinois. By 6 a.m., she\u2019s looking at weather conditions and nailing down where to torch.Prairies, oak woods, savannas and wetlands all evolved with fire; it\u2019s part of their makeup. Consider how an oak leaf\u2019s edges curl when it falls. \u201cWhen a fire comes through, the leaf is dry on the underside, and it burns quite rapidly,\u201d said Brad Semel, a natural heritage biologist with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources.Many factors influence site selection: wind, humidity, atmospheric conditions, soil type, the presence of nearby neighborhoods and the assemblage of plants and animals.\u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons I like it; it\u2019s kind of an intellectual exercise,\u201d Ms. Berns said.By 10 a.m., the morning humidity has usually dropped enough to start a fire.The basic principles behind a prescribed fire are: Secure a perimeter, and burn into the wind.The perimeter consists of fire breaks: streams, roads, mowed areas and other surfaces that won\u2019t burn.\u201cFor most of February and March, all I\u2019m doing is putting in fire breaks \u2014 mowing, cutting dead trees,\u201d Mr. Semel said.Like a conductor wields her baton, you wield your drip torch against the wind. As you go, you\u2019re spraying water on rogue flames. It\u2019s an intimate interplay of elements.The farther upwind you go, the louder the fire roars. But that\u2019s O.K.: Grasses, brush and other fuels downwind have already been consumed by the rest of the burn. From the finish line, flames rage briefly, then disappear into the black space you\u2019ve created.For thousands of years, indigenous Americans ignited the landscape. Fire, they knew, brought bison and deer to hunt, and berries and tubers to harvest.European colonizers took these strategies and practiced them for centuries \u2014 but things changed in the early 20th century.A few catastrophic wildfires, including the Peshtigo Fire in 1871, which killed more than 1,500 people in Wisconsin, and the Great Fire of 1910, which burned three million acres in the Northwest, helped convince land managers that fire should be vanquished. The United States Forest Service started the Smokey Bear campaign, which portrayed all fire as destructive.But ecologists suspected fire suppression was disrupting natural life cycles. Giant sequoias, they noticed, were no longer regenerating in California. In the 1960s, scientists encouraged policymakers to allow for natural processes like fire.After a series of wildfires blazed through more than a third of Yellowstone National Park in 1988, the ecosystem quickly recovered. Prescribed fire programs grew in popularity.When Ms. Berns got involved nearly 30 years ago, she was going to sites \u201cwith a pair of blue jeans, a flare and a garden rake,\u201d she said. She has since seen prescribed fire develop into a more standardized science, one that continues to evolve.The goal is to mitigate the damage humans have already done. Prairie once covered 170 million acres of North America. Today, less than four percent remains. Oak savanna is now one of the rarest ecosystems on our planet.Without management, these ecosystems \u201ccould disappear in the span of a human generation,\u201d said Ken Klick, a restoration ecologist for the Lake County Forest Preserve District.Late April means rebirth. Like the fast blush of a first kiss, green erupts across the landscape. Carpets of wildflowers unfurl. Turtles, snakes and voles stretch sunward after months of subterranean winter. Hibernating insects shiver awake, chorus frogs rehearse tunes and birds begin to dream of nests.Just a week earlier, the ground might have been covered in soot from a prescribed fire. Absorbing more heat, and fertilized by ash, blackened patches of earth come alive before neighboring areas. The resulting mosaic supports a wide array of species.There\u2019s prairie smoke, with crimson buds that expel puffs of wispy seed tendrils. Or wild lupine, stacked with fragrant purple flowers, which can thrive in oak savanna and is required eating for the endangered Karner blue butterfly.In 2014, wild bison were reintroduced to Nachusa. It was the first time the beasts roamed free on Illinois prairie since the 1830s.Today 105 of the fuzzy mammals roam Nachusa. Supreme loungers, they revel in lazy spring afternoons.\u201cThey\u2019re looking a little shaggy this time of year, before they shed their winter coats and take on a different gleam,\u201d Mr. Kleiman said.Much of the work of burning, fighting weeds and cutting brush throughout the year is done by dedicated volunteers. A few dozen help out at Nachusa Grasslands, with business owners, retired teachers and engineers among their ranks.Through spring and summer, teams collect seeds from as many plant species as possible, running a friendly competition to see who can harvest more. These seeds go into site-specific mixes.To understand which species go together, Mr. Kleiman consults \u201cPlants of the Chicago Region,\u201d which catalogs some 3,000 plants.It\u2019s a bible, he said, for \u201cpeople like me trying to reconstruct Humpty Dumpty here, taking ruined habitat and making it whole again.\u201dCome autumn, Mr. Kleiman and his colleagues will disperse their seed mixes, embedding their hopes for the future into the soil.Lifetimes from now, perhaps, people will still walk these lands. They may marvel at ephemeral spring wildflowers, take glee in warblers\u2019 songs and feel the weight of the oaks, surviving and whispering old stories to one another._____Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "San Francisco Conservatory of Music Gets $46 Million Gift", "Date": "2018-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCapping the celebration of its 100th anniversary, the San Francisco Conservatory of Music on Wednesday announced a gift of $46.4 million from the William K. Bowes, Jr. Foundation, among the largest donations ever to an American music school.The gift will help fund construction of a $185 million, 12-story building on a site just south of San Francisco City Hall. Designed by Mark Cavagnero Associates and scheduled to open in 2020, it will include two concert halls, rehearsal spaces, high-tech studios and classrooms, and will provide housing for the student body.\u201cIt will shape the future of the conservatory, in one of the most exciting pieces of real estate in the world,\u201d David H. Stull, the school\u2019s president, said in a phone interview.Founded in 1917 by Ada Clement and Lillian Hodghead, the San Francisco Conservatory is the oldest independent music school on the West Coast, with luminaries like Yehudi Menuhin and Isaac Stern among the alumni of its youth program. While the school has long emphasized risk-taking and an expansive view of the field, Mr. Stull has pushed it and its curriculum toward the future since becoming president in 2013. Its program in Technology and Applied Composition (TAC), which began offering courses in 2015, has been forging a new identity for the 21st-century composer.Though both composition and technology are fields dominated by men, the TAC program has managed the rare achievement of gender parity, with 13 women and 12 men in its most recently completed cohort. (The conservatory\u2019s traditional composition program had five women and 24 men in the same cohort.)Driving the program\u2019s development has been its executive director, MaryClare Brzytwa, a composer and educator who combines classical training as a flutist with a background in computer music. She led efforts to recruit as visiting faculty women at the top of their fields in tech-related musical careers. Teachers such as the Grammy-winning Leslie Ann Jones (who directs music recording and scoring at Skywalker Sound) and Jaclyn Shumate (an audio director at Microsoft), Ms. Brzytwa said, \u201callow my students to see it as normal for women to have these careers.\u201dTAC complements training in composition with special courses in software and studio technology to equip students for careers in such fields as film scoring and video game sound design, as well as in production. The new building, to be named the Ute and William K. Bowes, Jr. Center for Performing Arts, will house a special \u201ctechnology hall\u201d with a state-of-the-art recording studio and other equipment focused on TAC.\u201cOur students learn how to write classical music and real-world production skills at the same time,\u201d Ms. Brzytwa said. \u201cStylistically, they come from many perspectives \u2014 jazz, classical or electronic music \u2014 and there is a lot of leeway to plan a path of their own. But all of them seem to want rigor.\u201dEven students who are not pursuing composition in the TAC program recognize its influence on the school\u2019s direction. DuMarkus Davis, who is in his second year as a violin student, says he decided to move from his native Atlanta to San Francisco \u201cbecause I wanted to do something involving musical entrepreneurship and wanted to be surrounded by the tech in Silicon Valley. I knew that the TAC program was an element of SFCM. All of that ultimately sold me on the conservatory.\u201dBefore coming to the school for TAC\u2019s one-year professional studies program, Emily Pitts had earned a degree in software engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and then spent five years in the corporate world, pursuing a passion for writing music for film and video games on the side. Even before graduating, she has been hired at Facebook to work with its 360 Spatial Workstation team to design spatial audio for its video player.\u201cIt\u2019s a marriage between my engineering and audio interests,\u201d Ms. Pitts said.\u201cIn the real world, it can feel intimidating, like you\u2019re trying to get into this boys\u2019 club,\u201d she added. \u201cWorking with so many other women and seeing your peers succeed and excel has been great.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fury in Germany as Rap Duo With Anti-Jewish Lyrics Gets Award", "Date": "2018-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 In Germany\u2019s hugely popular hip-hop music scene, one of the biggest albums of the past year was from two trash-talking rappers who rhymed about their prowess in bed and in the weight room and about violently dominating their opponents.The album has racked up sales, but has also attracted a different sort of attention. In one song, the pair boast about how their bodies are \u201cmore defined than Auschwitz prisoners.\u201d In another, they vow to \u201cmake another Holocaust, show up with a Molotov.\u201dWidespread condemnation turned into an uproar in the last week since the rappers, Farid Bang and Kollegah, won the Echo award for best hip-hop album at Germany\u2019s equivalent of the Grammys on April 12.Posting on Twitter in German, the foreign minister, Heiko Maas, wrote: \u201cAnti-Semitic provocations do not deserve awards, they are simply disgusting.\u201dHe also noted the unfortunate timing of the ceremony. April 12 is a day of worldwide solemnity. \u201cThat such a prize was handed out on Holocaust Remembrance Day is shameful,\u201d he wrote.The country\u2019s recording industry association had criticized the lyrics but defended its choice in the name of artistic freedom. Nominations are based on popularity and rankings on music charts, not artistic quality \u2014 a process the association has pledged to re-examine after the outcry.But beyond the resentment over the award, the episode has also provoked soul-searching about incitement in art, and the extent of anti-Jewish sentiment in German hip-hop in particular.And most troubling, many believe, is what it says about the rise in anti-Semitism among young people, and the millions of impressionable rap fans who are generations removed from the horrors of Nazi rule.Germany\u2019s attempts to atone for the evils of its past, while confronting the troubles of its present, is its never-ending preoccupation. On Wednesday, in response to a video showing a man in Berlin wearing a Jewish skullcap being attacked by a group of young men speaking Arabic, Chancellor Angela Merkel vowed to commit her government to fighting anti-Semitism \u201crelentlessly and with resolve.\u201dThe objectionable lyrics in the winning album, titled \u201cYoung, Brutal, Good Looking 3,\u201d do not explicitly deny the mass slaughter of some six million Jews by the Nazis, nor do they specifically incite hatred of Jews, both of which would have made them illegal under Germany\u2019s strict laws banning Holocaust denial.Kollegah and Farid Bang did not respond to requests for comment. On the night of the ceremony, Kollegah replied to criticism by saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want to make a political debate out of this,\u201d and invited anyone who wanted to discuss it to approach him at the after-party.In the music video for his track \u201cApocalypse,\u201d a banker in a London office tower is shown controlling the evil forces in the world, and wearing a Star of David ring. After a final showdown between good and evil, Kollegah \u2014 a 33-year-old convert to Islam whose real name is Felix Blume \u2014 raps, \u201cMuslims, Christians and Buddhists lived together in peace,\u201d pointedly not mentioning Jews.Allegations of anti-Semitism have dogged German hip-hop for years and were even the subject of a recent documentary, \u201cThe Dark Side of German Rap.\u201d One song by the rapper Haftbefehl mentions a conspiracy theory about the Rothschilds, a Jewish banking family, and the video for another features images of Orthodox Jews carrying suitcases of money and diamonds over the lyrics \u201cmoney, money rich.\u201dMany lyrics are also homophobic and degrading to women \u2014 issues in rap music that transcend Germany\u2019s borders. In one song, the rapper Shindy says that his openness to having sex \u2014 described in an obscene way \u2014 with Jewish women is proof he is not an anti-Semite.\u201cIt\u2019s not just about Israel, it\u2019s about injustice everywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cBut no one listens when you\u2019re calm and polite, and so you have to use more drastic means.\u201dNevertheless, he faulted Kollegah\u2019s and Farid Bang\u2019s lyrics. Words that conjure images like \u201cconcentration camps, Auschwitz, Jews, people who were gassed \u2014 those shouldn\u2019t be used,\u201d Bushido said.Ms. Merkel\u2019s government has for the first time appointed a commissioner to combat anti-Semitism in response to reports that incidents are increasing, especially among the young.Children in German schoolyards casually toss about \u201cYou Jew,\u201d as an insult, and reinforce stereotypes about Jews, such as saying \u201cDon\u2019t be such a Jew\u201d when trying to convince someone to lend some change.\u201cAt a time when hate against Jews is increasing around the world and a flood of anti-Jewish sentiment can be seen online, especially among young people,\u201d said Monika Schwarz-Friesel, a professor of linguistics at Berlin\u2019s Technical University, \u201cto declare anti-Semitic and fantastical, conspiratorial song texts as \u2018artistic freedom,\u2019 and award them prizes is viewed by researchers of anti-Semitism as particularly irresponsible.\u201dAnti-Semitic themes have plagued other German music genres \u2014 in particular, punk and metal music popular among the country\u2019s neo-Nazis. But those groups have remained largely underground, often forced to perform outside Germany because of its Holocaust-denial laws.Some rap fans have said that the lyrics were being unfairly scrutinized by people who did not understand the genre, in which rappers constantly try to outdo and outshock their rivals.\u201cOf course I think this line is tasteless,\u201d Michael Fritzsche, 26, of Leipzig, said, referring to the offending lyrics. \u201cBut let\u2019s be honest, a discussion about the political correctness in music lyrics should not be limited to rap.\u201dBut for all of the uproar over the words, Viola Funk, a journalist in Berlin who covers hip-hop, said she believed a larger point was being missed.\u201cGerman rap is a scapegoat, because youth culture is always a scapegoat,\u201d Ms. Funk, who directed \u201cThe Dark Side of German Rap,\u201d said. \u201cAs if it didn\u2019t have anything to do with society at large.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "YouTube Says Computers Are Catching Problem Videos", "Date": "2018-04-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The vast majority of videos removed from YouTube toward the end of last year for violating the site\u2019s content guidelines had first been detected by machines instead of humans, the Google-owned company said on Monday.YouTube said it took down 8.28 million videos during the fourth quarter of 2017, and about 80 percent of those videos had initially been flagged by artificially intelligent computer systems.The new data highlighted the significant role machines \u2014 not just users, government agencies and other organizations \u2014 are taking in policing the service as it faces increased scrutiny over the spread of conspiracy videos, fake news and violent content from extremist organizations.Those videos are sometimes promoted by YouTube\u2019s recommendation system and unknowingly financed by advertisers, whose ads are placed next to them through an automated system.This was the first time that YouTube had publicly disclosed the number of videos it removed in a quarter, making it hard to judge how aggressive the platform has previously been in removing content, or the extent to which computers played a part in making those decisions.Figuring out how to remove unwanted videos \u2014 and balancing that with free speech \u2014 is a major challenge for the future of YouTube, said Eileen Donahoe, executive director at Stanford University\u2019s Global Digital Policy Incubator.\u201cIt\u2019s basically free expression on one side and the quality of discourse that\u2019s beneficial to society on the other side,\u201d Ms. Donahoe said. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard problem to solve.\u201dYouTube declined to disclose whether the number of videos it had removed had increased from the previous quarter or what percentage of its total uploads those 8.28 million videos represented. But the company said the takedowns represented \u201ca fraction of a percent\u201d of YouTube\u2019s total views during the quarter.YouTube has contended that the volume of videos uploaded to the site is too big of a challenge to rely only on human monitors.Still, YouTube said three-quarters of all videos flagged by computers had been removed before anyone had a chance to watch them.The company\u2019s machines can detect when a person tries to upload a video that has already been taken down and will prevent that video from reappearing on the site. And in some cases with videos containing nudity or misleading content, YouTube said its computer systems are adept enough to delete the video without requiring a human to review the decision.The company said its machines are also getting better at spotting violent extremist videos, which tend to be harder to identify and have fairly small audiences.At the start of 2017, before YouTube introduced so-called machine-learning technology to help computers identify videos associated with violent extremists, 8 percent of videos flagged and removed for that kind of content had fewer than 10 views. In the first quarter of 2018, the company said, more than half of the videos flagged and removed for violent extremism had fewer than 10 views.Even so, users still play a meaningful role in identifying problematic content.

{"Headline": "At Toronto Vigil After Van Attack: Sadness, Civic Pride and Unease", "Date": "2018-04-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn a crisp and sunny Sunday afternoon, people gathered for what organizers called a walk of solidarity and healing near the site where the first victim was struck, which has been transformed into a large memorial, with a stone wall covered with flowers, photos and messages of hope and love.Maryam Nazemi stood across from the memorial, weeping. She held a sign that said \u201cToronto Strong.\u201d She was at her nearby gym on Monday when the attack began. Since then, she has come here every day seeking solace from others.\u201cIt\u2019s a healing place for me,\u201d said Ms. Nazemi, 57, a social worker who immigrated to Canada from Iran more than 30 years ago. \u201cThis is the only place that feels O.K. I am with everyone. We are one.\u201dAs the marchers proceeded solemnly down Yonge Street, filling all six lanes, they were joined by many of the country\u2019s top officials. Justin Trudeau, the prime minister, melted in with the crowd.The procession was led by a singing choir, with people behind them hoisting banners that read \u201cLove for all hatred for none.\u201d Some of those marching wore orange shirts that said \u201cFree Hugs.\u201dThe march ended at Mel Lastman Square, where religious leaders representing Toronto\u2019s highly diverse population \u2014 Hindus, Jews, humanists, Muslims, Christians, Buddhists and more \u2014 delivered short speeches. An Aboriginal group, Red Spirit Drummers, was among those providing music.\u201cI needed to be here,\u201d said Solange Homer, an immigrant from Trinidad. \u201cRace, religion doesn\u2019t matter. In times like this, we support one another.\u201dAmong those listening was Ken Greenberg, 73, an urban designer who has been asked often over the last week about the practicality of erecting protective barricades for the city\u2019s sidewalks. But as he looked around the packed square, where people born all around the world were offering hugs of support to one another, he said \u201cthe real armor is the connections\u201d among Toronto\u2019s residents.But Constable Lam made the arrest without incident.\u201cI\u2019m proud of my city,\u201d said Colleen Rooney, 60, a life coach. \u201cHow this has brought people together, more than separated us.\u201dIn addition to the response of the city\u2019s emergency services, the Canadian news media has highlighted the actions of ordinary citizens in the aftermath of the attack: people who held the hands of dying victims, who tore off their belts to fashion tourniquets, who performed CPR until the paramedics arrived.\u201cIt says something that we came together like this,\u201d said Annie Lee, 28, who lives in a condominium building close to where the attack ended. \u201cNo one jumped to conclusions. Politicians did not blame each other like in the United States. It\u2019s a testament to our unity,\u201d said Ms. Lee, 28, who works in marketing.The city began a #TorontoStrong fund-raising effort, which had raised 1.8 million Canadian dollars, or about $1.3 million, by Sunday. Much of the money will go to the families of the victims, to help cover funeral costs and trauma counseling.The attack happened in a once-sleepy inner suburb in the north of Toronto that, over recent decades, has transformed into a mini-downtown, with new condominium towers shooting up, bringing immigrants and bustle to the area. Korean restaurants, bubble tea cafes and small karaoke bars dot the wide suburban sidewalks, along with nods to gentrification \u2014 Whole Foods and Starbucks.Over the past week, pilgrims from across the city have ventured to the street, bringing flowers and candles and handwritten cards near the spots where people were struck down.The victims ranged in age from So He Chung, a 22-year-old molecular biology student, to 84-year-old Mary Elizabeth Forsyth, who had wheeled her walker to a stop, on one of her frequent strolls, to feed the birds and squirrels.Mr. Minassian, 25, faces 10 counts of first-degree murder and 13 counts of attempted murder.He has been described by acquaintances as a loner, who expressed fear of women.The police say Mr. Minassian posted a message hostile to women on his Facebook page moments before the deadly rampage began. In it, he praised \u201cincels,\u201d or involuntary celibates \u2014 a term used by an online community of misogynists who blame women for denying them what they see as their right to sexual intercourse.This fact has given rise to another feeling in Toronto, in addition to the sadness and the civic pride: an uneasiness that misogyny might have been the primary factor behind the terrible act.\u201cIt struck in me a kind of terror,\u201d said Ms. Lee. \u201cHow many more people like that are there hidden out here?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A.I. Researchers Are Making More Than $1 Million, Even at a Nonprofit", "Date": "2018-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 One of the poorest-kept secrets in Silicon Valley has been the huge salaries and bonuses that experts in artificial intelligence can command. Now, a little-noticed tax filing by a research lab called OpenAI has made some of those eye-popping figures public.OpenAI paid its top researcher, Ilya Sutskever, more than $1.9 million in 2016. It paid another leading researcher, Ian Goodfellow, more than $800,000 \u2014 even though he was not hired until March of that year. Both were recruited from Google.A third big name in the field, the roboticist Pieter Abbeel, made $425,000, though he did not join until June 2016, after taking a leave from his job as a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. Those figures all include signing bonuses.The figures listed on the tax forms, which OpenAI is required to release publicly because it is a nonprofit, provide new insight into what organizations around the world are paying for A.I. talent. But there is a caveat: The compensation at OpenAI may be underselling what these researchers can make, since as a nonprofit it can\u2019t offer stock options.Salaries for top A.I. researchers have skyrocketed because there are not many people who understand the technology and thousands of companies want to work with it. Element AI, an independent lab in Canada, estimates that 22,000 people worldwide have the skills needed to do serious A.I. research \u2014 about double from a year ago.\u201cThere is a mountain of demand and a trickle of supply,\u201d said Chris Nicholson, the chief executive and founder of Skymind, a start-up working on A.I.That raises significant issues for universities and governments. They also need A.I. expertise, both to teach the next generation of researchers and to put these technologies into practice in everything from the military to drug discovery. But they could never match the salaries being paid in the private sector.In 2015, Elon Musk, the chief executive of the electric-car maker Tesla, and other well-known figures in the tech industry created OpenAI and moved it into offices just north of Silicon Valley in San Francisco. They recruited several researchers with experience at Google and Facebook, two of the companies leading an industrywide push into artificial intelligence.In addition to salaries and signing bonuses, the internet giants typically compensate employees with sizable stock options \u2014 something that OpenAI does not do. But it has a recruiting message that appeals to idealists: It will share much of its work with the outside world, and it will consciously avoid creating technology that could be a danger to people.\u201cI turned down offers for multiple times the dollar amount I accepted at OpenAI,\u201d Mr. Sutskever said. \u201cOthers did the same.\u201d He said he expected salaries at OpenAI to increase as the organization pursued its \u201cmission of ensuring powerful A.I. benefits all of humanity.\u201dOpenAI spent about $11 million in its first year, with more than $7 million going to salaries and other employee benefits. It employed 52 people in 2016.At DeepMind, a London A.I. lab now owned by Google, costs for 400 employees totaled $138 million in 2016, according to the company\u2019s annual financial filings in Britain. That translates to $345,000 per employee, including researchers and other staff.Some researchers may command higher pay because their names carry weight across the A.I. community and they can help recruit other researchers.\u201cWhen you hire a star, you are not just hiring a star,\u201d Mr. Nicholson of the start-up Skymind said. \u201cYou are hiring everyone they attract. And you are paying for all the publicity they will attract.\u201dOther researchers at OpenAI, including Greg Brockman, who leads the lab alongside Mr. Sutskever, did not receive such high salaries during the lab\u2019s first year.In 2016, according to the tax forms, Mr. Brockman, who had served as chief technology officer at the financial technology start-up Stripe, made $175,000. As one of the founders of the organization, however, he most likely took a salary below market value. Two other researchers with more experience in the field \u2014 though still very young \u2014 made between $275,000 and $300,000 in salary alone in 2016, according to the forms.Though the pool of available A.I. researchers is growing, it is not growing fast enough. \u201cIf anything, demand for that talent is growing faster than the supply of new researchers, because A.I. is moving from early adopters to wider use,\u201d Mr. Nicholson said.In essence, Mr. Musk was poaching his own talent. Since then, he has stepped down from the OpenAI board, with the lab saying this would allow him to \u201celiminate a potential future conflict.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "What You Don\u2019t Know About How Facebook Uses Your Data", "Date": "2018-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRepresentative Debbie Dingell, a Democrat from Michigan, for one, wanted to know about Facebook\u2019s use of different types of tracking software to follow consumers\u2019 activities on millions of non-Facebook sites all over the web.Facebook meticulously scrutinizes the minutiae of its users\u2019 online lives, and its tracking stretches far beyond the company\u2019s well-known targeted advertisements. Details that people often readily volunteer \u2014 age, employer, relationship status, likes and location \u2014 are just the start.Facebook tracks both its users and nonusers on other sites and apps. It collects biometric facial data without users\u2019 explicit \u201copt-in\u201d consent.And the sifting of users can get quite personal. Among many possible target audiences, Facebook offers advertisers 1.5 million people \u201cwhose activity on Facebook suggests that they\u2019re more likely to engage with/distribute liberal political content\u201d and nearly seven million Facebook users who \u201cprefer high-value goods in Mexico.\u201dMany other companies, including news organizations like The New York Times, mine information about users for marketing purposes. If Facebook is being singled out for such practices, it is because it is a market leader and its stockpiling of personal data is at the core of its $40.6 billion annual business.Facebook uses a number of software tools to do this tracking. When internet users venture to other sites, Facebook can still monitor what they are doing with software like its ubiquitous \u201cLike\u201d and \u201cShare\u201d buttons, and something called Facebook Pixel \u2014 invisible code that\u2019s dropped onto the other websites that allows that site and Facebook to track users\u2019 activity.Ms. Dingell asked Mr. Zuckerberg how many non-Facebook sites used various kinds of Facebook tracking software: \u201cIs the number over 100 million?\u201d He said he\u2019d have to get back to her with an answer.\u201cThere are common parts of people\u2019s experience on the internet,\u201d Matt Steinfeld, a Facebook spokesman, said in a statement. \u201cBut of course we can do more to help people understand how Facebook works and the choices they have.\u201dFacebook requires outside sites that use its tracking technologies to clearly notify users, and it allows Facebook users to opt out of seeing ads based on their use of those apps and websites.That has not stopped angry users from airing their grievances over Facebook\u2019s practices.Facebook persuaded a federal judge to dismiss the case. The company argued that tracking users for ad-targeting purposes was a standard business practice, and one that its users agreed to when signing up for the service. The Missouri man and two other plaintiffs have appealed the judge\u2019s decision.But in Europe, some regulators contend that Facebook has not obtained users\u2019 explicit and informed consent to track them on other sites and apps. Their general concern, they said, is that many of Facebook\u2019s 2.1 billion users have no idea how much data Facebook could collect about them and how the company could use it. And there is a growing unease that tech giants are unfairly manipulating users.\u201cFacebook provides a network where the users, while getting free services most of them consider useful, are subject to a multitude of nontransparent analyses, profiling, and other mostly obscure algorithmical processing,\u201d said Johannes Caspar, the data protection commissioner for Hamburg, Germany.In 2015, for instance, the Belgian Privacy Commission ordered Facebook to stop systematically using \u201clong-term and uniquely identifying\u201d codes to track nonusers without their \u201cunequivocal and specific consent.\u201d The agency subsequently sued Facebook. In February, a judge in Brussels ordered Facebook to stop tracking \u201ceach internet user on Belgian soil\u201d on other websites.Facebook has appealed the decision. In his comments in the House hearing on Wednesday, Mr. Zuckerberg said Facebook tracked nonusers for security purposes \u2014 to ensure they could not scrape public data about Facebook users.But, in one presentation on the case, Belgian regulators wrote: \u201cTracking nonusers for security purposes is excessive.\u201dOutside the European Union, Facebook employs face recognition technology for a name-tagging feature that can automatically suggest names for the people in users\u2019 photos. But civil liberties experts warn that face recognition technology could threaten the ability of Americans to remain anonymous online, on the street and at political protests.Facebook sent notices alerting users of its new face recognition uses and said it provides a page where they can turn the feature off.Facebook has other powerful techniques with implications users may not fully understand.Some marketers worry that political campaigns or unscrupulous companies could potentially use the same technique to identify the characteristics of, for instance, people who make rash decisions and find a bigger pool of the same sort of Facebook users.Facebook\u2019s policies prohibit potentially predatory ad-targeting practices. Advertisers are able to target users using the look-alike service, but they do not receive personal data about those Facebook users.Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a nonprofit group in Washington, however, warned that this look-alike marketing was a hidden, manipulative practice \u2014 on a par with subliminal advertising \u2014 and said it should be prohibited.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: Can San Diego Ditch the Power Company?", "Date": "2018-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.For the last 18 years, California regulators have shaped energy policy largely based on fear. They wanted to avoid repeating the disastrous experience that followed the deregulation of the energy market, which left the state vulnerable to manipulation by energy traders and caused a power crisis that led to soaring electricity prices and blackouts.In response, they approved new power plants \u2014 more than the state could even use. They expanded the network of power lines with billions of dollars. They developed a system of trading electricity throughout the West.But the choices of state regulators in Sacramento and San Francisco didn\u2019t satisfy local communities. They decided to take control of their electricity.Using a law passed in 2002, local governments have been working to wean their constituents off the electricity system run by the state\u2019s three big shareholder-owned utilities to form government-run power programs.The programs, known as community choice aggregation, have spread across the nation, beginning in Cape Cod in Massachusetts and spreading to New York, Illinois and increasingly California, where Marin County became the first to adopt the model in 2010.When a community choice program begins, the government moves all electricity customers in their service area into the new program. Consumers must opt out if they want to go back to their previous provider. The traditional utilities are typically required to maintain the network of power lines and often the billing for all customers.California\u2019s shareholder-owned utilities \u2014 Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric Company \u2014 argue that the required services will impose higher costs on them and ultimately their remaining customers.And with a political-style ad campaign, the San Diego utility has raised the specter of a return to the blackouts that marked the California energy crisis. \u201cSan Diegans and Californians are no strangers to rolling blackouts caused by deregulation that triggered an energy crisis,\u201d a narrator says in the ad while a statement flashes on the screen, stating, \u201cRemember the California Electricity Crisis?\u201dThe City Council is expected to vote by year\u2019s end on whether to approve the plan.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)In other news:There is a shark lab at California State University, Long Beach and experts there are trying to track an interesting trend.\u201cThe good news is that they are coming back,\u201d Dr. Lowe continued. \u201cThe tricky part is that we lack the tools to monitor them.\u201dSo Assemblyman Patrick O\u2019Donnell, a Democrat of Long Beach, has introduced a bill that would make grant funding available for the kind of research the lab seeks to perform.At the moment, officials say the lab is so overextended, researchers have run out of shark tags. Mr. O\u2019Donnell called it a \u201chuman, environmental and economic issue.\u201d\u201cThis is jeopardizing our efforts to learn about white shark behavior and help lifeguards and law enforcement better inform the public about beach safety,\u201d Dr. Lowe said.The bill cleared a committee last week and will now move to appropriations.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

Although there was some progress in setting basic norms of behavior in cyberspace through a United Nations-organized group of experts several years ago, the movement has since faltered.Mr. Smith said over the weekend that the first move needed to come from the American companies that often find themselves acting as the \u201cfirst responders\u201d when cyberattacks hit their customers. \u201cThis has become a much bigger problem, and I think what we have learned in the past few years is that we need to work together in much bigger ways,\u201d Mr. Smith said in an interview. \u201cWe need to approach this in a principled way, and if we expect to get governments to do that, we have to start with some principles ourselves.\u201dYet not all governments are likely to embrace the \u201cCybersecurity Tech Accord\u201d in part because the principles it espouses can run headlong into their own, usually secret efforts to develop cyberweapons.Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor who leaked documents about surveillance programs, revealed pictures suggesting that American officials intercepted some hardware that came out of Cisco Systems, a major manufacturer of the routers and switches that make up the spine of the internet, apparently so the equipment directed traffic back to American intelligence agencies. There is no evidence that Cisco cooperated, but the publication of the photos led some foreign customers to believe that American equipment had been broadly compromised by the N.S.A.Cisco is one of the firms that has signed the accord. Mark Chandler, Cisco\u2019s general counsel, said the company believed that \u201cwe need to say we will not be part of any effort that will undermine the security of the web, or undermine those who depend on it \u2014 our customers.\u201d Among the other signatories were Dell, Juniper Networks, the two parts of the recently-split Hewlett-Packard, Symantec and FireEye. Two foreign firms, Telephonica of Spain and Nokia of Finland, also signed. There are no Chinese or Russian companies on the list of initial signatories.The new technology accord vows that the 31 signers \u201cwill protect against tampering with and exploitation of technology products and services during their development, design, distribution and use.\u201d Among the companies that signed are Oracle, Symantec, FireEye and HP, along with the Finnish company Nokia and the Spanish company Telef\u00f3nica.The cybersecurity coordinator at the White House, Rob Joyce, is widely rumored to be considering leaving his post and returning to the National Security Agency, where he ran the most elite of the cyberforces that attack foreign networks. If Mr. Joyce departs, the White House will have lost its two most senior, and most knowledgeable, cybersecurity policymakers in the span of a few weeks.An earlier version of this story incorrectly referred to the name of one of the signatories on the technology accord.

This week, the Trump administration is expected to announce a list of Chinese imports subject to tariffs, which could include high-tech products like semiconductors as well as cheap electronics and other goods that many Americans buy.Josh Kallmer, the senior vice president for global policy at the Information Technology Industry Council, an advocate for companies like Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and IBM, said his group had been largely supportive of the administration\u2019s targeting of China\u2019s unfair trade practices. But the group had made it clear to the White House that it would not be pleased with any measure that had tariffs \u201cas the primary or even a significant remedy.\u201d\u201cThe reason is that it would be a tax on consumers,\u201d Mr. Kallmer said, \u201cprecisely the people we are trying to support.\u201dThat theory could make it more difficult for American companies to operate in a country that already puts up steep barriers.As Mr. Trump advances a series of tough trade measures to confront these behaviors, however, cracks have appeared in American industry\u2019s seemingly united front.Companies in technology, investment and other industries now say that the measures the administration is taking to help them may actually end up doing irreparable harm to supply chains they have built up over decades. Any American company that wants to be a global player cannot afford to lose access to China\u2019s growing market, executives say.The 25 percent tariff on pork that China imposed on Monday is expected to be particularly harmful, including in regions that supported the president, like Iowa, North Carolina and Indiana. Last year, American farmers sent more than a billion dollars\u2019 worth of pork to China, their largest export market by value after Japan and Mexico.\u201cBecause we\u2019re so blessed to have America feed the world, we\u2019re also the first industry to get slammed whenever there are trade difficulties between the U.S. and other countries,\u201d Denise Bode, the coordinator for the American Fruit and Vegetable Processors and Growers Coalition.\u201cAmerican farmers appear to be the first casualties of an escalating trade war,\u201d said Max Baucus, a former Democratic senator from Montana and a chairman of a group called Farmers for Free Trade. \u201cWith farm incomes already declining, farmers rely on export markets to stay above water. These new tariffs are a drag on their ability to make ends meet.\u201dHowever, analysts and companies involved in China said that these measures appeared unlikely to adequately resolve American concerns about China\u2019s longstanding encroachment on American intellectual property.Companies are waiting anxiously for the administration to release a list of Chinese products this week that will be subject to tariffs \u2014 most likely the kind of high-tech products that the administration has accused China of targeting. The retail industry, which lobbied the administration and Congress against an early plan to impose tariffs on Chinese-made apparel and footwear, is now cautiously optimistic that its products will be exempt.G.E. and IBM, which operate through joint ventures and other partnerships in China and around the world, have both lobbied against the expansion of Cfius over concerns that restrictions on joint ventures with foreign companies that include the transfer of valuable skills or technology could weaken the position of American companies abroad.Financial firms, including Goldman Sachs and the Carlyle Group, have also expressed concern about investment restrictions, saying they could provide a drag on the United States economy.White House advisers, in turn, have complained that previous approaches to dealing with China have not worked, and that companies are overreacting to legitimate trade measures.Speaking Monday on CNBC, the White House trade adviser, Peter Navarro, defended the administration\u2019s tough actions on China and said investors should not fear a trade war.\u201cEverybody needs to relax,\u201d Mr. Navarro said. \u201cThe economy is as strong as an ox.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Scott Pruitt, Under an Ethics Cloud, Faces Lawmakers", "Date": "2018-04-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, testified on Capitol Hill on Thursday in what turned out to be a daylong grilling over allegations of ethical infractions and lavish spending.The E.P.A. chief, whose job may be hanging by a thread, delivered a typically lawyerly performance.As Democrats opened an aggressive, coordinated line of questioning \u2014 on Mr. Pruitt\u2019s spending, housing arrangements, security team and raises for political appointees \u2014 he stayed quiet and calm, never raising his voice or his temper, but rarely giving direct answers to those questions.Here are the highlights from the two sessions:Representative Paul Tonko, Democrat of New York, got the morning questioning off to a start by asking Mr. Pruitt to answer \u201cyes or no\u201d to whether he had approved pay raises for two E.P.A. employees he brought with him from Oklahoma.Mr. Pruitt said he had delegated the authority to grant such approvals, or as he put it, \u201cThere was delegation given in my authority.\u201d He said, \u201cI was not aware of the amount, and I was not aware of the bypassing that was going on.\u201dMr. Tonko said the answer suggested \u201cyou have no idea what is going on\u201d under Mr. Pruitt\u2019s name at the agency.Representative Frank Pallone Jr., a New Jersey Democrat, was even more direct in his opening remarks Thursday morning. \u201cYou are unfit to hold public office and undeserving of the public trust,\u201d he told Mr. Pruitt. \u201cEvery indication we have is you really should resign.\u201dHe followed up by asking Mr. Pruitt whether he had sidelined or demoted at least five employees who disagreed with him, demanding a \u201cyes or no\u201d answer as to whether he had called for these changes.\u201cI don\u2019t ever recall a conversation about that,\u201d Mr. Pruitt said.\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a yes,\u201d Mr. Pallone responded.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t take that as a yes,\u201d the administrator pushed back.Mr. Pallone continued to press. \u201cHas it always been your practice to fire people who disagree with you?\u201dRepublicans also chastised Mr. Pruitt from the beginning, but their questions tended to be much more gentle.Representative Joe Barton of Texas, who has long denied the overwhelming evidence of human effects on climate change, offered sympathy in the morning session. \u201cMr. Pruitt, you\u2019re not the first victim of Washington politics,\u201d he said.As to Mr. Pruitt\u2019s penchant for first-class travel, Mr. Barton said: \u201cYou\u2019ve been attacked for flying first class. Was that illegal? It may look bad, but it\u2019s not illegal.\u201dRepresentative David B. McKinley, Republican of West Virginia, told Mr. Pruitt sympathetically that the attacks on him \u201chave an echo of McCarthyism.\u201dThe head of the Environmental Protection Agency faces nearly a dozen federal inquiries into his practices. We break down the accusations by category.Representative Diana DeGette, a Colorado Democrat, speaking in the morning session, drilled down on some of the ethics questions concerning Mr. Pruitt\u2019s expenses in office and his past financial dealings.Mr. Pruitt had previously testified that the expense was appropriate. In light of the recent ruling, Ms. DeGette asked whether Mr. Pruitt knew that the purchase had violated the law and whether anyone would be penalized.\u201cWe are investigating this internally,\u201d he said.\u201cWould you agree that public officials should be held to the highest standards of ethical conduct?\u201d she asked. He responded that he did.Representative Tony C\u00e1rdenas, a California Democrat, also brought up the phone booth.\u201cI was not aware of the approval of the $43,000,\u201d Mr. Pruitt told him, \u201cand if I had known about it, congressman, I would not have approved it.\u201dMr. C\u00e1rdenas responded that \u201cif someone was spending $43,000 in my office, I would know about it.\u201dRepresentative Anna G. Eshoo, a California Democrat, had scathing criticism for Mr. Pruitt when her turn for questioning came Thursday morning. \u201cYou have a solid record of violating ethics rules from the state level to the federal government,\u201d she told him. \u201cI think it\u2019s an embarrassment.\u201dThen she asked: \u201cDo you have any remorse? Yes or no?\u201dMr. Pruitt responded: \u201cI think there are changes I\u2019ve made already. I\u2019ve made a change from first class to coach travel.\u201dMs. Eshoo returned to her call for a yes-or-no answer, and asked Mr. Pruitt whether he would reimburse the government. He launched into a long response, but she cut him off.\u201cWith all due respect, I may be elected, but I\u2019m not a fool,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not \u2018dodge-question\u2019 day.\u201dIn the afternoon session, Representative Betty McCollum, a Minnesota Democrat, pressed Mr. Pruitt about his claims that he had been obliged to fly first class because of \u201cunprecedented\u201d death threats. Ms. McCollum told Mr. Pruitt that her office had contacted the E.P.A. inspector general, Arthur A. Elkins Jr., and that \u201che disputed your claim.\u201d Besides, she said, \u201cWe all receive death threats on our Facebook page.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a shell company,\u201d he said quickly, and said that such financial structures were commonly used to purchase real estate in Oklahoma.She then asked Mr. Pruitt whether he had paid taxes on rent he received. He said such issues had been handed over to an accountant.Ms. McCollum, the Minnesota Democrat, also took time to focus on the question of whether E.P.A. staff members who challenged Mr. Pruitt\u2019s spending and other conduct had been unfairly demoted or reassigned.Mr. Pruitt denied that any of his employees had been demoted, fired or sidelined because they had questioned his spending. \u201cI\u2019m not aware of any instance in that regard,\u201d Mr. Pruitt said.Representative Chellie Pingree of Maine, a Democrat, said in the afternoon session that she wanted to focus on \u201csevere policy disagreements\u201d with Mr. Pruitt and expressed concern that Trump administration officials appeared to believe they are \u201cthere to dismantle\u201d the agencies they lead.In his exchange with Ms. Pingree, the E.P.A. chief defended the administration\u2019s efforts to repeal the Clean Power Plan, former President Barack Obama\u2019s signature plan to curb greenhouse gases. To support his position, he falsely said that the plan had been struck down by the Supreme Court. (The justices delayed the plan but did not rule on the merits before the change in administrations.)But he would not say definitively whether that was a final position. The E.P.A. is \u201cworking very diligently and diplomatically with California to find answers on this issue,\u201d Mr. Pruitt said, in response to questions from Representative Doris Matsui, a California Democrat who has sought to protect her state\u2019s ability to regulate emissions.Moments after Mr. Pruitt finished his second and final appearance of the day on Capitol Hill, his security detail hustled him out of the hearing room. Most Republicans also rushed out, while Democrats lingered to continue their criticisms of the administrator for reporters.Representative Ken Calvert, the California Republican who presided over the afternoon session, called Mr. Pruitt\u2019s appearance \u201cvery professional.\u201d Asked whether Mr. Pruitt should resign, he said no.Eric Lipton contributed reporting.Follow @NYTClimate on TwitterAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Riffing On One of the World\u2019s Great Sandwiches", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCity KitchenOddly enough, I first tasted banh mi, one of the world\u2019s most delectable sandwiches, in Albuquerque.This was decades ago; I was hungry and grabbed one from the checkout counter of a giant Asian supermarket. Two bites in, I was hooked. It was extraordinarily flavorful \u2014 sweet, spicy and meaty. For me, it was a pleasant change from the usual New Mexico menu of tacos, enchiladas and tamales (though I love those, too).There are now, of course, numerous Vietnamese-American communities and Vietnamese restaurants all over the United States, so banh mi is readily available, known to many as a first-rate quick bite. The classic, built in a crisp baguette spread with mayonnaise, contains p\u00e2t\u00e9, thinly sliced ham and roasted pork, along with strips of pickled vegetables, cilantro, cucumber and hot chiles.Banh mi is, after all, a hybrid, with French colonial roots. The French eventually pulled out of Vietnam, and for the most part, local flavors replaced Gallic ones. But the baguette, mayonnaise and liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 remained.Shops specializing in the sandwich are fairly easy to find in New York City, but all are not created equal. Much of their success lies in the bread: ideally a sandwich roll or baguette, with a crisp crust and fluffy interior, and always heated. When I was in Vietnam a few years ago, the bread was warmed over hot coals, kept behind the counter for that specific task.But at home, you might use your oven, and a kaiser roll, a small ciabatta or a bolillo from a corner bodega. Or look for an old-fashioned airy baguette from a French bakery (not the denser, new-wave type).However much I love them, though, I\u2019m no more than an amateur, one who has gleaned quite a few tips from the California-based teacher and food writer Andrea Nguyen\u2019s book, \u201cThe Banh Mi Handbook\u201d (Ten Speed Press, 2014). In it, she offers countless twists on the original, including fillings of grilled chicken, stir-fried beef and char siu pork, and even a Louisiana po\u2019 boy-style banh mi with fried oysters, all of which she claims as authentic.Emboldened, I decided to make banh mi with miniature pan-fried crab cakes and all the spicy trimmings. It received raves, but I\u2019ve also made banh mi with fried shrimp. Both would be approved by Ms. Nguyen, I suspect.Other options could include mayonnaise-dressed lobster or crab salad, as kind of riff on a Yankee lobster roll. But maybe don\u2019t try serving it to die-hard, traditionalist New Englanders.cookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Search of Facebook\u2019s Heroes, Finding Only Victims", "Date": "2018-04-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA week earlier, mobs of Sinhalese-speaking Buddhists, the country\u2019s majority group, had risen up, inspired by anti-Muslim misinformation and hate speech on Facebook. They destroyed mosques and Muslim homes in several towns, killing one man.But, here, the monk we\u2019d heard about, Nelligala Dhammaratne, had met the mob in the street. Drawing on his religious authority and sway with the community, he admonished its members to disperse. The local mosque was saved.Mr. Dhammaratne was meant to provide a heroic contrast to our story\u2019s villains: the extremists who\u2019d dominated social media here and in other developing countries, using it to whip people into paranoid rages that sometimes became deadly.We thought we had a story about good guys and bad guys battling for control of the vast information spaces that Facebook opens up in countries like Sri Lanka. That was in line with Facebook\u2019s own worldview, that the platform heightens any society\u2019s pre-existing tendencies for good and bad. In this view, Facebook has a responsibility to mitigate the bad, but could hardly be blamed for creating it.But Mr. Dhammaratne was not what we\u2019d expected. Spending time with him at his mountaintop temple, overlooking rolling green hills, we realized that our understanding of Facebook\u2019s role in societies with weak institutions went far beyond magnifying good and bad alike.Yes, he\u2019d stopped the mob. But he also recited to us, as unvarnished truth, some of the very anti-Muslim rumors that had spread in viral Facebook memes before the attack. Muslim shop owners put chemicals in bras to sterilize Buddhist women. Muslim doctors sterilized Buddhist patients without their knowledge. Muslims in government were secret extremists.How did he know this? \u201cThe whole country heard about this\u201d on Facebook, he answered. Had he discussed this with his constituents in the run-up to the violence? Of course.We came to understand that Facebook\u2019s algorithm-driven newsfeed, by pushing out whatever content drew the most engagement from users, does more than amplify existing prejudices or boost extremists.By pushing out content charged by negative, primal emotions like anger or fear \u2014 which, studies show, perform best on the algorithm \u2014 the platform can change how people see the world and relate to one another. In countries with weak institutions but where Facebook use is widespread, that can allow misinformation to run rampant. And in societies with histories of deep social distrust, it can turn deadly.Mr. Dhammaratne, meant to show how society\u2019s gatekeepers guard against those forces, turned out to exemplified that even the well-intentioned are overwhelmed by these forces. This would not be a story of heroes and villains, we learned, but of victims on both sides of the violence.Who were they \u2014 suddenly plugged into one of the most sophisticated media platforms in history, which presented itself as a portal for news and information \u2014 to resist?\u201cSinhalese people who had been perfectly fine were getting provoked into action,\u201d Mr. Dhammaratne said, referring to emotionally charged Facebook content, which had made it difficult for members of his congregation to distinguish truth from reality.We would see that pattern, of otherwise well-meaning bystanders provoked by online anger and fear, play out in a number of cases we tracked across the developing world.\u201cIt\u2019s the ability of these apps to transmit messages, especially audio and video, so quickly and to such large groups, that is how this wave of violence was created,\u201d Mr. Dhammaratne said.He said the government had been right to temporarily block social media; \u201cThat\u2019s how this got controlled.\u201dBut Facebook has become too essential for day-to-day life to be shut down, he added. It will have to be regulated or better policed, though he was unsure how. Otherwise, this might happen again.Advertisement"}

But he said that it received no information in advance of the shooting.During the attack, Ms. Aghdam fired \u201cmultiple shots\u201d from a Smith & Wesson 9-millimeter, semiautomatic handgun, Ed Barberini, chief of the San Bruno police department, said on Wednesday. The gun, which was registered to her, was recovered at the scene.There is no evidence linking Ms. Aghdam to any of the shooting victims, Chief Barberini said. Investigators were searching two homes in Southern California associated with the suspect.On Tuesday morning, before driving to the YouTube offices, Ms. Aghdam visited a local gun range, the police said.Ms. Aghdam parked her car at a business near YouTube. She entered one of the company\u2019s parking garages, and then walked into an outdoor courtyard where employees were eating lunch. The chief said that investigators were still trying to determine what level of security there was in the area leading to the courtyard. Zach Vorhies, a YouTube engineer, said on Tuesday that the dining area was accessible from an adjacent parking structure without an employee badge.\u201cAt this point in the investigation, it is believed that the suspect was upset at the policies and practices of YouTube. This appears to be the motive for this incident,\u201d Mr. Barberini said.The chief said his department had worked with YouTube to develop security measures for the campus, including what to do in the case of an armed attacker.The three shooting victims were taken to Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital. Two women, a 32-year-old who was admitted in serious condition and a 27-year-old who was admitted in fair condition, were released late on Tuesday, a hospital spokesman said.The third shooting victim, a 36-year-old man, had improved from critical to serious condition and remained in the hospital.On Wednesday morning, the area around YouTube\u2019s office in San Bruno, a suburban community of 41,000 people that stretches into the hills above Silicon Valley, was quiet. Police officers, security guards, news reporters and a handful of employees milled around outside the building.Police had cordoned off the street in front of the offices, but company security guards were allowing small groups of employees into the building from a lower-level entrance.A few workers in hard hats and florescent yellow vests from a company called Restoration Management Company \u2014 a firm that specializes in services cleaning up \u201ctrauma scenes,\u201d according to its website \u2014 carried plastic bags of debris out of the building.YouTube employees on Wednesday appeared to spend no more than 10 minutes inside before exiting the building. A few employees, who asked not to be identified because they had been told not to speak to the news media, said they were picking up items left behind after they fled the building during the attack. Some said they were there to pick up their cars \u2014 a few people drove vehicles out of a closed parking garage that police said Ms. Aghdam used to enter the YouTube facility on Tuesday.But in other buildings in the YouTube complex, it appeared to be a regular work day. At a YouTube office across the street from the main headquarters, employees ate lunch in a fenced off courtyard.Ms. Aghdam had YouTube pages in Persian, Turkish and English. In several of her videos she stated that she had been born in Iran, in the city of Urmia, near the border with Turkey. She explained in videos that she and her family are members of the Baha\u2019i faith, a persecuted minority in majority Muslim Iran.It was perhaps her inability to easily fit a stereotype that drew her to so many in Iran, where she had tens of thousands of followers on social media. Several of her colorful \u2014 and sometimes bizarre \u2014 videos had gone viral.Life in the United States had not been good, she said in one video posted last week. \u201cThere they kill you by ax,\u201d she said of Iran. \u201cHere they kill you with cotton\u201d \u2014 an Iranian expression meaning to die by something that you do not know is dangerous.In another video, she responded to viewers who had begun to wonder if she was mentally ill: \u201cI don\u2019t have any special mental or physical disease, but I live on a planet filled with disease, disorders, perversions and injustices.\u201d\u201cWhen searching for my website in google, at top of link they add \u2018an error occurred\u2019 but there is no error!\u201d a website under her name, NasimeSabz.com, said in February 2016. \u201cThey add it to keep you from my visiting my site.\u201dMs. Aghdam\u2019s personal website included graphic photos of slaughtered animals and pleas not to wear fur jackets or have sex outside of marriage. More recently, she focused on what she perceived as discrimination by YouTube and Google. Ms. Aghdam had YouTube pages in Persian, Turkish and English.In February 2017, she criticized YouTube in a video on Facebook for restricting one of her workout videos to older audiences. \u201cThis is what they are doing to vegan activists and many other people who try to promote healthy, humane and smart living \u2014 people like me are not good for big business, like for animal business, medicine business and for many other businesses. That\u2019s why they are discriminating and censoring us,\u201d she said in the video.By Tuesday night, YouTube, Instagram and Facebook had all taken down her pages and videos. Ed Barberini, San Bruno\u2019s police chief, said on Wednesday that investigators were aware of Ms. Aghdam\u2019s criticism of YouTube and Google.\u201cWe are learning that Ms. Aghdam had a problem with the policies or practices that YouTube had employed,\u201d Chief Barberini said in an interview on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d \u201cObviously, she was upset.\u201dActive shooting incidents in the United States are increasingly common, but shootings by women are quite rare.A 2014 F.B.I. study of 160 active shooting incidents found that at least six involved a woman. Women were involved in three other incidents from 2014 to 2016, according to the bureau. The bureau defined such incidents as \u201can individual engaging in killing or attempting to kill people in a confined and populated area,\u201d and distinguished the events from murders or mass killings.Mass shootings are often regarded as incidents where at least four people are killed.In 2010, a woman who had been fired from her job at a Publix Supermarket in Florida returned to the store with a gun. In another instance the same year, a woman shot at co-workers after she had been suspended from her position at Kraft Foods in Philadelphia. Both women had handguns.Although Ms. Aghdam appeared to have a long-running grudge against YouTube, the police said that it did not appear that she knew any of the three shooting victims.An earlier version of this article misquoted a comment made by Nasim Najafi Aghdam in one of her YouTube videos. She said, \u201cThis is what they are doing to vegan activists and many other people who try to promote healthy, humane and smart living,\u201d not \u201cwhat they are doing to weekend activists.\u201dThomas Erdbrink, Nellie Bowles and Jack Nicas contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "A Big Reason Wall Street Is Flocking to Spotify: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Good Tuesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Spotify\u2019s shares opened at $165.90.\u2022 If the markets fall again, we have some possible explanations.\u2022 Should Facebook offer \u201cWhy Me?\u201d buttons?\u2022 Disney has offered to buy Sky News to help Fox\u2019s Sky bid.Spotify is a loss-making company that might not report a profit until next decade, but that didn\u2019t stop investors from valuing the company at $30 billion when it debuted Tuesday on the United States stock market.Spotify is an impressive company. Its loyal, paying customer base is enormous and is expected to keep growing. Also, Spotify has so far held its own in the face of competition from Apple, Amazon and Google, all of which want to win new subscribers to their music streaming services.But there is an important reason that Wall Street is flocking to Spotify: It is doing a great job at getting record companies to roll over.Spotify\u2019s main cost is what it pays record companies for the music it streams to its customers. As Spotify has grown, that expense has fallen as a share of its total revenue, which shows that Spotify is negotiating increasingly advantageous deals with record companies.That has bolstered Spotify\u2019s gross profit margin, which measures how much money a company keeps after paying out the costs directly related to generating its revenue. Last year, that margin was 21 percent of revenue at Spotify, well up from 14 percent in 2016.Crucially, though, Spotify has said it expects its gross margin to expand to as much as 35 percent over the longer term. In other words, as Spotify\u2019s spending on music grows, so will its leverage over record companies. And it may well achieve its gross margin target. After all, Netflix, which occupies a similar position in the market for streaming video, has a gross margin of 35 percent.But Spotify\u2019s main rivals could complicate things. What if Amazon offered record companies better terms than Spotify? That would reduce Spotify\u2019s bargaining power, making it harder to deliver wider gross margins investors are expecting. And Amazon, along with Apple and Google, has far deeper pockets to slog it out over the long term.\u2014 Peter EavisSpotify\u2019s unusual path to the public markets was a success.On its first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the music streaming service finished with a valuation of $26.5 billion.Spotify\u2019s shares opened at $165.90 before closing at $149.01.That\u2019s well above the high of $132.50 that its shares changed hands at in private transactions this year. It\u2019s also well above the $137.50 the WSJ reported its private shares were trading at during the past week.Spotify had eschewed a typical initial public offering in favor of a direct listing. That meant there was no \u201cdeal price\u201d for investors to reference on the first day of trading and no underwriters acting as stabilizing agents if the stock began to plunge.Despite all that, Spotify\u2019s valuation at the close on Tuesday ranks among the highest for a tech company debuting on an American exchange.Here\u2019s a look at the tech companies with the 10 biggest market capitalizations after their first day of trading, courtesy of Dealogic:Alibaba \u2014 $233.9 billionFacebook \u2014 $81.7 billionPalm \u2014 $53.3 billionInfineon Technologies \u2014 $47.9 billionJD.com \u2014 $28.9 billionSnap \u2014 $28.9 billionGoogle \u2014 $27.2 billionSpotify \u2014 $26.5 billionTwitter \u2014 $24.9 billionAgilent \u2014 $20.1 billionTesla said:\u2022 It built 2,020 Model 3s in the past seven days. That fell short of its goal of 2,500 by the end of the quarter.\u2022 Tesla produced 9,766 Model 3s during the quarter.\u2022 In total, Tesla produced 35,000 cars in the first quarter.\u2022 It has delivered 8,800 Model 3s during the first quarter, below the 8,800 analysts expected according to Bloomberg.\u2022 In all, Tesla delivered a record 29,980 vehicles during the quarter.\u2022 The company said it expects Model 3 weekly production to reach 5,000 by the end of the second quarter.\u2022 The combined deliveries of the Model X and Model S came to 21,800 cars, the lowest total in several quarters.ContextTesla\u2019s stock and bond prices have plunged amid concerns about how much cash the company is using as it struggles to speed up assembly and sales of the Model 3. With a starting price of $35,000, the car is supposed to be more affordable than Tesla\u2019s other cars. The company has been counting on a quick expansion of its Model 3 business to increase revenue.The president reiterated his claim that Amazon is \u201ccosting the United States Postal Service massive amounts of money\u201d in a post to Twitter on Tuesday morning.Shares are essentially flat on the day.\u201cPackage delivery has been a bright spot for a service that\u2019s lost money for 11 straight years. The losses are mostly due to pension and health care costs \u2014 not the business deal for the Postal Service to deliver packages for Amazon. Boosted by e-commerce, the Postal Service has enjoyed double-digit increases in revenue from delivering packages, but that hasn\u2019t been enough to offset declines in first-class letters and marketing mail, which together make up more than two-thirds of postal revenue.\u201cWhile the Postal Service\u2019s losses can\u2019t be attributed to its package business, Trump\u2019s claim that it could get more bang for its buck may not be entirely far-fetched. A 2017 analysis by Citigroup concluded that the Postal Service was charging below-market rates as a whole for parcels. The post office does not use taxpayer money for its operations.\u201dCould Mr. Tump\u2019s criticism lead to action against Amazon?\u201cNothing can be certain, except death and taxes \u2026 and more Trump tweets on Amazon. We believe sales tax collection changes would have limited impact on consumer use of Amazon and could actually help Amazon\u2019s relative competitive positioning in domestic e-commerce.\u201dMore from Andrew:The \u201cWhy Me?\u201d button might create all sorts of problems for Facebook, and its advertisers, too. It would allow users \u2014 and rivals \u2014 to reverse engineer much of the way the system works. And advertisers would probably object to the idea of making their targeting plans public. But that would be the cost of using such large public platforms with such exact targeting.The bottom line: Disney wants Fox to have full control of Sky to support its $52.4 billion deal to buy most of Fox, and it wants to get ahead of Comcast\u2019s rival effort to buy that 39 percent of the British broadcaster.An earlier version of this article misstated the status of a Department of Defense contract for cloud computing services.

{"Headline": "Gender Progress in Macho Australia?", "Date": "2018-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter 52______In addition to public panels on the #MeToo movement, there were conferences, university discussions and a dinner with young female New York Times readers to talk about our coverage.Everyone, it seemed, had something to say about #MeToo.On her way back to New York, Francesca jotted down a few impressions about Australia\u2019s gender movement and how it compares with what\u2019s happening in the United States.Her thoughts raised as many questions as they answered, and we hope you\u2019ll share your insights as we unpack the issue.Notebook from SydneyBecause I\u2019m director of the New York Times Gender Initiative, many people I met on my travels wanted to talk me about women and Trump and women and sexual harassment and women and Harvey and women and the workplace and women and women and women.But they also had a few things to share, too.The rumblings from women and people in their 20s and 30s began almost at once:\u201cAustralian politics is a boys\u2019 club. The journalists here don\u2019t cover politicians as aggressively as they do in the U.S. Exhibit A (and B and C and D): Barnaby Joyce!\u201d\u201cAnd the press! The press! There are so few publications we identify with! Most young people just turn away and shrug.\u201d\u201cAnd the defamation laws! It\u2019s almost impossible for the press to cover sexual harassment. Meanwhile, sexual harassment is rife in universities, at workplaces and on and on!\u201dAnd yet.The Sydney Opera House was hosting a day all about women called \u201cAll About Women.\u201d Attendees who were mostly women (and a few odd men out) turned out in the thousands. The festival aired around the country on local TV stations. People tuned in.And yet.The ABC devoted episodes to International Women\u2019s Day and two ABC national radio stations (Fran Kelly and Richard Glover) invited me on to talk Harvey Weinstein and, you guessed it, women.And yet.Gay marriage had been recently legalized. And the city of Sydney would pay homage to the passing of the law at its 40th Anniversary Mardi Gras celebrations. And yet.Barnaby Joyce, the former deputy prime minister, a champion of family values, who had fathered a child with a staff member who was not his wife, and accepted a rent-free townhouse from a millionaire politician, had stepped down from his post. On the surface it looked like progress but underneath, was it? It got me thinking: What should women (and others) in Australia realistically expect from a gender movement? Are hopes pinned too high? Or do expectations not go far enough? So here are my questions for you, Australia: How do you think the movement in Australia compares with the wave of accountability sweeping the rest of the world?And what does gender progress in a macho country like Australia look like, anyway? Now let\u2019s catch up with news of the week, and what to watch on Netflix on April.______\u201cI never expected anything like this, just as a poor man never dreams of striking it rich overnight,\u201d Mr. Lam said.______Sometimes the most memorable stories are those of a single individual who hit a fork in the road, and took off in a surprising direction.______News and FeaturesSports____________My personal pick: \u201cThe Lobster.\u201d If I even tried to explain it, I would fail miserably \u2014 but it\u2019s definitely a memorable film. It\u2019s about love. And dictatorship. Maybe.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Phoenix Transplant Buys in Brooklyn", "Date": "2018-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe HuntAfter working for Yelp in Phoenix for nearly six years, Lindsey Olson knew she could transfer to any other city where Yelp had an office, but she only had eyes for New York.In Phoenix, \u201cI felt like a big fish in a small pond both career-wise and dating-wise,\u201d said Ms. Olson, now 28. And \u201cthere was no other place but New York for me.\u201dSo she picked up and moved last year into a spacious one-bedroom in Williamsburg that she found on StreetEasy. The rent, of course, alarmed her.Her 1,000-square-foot one-bedroom in Phoenix had come with a pool and cost her only $1,000 a month. But in Brooklyn, \u201cevery single month I would see that $2,400 come out of my bank account,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was insane.\u201d So she decided to invest in a place of her own.They met for dinner to talk real estate. Ms. Olson\u2019s budget cap was $600,000 for a one-bedroom in a co-op building. Space and storage were her priorities. \u201cMoving to a tiny New York apartment was too much of a change for me,\u201d she said.She had already downsized a lot when she moved to New York, donating 12 garbage bags of clothing and returning her childhood piano to her parents. Even so, \u201cI had way more furniture than your average New Yorker,\u201d she said.What\u2019s more, \u201ca bigger place is easier to keep clean. If you have the room to put things away, you are not going to be as cluttered.\u201dShe also wanted central heating and air conditioning, which she was used to. \u201cBeing a Phoenix transplant, I don\u2019t want to use one of those window things for air conditioning, or rely on the building to either roast me or freeze me,\u201d she said.She hunted in Brooklyn, north and west of Prospect Park, \u201cat the most competitive price point in those ideal neighborhoods,\u201d Ms. Gladysz said.Ms. Olson had no interest in browsing. She screened aggressively and visited only places that met her main criteria.\u201cI am not the pickiest person,\u201d she said. \u201cI can easily see myself living in a lot of different places.\u201d Gauging size, however, was difficult without actually setting foot inside.Because these types of apartments often sell quickly, she urged Ms. Olson to bid on places that interested her. \u201cWe see clients lose to a cash offer,\u201d she said. \u201cIt sometimes takes multiple offers to get what you want.\u201dMs. Olson, worried she would find nothing better, bid the asking price of $489,000, which was accepted. Monthly maintenance was in the low $500s.But then she reconsidered. The charming block wasn\u2019t enough to overcome the small space. \u201cMy dad said, you are not living outside on the street \u2014 you are living inside, in the apartment,\u201d Ms. Olson said.She also didn\u2019t relish downsizing even more. \u201cThe prospect of having to sort through all my stuff just to move wasn\u2019t particularly appealing,\u201d she said. She withdrew her offer.At $595,000, it was at the top of her price range. Maintenance was in the low $700s. Her offer of the asking price was declined, she suspects because she didn\u2019t have the post-closing liquidity the building required.A one-bedroom in Prospect Heights was being sublet to a couple for $2,600 a month. \u201cI knew it was this one the moment I walked in,\u201d Ms. Olson said. \u201cIt was the first one where I wasn\u2019t putting in an offer in case I didn\u2019t find something better.\u201dThe listing price, $499,000, was low. Maintenance was around $800 a month.\u201cWe thought they were trying to encourage a bidding war,\u201d Ms. Olson said. She offered $525,000, and learned there were two other offers. Ms. Gladysz learned that the seller would accept the first bid at $550,000. Ms. Olson boosted her offer immediately, and the apartment was hers.She closed in the winter. \u201cThings couldn\u2019t have gone better,\u201d she said. \u201cI had no horror stories.\u201d She was even able to break her rental lease two months early and get her security deposit back.\u201cIt was the smoothest transaction I\u2019ve ever witnessed,\u201d Ms. Gladysz said.Ms. Olson had some minor renovations done \u2014 she installed an entertainment center modeled on the one she had liked in the Brooklyn Heights apartment, added customized closets, refinished the floors, regrouted the bathroom and replaced some light fixtures. The contractor was her super\u2019s brother-in-law.Her subway commute to her Flatiron office is lengthier now: 45 minutes rather than 25. Her monthly outlay is now $400 more, but because she is an owner, it no longer feels insane.\u201cI find myself making excuses now not to go into the city,\u201d she said. \u201cThe commute is the only thing that is not ideal, but it is worth it for owning my place.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York Today: Return of the Fountain", "Date": "2018-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York TodayUpdated, 8:28 a.m.Good morning.Powdery blue skies.People lazing in the grass, gazing up at the clouds or reading books.A peaceful melody \u2014 John Lennon\u2019s \u201cImagine\u201d \u2014 coming from a tattered piano.This is not a scene from 1970s New York City; it was this week, beside the fountain in Washington Square Park.After a nearly six-month rest, the fountain has been turned on for the season. As we slung our feet over its edge yesterday, during what was one of the best days of spring weather yet, we wondered: How, exactly, does this thing work?The fountain holds almost 32,000 gallons of water between its two tanks, according to George Vellonakis, executive director of the Washington Square Park Conservancy. That water is constantly moving, recirculating between a filtration system (which keeps the fountain clean) and display pumps (with jets that can shoot the water 45 feet into the air).\u201cIt\u2019s almost like a rose petal,\u201d Mr. Vellonakis said of the shape of the water from the jets.A team of plumbers for the city\u2019s parks department turned the jets back on this week after a full day of cleaning the water system, filling the tanks and adjusting the fountain heads. Similar work goes into switching on the 50 fountains in city parks across the five boroughs.Stop by Washington Square Plaza this weekend and you\u2019ll time-travel: Sit on the stone rim of the fountain and imagine the 1860s, when the original coping was constructed; tiptoe along its inner granite steps and return to present-day New York, on a part of the structure that was revamped within the last decade.The fountain in the park today was modeled on the original from the 1840s, Mr. Vellonakis said, with some modifications made in the 1930s and 1960s. \u201cSo it\u2019s consolidating all the periods,\u201d he said.The fountain runs between 8 a.m. and 11 p.m. \u2014 at the behest of timers in the park\u2019s field house \u2014 but one of the most striking times to visit is early in the morning.\u201cBefore the jets turn on, it\u2019s a reflecting pool,\u201d Mr. Vellonakis told us. \u201cWhen you look at the reflection in the water, you can see the Arch.\u201d(That architectural magic was not, according to him, intentional.)And for those who aren\u2019t early birds? Go south of the fountain, Mr. Vellonakis said, take a photograph between the fountain\u2019s jets and the opening of the Washington Arch, and you\u2019ll catch the Empire State Building in the background.Here\u2019s what else is happening:As they say, beauty is fleeting.Yesterday\u2019s perfect weather has turned to rain \u2014 it\u2019ll continue into this evening, and possibly into Saturday.SaturdaySunday(WNYC did not buy DNAinfo but will host DNAinfo\u2019s archives.)Write on.Advertisement"}

Amid their brises and bar mitzvahs, I felt invisible. At 16, I left for the University of Michigan. At 20, I escaped to Manhattan, showering with my door double bolted, haunted by my brother\u2019s creepy pet.Dad was overjoyed when Brian started medical school, bequeathing him his study skeleton. During Brian\u2019s monthlong surgical rotation at a hospital in New York, Dad decided he should crash in a sleeping bag in my studio apartment.\u201cWaking me at dawn will screw up my life,\u201d I yelled.\u201cIsn\u2019t Brian\u2019s medical career important to you?\u201d Mom asked.It wasn\u2019t.

We double-dated with my friend Monica, a nurse who\u2019d share tales of hemorrhages and exploding gallbladders. I figured they\u2019d talk shop. When they soon wed and had kids in Michigan, I was jealous, feeling the loser in our lifelong rivalry.Eventually I found a great husband, apartment and career, delivering books, not babies.

Maybe he was favored because he\u2019d stayed in Michigan, became a healer like my father, and visited my parents every weekend. When Dad and my husband were sick, Brian offered medical advice daily, barely standing himself.My eternal resentment over my folks\u2019 belief that Brian walked on water twisted into guilt that I\u2019d neglected my family. I worried that his heavier burdens stressed his immune system. I\u2019d loved my weekly pedicure dates with his daughter Dara, an N.Y.U. freshman living around the corner from me. Now I clung to her, inventing excuses to drop by her dorm to spy my brother\u2019s face in hers.My husband and I offered to fly to Michigan to help. Brian wanted us to show his kids a fun New York week instead. Our unused bedroom was a messy makeshift office, our secret rule: no houseguests. But suddenly we were thrilled to host Ben, now a 16-year-old science wiz, and his athletic brother, Abe, 14. My husband took the boys to Brian\u2019s favorite steak house. I led them through the Strand Bookstore, retracing steps I\u2019d taken with their dad. They wanted stories of his past, willing him back to his powerful party years. They laughed at his rodent trick, New York residency crash, and our double date with their parents, who\u2019d trashed my husband and me as \u201cbleeding heart liberals.\u201dBenny teased me about sleeping late and ordering in. \u201cShe has a pantry, but it\u2019s a block away,\u201d he told his mom.\u201cAnd it delivers,\u201d added Abe.When my husband got the kids tickets for a TV taping, Brian posted an Instagram screenshot of Dara, Ben and Abe in the audience. I was happy to please my kid brother, as I should have been all along.After Benny texted his perfect ACT score, I posted it on Facebook, kvelling like my mother.\u201cNext time, come back with your dad,\u201d I texted the boys, praying they could.In July Brian returned with his kids, on Benny\u2019s college tour. In remission, my brother looked great, as if nothing had changed. Except how close I held him when he left, wishing he\u2019d stay longer, begging for more time to catch up.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Facebook Fallacy: Privacy Is Up to You", "Date": "2018-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneWas Mark Zuckerberg pulling their leg?By providing its users with greater and more transparent controls over the personal data they share and how it is used for targeted advertising, he insisted, Facebook could empower them to make their own call and decide how much privacy they were willing to put on the block.He must be kidding.As Mr. Zuckerberg surely knows, providing a greater sense of control over their personal data won\u2019t make Facebook users more cautious. It will instead encourage them to share more. This, of course, will produce more data for Facebook to mine to its own financial advantage.\u201cDisingenuous is the adjective I had in my mind,\u201d said Alessandro Acquisti, a leading expert on privacy-related behavior at Carnegie Mellon University, when I called to chat about how Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony meshed with his research.\u201cFifteen years ago it would have been legitimate to propose this argument,\u201d he added. \u201cBut it is no longer legitimate to ignore the behavioral problems and propose simply more transparency and controls.\u201dThe phenomenon even has a name: the \u201ccontrol paradox.\u201d\u201cPrivacy control settings give people more rope to hang themselves,\u201d Professor Loewenstein told me. \u201cFacebook has figured this out, so they give you incredibly granular controls.\u201dIt is time that Congress appreciates it, too.The question for members of Congress goes beyond how much Facebook and others may be exploiting our inability to rationally assess the pros and cons of sharing information \u2014 profiting from the difficulty we have measuring the immediate reward of the cute puppy video against the more distant risk of having our data sloshing around the internet for years.Those in the industry often argue that people don\u2019t really care about their privacy \u2014 that they may seem concerned when they answer surveys, but still routinely accept cookies and consent to have their data harvested in exchange for cool online experiences.Professor Acquisti thinks this is a fallacy. The cognitive hurdles to manage our privacy online are simply too steep.This is all pretty novel. The idea of online privacy didn\u2019t exist a generation ago. While we are good at handling our privacy in the offline world, lowering our voices or closing the curtains as the occasion may warrant, there are no cues online to alert us to a potential privacy invasion. It seems foolhardy to think we could determine the boundaries of data collection on our own.Even if we were to know precisely what information companies like Facebook have about us and how it will be used, which we don\u2019t, it would be hard for us to assess potential harms. Could we face higher prices online because Amazon has a precise grasp of our price sensitivities? Might our online identity discourage banks from giving us a loan? What else could happen? How does the risk stack up against the value of a targeted ad, or a friend\u2019s birthday reminder?Members of Congress have mostly let market forces prevail online, unfettered by government meddling. Privacy protection in the internet economy has relied on the belief that consumers will make rational choices. Give them a simple dial to manage their preferences \u2014 and accurate information, in a timely fashion and a big font, about what they are sharing online \u2014 and they will make the right calls to avoid discrimination, protect themselves from predatory behavior and thrive.The more that psychologists and behavioral economists study psychological biases and quirks, the clearer it seems that rational choices alone won\u2019t work. \u201cI don\u2019t think any kind of disclosure or opt in or opt out is going to protect us from our worst instincts,\u201d Professor Loewenstein argued.What to do? Professor Acquisti suggests flipping the burden of proof. The case for privacy regulation rests on consumers\u2019 proving that data collection is harmful. Why not ask the big online platforms like Facebook to prove they can\u2019t work without it? If reducing data collection imposes a cost, we could figure out who bears it \u2014 whether consumers, advertisers or Facebook\u2019s bottom line. That could help set societywide boundaries about what data to collect and what to leave alone.It would no longer be up to confused users to protect themselves.Advertisement"}

On Monday, European regulators pushed the idea forward, announcing an investigation into Apple\u2019s proposed acquisition of the song-identification app Shazam over concerns the iPhone maker would get access to data on competitors like Spotify.Ms. Vestager has said that with free services, customers pay with their data, and are not always getting a fair deal.

{"Headline": "Investment Boom From Trump\u2019s Tax Cut Has Yet to Appear", "Date": "2018-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter years of costly layoffs and plant closings, things are looking up for the heavy-machinery giant Caterpillar, which forecasts solid global sales growth and increased demand this year. Yet despite the corporate investment incentives at the center of President Trump\u2019s tax overhaul, the company\u2019s executives have no plans to supercharge investment or expansion.Caterpillar\u2019s plans for new investment remain low by historical standards. Instead, the company has started using cash to repurchase its own stock as a way to return cash to shareholders, something it hadn\u2019t done since 2015.\u201cWe feel we have the necessary bricks-and-mortar capacity that we need,\u201d Brad Halverson, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, said in a post-earnings conference call last Tuesday.Republicans sold the 2017 tax law as \u201crocket fuel\u201d for American investment and growth, saying that corporations \u2014 flush with cash from lower tax rates \u2014 would channel money back into the economy by building factories and offices and investing in equipment, which would help companies grow and provide winnings for workers.Economists say that may happen as companies readjust their spending plans over the coming months to take advantage of the new law, and they note that it is too early to tell how much the tax law will spread into the broader economy.But, so far, hard evidence of such an acceleration has yet to appear in economic data, which show more of a steady investment roll than a rapid escalation. And while there are pockets of the economy where investment is picking up \u2014 among large tech companies and in shale oil business, for example \u2014 corporate spending on buying back stock is increasing at a far faster clip, prompting a debate about whether the law is returning money to the overall economy or just rewarding a small segment of investors.Data on the gross domestic product, released Friday, showed that business investment grew at a 6.1 percent annual clip during the first three months of 2018, down from 7.2 percent during the first quarter last year. Excluding oil and gas investment, which is particularly volatile, the investment pace grew slightly over the past year.While the first-quarter investment numbers were more robust than they were in 2015 and 2016 \u2014 when a bust in oil prices curtailed a large chunk of American corporate spending \u2014 they weren\u2019t radically different from the roughly 5 percent rate of growth for business investment that has prevailed since 2010.Representative Erik Paulsen, a Minnesota Republican who chairs the Congressional Joint Economic Committee, attributed the G.D.P. growth to the tax cuts. \u201cAmericans are better off today than they were 16 months ago,\u201d he said in a statement on Friday. \u201cBusiness investment is strong, wages are growing, and disposable income is climbing thanks to tax reform and pro-growth policies.\u201dAnalysts were more cautious in drawing conclusions.\u201cEven regardless of the tax plan kicker, we would have seen a pickup in business investment,\u201d said Keith Parker, head of United States equity strategy at UBS. Capital spending, he said, \u201ctypically follows profits with a lag.\u201dScott Greenberg, a tax analyst at the conservative Tax Foundation, warned that it was \u201calways difficult to identify an economic trend from just one quarter\u2019s data.\u201dSenator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, told The Economist in remarks published last week that after the tax cuts passed, corporations \u201cbought back shares, a few gave out bonuses; there\u2019s no evidence whatsoever that the money\u2019s been massively poured back into the American worker.\u201d A spokeswoman said Monday that Mr. Rubio\u2019s criticism was that the law could have done more to help working families while also stimulating corporate investment.While overall business investment in the American economy was up 6.1 percent in the first quarter, business spending by the larger corporations included in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index \u2014 as measured by their announcements of capital expenditures so far this earnings season \u2014 is up 23.5 percent from the first quarter of 2017, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. That would be the fastest pace since 2012.Large tech companies are among some of the biggest spenders. Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, nearly tripled its first-quarter capital spending to $7.3 billion on real estate and computing capacity and data centers. Amazon increased investment by more than 40 percent to more than $3 billion as it builds out its network of fulfillment centers.But with roughly a quarter of the companies in the S.&P. 500 having reported first-quarter results, their spending on buybacks is even higher, up 43 percent from the first quarter of 2017, to $43 billion, according to data from Howard Silverblatt, an analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.Traditionally when companies have more cash than they think they can invest productively, they return it to shareholders either by paying them cash dividends or by going into the market and repurchasing shares. Those buybacks tend to push the price of a stock up, making shareholders wealthier, at least on paper.Republicans, and some Democratic economists, say this can help the economy, if those shareholders sell their stock and then use their profits to make other investments. But critics argue that buybacks disproportionately benefit the wealthy \u2014 the richest 10 percent of Americans own 84 percent of all stock \u2014 and executives who are often compensated with shares.Boeing said it had bought back $3 billion worth of its stock in the first quarter. (It expects to buy $15 billion over the next two years.) Facebook expanded its plans to buy back its shares to the tune of $9 billion. the appliance maker Whirlpool said it would sell its Brazilian refrigerator compressor business for roughly $1 billion, and then use that money to buy its own shares. The railroad operator CSX said it had bought back more than $800 million in shares in the first quarter, as part of plans to buy $5 billion in shares by the first quarter of next year.As they anticipated a windfall from tax cuts, the nation\u2019s banks increased their pace of buybacks by more than 50 percent last year, to $77.5 billion from $51 billion in 2016, according to data compiled by S&P Global Market Intelligence. The 10 largest banks, led by JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup, accounted for 70 percent of those buybacks.Republicans have highlighted the buybacks as a boost for the economy, saying they will put money in the hands of investors who will find productive and widespread ways to use it. Many Democrats say those buybacks undermine Republican claims about the tax law and prove the overhaul will reward only corporations and the wealthy.\u201cThe whole theory was to lavish corporations and the already wealthy with tax cuts, and maybe the benefits will trickle down to everyone else,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, said in a floor speech in April. \u201cWe\u2019re already seeing the balloon burst on that idea, as corporations dedicate an enormous percentage of the tax savings to stock buybacks, and only a sliver to worker compensation.\u201dA recent surge in oil and gas investment is largely a result of the recovery in oil and gas prices and easing of regulations over the last year, rather than incentives put in place by the tax overhaul. Economists believe those incentives \u2014 such as allowing companies to immediately and fully deduct the cost of capital spending in order to lower their taxes \u2014 could help stimulate investment for companies.Verizon, in its quarterly earnings report last week, said it had increased capital expenditures to $4.6 billion in the first quarter, up $1.5 billion from the same period in 2017. But the company plans to stick to its target of spending at most $17.8 billion on investment this year \u2014 a level that has not budged much for the past four years.\u201cI don\u2019t see us having a massive acceleration in capex,\u201d Verizon\u2019s chief financial officer, Matt Ellis, told analysts on its post-earnings conference call.Advertisement"}

It doesn\u2019t have to be that way.When we head out for dinner in major cities, for example, the restaurant has a letter grade from the health inspector in the window. As a society, we recognize that when consumers dine out, they may be putting their health at risk. We require, in turn, that restaurants display the simple but powerful information about their hygienic standards.There is no equivalent standard by which a consumer may judge the data security practices of a business.Unfortunately, we have become inured to these hacks. Our response to breaches has become routine: more calls for regulation, followed by congressional hearings and failed regulatory proposals. Consumers go about their lives, numbed by the frequency and the lack of consequences. Meanwhile, the hacks get worse.This cycle stems in part from a lack of information about the security practices of businesses. But forcing companies to explain how they are keeping the bad guys out would only help the bad guys.The simple grading system used by restaurant regulators can and should be a model to inform the public about the digital security of businesses that store sensitive consumer data. A letter grade is a crude measure to assess a complex issue like cybersecurity to be sure, but what the metric lacks in nuance it makes up for with brute force.A new grading system should start with the basics: Are companies on top of data security, and if hacked, do they know how to reduce the impact?There are plenty of details to be worked out about a cybersecurity grading system. But the one nonnegotiable aspect would be that, once assigned, letter grades must be made highly accessible to the public. Companies should be required to display their grades prominently at their physical locations, on their websites, on certain documents (mortgage applications, for example) and on credit card readers.A grading system would not solve every cybersecurity problem, nor prevent every breach. But our sad state of affairs \u2014 in which we are equal parts fearful, apathetic and ignorant about digital security \u2014 must change. Providing clearer information to the public is the most productive next step we can take.Craig A.

Trump was elected president, she made a common liberal refrain \u2014 \u201cIf Trump wins, I\u2019m leaving the country\u201d \u2014 reality, deciding not to return home with her daughters, Aubrey and Gabriella.

But until that utopian day arrives, \u201cWe\u2019re unplugging from the Matrix.\u201dThe Quains are not the only family that has of late dispensed with the trappings of the American dream (house, school, career) and gone nomad. Hopping from one vacation rental to the next or piling into R.V.s, they have sold or rented out their homes and unloaded most of their possessions, financing their travels with savings or work done remotely.Lainie Liberti, an administrator of the group, said it\u2019s not just the tense political climate in the United States motivating people to leave. \u201cPeople are not seeing a future,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are starting to focus on living now and focusing on their children. They are re-evaluating what is important to them.\u201dMs. Quain, who worked as much as 100 hours a week running her own company, worried about the values she was imparting to her daughters. \u201cI don\u2019t want them to grow up to be worker bees,\u201d she said. \u201cI want them to grow up to be freethinking entrepreneurs.\u201dLike many of the new expats, she is home-schooling (\u201cworldschooling\u201d is the more popular term). Her daughters are learning Spanish at a Medellin day camp and spend their spare time playing Minecraft and Roblox, video games they sometimes play online with other traveling children.

They pared down their belongings to the bare essentials, although Ms. Gillespie did carry an orange Bebe skirt and Zara top around Italy all summer because she thought it would make for a great photograph in Florence (she got her shot and unloaded the outfit). \u201cIt was totally impractical,\u201d she said.Jessica and William Swenson are financing an 11-month around-the-world trip with their three small children through a mix of savings, inheritance, a severance package and the income from renting out their four-bedroom house with a pool in Livermore, Calif.The family is traveling light, carrying only backpacks \u2014 even the children, Ezra, 8, Theo, 6, and Vesper, 5, have them \u2014 with a few changes of clothes.

The production seems fine, but what concerns me is that my friend (who is white) uses brown emoji hands when she markets the clothes on social media. The clothing itself \u2014 the cuts and prints \u2014 already seems appropriated. But her blatant use of dark-skinned emoji makes me uncomfortable. What should I say?ANONYMOUSNot a syllable! You have too deeply discounted the value of your friend\u2019s fair-trade enterprise and over-magnified your relatively trifling concerns. Your friend may be offering life-changing wages to people in a poorer region. (With expansion, she could help even more of them.) Better still, ethical supply chains eliminate child labor and other exploitation in fabric making, pattern cutting, sewing, packing and distribution.Given that all this work transpires in India \u2014 that the clothing is indeed made by Indians \u2014 her use of brown-skinned emoji hands seems reasonable enough. And if I total up your major complaints: fabrics and designs that seem \u201cappropriated\u201d (from the very region where they are made \u2014 huh?) and the dreaded brown-skinned emoji, you seem to be missing the forest for the trees.It is exquisitely easy to stand on the sidelines and nitpick at the imperfections of worthy projects. (As a jealous person, I am often likely to pile on.) But rather than quibbling with your pal over symbolic concerns, why not congratulate her on the material good she\u2019s doing? If you can\u2019t, better to keep quiet.At a dinner party at my parents\u2019 house, the new wife of their neighbor bought four boxes of Girl Scout cookies from my daughter. She had two boxes of Thin Mints on hand and wrote an i.o.u. for the other two. The woman paid $20 for all four boxes. Four days later, I received a text from her: \u201cWhere are my cookies?\u201d I apologized and said we would bring them as soon as we could. (It\u2019s an hour\u2019s drive.) Three days later, she sent another text: \u201cI want my money back. Send me a check for $20.\u201d I explained that she had already taken two boxes, so I would send her $10. She then sent a photo of the clearly doctored i.o.u., showing that we owed her four boxes. Thoughts?DAVIDHang on! I may have gotten $10 of enjoyment out of your story, thereby solving everyone\u2019s problem. (Except, clearly, those of the neighbor lady \u2014 but let\u2019s leave her troubles to a qualified professional.) My central concern is that your parents will continue living next to these neighbors long after Thin Mint season has passed. Resolve this quickly (and unfairly) for your parents\u2019 sake. Send the woman a check for $20 and bring down the curtain on possibly the best story about Girl Scout cookies ever told.I am a 36-year-old guy. For the last 10 years, my mom has invited me to Passover Seder. I never go. Religion is not my thing. But this year she didn\u2019t invite me. We had a good talk the day before the dinner, so I don\u2019t think she\u2019s upset. But I heard from a cousin that the Seder went on as usual. I can\u2019t help feeling insulted. What should I do?NATHANIELInsulted? If you weren\u2019t 36 (and I didn\u2019t object to corporal punishment), I would recommend a brisk spanking for you, Nathaniel. You haven\u2019t once, apparently, in 10 years, given much thought to your mother\u2019s hurt feelings at your declined Seder invitations. Still, you take offense the one time she forgets to invite you. Let\u2019s acknowledge the sad truth: Your mother, like many, is probably a glutton for filial punishment. You would have been as welcome this year as any.My suspicion is that the formality of inviting you slipped her mind in the rush of putting together a complex meal for many guests. (It\u2019s not as if you were going to accept the 11th invitation, correct?) But let\u2019s test my hypothesis: Mark your calendar now for next year; make a big show of telling Mom how much you want to attend; then go. Be sure to report back, O.K.?I am so mad I could spit! Last weekend, at an Easter egg hunt, a 6-year-old boy told our 4-year-old daughter that there is no Easter bunny. She was devastated. I think the boy\u2019s parents could (and should) have prevented this. Your thoughts?DADI\u2019m sorry for your loss of the Easter bunny. But short of placing your daughter in a sensory deprivation tank, she\u2019s going to hear things on the mean streets. And 6-year-olds aren\u2019t famous for discretion. When your anger subsides, let the boy\u2019s parents know what happened, so they can try to prevent its recurrence next year (and at Christmas). But I still think you can salvage this situation for another year or so with your 4-year-old: Ask her where she thinks the candy comes from \u2014 then deny, deny, deny.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: Gauge in Brisbane, Australia", "Date": "2018-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAustralia Fare9 PhotosGauge, which opened in 2015, is the work of a group of young and passionate dudes: the owner, Jerome Batten; the head chefs, Cormac Bradfield and Phil Marchant, and the front-of-house manager, Jack Brooks. The restaurant serves avocado toast and bacon sandwiches with barbecue sauce during the day, but at night the food takes a serious turn, with various options that include two-, three- and seven-course menus.The chefs are as taken with fermentation and native ingredients as any other modern Australian cooks, but here there is intent that veers toward pleasure and away from gratuitous posturing. Salted kangaroo (it has since been swapped out for beef) comes shredded atop a hunk of braised radicchio, peppering its juicy bitterness with a slightly gamy tang. Fermented turnip contrasts beautifully with a gorgeously rosy smoked duck breast, giving a hint of funk to the otherwise straightforward but perfectly executed dish.The chefs play a lot with the line between sweet and savory, which is a game that usually devolves into throwing fruit at perfectly good dinner items. But at Gauge they take the opposite tack, turning chicken liver parfait into an early dessert course by adding a flurry of dehydrated raspberry, or making a dense, cakelike bread out of black garlic and inviting you to smother it in burned vanilla brown butter. It is one of the most savory desserts I\u2019ve ever had, and it is utterly enthralling.It would be easy to suppose that talent is the main differentiator between Gauge and lackluster modern Australian restaurants, but that is too simple an explanation. The model for this kind of cooking is built on newness and creativity \u2014 Australia is playing with an entirely new palette of flavors in the form of native ingredients (new to non-Indigenous cooks, that is). As with molecular gastronomy, there is much potential for the pleasure of the customer to be given a back seat to the ego of the cook.Gauge\u2019s dedication to pleasure is front and center on the plate, but it also comes through beyond the cooking. The small space takes on a broody vibe at night, but it retains the casual feel of a cafe. There is no pretense of formality here, yet the service is remarkable. Mr. Brooks will remember a customer who stopped in briefly weeks earlier; he will crouch beside your table, look you in the eye, and guide you toward a meal that suits your needs. If I have ever had service this conscientious before in Australia, it was at Attica.It would be wonderful if more restaurants were inspired by this aspect of Mr. Shewry\u2019s legacy \u2014 the art of delighting people, not as a means to gain admirers, but as a deep meditation on the nature of hospitality. The folks at Gauge understand this far better than most, and I hope they are rewarded in kind. When it comes to building a whole new style of dining, the most important ingredients are philosophical as well as edible.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Protesting Artists Step Off the Streets and Into the Gallery", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cArtists are asking some very fundamental, very interesting questions,\u201d Martina Weinhart, the curator of the exhibition, said in an interview. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to answer them \u2014 we want to raise them.\u201dThe question posed in the first room of the Schirn show is an unnerving one in an era characterized by rising authoritarianism, populism and a flood of \u201cfake news\u201d: Are we entering a post-democratic age? A large installation by the Belgian artist Guillaume Bijl recreates voting booths from Austria, Azerbaijan, China, Finland, Japan and Morocco. In a museum context, staged with dramatic lighting against dark walls, the booths look like cheap relics from a bygone chapter of history.History was the starting point for \u201cPower to the People\u201d \u2014 the slogan, after all, harks back to the 1960s and \u201970s. The original idea for the show was for an exhibition to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the 1968 youth movement, Ms. Weinhart said. \u201cBut then I quickly took a step further, because the times we are living in now are just as interesting,\u201d she added. \u201cPerhaps there is even more upheaval now than there was then. There is an incredible energy that is setting something in motion, and that is reflected in art.\u201dIn the past, Ms. Holten\u2019s art focused primarily on environmental subjects. \u201cI have kept away from economics and politics because that is not my personal interest,\u201d she said in a telephone interview. But since Mr. Trump\u2019s election campaign, that has changed, she said.\u201cSome days I was at six rallies,\u201d she added. \u201cIt has never been like this before.\u201dMs. Holten\u2019s series of 10 pencil portraits, titled \u201cShe Persisted\u201d (2017), features women who faced down adversity, including Anita Hill, Emily Dickinson, Chelsea Manning and Harriet Tubman. \u201cMy work has never included anything human before,\u201d Ms. Holten says. \u201cThe portraits were a form of meditation, a way of taking a break from making signs and going out on the street. But it was also a reminder that there are people who have dealt with and are dealing with obstacles. There is hope.\u201d\u201cA mere 70 likes are enough to allow a computer analysis to produce a personality profile,\u201d the catalog says. In a parody of social media superficiality, Mr. Flood created thousands of small-format paintings bearing the word \u201cLIKE,\u201d and visitors to the exhibition are invited to place them in front of artworks that appeal to them.Three Turkish artists featured at the Schirn remind us that political resistance can be dangerous in many parts of the world. Ahmet Ogut\u2019s \u201cThe Swinging Doors\u201d features two riot shields attached to either side of an entrance. They can be pushed open from either direction, like a classic saloon door. Leaning against the shields to pass through the doors gives the visitor a sense of what it is like to confront the police as a defenseless demonstrator. Returning in the other direction is to feel the fear of riot police officers facing mass protests with just a truncheon and a sheet of thick plastic as protection.Nasan Tur\u2019s video installation \u201cPreparation No. 1\u201d projects six films of a man energetically but meticulously getting ready for something, perhaps a demonstration. In furtive close-up shots, he packs a heavy chain, tests a megaphone and marks a map in the semidarkness of a room with lowered blinds, as though working undercover.\u201cWith the uprising, there was an immediate polarization,\u201d Mr. Altindere said in an interview. \u201cIt started with the politicization of the young generation and it quickly turned into a more violent environment. I wanted to show innocence and oppression, the fragility of everyday life in that situation.\u201dMr. Altindere publishes a contemporary art magazine in Istanbul, and his work, which has featured at the Documenta art exhibition in Kassel, Germany, and at the Berlin Biennale, focuses mainly on political themes.\u201cCensorship is highly possible\u201d in Turkey today, he said. \u201cBut it is important that artists should not start exercising self-censorship. In this show, you can see that even in the most oppressed countries, artists manage to express their opinions.\u201dAt one point in Mr. Altindere\u2019s video, laser beams shooting from the ballerinas\u2019 eyes appear to paralyze the police. It\u2019s a hint at the power of art to confront authority and its ability to force change.\u201cIt\u2019s really hard,\u201d Ms. Holten said. \u201c We just have to keep doing what we do.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Strong and Stressed Black Woman", "Date": "2018-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDr. Burnett-Zeigler is a clinical psychologist.Ms. T., 75, came to see me for therapy after a man stole her purse. He was in a car and lured her over under the guise of asking directions. Then he grabbed her bag and stepped on the accelerator. She was dragged halfway down the block before she let go. When I saw her a month later, she was still in physical pain from her injuries and emotional pain from having endured a traumatic experience.Ms. T. had raised three successful children as a single mother, while enjoying a prosperous career as the head of a social services agency. She had gone through difficult times before, but she\u2019d always been able to overcome them. Now she was embarrassed that she hadn\u2019t been able to \u201cget over\u201d what had happened. She didn\u2019t want to show her adult children her \u201cweakness\u201d and lean on them for support. She believed in therapy, in theory, but was ashamed to be the one who needed it. She no longer saw herself as the \u201cstrong black woman\u201d she had once been.This Strong Black Woman is a cultural icon, born of black women\u2019s resilience in the face of systemic oppression that has dismantled families and made economic stability a formidable challenge. She is self-sufficient and self-sacrificing. She is a provider, caretaker and homemaker. And often, she is suffering.I provide therapy to people from all socio-economic and racial backgrounds. I am the only black female clinical psychologist on the faculty of the department of psychiatry at Northwestern University, and black women often come to me in secret, feeling alone and embarrassed. They come despite friends and family telling them to \u201cjust pray.\u201d They come because they are \u201cdesperate\u201d and \u201ccan\u2019t take it anymore.\u201d I often get requests for informal consultation via email, LinkedIn, even Facebook. They\u2019re skeptical about mental health treatment. They don\u2019t want therapy, just to talk, and maybe get some advice.Even in the confidential safe space of therapy, they cling to their public image of strength. They don\u2019t realize that there is a secret community of Strong Black Women who share their distress.Many \u2014 myself included \u2014 wear the badge of Strong Black Woman with honor. We are proud of our tenaciousness and never let the world see us crack. But we are suffering silently with the mental and physical health consequences of carrying the burden of family, work and community responsibilities, compounded by personal experiences of trauma and loss, all in an environment of pervasive racial and gender discrimination.And yet fewer than 50 percent of black adults with mental health needs receive treatment. Shame is a key barrier. Black women also often prefer a black mental health care provider, and there are too few black social workers, psychologists and psychiatrists. In low-income communities, mental health services are scarce and waiting lists are long. And finally, more than 16 percent of black women are uninsured, and many can\u2019t afford treatment.Meanwhile, the psychological wear and tear of being a Strong Black Woman takes a toll on the mind and body.Traditionally, black women have garnered strength from God. The church provides a place for fellowship, social support and spiritual guidance. However, the black church has not always condoned secular mental health care and churchgoers may feel that their faith is called into question if they seek extra help.In lieu of therapy, some people cope with their distress through eating unhealthy foods and overeating, smoking, drinking alcohol and spending excessive time in bed or watching television. While these behaviors may provide temporary relief, stress and depression can emerge in the form of irritability, anger, physical pain and chronic illness.Ms. T. reminded me of my grandmother, who moved to Chicago from Montgomery, Ala., as a single mother to escape an abusive relationship with an alcoholic husband. She lived in the Jane Addams housing projects, worked as a seamstress by day and attended Herzl Junior College at night. She worked her way off public assistance, earned bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees, and saved enough money to pay for my Ivy League education. She, too, had once been robbed and came home with the straps of her purse as evidence of the struggle. My grandmother was the quintessential Strong Black Woman.But what about her struggles, her sadness and fear? I\u2019m sure she experienced them. But we never talked about it.Many of us have been conditioned to believe that we must be strong to survive. But we cannot hold up the strength of black women without acknowledging the stress that comes with it. Otherwise, we set unreasonable expectations for what black women should be able to endure.We must let go of the singular narrative of what it means to be a Strong Black Woman. Black women have harnessed their strength out of the necessity to support themselves and their families when no one else would \u2014 and that should be applauded. But there is also strength in vulnerability, comfort in seeing that you are not alone and power in knowing when to ask for help.Inger E. Burnett-Zeigler is an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Another Pence Runs for Congress, His Business Record Raises Questions", "Date": "2018-04-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCOLUMBUS, Ind. \u2014 When you have the best known name in your congressional district and your younger brother is a heartbeat away from the presidency, it is difficult to run a stealth campaign. But Greg Pence is doing a pretty good job of it.Mr. Pence has skipped candidate debates and declined to give interviews or release a public schedule, instead posting after-the-fact campaign snapshots on Twitter or Facebook, often smiling, wearing a red fleece vest with his name on it. His first television ad featured President Trump and did not mention his brother, Vice President Mike Pence.His inspiration for running? \u201cI looked in the mirror and said, \u2018If not me, who?\u2019\u201d he told The Columbus Republic in February in the only extensive interview he has granted.Hardball it is not. Legacy politics it is.Hardly the first candidate to run on a famous name, Mr. Pence, 61, extols two central credentials in his House bid: his service in the Marines and his success as a business executive. But an examination of his record in business shows decidedly mixed results. He was the president of a convenience store chain \u2014 making key strategic decisions \u2014 that filed for bankruptcy protection and was assessed penalties of $8.4 million by the State of Indiana for environmental damage, caused primarily by leaking underground storage tanks.A local bank, where he also served on the board of directors, was forced to sue him to recover $3.8 million in debts that he had personally guaranteed, only to have to settle for pennies on the dollar.But when he needed a second chance, one seemed to be waiting for him.Mr. Pence\u2019s race in a safely Republican district where he has lived most of his life \u2014 stretching from the far eastern suburbs of Indianapolis to Muncie in the north and the Kentucky line to the south \u2014 shows the durable power in politics of a famous name and insider connections even in an outsider era.The older Mr. Pence has the same white hair, genial bearing and deeply conservative politics of his brother, and his campaign is tethered to the Trump administration. He pledges to help advance Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d agenda in Congress. The vice president held a fund-raiser for him at the Trump International Hotel in Washington recently, and Donald Trump Jr. will headline another later this month in New York.The race is Mr. Pence\u2019s first for public office, and he has largely avoided attention and scrutiny. But that strategy will be tested as the Republican primary on May 8 approaches. He faces at least one serious challenger, Jonathan Lamb, who has put more than $800,000 of his own money into the race and calls himself a serial entrepreneur. He said Mr. Pence\u2019s run smacked of nepotism.\u201cNo amount of money in the world can buy the name ID that Pence has,\u201d Mr. Lamb said. \u201cBut with name ID, you step on toes. People don\u2019t want to see this dynasty, like the Kennedys and Bushes.\u201dMr. Pence has never displayed the political ambitions of his brother, who was elected in 2000 to the House seat that he now seeks, then Indiana\u2019s governor in 2012, before joining Mr. Trump\u2019s ticket in 2016. The elder Mr. Pence\u2019s campaign says he is \u201cready to serve again,\u201d a reference to his enlistment in the Marines in 1979 after he graduated from Loyola University in Chicago.He also highlights his business experience, which he said showcased how he cared for his employees, putting their interests ahead of his own. His most prominent position was when he served as president of Kiel Brothers Oil Company from 1998 until 2004.Kiel Brothers was a growing family business in Columbus when its founder, Carl Kiel, asked Edward Pence, the father of Greg and Mike, to join the company in 1965. They sold fuel to service stations, then eventually went into the convenience store business, which grew to more than 200 outlets, primarily in Indiana and Kentucky, mostly under the name Tobacco Road.\u201cWant a smoke, a Coke or a tank of gas? Kiel Brothers Co. is there to serve you,\u201d a company description in Hoover\u2019s said. The company prospered, building a corporate headquarters in Columbus, where it held a place of esteem.When Mr. Pence died in 1988, the Kiel family turned to Greg Pence to join the business. Mr. Pence steadily took on more responsibility until he became president in 1998. With that came other obligations to the company, and he and a younger member of the Kiel family, Theodore, each signed personal guarantees to the local Home Federal Bank to obtain loans to continue to expand.A year later, Mr. Pence was named to Home Federal\u2019s board of directors. As he was becoming a more prominent member of the Columbus business community, Mike was a rising power in the Republican Party.Mr. Pence signed another guarantee in 2001, records show, promising to repay any outstanding debts from his personal assets if the need arose.Three years later, it did \u2014 the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, facing $100 million in claims from creditors.At the next regular board meeting of the bank, with the officials seated around a wooden conference table, Mr. Pence told them about the bankruptcy and said he would not be able to honor his personal guarantee to repay company loans. He acknowledged the obvious conflict of interest, board members said, and resigned from the board.He had resigned abruptly from the company as well, leaving the restructuring work to the chief financial officer, David E. Roll, who, bank officials said, worked tirelessly, sometimes until midnight, trying to keep the company afloat. Attempts to reach Mr. Roll were not successful.That is not how former bank and company officials said Mr. Pence acted when it mattered most. While businesses fail all the time, said one former bank official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters, such failures reveal the character of those involved, and Mr. Pence had \u201cbailed.\u201dAnother bank board member, Harold Force, who runs a construction company in Columbus, had no criticism of Mr. Pence, but acknowledged the consequences of the failure of a homegrown company that he described as a \u201cpillar\u201d in the town of 46,000 in southern Indiana.\u201cWhen a company like that comes to an end, there are probably a lot of loyal people who are let down in some ways, heartbroken in some cases,\u201d Mr. Force said, adding, \u201cI think everybody regrets that.\u201dJay Jaffe, a lawyer in Indianapolis who represented the company in the bankruptcy proceedings, defended Mr. Pence\u2019s actions. \u201cI would not say he ran away because he wanted to run from a bad situation,\u201d Mr. Jaffe said. \u201cHe stuck around for a long time to try to make the situation work.\u201dKyle Robertson, the spokesman for Mr. Pence\u2019s campaign, said in a statement that \u201cprior to his departure, Mr. Pence negotiated and secured a KERP (Key Employee Retention Plan) that would help employees going through the eventual transition. Mr. Pence voluntarily forfeited his KERP when he resigned.\u201dThe account of Mr. Pence\u2019s actions and the bankruptcy is based on interviews with a half- dozen former bank officials and others with ties to the company, along with a review of hundreds of pages of court records, including in the bankruptcy case. One of the creditors in the case was the Indiana Department of Environmental Management, which said that the company had caused $8.4 million in damage to the state.In a separate legal action, Mr. Pence also refused several attempts from the bank to collect money based on his personal guarantee, forcing the institution to go to court.Pence campaign officials defended the candidate\u2019s actions.\u201cMr. Pence chose to resign in order to pursue other opportunities,\u201d Mr. Robertson said in response to written questions. \u201cEveryone knows the oil and gas industry changed rapidly in the 1990s and early 2000s, and many small, independent companies like Kiel Brothers were not able to survive because of the national consolidation.\u201dRecords from the Superior Court in Indianapolis show that Home Federal Bank won a $3.8 million civil judgment against Mr. Pence to satisfy the personal guarantees. But former bank officials said he settled the matter for a small fraction of that amount. In contrast, Theodore Kiel lost his primary residence as part of his effort to satisfy his guarantee.Mr. Robertson declined to discuss those actions except to say that they were unrelated to bankruptcy court action against the company. Those \u201cpersonal guaranty liens\u201d were \u201creleased after being satisfied,\u201d Mr. Robertson said.The Indiana Department of Environmental Management claim against the company was withdrawn after insurance payments and remediation efforts. Mr. Robertson said that Mr. Pence played no role in settling the action brought by the state.Six months after Mr. Pence resigned from the bankrupt company, the state\u2019s governor at the time, Mitch Daniels, seemed to offer him a lifeline, appointing him deputy commissioner of the same state environmental agency that had sued his company. But Mr. Pence stayed in the job at the agency, known as IDEM, for only two and a half months.\u201cGovernor-elect Mitch Daniels asked Mr. Pence to help with transition work at IDEM,\u201d Mr. Robertson said, later adding, \u201cThere was never a discussion how long Mr. Pence would stay.\u201dMr. Pence and his wife now own two antique malls in southern Indiana, valued at between $5 million and $25 million, according to financial disclosure statements he filed with the House in January.Mr. Lamb, his opponent in the primary, said he could draw a sharp contrast between his business success and Mr. Pence\u2019s record. \u201cI\u2019m an entrepreneur and have had success,\u201d Mr. Lamb said. \u201cHe was handed a very large corporation that he ran into the ground.\u201dWhile Mr. Pence\u2019s business record may become one focus of the campaign, his hearty endorsement of the Trump agenda could provide another.Columbus is a rare Rust Belt town that continues to have a thriving manufacturing economy, with an unemployment rate of 2.7 percent. Its downtown is bustling with small businesses, and its modern architecture has drawn international acclaim.A Brookings Institution study last year ranked Columbus as the No. 1 metro area measured by exports as a share of local gross domestic product \u2014 50.6 percent. As such, it is heavily exposed to the kind of wild trade gyrations that Mr. Trump\u2019s policies have generated.The district also has a large agricultural presence that could be hurt by them as well. \u201cWe can\u2019t be getting into a tariff war over soybeans,\u201d Mr. Lamb said. \u201cThat\u2019s why people are looking for someone who can be their voice.\u201dWhen asked about the Brookings study, Mr. Robertson replied, \u201cMr. Pence supports the Trump administration in its defense of American companies who have been subjected to decades of illicit trade practices and unfair policies.\u201dKitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Mass-Shooting Survivor Network", "Date": "2018-04-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cTalking to others has helped me realize that I\u2019m not a crazy person.\u201d\u201cSo, you were shot too?\u201d she said. Two months earlier, Mr. Korellis had been in the front row of his oceanography class when a gunman burst into the lecture hall with a shotgun. Mr. Korellis ducked under his desk, waited for a pause between blasts and bolted for the door. He was hit in the back of the head and arm with shotgun pellets but managed to stagger out into the safety of the cold Midwestern winter. When he got to the hospital, he was bleeding and missing a shoe. Ms. Haas could relate. One year before, she had been in French class when a gunman had walked in and killed the teacher. Ms. Haas huddled under her desk as her classmates were shot, and two bullets grazed her head. The gunman left to terrorize other classrooms but returned several times to kill more students, and then himself. Eleven students died in that small room. The conversation between Mr. Korellis and Ms. Haas, which took place a decade ago, was the result of a specific kind of outreach: survivors reaching out to other survivors. More and more, those who have lived through mass shootings \u2014 which were defined by the Obama administration in 2013 as a shooting with three or more deaths \u2014 are connecting with new survivors to create support groups between communities.\u201cWe didn\u2019t know who else to talk to,\u201d said Mr. Korellis, 32, now a geographic information systems project manager for Walgreens. \u201cBut hearing about a different shooting from their perspective helped. It was like, \u2018Tell me how the next year is going to be, what am I going to be dealing with?\u2019\u201d Within the next few weeks, Mr. Korellis and nine other injured classmates traveled to Blacksburg, Va., for a memorial service that marked a year since the Virginia Tech shooting. On the morning of the service, students from both schools met, paired up and traded tips for dealing with the frustrations and worries they had in the aftermath of their separate traumas. The network of gun-violence support groups across the country is loose and sprawling, with ad hoc outfits that form and disband based on need. After a mass shooting there is an initial media blitz in which survivors are overwhelmed with attention. But after the TV camera crews pack up and leave, the affected communities are left to pick up the pieces. That\u2019s when the emotional support groups reach out. One of the largest is the Rebels Project, a nonprofit founded by survivors of the 1999 Columbine high school shooting. It was created in 2012 after the movie theater shooting in Aurora, Colo., which took place about 20 miles from Columbine. Today the group has over 770 members from roughly 40 different communities of people who have been affected by mass shootings.The Rebels Project began its outreach to the Aurora survivors through local TV news interviews, holding monthly meetings in a local church that offered its space for free. They had few attendees at first, but that wasn\u2019t unexpected. \u201cIn the immediate aftermath, you just want to be left alone,\u201d Ms. Martin said. \u201cThe media is everywhere, bothering everyone they can for a story.\u201d But the Rebels Project kept holding meetings, and attendance grew as word-of-mouth knowledge of the group spread. Whenever new survivors join the Rebels Project, Ms. Martin asks them about the specifics of the shooting they experienced \u2014 where were they, if they were injured, and what else was going on in their lives. She uses this information to coordinate between disparate members who have had similar experiences. \u201cWe have three members that were injured in shootings while they were pregnant, and all three of their babies survived,\u201d Ms. Martin said. \u201cKnowing that, I was able to connect them with each other.\u201d She also emphasized the importance of having survivors with different types of experiences talk with each other: for example, having someone who was injured connect with a family member of someone who died. That is because part of the process is accepting that there is no good way to define a so-called survivor of a mass shooting. The label can encompass those who were physically injured in attacks; those in the rooms or spaces where the shootings took place; those who were roiled by the intense confusion of police responses; and the families and loved ones of all those involved. The only people who can\u2019t be counted as survivors are the dead.\u201cOne of our core beliefs is that, while experiences are different, no one is worse than the other,\u201d Ms. Martin said. \u201cA big part of survivors\u2019 guilt is thinking you don\u2019t have the right to feel bad or traumatized because you weren\u2019t right there.\u201dMembers of support groups bounce specific questions off each other, and not just expected ones about handling the media, dealing with medical bills and insurance, or talking with employers about PTSD. One common query among survivors: How should one stay calm during the country\u2019s most triggering holiday? Stressors can be unexpected, and it helps to have sounding boards. \u201cI\u2019m not dissing Ikea, but it drives me nuts because I have no idea how to get out of there,\u201d said Zach Cartaya, a Columbine survivor and chief financial officer of the Rebels Project. \u201cTalking to others has helped me realize that I\u2019m not a crazy person for going into a small conference room and feeling anxious and uptight. Knowing I\u2019m not alone, and not insane, and it\u2019s O.K. to seek help and talk about this, it makes a really big difference.\u201d In a recent Facebook post, one member of a survivor support group simply asked if anyone else was having trouble sleeping. There were dozens of responses. \u201cWe know we don\u2019t have to be polite or overly protective of each other\u2019s feelings,\u201d Ms. Anderson said. Everyone has \u201cbeen through the same things we have.\u201dIn February, she and Ms. Martin went to DeKalb, Ill., to meet Mr. Korellis and other survivors of the 2008 Northern Illinois University shooting. It was the 10th anniversary, which meant that this memorial would be particularly stressful, with a heavy media footprint. To get a calming breath before the cameras rolled, the survivors and their supporters hunkered down in a conference room.They ate brownies and cookies shaped like dog bones (a reference to the Huskie, the college mascot) and spent a few quiet moments catching up on each other\u2019s lives. On display were five wreaths, one for each of those who had died 10 years before.Before long, Mr. Korellis began getting alerts on his phone, and he noticed other survivors checking notifications. Whatever they were reading was shocking; some reacted with tears. Finally, one member announced to the group that there were reports of another shooting, this one at a high school in Parkland, Fla. The N.I.U. survivors put their phones away and went outside. In front of a fleet of news cameras, they placed wreaths outside of Cole Hall and spoke words of remembrance. At 3:06 p.m., the minute when the shooting on their campus began a decade before, they observed a moment of silence. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Failed by Facebook, We\u2019ll Return to the Scene of the Crime. We Always Do.", "Date": "2018-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookThe reality is that when it comes to privacy, the trade-off has already been made: We decided long ago to give away our personal information in exchange for free content and the ability to interact seamlessly with others.The evidence is all too clear: After just about every big privacy hack over the past decade, people quickly returned to the scene of the crime, using the same store or online site that had been compromised. Remember the massive breaches at Home Depot, Target and Yahoo? The number of consumers who never went back is minuscule.Perhaps Facebook\u2019s latest privacy scandal \u2014 combined with its role in the spread of false news and in foreign interference in United States elections \u2014 will be a turning point in consumer behavior. But if history is any guide, we won\u2019t do anything differently, unless regulators take steps to save us from ourselves.For all the head-scratching and criticism over Facebook\u2019s slow response to various breaches and privacy fiascos, it wasn\u2019t completely irrational. The incentive for companies to go to great lengths to protect our data \u2014 with the exception of banks and financial firms \u2014 just isn\u2019t there.None of this is to suggest that Facebook handled these situations properly; it clearly did not. And over the past week, Mr. Zuckerberg has repeatedly said as much to just about anyone who would listen.The problem is that Mr. Zuckerberg has been apologizing for years for all sorts of breaches of trust with his \u201ccommunity.\u201d And guess what? After each mea culpa, the Facebook community has grown.Perhaps the biggest obstacle to behavioral change \u2014 besides our insatiable desire for all things \u201cfree\u201d \u2014 is that it is unusual for most consumers to truly feel the effects of a massive data breach. For most people, it\u2019s a theoretical problem \u2014 the way some people view climate change or the growing national debt.The people who are most directly affected by privacy breaches are those who have had money stolen or whose email was exposed. But in huge data breaches, those people are a statistical anomaly.But most people don\u2019t feel it.Over the weekend, I asked users on Twitter whether they had deleted their Facebook accounts or reduced their activity on it. Nearly 700 users replied. For every one saying they were spurning Facebook, there were more saying they were continuing to use it.\u201cUnderstand nothing in social media is truly private and recognize that in most areas of life someone is trying to sell you something or affect your behavior,\u201d one user wrote. Another wrote: \u201cPeople love the service they get from Facebook but forget nothing is free. We pay for using it by providing our demographic and personal information so that they can sell ads to businesses to better understand and target us. We benefit by getting more relevant ads sent to us.\u201dAnd while a number of people said they were distancing themselves from Facebook, they cited not only privacy concerns but said the service had become less relevant to them.\u201cPeople have really gotten comfortable not only sharing more information \u2014 and different kinds \u2014 but more openly with more people,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cAnd that social norm is just something that\u2019s evolved over time. And we view it as our role in the system to constantly be innovating and updating what our system is, to reflect what the current social norms are.\u201dUnless our social norms change, Facebook and other sites probably won\u2019t, either.An earlier version of this article misstated Google\u2019s policy on scanning the content of its Gmail service as a way of directing advertising to specific users.

{"Headline": "Teachers in Oklahoma and Kentucky Walk Out: \u2018It Really Is a Wildfire\u2019", "Date": "2018-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThousands of teachers in Oklahoma and Kentucky walked off the job Monday morning, shutting down school districts as they protested cuts in pay, benefits and school funding in a movement that has spread rapidly since igniting in West Virginia this year.In Oklahoma City, protesting teachers ringed the Capitol, chanting, \u201cNo funding, no future!\u201d Katrina Ruff, a local teacher, carried a sign that read, \u201cThanks to West Virginia.\u201d\u201cThey gave us the guts to stand up for ourselves,\u201d she said.The walkouts and rallies in Republican-dominated states, mainly organized by ordinary teachers on Facebook, have caught lawmakers and sometimes the teachers\u2019 own labor unions flat-footed. And they are occurring in states and districts with important midterm races in November, suggesting that thousands of teachers, with their pent-up rage over years of pay freezes and budget cuts, are set to become a powerful political force this fall.The next red state to join the protest movement could be Arizona, where there is an open Senate seat and where thousands of teachers gathered in Phoenix last week to demand a 20 percent pay raise and more funding for schools.The growing fervor suggests that labor activism has taken on a new, grass-roots form.\u201cOur unions have been weakened so much that a lot of teachers don\u2019t have faith\u201d in them, said Noah Karvelis, an elementary school music teacher in Tolleson, Ariz., outside Phoenix, and leader of the movement calling itself #RedforEd, after the red T-shirts protesting teachers are wearing across the country.Mr. Karvelis said that younger teachers had been primed for activism by their anger over the election of President Trump, his appointment of Betsy DeVos as education secretary and even their own students\u2019 participation in anti-gun protests after the school shooting in Parkland, Fla.\u201cTeachers for a long time have had a martyr mentality,\u201d Mr. Karvelis said. \u201cThis is new.\u201dStriking West Virginia teachers declared victory last month after winning a 5 percent raise, but Oklahoma educators are holding out for more.Last week, the Legislature in Oklahoma City voted to provide teachers with an average raise of $6,000 per year, or roughly a 16 percent raise, depending on experience. Gov. Mary Fallin, a Republican, signed the package into law.Teachers said it was not enough. They have asked for a $10,000 raise, as well as additional funding for schools and raises for support staff like bus drivers and custodians.About 200 of the state\u2019s 500 school districts shut down on Monday as teachers walked out, defying calls from some parents and administrators for them to be grateful for what they had already received from the state.To pay for the raise, politicians from both parties agreed to increase production taxes on oil and gas, the state\u2019s most prized industry, and institute new taxes on tobacco and motor fuel. It was the first new revenue bill to become law in Oklahoma in 28 years, bucking decades of tax-cut orthodoxy.In Kentucky, teachers earn an average salary of $52,000, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, compared with $45,000 in Oklahoma. But teachers there, thousands of whom are picketing the Capitol during their spring break, are protesting a pension reform bill that abruptly passed the State House and Senate last week. If Gov. Matt Bevin signs it into law, it will phase out defined-benefit pensions for teachers and replace them with hybrid retirement plans that combine features of a traditional pension with features of the 401(k) accounts used in the private sector. Teachers in the state are not eligible for Social Security benefits.\u201cWhat I\u2019m seeing in Louisville is teachers are a lot more politically engaged than they were in 2015 or 2016,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really is a wildfire.\u201dIn Arizona, where the average teacher salary is $47,000, teachers are agitating for more generous pay and more money for schools after watching the state slash funds to public education for years.\u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to escalate our actions,\u201d Mr. Karvelis said. \u201cWhether that ultimately ends in a strike? That\u2019s certainly a possibility. We just want to win.\u201dMr. Karvelis, 23, said teachers would not walk out of class unless they were able to win support from parents and community members across the state, including in rural areas. But he said the movement would be influential regardless of whether it shuts down schools.\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a lot of teachers at the ballot box who I don\u2019t think would normally go in a midterm year,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I were a legislator right now, I\u2019d be honestly sweating bullets.\u201dWith Republican legislators and governors bearing the brunt of the protesters\u2019 fury, the Democratic Party is trying to capitalize on the moment. The Democratic National Committee plans to register voters at teacher rallies, and hopes to harness the movement\u2019s populism.The teacher walkouts are \u201ca real rejection of the Republican agenda that doesn\u2019t favor working-class people,\u201d said Sabrina Singh, the committee\u2019s deputy communications director. \u201cRepublicans aren\u2019t on the side of teachers. The Democrats are.\u201dThat type of rhetoric is a sea change from the Obama years, when many Democrats angered teachers by talking less about core issues of schools funding than about expanding the number of charter schools, or using student test scores to evaluate teachers and remove ineffective ones from the classroom.\u201cSchool reformers kind of overshot the mark, and we\u2019re now in a pendulum swing where teachers increasingly look like good guys,\u201d said Frederick Hess, director of education policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank.Republicans, too, he said, should consider pitching themselves as teacher-friendly candidates, perhaps by tying teacher pay raises to efforts to expand school choice through private school vouchers or charter schools.Lily Eskelsen Garc\u00eda, president of the National Education Association, the nation\u2019s largest teachers\u2019 union, called the movement an \u201ceducation spring.\u201d\u201cThis is the civics lesson of our time,\u201d she said. \u201cThe politicians on both sides of the aisle are rubbing the sleep out of their eyes.\u201dBen Fenwick contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

But anyone wanting to assess where the stellar foreign growth came from \u2013 and whether it can continue \u2014 would have little company data with which to work.Twitter on Monday did not break down international revenues by region. It did say that Japan, its second largest source of revenue, brought in $117 million, a 61 percent increase. Facebook, in contrast, releases revenue and user numbers for four regions. That Twitter offers limited international data is perhaps not that surprising, given that the company does not release a tally for daily active users, a number Facebook provides. (Twitter does release a growth number for daily users but only provides an actual total for monthly active users.)Twitter\u2019s revenue trends may at some point prompt it to divulge more. Foreign advertising revenue accounted for half its sales in the first quarter, compared with 40 percent in the same period a year ago.Ned Segal, Twitter\u2019s chief financial officer, on Wednesday said the strength of international revenue could mean that they account for more than half of the total. In the first quarter, foreign ad revenue surged 51 percent, compared with the year-earlier period. In the United States, the increase was just 1 percent.Mr. Segal did mention some first-quarter \u201chighlights\u201d for the international operations. A good ad sales performance and audience growth powered Japan\u2019s results, he said, adding that ads outside of China for Chinese exporters were also a source of strength. Britain, Brazil and the Middle East were also bright spots, Mr. Segal said.Twitter\u2019s stock slid on Wednesday despite the good numbers. With a little more clarity, investors may be willing to give them more weight.- Peter EavisComcast has formally bid nearly $31 billion for the European broadcaster. Sky has withdrawn its recommendation of Fox\u2019s year-and-a-half-old bid for full control.What\u2019s next?Keep these dates in mind\u2022 On May 1, Britain\u2019s competition regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority, is expected to offer its recommendation on whether Fox\u2019s bid should allowed to go through.\u2022 By June 13 or so, Britain\u2019s culture secretary, Matthew Hancock, is expected to make a final decision on Fox\u2019s offer.In the meantime, Comcast is working to obtain regulatory approvals for its own bid. Given the American telecom giant\u2019s relatively small presence in Britain, that shouldn\u2019t be too much of an issue.\u2014 Michael de la MercedPutting together a nearly $31 billion takeover requires a fair amount of help. Here\u2019s who\u2019s working for Comcast and Sky \u2014 and Fox, which may come back with a higher bid.Comcast\u2022 Robey Warshaw, the small boutique investment bank run by \u201cthe two Simons.\u201d Both Mr. Robey and Mr. Warshaw are on the deal.\u2022 Evercore Partners, led by co-founder Roger Altman and senior deal maker Eduardo Mestre\u2022 Bank of America Merrill Lynch (which is working as corporate brokers, a peculiarly British function that is something like relationship banking and market surveillance), led by Adrian Mee, a global co-head of M.&A., and Tim Waddell, a vice chairman of corporate and investment banking for Europe and a veteran corporate broker.\u2022 Wells Fargo, led by Stephen Locke, a managing director.Sky\u2022 Morgan Stanley (financial adviser and corporate broker), led by Simon Smith, head of investment banking in Europe; Anthony Zammit, a managing director; and Ben Grindley of corporate broking.\u2022 PJT Partners, led by partners Simon Lyons and Scott Matlock.\u2022 Barclays (as financial adviser and corporate broker), led by Mark Astaire, chairman of corporate broking and Richard Taylor, co-head of investment banking.Fox\u2022 Centerview Partners, led by co-founder and longtime Fox adviser Blair Effron and partners David Cohen and James Hartop\u2022 Goldman Sachs, led by investment banking co-head and longtime Fox adviser John Waldron; Mark Sorrell, head of M.&A. for EMEA (and a son of Martin Sorrell); and managing directors Mike Smith and Owain Evans\u2022 JPMorgan Chase, led by Jennifer Nason, global chairwoman of T.M.T.; Hugo Baring, co-head of T.M.T. banking for EMEA; Marco Caggiano, a managing director; and Dwayne Lysaght, head of U.K. M.&A.How the offers stack up:\u2022 Comcast: \u00a312.50 a share, and pledges to maintain Sky News\u2019s independence\u2022 Fox: \u00a310.75 a share for the 61 percent of Sky it doesn\u2019t yet own. (Disney, which had already agreed to buy the bulk of Fox in a separate deal, has also offered to buy Sky News to satisfy editorial independence concerns.)Financial companies are on the brink of having one of their top demands granted: an end to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s public database of complaints about their products and services.What\u2019s in the databaseWhy finance institutions want it shut downThey say the database can be misleading because the agency publishes a record of all the complaints that it receives, without vetting them. The companies also argue that they already have channels for resolving customer disputes.Why consumer groups say that could be problematicConsumer groups argue that taking the database offline would neuter one of its core purposes: pushing companies to take complaints more seriously.More than 185,000 complaints to the bureau have been resolved with some form of compensation or relief, often with financial institutions changing their practices or making customers whole.The social media company became the latest firm to easily beat expectations, only to have its shares tumble.If those stock moves sound familiar, that\u2019s because similar moves happened at 3M and Caterpillar on Tuesday. Despite meeting expectations, 3M tumbled after it lowered the high end of its outlook. Caterpillar, meanwhile, raised its guidance for the year, but comments on its conference call that the first quarter would be the \u201chigh-water mark\u201d for earnings per share sent the stock sliding.Why such big moves? It\u2019s worth pointing back to what DealBook\u2019s Peter Eavis wrote Tuesday:\u201cDespite all the bullish talk about earnings and the economy, stocks looked vulnerable going into the first-quarter earnings season. Analysts are expecting earnings for companies in the S.&P. 500 to grow 25 percent this year, an unusually large increase. At the 2018 forecast, the S.&P. 500 looks temperately valued at 17 times earnings. But looking back, stocks appear expensive, at 21 times the S.&P. 500\u2019s earnings for 2017. This large gap between future and historical valuations creates a chasm that stocks can fall into if profits disappoint. If companies, like 3M did on Tuesday, provide underwhelming earnings outlooks, investors will stop believing that stocks are cheap, based on 2018 earnings.\u201dIn the case of Twitter, the stock is up about 30 percent this year and more than 75 percent since late October. A rally like that leaves little room to disappoint.Wall Street executives are eagerly awaiting a relaxation of the supplemental leverage rule, which governs how much their firms can borrow. The Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of Currency are for it; the F.D.I.C. and Lael Brainard, an Obama administration appointee at the Fed, are opposed.Why relax the rule? It\u2019s making it too hard for banks to do business. \u201cThe best analogy is that it\u2019s like having the same speed limit for every road in the country,\u201d Greg Baer of the Clearing House Association told Peter.Why keep it? The rule provides adequate protection in case there\u2019s another downturn, and banks have been doing fine otherwise. \u201cU.S. bank lending has been healthy over recent years and profits are strong,\u201d Ms. Brainerd said in a speech last week.\u2022 There are more Republican senators and Democratic governors named John than there are women in either group.\u2022 There are almost as many C.E.O.s named John in the Fortune 500 as female C.E.O.s in that group.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pope Francis Puts Caring for Migrants and Opposing Abortion on Equal Footing", "Date": "2018-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVATICAN CITY \u2014 Caring for migrants and the poor is as holy a pursuit as opposing abortion, Pope Francis declared in a major document issued by the Vatican on Monday morning.Pushing back against conservative critics within the church who argue that the 81-year-old pope\u2019s focus on social issues has led him to lose sight of the true doctrine, Pope Francis again cast himself, and the mission of the Roman Catholic Church, in a more progressive light.The pope\u2019s vision of holiness explicitly highlights migrants, whose plight he has sought to elevate to global attention perhaps more than any other issue.\u201cWe often hear it said that, with respect to relativism and the flaws of our present world, the situation of migrants, for example, is a lesser issue,\u201d he said.\u201cSome Catholics consider it a secondary issue compared to the \u2018grave\u2019 bioethical questions.\u201d\u201cThat a politician looking for votes might say such a thing is understandable, but not a Christian,\u201d he continued, adding that welcoming the stranger at the door was fundamental to the faith. \u201cThis is not a notion invented by some Pope, or a momentary fad.\u201dThe pope\u2019s 103-page document \u2014 an apostolic exhortation titled \u201cGaudete et Exsultate,\u201d or \u201cRejoice and Be Glad\u201d \u2014 is less authoritative than a papal encyclical, but is nevertheless an important teaching pronouncement. At its outset, Francis makes clear that it is not meant \u201cto be a treatise on holiness\u201d but to \u201cre-propose the call to holiness in a practical way for our own time.\u201dThe pope is reminding his church to \u201cexpand our view,\u201d said Archbishop Angelo De Donatis, the vicar general of Rome.Throughout the document, Francis urges followers to be less consumed with showy demonstrations of faith and piousness than with patiently and lovingly raising children, working hard to support families and representing what he called \u201cthe middle class of holiness.\u201dBut a majority of the document is a rumination on what constitutes an effective and true practice of holiness.While he says \u201c the silence of prolonged prayer\u201d is critical, Francis adds that holiness at times requires the faithful to be loud and active, and says it \u201cis not healthy\u201d to seek prayer while disdaining service.He cautions against a cold reason untethered from spirituality, and warns against an overemphasis on the power of human will alone, \u201cas if it were something pure, perfect, all-powerful, to which grace is then added.\u201dIn doing so, he suggests that prosperity and power gospels fail to realize that not everyone can do everything. Holiness requires humility, he says, and a lack of \u201cacknowledgment of our limitations prevents grace from working more effectively within us.\u201dIn a section of the document titled \u201cSigns of Holiness in Today\u2019s World,\u201d the pope explicitly laments a modern culture that includes \u201cthe self-content bred by consumerism; individualism; and all those forms of ersatz spirituality \u2014 having nothing to do with God \u2014 that dominate the current religious marketplace.\u201dThe pope, like many others, is also worried that social networks like Facebook feed into the hedonism and consumerism that \u201ccan prove our downfall\u201d and are, in short, a waste of time.\u201cWhen we allow ourselves to be caught up in superficial information, instant communication and virtual reality, we can waste precious time,\u201d he says, adding that \u201call of us, but especially the young, are immersed in a culture of zapping.\u201dAt a news conference introducing the exhortation Monday afternoon, the Vatican presented a promotional video in which a mediocre and unholy life was illustrated by a young man playing video games, while a holy life was living joyfully with one\u2019s family. But the video, like Francis, most emphasized the need to care for the poor and to welcome migrants.To highlight that point, the Vatican offered interviews with Mohammad Jawad Haidari, a Muslim refugee from Afghanistan. Asked what he thought about the pope explicitly putting the care for migrants on the same footing as opposition to abortion, he said, \u201cIt was a surprise, and a revolutionary text with respect of the vision I had before of the Christian world.\u201dThat possibility, which critics have called heretical and schismatic, has been a rallying cry for a small but committed group of traditionalists.When asked if the document on holiness was a response to those critics, the panelists at the Vatican news conference on Monday, including Archbishop De Donatis, looked uncomfortably at one other for several seconds before giving a roundabout answer.But some of the passages seemed intended as a rebuke to the canon lawyers and archconservative cardinals leading the opposition to Pope Francis.In the document, the pope excoriates Christians taking the path of \u201can obsession with the law, an absorption with social and political advantages, a punctilious concern for the Church\u2019s liturgy, doctrine and prestige.\u201d They should instead be passionate about \u201cseeking out the lost,\u201d he writes.He is also withering in his criticism of the hostile tenor that often reverberates throughout the conservative Catholic blogosphere.\u201cChristians, too, can be caught up in networks of verbal violence through the internet,\u201d Francis said, citing vicious examples of defamation in some Catholic outlets where \u201cpeople look to compensate for their own discontent by lashing out at others.\u201d He adds that in upholding some commandments, they ignore the forbidding of bearing false witness and vilification. \u201cHere we see how the unguarded tongue, set on fire by hell, sets all things ablaze,\u201d he says.But in \u201cRejoice and Be Glad,\u201d Francis indicated that he had no doubt the devil is real.\u201cWe should not think of the devil as a myth, a representation, a symbol, a figure of speech or an idea,\u201d he writes. \u201cThis mistake would lead us to let down our guard.\u201dIn the devil\u2019s arsenal is the spreading of gossip, which the pope disdains, but he also expresses an intolerance for the intolerant and close-minded.In another poke at conservative critics inside the Vatican hierarchy, he bemoans those who would prefer a self-righteous and orthodox minority to the tough work of spreading peace by embracing \u201ceven those who are a bit odd, troublesome or difficult.\u201d\u201cSowing peace all around us,\u201d he writes. \u201cThat is holiness.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What the Rape and Murder of a Child Reveals About Modi\u2019s India", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMs. Saran is a journalist based in New Delhi.The child was abducted in January and imprisoned for a week in a temple, where she was drugged, starved and raped repeatedly before being murdered. Her body was thrown into the forest. At the time the crime passed without much comment beyond the local press.The 8-year-old girl belonged to the Muslim Bakarwal people, who move with their sheep and horses between high mountain pastures in the summer and the plains of the Hindu-dominated Jammu region in winter. There is tension with local Hindus over the right to graze animals on the land. According to the police, the motive of the premeditated crime was to terrorize the Bakarwals and dislodge them from the area. The bereaved parents were not even allowed to bury the child in the village. They have since fled the area.Over the past week, horrified Indians have protested vigorously on social media and in some cities. The disgust and the fury at the complicity of politicians, and the federal government\u2019s silence, grew into a thunderous chorus demanding that the prime minister speak up and fire the ministers backing the Hindu Ekta Manch.Belatedly reacting to popular outrage, Mr. Modi finally said: \u201cIncidents being discussed since past two days cannot be part of a civilized society. As a country, as a society, we all are ashamed of it.\u201d He promised justice. His vague statement delicately alluded to another case in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, where a lawmaker from Mr. Modi\u2019s party is accused of rape. Mr. Modi stayed away from his party\u2019s involvement in both cases.Yet instead of uniting India in horror, the incident has deepened religious, political and ethical divides. It has also made clear that there is no automatic political cost to crime or falsehood if it furthers the hegemonic political narrative. The politicians involved were sacked only after a huge public outcry. Government ministers, officials, right-leaning media and right-wing supporters have been perfectly sanguine about using the dead child to polarize society with whataboutery, fake news and wild conspiracy theories.The sense of national crisis today is because Indians feel a rising urgency to either counter this ethical collapse or to capitalize on it in the run-up to the next election.Mr. Modi came to power in 2014, and four years into his term, religious and cultural bigotry stands mainstreamed in Indian society.Many who voted for Mr. Modi\u2019s economic promises are disappointed by his failure to deliver, and impatient with his deliberate silences around sectarian and sexual violence and hate speech by his party colleagues and ministers. The systematic destruction of democratic institutions is hard to ignore.The B.J.P. and its Hindu nationalist affiliates are bent on refashioning India into a country that is increasingly hostile to secular, democratic, pluralist and minority Indians. The rape and murder of the little nomad girl has thus taken on a larger meaning, reflecting the struggle for the fundamental character of India.This battle for the soul and future of India is likely to get more violent in the lead-up to the national elections, scheduled for next year. Mr. Modi\u2019s B.J.P. is braced for a desperate, ugly fight and has a long history of using religious polarization to electoral advantage.It will be up to the citizens of India to fight for a tolerant, pluralist country and stop the degeneration of its civic and political life.Advertisement"}

It has high ceilings, hardwood floors stained a warm brown, large south-facing windows and a wall in the kitchen that you would bet your ticket to heaven was exposed brick.Four years ago, the couple decided it was time to put down roots in New York City and buy an apartment. They scrutinized hundreds, frequently at Sunday open houses just before Ms. Levy had to shove off to perform in the \u201cLes Miserables\u201d matinee. She wanted to buy any and every place she saw. Her husband\u2019s attitude could be summed up thus: Let it go.\u201cIf it was a hellhole or it was amazing, I\u2019d say, \u2018This is great. We can make this work. We can do this and this and this,\u2019\u201d Ms. Levy recalled. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a big interior design nerd, and I\u2019d always be envisioning how we could move the walls.\u201d And David would say, \u2018This is the worst apartment I have ever seen.\u2019\u201dShe continued: \u201cI think I was just so eager to own a piece of New York City that I was willing to leap, which is my way. And he was like, \u2018Let\u2019s take a breath, and keep it steady here, and wait for our place.\u2019 And, of course, he was right.\u201dWhen they first saw it, \u201cour place,\u201d an estate sale, had but a single bedroom and bath. Subsequently, walls were relocated or eliminated to carve out a nursery, a second full bath and an office that doubles as guest quarters. Pocket doors were installed to create private nooks and to maximize floor space; the ceilings were raised three feet, and a long wall in the kitchen acquired a veneer of thin brick. (It fools everybody.)\u201cWe designed this apartment within an inch of its life,\u201d Ms. Levy said. But really in the best possible way: It is well thought out without appearing studied or precious. And because Ms. Levy is a bit of a neat freak, there is a place for everything and everything in its place.The neutral-toned furniture \u2014 some new, some picked up at flea markets or found through a moms\u2019 group on Facebook \u2014 is a pleasing backdrop for art and knickknacks like the vintage ice bucket and the brass urn that holds a plant.\u201cIt\u2019s all about the mix,\u201d Ms. Levy said. \u201cIf you have too many of any one thing it starts to feel either too dated or too modern and cold.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the first adult piece of art we bought together,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a child, I would go to galleries every weekend with my parents, who collected a lot of abstracts and a lot of sculptures. I had to sit quietly, and I wouldn\u2019t be able to touch anything, and I hated it. And, of course, as I\u2019ve grown up, art is the thing I love most.\u201dAs much as anything, the apartment is a celebration of family: the family Ms. Levy has created with Mr. Reiser and their young son, and her family in Canada.The master bedroom and master bath are illuminated by chandeliers that belonged to Ms. Levy\u2019s maternal grandmother, Freda. It was Freda, too, who furnished the lamp on a side table in the living room. The mirror in the kitchen came Ms. Levy\u2019s way courtesy of her paternal grandparents. The gallery wall in the living room displays the wood sign that hung outside her doctor father\u2019s office for more than 40 years, as well as a plot plan of the street Ms. Levy grew up on, an artifact she found in her parents\u2019 basement.But she has yet another legacy from the previous generation. \u201cBesides being art collectors, my parents love interior design. And when I was little, most Sundays I would come downstairs and find them rearranging the furniture,\u201d Ms. Levy said.\u201cI fully inherited that hobby,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m sort of famous for moving massive pieces of furniture around the apartment by myself, much to David\u2019s surprise and worry.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Found Footage Offers a New Glimpse at 1906 San Francisco Earthquake", "Date": "2018-04-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Saturday night, a small crowd filled a 120-seat theater in Fremont, Calif., to watch a movie unlike any other on the big screen, one that offers a fresh look at a tragic chapter in American history.\u201cIt\u2019s quite a bookend to the earlier film where you see the activity down Market Street, only in a different light because everything is devastated,\u201d Mr. Kiehn said. Less than a decade ago, his research revealed that the earlier Miles Brothers movie was recorded not in 1905, as was long believed, but just four days before the earthquake. The new footage, which he painstakingly digitized, was recorded just a few weeks later, he said.For the first five or so minutes, the newly found film takes viewers on a trip similar to the one in the earlier Miles Brothers production, Mr. Kiehn said. Unlike that movie, the camera in the new one occasionally pans from side to side to reveal the rubble lining Market Street, San Francisco\u2019s main artery. Soon, the landmark Ferry Building comes into view, its scaffolding offering a clue to the date. A photograph marked April 22 shows no such support structure, while one dated May 3 shows more scaffolding than appears in the film, suggesting the recording was made sometime in between, Mr. Kiehn said.The movie then cuts to a different view of the Ferry Building site, panning back to Market Street, where wagons are lined up for passage across the bay.\u201cYou can even see a military guard with a bayoneted rifle standing post to control the crowds and there\u2019s dozens and dozens of these wagons just waiting there,\u201d Mr. Kiehn said. \u201cYou can see all the devastation in the background.\u201dThe latter portion of the film shows buildings being demolished with explosives. In a final scene, a crowd gathered to watch one such blast with the occasional bystander turning to look at the camera, which was still a novelty in 1906.That final stretch of the footage is tinted red, a kind of silent film special effect, Mr. Kiehn said.\u201cIn the early days, they would tint the film to kind of give a little color to the image,\u201d he said. \u201cTraditionally, red would be fire and night scenes would be tinted blue and they would have other colors to indicate some kind of mood.\u201dThe film\u2019s recent journey from obscurity began about two years ago.Around that time, David F. Silver, a Bay Area dealer of antique and vintage cameras, met a man selling the reel, which was in particularly good condition and featured scenes that Mr. Silver didn\u2019t recognize. After an inspection \u2014 and a brief panic when the seller held the highly flammable nitrate film perilously close to a light \u2014 Mr. Silver decided to buy it.\u201cIt\u2019s the kind of treasure that I look for,\u201d he said.One of the members of the group, Nick Wright, reached out to help and eventually connected Mr. Silver with his brother, Jason Wright, a dealer of antique photographs based in England, who agreed to buy the reel from Mr. Silver. \u201cI was kind of secretly hoping it was going to be this long-lost Miles Brothers film, so I took a chance on it,\u201d Mr. Wright said.If it was what he had hoped, he wanted to preserve the film, Mr. Wright said. So he contacted Mr. Kiehn, who was featured on a 2010 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d segment about the pre-earthquake film. The recovered film was shown publicly for the first time this weekend in three sold-out shows at the Edison Theater, a century-old venue restored by the Niles Essanay Silent Film Museum, where Mr. Kiehn is a film historian. The movie will be played again in early June at the 1,400-seat Castro Theater during the San Francisco Silent Film Festival.Mr. Wright said he plans to post at least some of the video online and will keep an archival copy for himself and share another with the Library of Congress. He wasn\u2019t sure what he\u2019ll do with reel itself, he said.\u201cIt\u2019s been digitized, it\u2019s been put down on safety film,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I feel good that it\u2019s been done. It\u2019s been saved now.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA new study on surveillance finds that Republicans tend to feel pleased about tracking, both online and in real life, while Democrats often feel bad about it.Are you creeped out by the idea of a company checking a job candidate\u2019s credit history before deciding whether to hire her or him? Your answer could be tied to your political views.A new poll on surveillance from the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania found that Americans are deeply divided over tracking, both online and in real life. And political affiliation is a main predictor of Americans\u2019 emotional reactions to surveillance, the researchers found.Among people who identified themselves as Democrats, for instance, 62 percent said they felt \u201ccreeped out\u201d by the idea of companies checking job applicants\u2019 credit history before hiring them. By contrast, half of independents and just 29 percent of Republicans felt creeped out. \u201cIt\u2019s just a chasm,\u201d he added.The survey was based on phone interviews conducted in January and February with a nationally representative sample of 1,499 adults in the United States. The margin of error was plus or minus 2.9 percentage points. While Republicans and Democrats are divided about surveillance, there was one situation that elicited strikingly similar responses among participants, no matter their political party: Facebook showing users ads based on interests they expressed on their Facebook accounts.Although the Annenberg School study was conducted before the data-mining scandal erupted, nearly half of respondents over all said they felt angry over the Facebook ad-targeting example. Among them, 48 percent of Democrats felt mad about Facebook tracking, along with 47 percent of independents and 44 percent of Republicans. The survey asked participants about different hypothetical situations, like the one involving Facebook. Another one involved landlords subscribing to databases that profiled the past behavior of potential tenants. And one involved government agencies tracking where people who received food stamps bought their groceries. In the survey, Republicans often said they felt \u201cunbothered\u201d by surveillance practices and even \u201cpleased.\u201dOne question, for instance, described police officers using surveillance techniques to closely monitor \u201cpeople who they think have characteristics that are common among criminals.\u201d Among survey respondents, 62 percent of Republicans said they felt \u201chappy\u201d about the police example, compared with 45 percent of independents and just 31 percent of Democrats.The Annenberg study is not the first survey on Americans\u2019 responses to snooping.Professor Turow said the survey responses in his new study suggested that many Republicans lacked empathy regarding surveillance practices that could disproportionately harm people of lower income. \u201cDemocrats seem more interested or more likely to say, \u2018It may not be directly affecting me, I feel safe, but I still feel angry about it,\u2019\u201d Professor Turow said. In the Annenberg survey, participants were not told that certain hypothetical situations in the study could have discriminatory results.\u201cIt would be interesting to see a version of this that compared responses if respondents knew the impact of the scenarios,\u201d said Ms. Madden, the Data & Society researcher.There was one trend that emerged among the survey respondents, regardless of their politics.In every situation in the study, the majority of survey participants said they felt the tracking practices were expected, not surprising. In other words, in a culture where consumers readily share their locations with Siri, their grocery lists with Alexa and their fingerprints with a federal program to speed them through airport security checks, many Americans are growing accustomed to the idea of increased monitoring.That normalization of surveillance has privacy experts warning that pervasive tracking could escalate in ways citizens might not like.\u201cOver time, political and commercial forces can manipulate you and others to allow for even the most vulnerable people in society to have their data used in ways that may negatively affect them,\u201d Professor Turow said. \u201cThese apartment house scenarios, these grocery scenarios, these police scenarios have consequences.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mark Zuckerberg Testifies on Facebook Before Skeptical Lawmakers", "Date": "2018-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Outside the Capitol Building on Tuesday sat dozens of cardboard cutouts depicting Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, wearing a characteristic T-shirt emblazoned with the message \u201cFix Fakebook.\u201dInside, clad in a navy suit and bright blue tie, Mr. Zuckerberg appeared before the Senate Commerce and Judiciary committees as he really is: the billionaire leader of one of the world\u2019s most powerful commercial and civic enterprises.Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s appearance, his first before Congress, turned into something of a pointed gripe session, with both Democratic and Republican senators attacking Facebook for failing to protect users\u2019 data and stop Russian election interference, and raising questions about whether Facebook should be more heavily regulated. Of specific interest were the revelations that sensitive data of as many as 87 million Facebook users were harvested without explicit permission by a political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, which was connected to the Trump campaign.Mr. Zuckerberg, 33, appeared confident and answered questions directly, and his performance helped bolster Facebook\u2019s stock, which ended the day up 4.5 percent. It was the first of two marathon hearings; the second will be before the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday.He was forced to admit mistakes and take responsibility for his company\u2019s actions \u2014 as have the many tobacco, pharmaceutical and bank executives who have been summoned to Washington.\u201cI think it\u2019s pretty much impossible, I believe, to start a company in your dorm room and then grow it to be at the scale that we\u2019re at now without making some mistakes,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.Senator Richard Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, zeroed in on the central issue of the hearing, asking Mr. Zuckerberg whether he would be comfortable sharing aloud the name of the hotel where he stayed on Monday night, or whether he would be comfortable sharing the names of the people he has messaged this week.\u201cNo. I would probably not choose to do that publicly here,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.\u201cI think that may be what this is all about,\u201d Mr. Durbin said. \u201cYour right to privacy. The limits of your right to privacy. And how much you give away in modern America in the name of, quote, connecting people around the world.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg was the only technology chief in the room, but he was often treated as a stand-in for the whole industry. Facebook has come under intense criticism for the Cambridge Analytica leak and for its initial response, which set off a #DeleteFacebook campaign online and sent the stock plunging more than 15 percent.But the hearing was about more than Facebook; it exposed a critical turning point as the power, sophistication and potential exploitation of technology outpaces what users, regulators or even its creators expected or seem prepared to handle.The moment is creating a showdown between two national power centers \u2014 Washington and Silicon Valley \u2014 as they jockey in a technology-centric world. Although Washington has long served as a check on the power of Wall Street and other profitable industries, lawmakers have tended to act as cheerleaders for technology companies rather than watchdogs. Light regulation enabled a culture of freewheeling innovation, and the beloved products that Silicon Valley companies created made them politically convenient allies.Today, five of the eight largest companies in the world are West Coast technology companies. Only a single East Coast institution, JPMorgan Chase, cracks the top 10. And lawmakers on both sides of the aisle suggested that Facebook and other companies may not be able to police themselves.\u201cHave you gotten too big?\u201d Senator Dan Sullivan, Republican of Alaska, asked Mr. Zuckerberg, before suggesting that Facebook might need to be reined in to protect it from itself.Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, pressed Mr. Zuckerberg on whether Facebook had become a monopoly, asking why Congress \u201cshould let you self-regulate?\u201dMr. Zuckerberg said he welcomed some form of regulation, as long as it was the \u201cright regulation.\u201d He also expressed support for the Honest Ads Act, a bill in Congress that would require more disclosures from online political advertisers.His answers did not mollify lawmakers, including Mr. Graham, who said in a statement after the hearing that \u201ccontinued self-regulation is not the right answer when it comes to dealing with the abuses we have seen on Facebook.\u201dSenator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said in an interview that he was \u201cunsatisfied\u201d and that it was clear Facebook could not and would not fully regulate itself and that Congress needed to provide a solution.\u201cThe old saying: There ought to be a law,\u201d he said. \u201cThere has to be a law. Unless there\u2019s a law, their business model is going to continue to maximize profit over privacy.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg\u2019s appearance before more than 40 senators came after weeks of preparation, and it appeared to pay off, as he seemed calm, deferential and prepared. Mr. Zuckerberg offered humor about the company\u2019s onetime mantra: \u201cmove fast and break things.\u201d (It has since been edited to \u201cmove fast with stable infrastructure.\u201d) He insisted on continuing questions when offered a break, eliciting smiles and laughter from staff sitting behind him. However, when Mr. Zuckerberg did take a break, he left behind his notes, which were quickly photographed and contained talking points for various topics including \u201cDefend Facebook,\u201d \u201cDisturbing Content\u201d and \u201cElection integrity (Russia).\u201dHis performance won accolades on Wall Street. \u201cThis is a different Mark Zuckerberg than the Street was fearing,\u201d said Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer and head of technology research for GBH Insights in New York. \u201cIt\u2019s a defining 48 hours that will determine the future of Facebook, and so far he has passed with flying colors, and the Street is relieved.\u201dBut Mr. Zuckerberg acknowledged that his idealistic view of humanity, and those of his fellow executives, had exposed Facebook\u2019s roughly 2.2 billion users to danger. Among them: Facebook failed to detect and stop Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, an oversight that Mr. Zuckerberg called \u201cone of my greatest regrets.\u201dSenator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, called Facebook and its role in society \u201cextraordinary\u201d and began the hearing by explaining that Facebook and Mr. Zuckerberg were being singled out because of the company\u2019s power.Mr. Thune said the Cambridge Analytica situation underscored how Facebook could be used for nefarious reasons, saying it appeared \u201cto be the result of people exploiting the tools you created to manipulate users\u2019 information.\u201dIn an indication that he may support legislation for internet companies, Mr. Thune said, \u201cIn the past, many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have been willing to defer to tech companies\u2019 efforts to regulate themselves. But this may be changing.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg was careful when pressed on how he defined the company, wary of opening it up to new legal liability. He said that Facebook was responsible for the content on the social network, but he argued that it was a technology company, rather than a publisher.\u201cI agree that we\u2019re responsible for the content,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t produce the content.\u201dThe primary thing that Facebook does, he added, is employ engineers and build products.Some of the hardest questions came from Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California, whose name is being floated for a presidential bid. Ms. Harris pressed Mr. Zuckerberg on whether Facebook executives made a decision not to inform users about the Cambridge Analytica data leak when they learned in 2015 that data was sold by a researcher to the political consulting firm. The question was crucial to the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s investigation of Facebook\u2019s violation of a 2011 agreement to protect users\u2019 privacy. If the company withheld information, which violates its agreement, the company could face record fines.Mr. Zuckerberg did not admit that the company explicitly decided to withhold that information from consumers, but he said the company had made a mistake in not informing users.There were glimmers of a partisan divide during the hearing. Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, asked about Facebook\u2019s handling of conservative media, including content related to Glenn Beck and a Fox News personality; Democrats questioned Mr. Zuckerberg on how quickly Facebook responded to Russian meddling in the election.But the dominant theme of the day was uncertainty about how to deal with Facebook, a complex, multifaceted giant that even technologists have struggled to define. Lawmakers \u2014 many of whom grew up in an era without social media \u2014 labored at times to understand the fine-grain nuances of Facebook\u2019s business model, such as the difference between selling user data to advertisers and allowing advertisers to target ads to an aggregated slice of Facebook users. At one point, Mr. Zuckerberg was forced to shoot down a conspiracy theory floated by Gary Peters, Democrat of Michigan, that Facebook listens to users through their microphones in order to serve them ads.Mr. Zuckerberg, who spent weeks being coached for the hearing by a team of outside experts, remained cool and collected while fielding question after question.But the lawmakers\u2019 technical sophistication was mostly irrelevant \u2014 by the end of the session, the warning had been sent: In order to avoid a much harsher regulatory glare that could include major punitive measures, Facebook needs to stop apologizing, get its act together, and show that it is capable of changing.\u201cThis episode has clearly hurt us,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cWe have to do a lot of work about building trust back.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the message written on cardboard cutouts of Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, outside the Capitol on Tuesday. The message was \u201cFix Fakebook,\u201d not \u201cFix Facebook.\u201dNicholas Fandos, Alan Rappeport and Matthew Rosenberg contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Big Is Beautiful\u2019 Questions the Virtues of Small Business", "Date": "2018-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBook EntryThe empirical evidence amassed by Mr. Atkinson and Mr. Lind in opposition to the \u201ccult of small business in America\u201d is impressive. The authors conclude that \u201con virtually every meaningful indicator, including wages, productivity, environmental protection, exporting, innovation, employment diversity and tax compliance, large firms as a group significantly outperform small firms.\u201dEven the conventional wisdom that \u201csmall businesses are the engine of job growth in our economy\u201d comes under attack. \u201cBig Is Beautiful\u201d points to flawed research based on \u201cgross\u201d rather than \u201cnet\u201d job creation as the \u201corigin of the small business job creation myth.\u201d Because the vast majority of small businesses fail, taking into account the resulting job losses reveals a modest contribution to overall job creation. One particularly striking research article cited notes that \u201cit takes 43 start-ups to end up with just one company that employs anyone other than the founder after 10 years.\u201d The average number employed by that surviving start-up: just nine.This skeptical attitude toward the inherent superiority of small firms to large is supported by the fact that their share of overall employment tends to go up only when the economy is weak rather than strong. This suggests not that small firms are the engine of job growth, but that job seekers are willing to accept their systematically lower wages, benefits and diversity only when forced to in times of high unemployment.The national consensus in favor of all things small is reflected in a dizzying array of local and national laws that provide either affirmative benefits or valuable exemptions. Both authors are inveterate policy wonks, having spent much of their careers at a succession of public and private think tanks, and devote half the book to discussing the history of these rules and justifying alternatives to our current regulatory approach to antitrust, tax and dozens of other topics.Possibly inspired by the wide popularity of \u201cnet neutrality,\u201d \u201cBig Is Beautiful\u201d defends many of its often radical policy proposals under the benign-sounding principle of \u201csize neutrality.\u201d Although these arguments are often interesting, they are weakened by caricaturing the positions of those who take a different view and the overuse of policy jargon. For instance, they name their own philosophy \u201cnational developmentalism\u201d and describe opponents of their approach to antitrust enforcement as \u201cneo-Brandeisians\u201d who, if they \u201cget their way,\u201d will \u201cbreak up most large companies into medium-sized ones.\u201dRegardless of the validity of their specific policy prescriptions, the data synthesized by Mr. Atkinson and Mr. Lind does call into question the wisdom of prevailing attitudes toward small business relative to large not just in law but in society. A look at recent trends in where graduates of top M.B.A. programs go to work reflects this increasing antipathy toward large firms.Given that Stanford is in the heart of Silicon Valley, it should be neither surprising nor worrisome that today almost as many graduates decide to start their own company as those who go into consulting (20 percent).If Mr. Atkinson and Mr. Lind are correct that big businesses are the prime driver of productivity while also maintaining a better record on social issues, it is at a minimum worth pausing before rejoicing over the rejection of large corporations by the most promising M.B.A.s. Large corporations themselves, as the recent Facebook scandals attest, bear much of the blame for the increasing disfavor in which they are held. But even if some of the contempt has been earned, \u201cBig Is Beautiful\u201d succeeds in highlighting why it is in our collective interest to find ways to help the biggest corporations earn back our trust, and attract more of our best graduates.Jonathan A.

{"Headline": "Hawaiian Food Is Flourishing \u2026 in Utah?", "Date": "2018-04-23", "News": "The restaurant chain Mo\u2019 Bettahs has found success appealing to Utah\u2019s dominant religious group: Mormons, who have long had ties to Polynesia.Supported byIt\u2019s nearly enough to make you forget you\u2019re in a dry, landlocked city where the sights include snow-capped mountains and the occasional blizzard.That this restaurant exists at all is improbable. The brothers Kalani and Kimo Mack, who hail from Kaneohe on the coast of Oahu, opened the Hawaiian-style fast-casual place in 2008, in the depths of the Great Recession, with no experience, no business plan and only the money they had saved from driving buses in Honolulu.A decade later, Mo\u2019 Bettahs has six perennially packed locations in Utah, an aggressive plan to expand to other states and a loyal customer base that dotes on the restaurant\u2019s specialties: crisp, golden-brown chicken katsu dipped in ketchup-laced Mo\u2019 Bettahs sauce, and steak glossed with a sweet, almost maltlike homemade teriyaki.A large measure of that success, though, derives not from any particular dish, but from the very specific appeal the restaurant holds for Utah\u2019s dominant religious group: Mormons.That Pacific region was one of the church\u2019s first overseas destinations, in the 1840s, for its missions \u2014 an essential Mormon tradition in which young members spend one and a half to two years in a single place to try converting locals to the faith. As a result, Mormons number in the hundreds of thousands in Polynesia, which has six Mormon temples and several church-sponsored schools.The Mack brothers, Kimo, 48, and Kalani, 49 \u2014 relaxed, slow-talking and clad in Hawaiian shirts and flip-flops regardless of the weather \u2014 never considered any of this when they moved to Salt Lake City and set out to open Mo\u2019 Bettahs, even though both are lifelong members of the Mormon Church.Growing up in Hawaii \u2014 their mother was Hawaiian-Korean, and their father was Caucasian \u2014 they were beach bums who barely graduated from high school, and eventually became city bus drivers. Kalani moved to Salt Lake City in 1998 because his wife\u2019s family was from there, as was his father; Kimo followed in 2008 to escape the high cost of living in Honolulu.\u201cThe Mormon thing wasn\u2019t really a draw,\u201d Kalani said. \u201cI thought that everyone in Utah kind of takes for granted the fact that everyone\u2019s Mormon. It doesn\u2019t feel as special as it does in Hawaii.\u201dWith no other job prospects, the brothers brainstormed and wrote down 10 ideas for businesses they could start together \u2014 including a tent company, and creating kiosks for loading songs onto an iPod. They settled on option No. 3: opening a restaurant.They had no clue about the logistics of running a restaurant, but no doubt that it would center on their favorite food, the Hawaiian plate lunch \u2014 a multicultural meal of meat, rice and macaroni salad, a staple of 19th-century sugar-plantation workers who came to Hawaii from countries like Japan and China. The name, Mo\u2019 Bettahs, is Hawaiian Pidgin, a Creole language from the plantations.But when Mo\u2019 Bettahs opened in the summer of 2008, with the economic downturn in full swing, the brothers were making only $500 a day in sales. \u201cI remember so vividly telling Kimo, \u2018How long do you think we can go until we have to pull the plug and cut our losses?\u2019\u201d Kalani said.Around the same time, Facebook was gaining traction, and Kalani\u2019s 15-year-old daughter, Malia, had just created a profile for herself. \u201cI quickly realized, holy smokes, you can reach a lot of people through this,\u201d he said.So Kalani made a profile for Mo\u2019 Bettahs, and soon noticed that there were many Facebook groups for Mormons who had served missions in Polynesia. He started promoting the restaurant through those channels.Mo\u2019 Bettahs was suddenly mobbed with former missionaries eager to give their families and friends a taste of the place where they had spent their most formative years. Mormons, the Macks quickly realized, were their greatest marketing tool.\u201cMormons are all about supporting their neighbors, and seeing their community succeed,\u201d Kimo said. \u201cI would go as far as to say: You want to be a successful business person here? You need to join the church.\u201dOne of those fans is Vince Vernon, who sells commercial insurance and served his mission in Hawaii from 2000 to 2002. Mo\u2019 Bettahs, he said, \u201ctook the environment in Hawaii \u2014 where everyone is happy to see you, where people are constantly feeding you, where there\u2019s so much food that you cannot see the bottom of the table \u2014 and they brought that here.\u201dAt one point, Mr. Vernon said, he visited the restaurant every day for six weeks because it reminded him so strongly of his mission experience. \u201cAnd it\u2019s the best food I have ever had in my life,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t even begin to describe the endorphin release from that chicken katsu.\u201dTodd Bangerter, a plumber, served his mission in Kaneohe from 2002 to 2004. \u201cI am a redneck hunting guy from Utah, and by the time I left Hawaii, I felt so much like part of the culture,\u201d Mr. Bangerter said. \u201cI really grew up there.\u201dTo have a place as true to his memories as Mo\u2019 Bettahs, he said, \u201call the way in Utah, where the biggest body of water close to the ocean is the Great Salt Lake \u2014 it\u2019s amazing.\u201d From his first taste of the macaroni salad, he said, it was like he was back in Hawaii.The Macks quickly became celebrities in local Mormon circles. \u201cIt got to the point that when I changed congregations, I walked in and everyone knew who I was,\u201d Kimo said. \u201cThey were like, \u2018You\u2019re the Mo\u2019 Bettahs guy!\u2019\u201dThere is one subset of the local Mormon population that the brothers acknowledge they have not been as successful in wooing: people of Polynesian descent.On a recent afternoon at the original restaurant, a table of teenage Samoan-American girls agreed that the food didn\u2019t have the depth of seasoning they were used to.\u201cIt\u2019s good for Utah, but I\u2019ve had Hawaiian barbecue with a lot more flavor,\u201d said one, Charlotte McFarland. \u201cA lot of the cooks here are white, so they don\u2019t know how to season because they didn\u2019t grow up cooking this food. This chicken katsu just tastes fried.\u201dA local Lyft driver from the Philippines who has spent much of his life in Hawaii said the food at Mo\u2019 Bettahs was \u201cnot sweet enough\u201d for his tastes.This response doesn\u2019t surprise the Macks. Polynesia has people of so many backgrounds that \u201ceveryone makes their food a little differently,\u201d Kalani said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we don\u2019t want to rely on that Polynesian audience, because I think so few of them actually eat with us, and those that do are our harshest critics.\u201dAndrew and Shauna Smith, the group\u2019s founders, said they were impressed by the economics of the restaurant. \u201cYou get so much food for your money, but the food cost is lower than average in the industry,\u201d Mr. Smith said. There are also not many Hawaiian restaurants in Utah to compete with Mo\u2019 Bettahs.The plan is to open six more Utah locations starting this summer, with a branch in Idaho \u2014 which also has a large Mormon population \u2014 to follow next year. After that, Mo\u2019 Bettahs plans to expand to states like Nevada and Missouri, in cities where housing costs are low and incomes are high.Four Foods has gotten Mo\u2019 Bettahs onto Instagram and Twitter, and expanded its presence on Facebook, which the Mack brothers had all but stopped using once they realized their fellow Mormons provided a much more powerful social platform.\u201cWe\u2019ve got this network of people from all over the world just because of the connectivity of the church,\u201d Kimo said. \u201cThey have become our customers, our business partners, our insurance guys, our graphic design team.\u201dIt helps that the teriyaki steak inspires devotion, too.\u201cThis food is the next big thing,\u201d said Mr. Vernon. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be better than Chipotle and Panda Express.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Facebook has even banned Mr. Kogan from the social network and deleted his profile.But in his first extensive interview since reports about Cambridge Analytica were published in The Times, The Observer of London and The Guardian, Mr. Kogan insisted that he was upfront about the Facebook app used to harvest the data, and that no one seemed to care.\u201cThe belief in Silicon Valley and certainly our belief at that point was that the general public must be aware that their data is being sold and shared and used to advertise to them,\u201d Mr. Kogan said in an interview with \u201c60 Minutes\u201d on Sunday.Founded by Stephen K. Bannon and Robert Mercer, a wealthy Republican donor, Cambridge Analytica rose to prominence for its work with President Trump\u2019s campaign in the 2016 election. The company claimed it had developed analytical tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior \u2014 and that Facebook data had been used to help create so-called psychographic modeling techniques.The questionnaire was not actually on Facebook. It was hosted by a company called Qualtrics, which provided a platform for online surveys. Respondents were asked to authorize access to their Facebook profiles, and when they did, an app built by Mr. Kogan performed its sole function: harvesting the data of users and all of their Facebook friends. Their names, birth dates and location data, as well as lists of every Facebook page they had ever liked, were downloaded without their knowledge or express consent.Facebook has said that those who took the quiz were told that their data would be used only for academic purposes, claiming that it and its users were misled by Cambridge Analytica and Mr. Kogan. Cambridge Analytica has said it was told that Mr. Kogan\u2019s app complied with Facebook\u2019s own rules.But The Times reported last month that the fine print accompanying Mr. Kogan\u2019s questionnaire told Facebook users that their data could be used for commercial purposes. That was an outright violation of Facebook\u2019s rules at the time, but the company did nothing to stop Mr. Kogan\u2019s app from collecting the data.\u201cThis is the frustrating bit, where Facebook clearly has never cared. I mean, it\u2019s never enforced this agreement,\u201d Mr. Kogan told \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d\u201cI had a terms of service that was up there for a year and a half that said I could transfer and sell the data,\u201d he continued, adding: \u201cNever heard a word.\u201dUntil April 2015, Facebook allowed app developers to collect some private information from the profiles of users who downloaded apps, and from those of their friends. Facebook has said it allowed this kind of data collection to help developers improve the \u201cin-app\u201d experience for users.Facebook even worked with Mr. Kogan. In November 2015, it brought him in as a consultant to explain the technique he had used for Cambridge Analytica, which focused on how the Facebook pages that users had \u201cliked\u201d could reveal aspects of their personalities.\u201cAt the time, I thought we were doing everything that was correct,\u201d Mr. Kogan told \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d\u201cIf I had any inkling that what I was going to do was going to destroy my relationship with Facebook, I would never have done it,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Slump? Tech, Trade Drag Down Stocks: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Good Monday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching.\u2022 Elon Musk finally responded to last week\u2019s bad news about Tesla.\u2022 Trump continues to go after Amazon.\u2022 China retaliated to President Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs.\u2022 Tech leaders have been keeping mum on Facebook.For months, the stock market rally seemed to have the strength to plow through the obstacles that the Trump administration threw in its way.But now, the S.&P. 500 index is down more than 10 percent from its all-time high.Too much blame can be placed on the White House, however.Before investors began fretting about tech and trade, the underpinnings of the stock market\u2019s ascent were perhaps not as robust as they looked. Wall Street analysts expect earnings for the companies in the S.&P. 500 to increase 25 percent this year, according to data compiled by Standard & Poor\u2019s, an unusually large jump that was reflected in the stock market valuations. Much of that projected earnings increase is coming from tax cuts and some from expectations that companies\u2019 revenue would grow at a nice clip as global growth stayed strong.\u2014 Peter EavisA little humor has not cleared the clouds over Tesla.The accident renews questions about Autopilot, a signature feature of Tesla vehicles, and whether the company has gone far enough to ensure that it keeps drivers and passengers safe.Raj Rajkumar, who researches autonomous driving at Carnegie Mellon University, thinks those assumptions concern one of Tesla\u2019s key sensors. \u201cThe radars they use are apparently meant for detecting moving objects (as typically used in adaptive cruise control systems), and seem to be not very good in detecting stationary objects,\u201d he says.Doubts about the fundamental capabilities of Tesla\u2019s Autopilot could crimp demand for its cars among a customer base that is often seeking the best technology.Out of respect for the privacy of our customer and his family, we do not plan to share any additional details until we conclude the investigation.- Peter EavisTech companies are again dragging down stocks on Wall Street.The S.&P. 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite are off 3.1 percent and 3.5 percent Monday. The continued fall in the share prices of some of the biggest tech companies is weighing heavily on the indexes.Amazon is down 5.4 percent, Netflix is off 5.9 percent, Facebook fell 3 percent, Google-parent Alphabet slipped 3.6 percent and Apple dropped 5.9 percent.After leading the market higher for much of the past two years, tech stocks have hit some turbulence. Since March 16, Facebook, Alphabet, Netflix and Amazon are all down more than 12 percent, while Apple is down 7.3 percent.Over that period the business models of those companies have come under increased scrutiny. News that Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm hired by President Trump\u2019s 2016 election campaign, gained access to private information on more than 50 million Facebook users has weighed not only on the shares of Facebook but on Alphabet as well. Amazon, meanwhile, has come under attack from President Trump.President Trump attacked the e-commerce again on Monday morning.Monday\u2019s tweet is the latest over the past five days from Mr. Trump criticizing Amazon. Over that period, Mr. Trump has accused Amazon of not paying enough taxes, of putting thousands of local retailers out of business and of using the United States Postal Service as its \u201cDelivery Boy.\u201dAmazon\u2019s shares are down 4 percent and are off nearly 11 percent since Axios reported on Wednesday about Mr. Trump\u2019s anger toward the company.Context\u2022 Amazon has said that the Postal Regulatory Commission, which oversees the service, has consistently found that its contracts with Amazon are profitable.Critic\u2019s cornerDA Davidson analyst Tom Forte wrote in a note via Reuters:\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s comments are consistent with industry sources we have spoken to in the shipping industry, who often label Amazon\u2019s deal with the USPS as a sweetheart deal. An argument, however, could be made that the USPS was losing billions before it expanded its service offerings for Amazon and would, still, likely lose billions if Amazon discontinued its use of the USPS tomorrow.\u201dCiting anonymous sources, Bloomberg\u2019s Ian King and Matt Gurman report:\u201cThe initiative, code named Kalamata, is still in the early developmental stages, but comes as part of a larger strategy to make all of Apple\u2019s devices \u2014 including Macs, iPhones, and iPads \u2014 work more similarly and seamlessly together.\u201dApple provides Intel with about 5 percent of its annual revenue.Kenneth C. Griffin\u2019s Citadel has just hired Phil Villhauer, a former top trader at Steven A. Cohen\u2019s investment firm. Mr. Villhauer will become deputy head of global equities at Citadel, a newly created position. He will officially join the Chicago-based hedge fund in the middle of April and work out of Citadel\u2019s office in New York, a Citadel spokesman confirmed.\u201cWe see this as a big hire for us,\u201d said Zia Ahmed, a Citadel spokesman.In January, Mr. Cohen reconfigured Point72 as a hedge fund after establishing it as a family office in 2014 to manage $11 billion of his personal wealth. Point72 has said it has raised between $2 billion and $4 billion in outside money.Mr. Villhauer had been with Mr. Cohen through both the good days and bad days. He was there when SAC turned into a powerhouse hedge fund, and he was there when the fund pleaded guilty to insider trading charges in 2013. The guilty plea required the firm to stop managing money for outside investors.When Mr. Villhauer left Point72, Mr. Cohen, in a letter to employees, called the departure a \u201cretirement\u201d and said he was sad to see Mr. Villhauer go.Now Mr. Villhauer will start a new chapter in his career at another well-known hedge fund firm.____________________________Part of the silence, people in the industry say, comes from a desire to avoid the business equivalent of bad karma \u2014 knowing that they, too, may one day face the buzz saw of public censure.Critic\u2019s corner More on data and privacy The Chinese government said on Monday that it would place tariffs on the imports of 128 American-made products in retaliation for to President Trump\u2019s tariffs on steel and aluminum.The Washington flyaroundWhen the Justice Department allowed Live Nation to merge with Ticketmaster, it tried to assuage concerns that the deal would cripple competitors.But critics have reason to be skeptical. Here\u2019s how Beau Buffier, the chief of the New York Attorney General\u2019s Antitrust Bureau, described Live Nation:\u201cIt is now widely seen as the poster child for the problems that arise when enforcers adopt these temporary fixes to limit the anticompetitive effects of deeply problematic vertical mergers.\u201dThe inquiries come as the department is reviewing two more mergers, between AT&T and Time Warner, and Disney and Fox.The department\u2019s new antitrust chief has said that the Live Nation deal and several other deals posed problems because they relied too much on the federal government\u2019s ability to police corporate behavior.\u201cEven if we wanted to do that, we often don\u2019t have the skills or the tools to do so effectively,\u201d the antitrust chief, Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, said in a speech.More for your playlistThe deals flyaroundAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Is Jewdas? Hosts of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Seder Grab Spotlight", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe group\u2019s very name \u2014 a play on Judas, the disciple who betrayed Jesus Christ \u2014 is a provocation, one that has angered many of those encountering the group for the first time. Some critics say that Jewdas\u2019s name, and antics, risk stoking age-old myths and hatreds that have led to anti-Semitic violence.Created in London more than a decade ago, Jewdas is a group of left-wing activists who are at odds with most of Britain\u2019s mainstream Jewish organizations. Its members say they are opposed to capitalism and fascism, but the group may be best known for its vociferous criticisms of Israel and its policies toward Palestinians.While there is a long and rich tradition of Jewish leftist thought, as well as Jewish criticism of Zionism and of the policies of the state of Israel, some critics say that Jewdas goes too far, and chooses outrage over advocacy.The Seder was held in an Anglican Church known for its ecumenical approach; the meal was vegan.But the group\u2019s use of satire has antagonized other Jewish organizations in Britain.In 2009, members of Jewdas sent out spoof emails in the name of the Board of Deputies, a leading Jewish organization, telling supporters that a scheduled rally had been called off.\u201cWhat has happened over the last week is anything but an attempt to address anti-Semitism. It is the work of cynical manipulations by people whose expressed loyalty is to the Conservative Party and the right wing of the Labour Party,\u201d the group wrote. \u201cIt is a malicious ploy to remove the leader of the opposition and put a stop to the possibility of a socialist government.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Police Identify Woman Who Wounded 3 at YouTube and Killed Herself; Motive Is Unclear", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN BRUNO, Calif. \u2014 A woman opened fire with a handgun at YouTube\u2019s headquarters in California on Tuesday afternoon, shooting three people \u2014 one of whom was critically injured \u2014 before killing herself, the authorities said.The San Bruno Police Department identified the attacker late Tuesday as Nasim Najafi Aghdam, who was in her late 30s. The motivation for the shootings was under investigation, the police said, although her social media postings included criticisms of YouTube.Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital received three patients: a man, 36, in critical condition; a woman, 32, in serious condition; and a woman, 27, in fair condition, a hospital spokesman, Brent Andrew, said at a news conference. A fourth person had injuries that weren\u2019t from a gunshot, the police said.\u201cAt this time there is no evidence that the shooter knew the victims of this shooting or that individuals were specifically targeted,\u201d the San Bruno Police Department said in a written statement.Word of the attack in San Bruno at YouTube, which is owned by Google and is one of the world\u2019s largest social media companies, quickly spread online through employees\u2019 social media feeds.Vadim Lavrusik, a YouTube employee who formerly worked for The New York Times, tweeted just before 1 p.m. that there was an \u201cactive shooter at YouTube HQ\u201d and that he had \u201cheard shots and saw people running while at my desk.\u201d He was barricaded in a room with co-workers, he said, but moments later tweeted that he had been safely evacuated.The last known address for Ms. Aghdam was in Menifee, a city in Southern California about halfway between Los Angeles and San Diego.Ms. Aghdam was active on various social media outlets, including YouTube, where she had a number of channels in Persian, Turkish and English. On YouTube, she published an eclectic set of videos, including music parodies and workouts, on topics like animal cruelty and vegan cooking.In February 2017, she recorded a video on Facebook criticizing YouTube for taking measures that decreased the number of views on her videos.She said that she had contacted YouTube, but that the site\u2019s support staff told her that her workout videos contained inappropriate scenes and needed to be restricted from younger audiences.\u201cThis is what they are doing to vegan activists and many other people who try to promote healthy, humane and smart living \u2014 people like me are not good for big business, like for animal business, medicine business and for many other businesses. That\u2019s why they are discriminating and censoring us,\u201d she said in the video on Facebook.YouTube had pulled down all of her channels as of Tuesday night.\u201cFor me, animal rights equal human rights,\u201d said Ms. Aghdam, then 29, who attended the protest carrying a plastic sword and wearing a wig and jeans painted with drops of blood.The shootings on Tuesday took place in a courtyard at YouTube\u2019s offices, the police said. Those offices, like other Google facilities, maintain light security, with employees using badges to go through security gates or doors. Usually, the main lobby is attended by a receptionist. There are no visible metal detectors or armed guards.San Bruno is about nine miles south of San Francisco, with a population around 43,000. YouTube is the city\u2019s biggest employer, and many workers commute here from San Francisco. Though YouTube is owned by Google, it operates in a separate office, about 20 miles from Google\u2019s main campus in Mountain View, Calif.Outside the YouTube headquarters, armed police officers waded into a crowd of 200 or so employees who had evacuated to a nearby parking lot Tuesday afternoon. The police asked for employees who had witnessed something firsthand to come forward, and about two dozen, some visibly distraught, walked over to the officers.Many employees said they had initially thought the episode was a fire drill. Others said they had run when people started shouting that there was a shooter. Two hours after the attack, YouTube employees, including Susan Wojcicki, the chief executive, continued to stream slowly down the hill, away from the office.Footage broadcast by CNN showed people leaving the building in single file with their hands raised above their heads. Separate footage showed a large crowd lining up to be frisked, one by one, by the police.Zach Vorhies, 37, a senior software engineer at YouTube, said in an interview that he had been sitting at his desk when the fire alarm went off. He grabbed his electric skateboard and headed for a back exit, he said. As he rode down a gravel hill, he heard someone shouting and saw a man lying motionless in one of the office\u2019s outdoor dining areas.\u201cHe had a red spot on his stomach, and he was lying on his back, not moving,\u201d Mr. Vorhies said. \u201cI saw the blood soak through the shirt.\u201dAbout 25 feet away from the victim, he said, a man was shouting, \u201cCome at me!\u201d Mr. Vorhies thought the man was the attacker, but he did not see a gun and said it was possible that the man had actually \u201cbeen taunting the shooter.\u201dA moment later, an armed police officer entered the patio area, and Mr. Vorhies quickly left, he said.The dining area can be reached from an adjacent parking structure without an employee badge, Mr. Vorhies said.By 2:15 p.m., President Trump had been briefed on the attack. He tweeted a short time later: \u201cWas just briefed on the shooting at YouTube\u2019s HQ in San Bruno, California. Our thoughts and prayers are with everybody involved. Thank you to our phenomenal Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders that are currently on the scene.\u201dExecutives at other Silicon Valley companies took to Twitter to send their condolences to YouTube employees.Others, including a trauma surgeon at the hospital where shooting victims were taken, expressed anger at continued gun violence.\u201cYou\u2019d think that after we\u2019ve seen Las Vegas, Parkland, the Pulse nightclub shooting, that we would see an end to this, but we have not,\u201d the surgeon, Dr. Andre Campbell, told reporters Tuesday afternoon.An earlier version of this article misquoted a comment made by Nasim Najafi Aghdam in one of her YouTube videos. She said, \u201cThis is what they are doing to vegan activists and many other people who try to promote healthy, humane and smart living,\u201d not \u201cwhat they are doing the weekend activists.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the name of the city in California where Ms. Aghdam\u2019s last known address was.

No. For nearly 20 years Mr. Barsky, 43, has been knitting sweaters of familiar landscapes and, in recent years, posting photographs of himself posing in front of them, wearing his matching jumper.Last year, Isaac Schleifer, a Baltimore city councilman, awarded him a commendation for his work.\u201cIn these times, to show Baltimore in a positive light is a good thing,\u201d Mr. Schleifer said. \u201cHe wants to spread the joy of knitting to the world.\u201dMr. Barsky, a Baltimore native, said he started knitting in 1999 when he dropped out of nursing school at his local community college. Then, he was shopping at a flea market in Lutherville, Md., where he saw three women selling yarn. He asked if they would teach him how to knit. \u201cThey said yes, if I bought their yarn,\u201d Mr. Barsky recalled. His first sweater depicted a covered bridge. \u201cI was looking at the clouds in the sky and thought that would make a nice sweater,\u201d he said. At first he created nature scenes. But then he became taken with famous landmarks. \u201cIf I know my plans in advance I\u2019ll knit a sweater and take it there,\u201d he said.That\u2019s what he did last summer on a trip to Los Angeles, where he posed in front of the Hollywood sign. \u201cI was looking for the right angle when a minibus full of tourists pulled over,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of them asked, \u2018Are you the knitting guy?\u2019 I said, \u2018I have some good news for you. I am about to take a picture with the landmark.\u2019\u201d After he snapped his photograph, he said he took one with the tourists.Not all his attempts are as fruitful.

California Today has been doing occasional question-and-answer sessions with candidates for office.This interview, with Mr. Cox, was edited and condensed for clarity.Q: How does a Republican win an election in a state like this? A: The biggest issue is the sanctuary state. The politicians seem to be favoring criminals over law-abiding citizens. The politicians are ignoring the rule of law in favor of political expediency. The other big issue is the tax burden \u2014 the gas tax in particular. They enacted this tax increase using a lot of political games to get it accomplished.Q: Does the Republican Party need to expand its appeal to become more competitive here? A: I\u2019m a Jack Kemp Republican. I think that\u2019s the kind of Republican we all have to be. Jack would always speak positively about things. I want people to get away from harsh language.Having said that, it is absolutely objectionable for people like Gavin Newsom and Jerry Brown to say they are not going to adhere to the federal law on immigration. Jerry Brown should not be acting like George Wallace in front of the schoolhouse in Alabama.Q: How much of an obstacle is Mr. Trump for you as you run for governor?A: I\u2019m at a forum a few weeks ago and I\u2019m listening to these Democrats ripping him up. I said: \u201cDonald Trump didn\u2019t create the housing crisis. Donald Trump didn\u2019t create a drought. Donald Trump didn\u2019t raise your taxes to ridiculous heights. You are sitting here making Donald Trump the issue.\u201d The issue on the ballot in 2018 is not going to be Donald Trump.Q: How do you think he is doing for president?A: I didn\u2019t vote for him. But I take great pains to say I like the tax cut. I like the regulations that he is streamlining. I like the judges he\u2019s appointing. I like moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem. So he\u2019s done some great things. I\u2019m not a huge fan of his Twittering.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Does it seem like everyone is always angry with you?These findings build on previous research indicating that depression, anxiety and irritability can affect how a person perceives other people\u2019s faces.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "Celebrating Mimouna and Its Dose of Post-Passover Carbs", "Date": "2018-04-02", "News": "This Moroccan ritual, now widely popular in Israel but little known in America, offers a spread of sweets including a stacked cake called moufleta.Supported byFor American Jews who can\u2019t go too long without their favorite carbohydrates, the end of Passover offers nearly as much cause for celebration as the holiday itself. Many begin right at sundown, wolfing down pizzas. Then come the brownies or other foods with the leavening ingredients they have been avoiding in a nod to ancestors who had no time to let bread dough rise while fleeing Egypt.Unbeknown to many Americans, however, Moroccan Jews have long marked the end of Passover with a more established ritual, a raucous tradition known as Mimouna. Soon after sunset on the last night of the holiday (observed this year on Friday or Saturday), they indulge in the first leavened food since Passover began: moufleta, a pan-cooked cake smeared with butter and honey.A variety of other Moroccan sweets follow, on a long, elaborately decorated table that includes the requisite mint tea. For Jews in Israel, where many Moroccans immigrated in the decades after its founding in 1948, Mimouna is now practically a national holiday, as Jews of all backgrounds break the bread that has been temporarily forbidden.It isn\u2019t easy to find a Mimouna in America. I spent years trying to invite myself to one before finally attending two last year, in Manhattan and Brooklyn. But you can make your own and make it your own, as long as it includes moufleta.Setting a traditional Mimouna table begins with foods you lay out as symbols but do not actually eat. A live fish in a bowl connotes fertility or abundance. Milk, eggs, wheat, fava beans and flour may make an appearance, too.There are also foods that do not show up on the table. Observant Jews do not mix meat and milk (and thus the butter that tops the moufleta) in the same meal, so this is not the time to show off your lamb tagine skills. Nor do traditionalists bake cookies with flour; that would require having bags of flour or Mimouna cookies in the house during Passover, which is also against the rules.Head down, Ms. Levinson stood at the stove with the makings of many dozen moufleta, and proceeded to prove herself. Her training? As a cook in a secret Israeli Army unit that she would not describe. The pan? \u201cI bought it at the 99-cent store in Midwood,\u201d she said.She rolled out the first moufleta with the help of an assistant, dropped it into the pan, flipped it once and then put the next on top. The heat from the first moufleta began cooking the side of the second that touched it, and then she flipped both at once, so the second moufleta got a browning on one side. She repeated this, over and over, until she had a stack of dozens, flipping the growing stack with her fingers.\u201cWhen you work in a kitchen, you don\u2019t really feel the heat anymore,\u201d she said.As the pile became nearly unmanageable, the guests began hovering. The hosts laid out softened sticks of butter and squeeze bottles of honey, near an enormous tea set with a kaleidoscopic array of colored glasses.When the guests dug in, one thing became immediately clear: Mimouna has to be in the running for the stickiest culinary ritual known to humanity. Honey gets under your fingernails, on your lapel, in the crevices of your cellphone and on the bottom of your shoes as children mill about and dribble it on the floor. So you rinse, and repeat.In Moroccan communities in Israel, there are generally no formal invitations to Mimouna, but everyone comes. Hosts maintain an open-door policy, and families wander from house to house, sipping tea, eating a moufleta, sampling another sweet or two and then walking down the street for more.Shira Ohayon, a researcher of Middle Eastern Jewish and feminist culture in Israel who was born to Moroccan Jews, has a relative who is active in Israeli politics. \u201cHe makes a big Mimouna,\u201d she said. \u201cAll the ministers would come. It\u2019s more of an industrial Mimouna.\u201dAround 10 one night last April, Sidney Cohen wandered into a decidedly nonindustrial Mimouna at the home of Meirav Alcobi Gavrielov and Varan Gavrielov on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Moufleta cooked by Rebecca Alcobi, Ms. Alcobi Gavrielov\u2019s mother, who had never celebrated Mimouna in America, emerged from a small galley kitchen.\u201cBy this time in Israel, you would have been to seven or eight houses, and you wouldn\u2019t have even seen the owners, because they were at other people\u2019s houses,\u201d Mr. Cohen said, pausing to lick his fingers.\u201cNow, I need tea,\u201d he added. \u201cWhere is the tea?\u201d And he headed back to the buffet to wash everything down.cookingcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Grand Tiki Bar for a Less-Than-Tropical Island, Manhattan", "Date": "2018-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cI want to bring the Polynesian islands to the island of Manhattan,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cJust because we live in an urban jungle doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t celebrate that we live on an island.\u201d\u201cWe are committed to making the Polynesian the best tiki bar in the world,\u201d Jeff Zalaznick, a partner in Major Food Group, said in a statement, with typical restraint.The 4,900-square-foot, L-shaped space will have sweeping views of the city on two sides, and a balcony that equals the interior in size and seating \u2014 in all, room for 200 people. A private room in the back, where Mr. Miller will keep his considerable stash of rare and vintage rums, will evoke the captain\u2019s table on a ship.The d\u00e9cor, by Vanessa Guilford, takes deep turquoise as its predominant color note, and includes large murals, teakwood floors, bamboo ceilings, a 30-foot-long lava-rock bar top, and cut-metal screens that evoke Polynesian masks.It\u2019s an expansive vision of tiki culture the likes of which New York has not seen since the days of Trader Vic\u2019s and the Hawaiian Room of the Hotel Lexington. \u201cNew York\u2019s been waiting for it,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cAnd honestly, I feel like people have been waiting for me to do it.\u201dMr. Miller, 47, is one of perhaps a half-dozen figures who spearheaded the recent tiki renaissance in the United States, and the only one without a bar. Instead, he has spread the aesthetic through an itinerant tropical party called \u201cTiki Mondays.\u201d The event began in 2011 at the SoHo bar Lani Kai (since closed), and later put in time at the Gold Bar, Mother\u2019s Ruin and Pouring Ribbons.He worked at ZZ\u2019s Clam Bar, Major Food\u2019s pocket-size cocktail and raw bar in Greenwich Village, and in 2014, the partners asked him to pitch his idea for a bar. For the presentation, Mr. Miller had leis mailed from Hawaii, and brought in an act called the Hula Belly Sisters. It worked.\u201cMy idea was Trader Vic\u2019s meets \u2018Mad Men\u2019 meets \u2018Pirates of the Caribbean,\u2019\u201d Mr. Miller said. Food will include pu pu platters and what Major Food boasts will be a \u201cbest-of-class Crab Rangoon.\u201dThe four-panel folding bar menu, modeled after Trader Vic\u2019s, lists 19 cocktails, four large-format shared drinks (one is served in a fish bowl) and two virgin cocktails. Among them are a few originals Mr. Miller has popularized over the years, like the Double-Barrel Winchester, which employs four different gins to create a panoply of flavors; the Fiddler\u2019s Green, a cross between two classic tiki drinks, the Blue Hawaiian and the Montego Bay, served from a slushie machine; and the Smokin\u2019 Sarong, a m\u00e9lange of Scotch, coconut, tea and honey.Speaking of sarongs, Mr. Miller, who promises to be at the Polynesian every day for its first year, will wear one as host, just as he often did at \u201cTiki Mondays.\u201d\u201cEveryone knows I will be in a sarong,\u201d he said. \u201cSarongs will be optional for staff.\u201dThe Polynesian, 400 West 42nd Street, Manhattan.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "With Death in Streets, Nicaragua Cancels Social Security Revamp", "Date": "2018-04-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMANAGUA, Nicaragua \u2014 President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua announced on Sunday that he was reversing a social security overhaul that had prompted days of protests in which up to two dozen people died.\u201cWe have to re-establish order,\u201d Mr. Ortega said in televised remarks. \u201cWe cannot allow groups to impose chaos, crime and looting.\u201dHis announcement seemed to acknowledge that the protests, which started on Wednesday as a picket by college students against the social security overhaul, had become a serious challenge to his authority.But it is unlikely to sway protesters who still have other grievances against his government \u2014 including Mr. Ortega\u2019s interference with the National Assembly, the law and the Constitution, like eliminating term limits. He is also widely criticized for having manipulated the Supreme Court, the elections council and mayoral races.The Nicaraguan leader has faced protests before, but at no point since his 2007 re-election have so many sectors united against him in what has become the greatest test of his presidency. Experts say it is the largest popular uprising here since the end of the nation\u2019s civil war nearly 30 years ago.If anything, students at Polytechnic University in Managua, who had been protesting for days, seemed galvanized by Mr. Ortega\u2019s Sunday announcement.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to move,\u201d said Golden Rivas, 36, a nursing major who had been at the Polytechnic University throughout the sit-in.Dara Nicole D\u00edaz, 18, a graphic design major, whipped out her cellphone to read a long list of the students\u2019 demands, which included the release of protesters detained in the past week and the resignation of the police chief.\u201cThis isn\u2019t a struggle just from now,\u201d she said. \u201cThis has been a dictatorship for almost 12 years. The people can\u2019t take it anymore.\u201dMr. Ortega\u2019s announcement capped a weekend of intensifying pressure. The rallies had spread to cities around the nation and claimed up to two dozen lives, according to Cenidh, a leading human rights organization.The government posted images of city blocks burning, government buildings in shambles and widespread ransacking of supermarkets with no police officers in sight \u2014 looting that some accused the government of staging in order to justify a crackdown.At lunchtime on Sunday, before Mr. Ortega\u2019s announcement, the streets of central Managua were largely deserted, with businesses looted or shuttered, as tension lingered.The business group also said other sectors would have to join the talks.\u201cWe want to sit at a real table, not a false one,\u201d Fidel Narv\u00e1ez, 29, a lawyer organizing some of the protests in the capital, said before Mr. Ortega\u2019s announcement. \u201cWe want a national recall referendum.\u201dThe social security overhaul would have forced contributors to pay more into social security and retirees to receive 5 percent less.Now in his third consecutive term as president, Mr. Ortega has a strong grip on power, including every branch of government and the military. Many poor people who receive housing and other government benefits support him.\u201cThe objective of the people on the street, and the dead, was for the presidential couple to leave,\u201d said Fidel Moreira, the executive director of the Center for the Studies of Governability and Democracy, which supports the protests. \u201cLooking at logic and how power here is built, that is a little far-off.\u201dOscar Pupiro Zuniga, 62, a local leader of the government\u2019s leftist Sandinista Front party, acknowledged that the government had erred in not negotiating the social security overhaul with business and union leaders first, but he said well-financed right-wing groups had taken advantage of the issue to sow chaos.\u201cWhy do I say those students are being manipulated?\u201d Mr. Pupiro said. \u201cDid you see the trucks filled with water, mortars and everything else the students might need? It\u2019s not a fair protest.\u201dOn Friday, bankers joined the protests, as the nation\u2019s largest business group called both for a dialogue and a nationwide protest on Monday. The Roman Catholic Church provided refuge to students as it became increasingly unclear whether the church, the business community or any other interlocutor could step in and resolve the growing crisis.Saturday\u2019s protests were galvanized by a rambling midday speech by Mr. Ortega, who cited what he called the cynical nature of the protests and said they were organized by right-wing forces.He said his administration had worked hard to foster a positive image that encouraged tourism and investment, only to see that ruined by news coverage that harked back to the nation\u2019s years at war.After leading a 1979 revolution to overthrow a right-wing dictatorship, Mr. Ortega was president of Nicaragua in the 1980s. But a war financed by the United States marked his entire term in office until he was voted out in 1990. After losing several further elections, he took office again in 2007 when legal changes allowed him to win with a plurality.On Saturday, Fanor Avenda\u00f1o Alguera met with a group of other young professionals. They were strategizing their next move in the growing protests, when his phone started buzzing with messages from fellow doctors at a demonstration at the university, saying: \u201cHelp, they have us surrounded\u201d and \u201cThey\u2019re asphyxiating us.\u201dIn a flash, Dr. Avenda\u00f1o and the engineers, lawyers, economists and publicists at the meeting grabbed face masks and bottled water and dashed off to the university, where they were met by dozens of youths carrying slingshots, rocks and bags of paint. They surrounded the university building as volunteers and nearby residents offered them water and first aid, while police officers at another entrance pushed back against student protesters.The sound of mortar fire echoed in the air.An earlier version of this article misidentified Fanor Avenda\u00f1o Alguera. He is a doctor, but is not with the Polytechnic University.An earlier version of this article misstated the legal changes that allowed Daniel Ortega to win a presidential election in 2007. He was allowed to win by a plurality, not a simple majority.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Wants America to Revert to the Queens of His Childhood", "Date": "2018-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.In 1950, Donald and his family moved around the corner to a grander 23-room, 9-bathroom redbrick \u2014 also built by his father \u2014 at 85-14 Midland Parkway.In 1960, when Trump turned 14, there were so few Hispanics that the census did not keep count; by 1970, when Trump turned 24, 153,691, or one out of 13, Queens residents were Latino. From 1960 to 1970, the black population of Queens grew from 145,885 to 258,006.In my opinion no high\u2010rise, low\u2010income housing works out. What happens is it becomes a concentration camp for the elderly where eventually you can\u2019t go out for a loaf of bread or a bottle of milk. Why don\u2019t they build gas chambers for these people?Sampson pointed out the connection between Trump\u2019s roots in Queens and the themes he has stressed as a candidate and as president:The explosion of immigration and the racial change in the makeup of Queens might have left an especially deep imprint, because his constant references to making America great again evoke an earlier time that was considerably less diverse. Indeed, building walls and stemming the tide of such change seems to be at the heart of Trump\u2019s appeals to a remembered national past, and in this case, of his childhood.Sampson cited thestrong link research has found between perceptions of disorder and the presence of immigrants and minorities \u2014 independent of actual disorder and crime \u2014 provides another clue, one that applies to neighborhoods and arguably up to the level of societies.Whites for whom the changing national diversity is salient express (a) more support for conservative policies, including those relevant to race; (b) less support for diversity; (c) more racial resentment and support for the Tea Party; and (d) more support for Donald Trump and anti-immigrant policies.Trump has long since departed Queens, along with more than 900,000 other whites, many of whom became recruits for his presidential campaign. His administration is in many respects an attempt to restore the Queens of his early childhood.During the campaign, Scaramucci recounted, Trump \u201cwould say to us: \u2018That tweet\u2019s not for you. You\u2019re probably offended by it. I don\u2019t care. That tweet is for the guy in the flyover states, at the steel plant. If I lose some of the effete Republican elite, what difference does it make?\u2019 \u201dLuce reports the story of Trump telling foreign investors that his casinos would be flooded by \u201cwhite trash.\u201d What did he mean by \u201cwhite trash,\u201d the investors asked.Trump replied: \u201cThey\u2019re people just like me, only they\u2019re poor.\u201dTrump is nothing if not consistent in his appeal to this constituency.\u201cWe cannot let people enter our country,\u201d Trump said:We have no idea who they are, what they do, where they came from. We have no idea what their records are. We don\u2019t know if they\u2019re murderers, if they\u2019re killers, if they\u2019re MS-13.Citing his upbringing in Queens, Trump boasted that federal immigration enforcement officershave gone into towns in Long Island where we\u2019ve taken MS-13 and we\u2019ve actually liberated towns. This is our country, right? I grew up in Long Island, right short of Long Island. And these are great towns; I know every one of them.Trump relishes gory descriptions of the dangers posed by illegal immigrants:They didn\u2019t want to use guns. They use knives because it\u2019s much more painful, where they cut people up, because a bullet is too quick. They want to inflict pain on students, on young women, young girls walking home. And their parents never see them again. They\u2019re cut up.Trump\u2019s views on race and ethnicity find a wide range of targets. He is conducting a subterranean assault on housing integration \u2014 the subject of his family\u2019s court battles in the 1970s. He has delegated the issue to Ben Carson, the secretary of Housing and Urban Development.take significant actions to overcome historic patterns of segregation, achieve truly balanced and integrated living patterns, promote fair housing choice, and foster inclusive communities that are free from discrimination.The new statement would read:HUD\u2019s mission is to ensure Americans have access to fair, affordable housing and opportunities to achieve self-sufficiency, thereby strengthening our communities and nation.to scale back federal efforts to enforce fair housing laws, freezing enforcement actions against local governments and businesses, including Facebook, while sidelining officials who have aggressively pursued civil rights cases.Thrush noted that in November, Anna Maria Far\u00edas, assistant HUD secretary for fair housing and equal opportunity, ordered a halt to \u201cabout a half-dozen fair housing investigations\u201d that had been given top priority during the Obama administration.The support Trump has garnered \u2014 and continues to maintain \u2014 among broad swaths of voters indicates the power and depth of the resentment and animosity in a segment of the American electorate that, before his candidacy, few analysts were fully aware of. Trump\u2019s core supporters \u2014 Americans most resistant to the racial and ethnic changes taking place around them \u2014 have not been subsumed by a dominant liberal culture, as many had hoped.neighborhood-level exposure to racial and ethnic minorities predicts greater group threat and racial identification among Whites as well as greater intentions to vote for Trump in the general election.The results raise an interesting question: Will these numbers help or hurt Trump\u2019s re-election effort?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Audit Approved of Facebook Policies, Even After Cambridge Analytica Leak", "Date": "2018-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe accounting firm, formerly known as PricewaterhouseCoopers, effectively gave Facebook a clean bill of health. \u201cFacebook\u2019s privacy controls were operating with sufficient effectiveness to provide reasonable assurance to protect the privacy\u201d of users, said the assessment, which stretched from February 2015 to February 2017.\u201cWe considered it a closed case,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cIn retrospect, that was clearly a mistake.\u201dLike its competitors, PwC closely protects the inner workings of its review process. The public versions of the reports it submits to the F.T.C. redact both the names of the employees who performed the work and the tests the firm used to assess Facebook\u2019s privacy measures. It is not clear whether Facebook informed its auditors of the leak, or whether PwC knew about it.In a statement, Facebook\u2019s deputy chief privacy officer, Rob Sherman, said the company remained \u201cstrongly committed to protecting people\u2019s information\u201d and appreciated \u201cthe opportunity to answer questions the F.T.C. may have.\u201dA spokeswoman for PwC declined to comment.\u201cClearly, the F.T.C. needs to be more forthcoming with the contents of those reports,\u201d said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, which advocates more stringent privacy protections. \u201cThere is still too much that is not known about Facebook\u2019s business practices during that critical time period.\u201dThe 2011 decree \u2014 triggered in part by a complaint EPIC and other consumer groups filed \u2014 followed a two-year investigation that found Facebook had routinely ignored its users\u2019 privacy preferences and shared their data without their permission. Besides demanding that Facebook give users more control over their data, the decree required the company to assess potential privacy risks. Facebook has acknowledged that it did not sufficiently police how third parties with access to its data, like Mr. Kogan, used the information.F.T.C. officials hailed the consent decree as a new and powerful model for regulating tech giants like Facebook and Google, which in recent years have built immensely lucrative advertising businesses rooted in the vast quantities of data they collect from people who use their free services.But critics of the agreement said it reflected the essential weakness of relying on an outside firm to evaluate Facebook\u2019s compliance with the order. The F.T.C. is a relatively small agency, where even major investigations are handled by teams of just a few people. Instead of retaining a large staff of technology and data experts to monitor businesses, the agency makes companies hire outside accounting and consulting firms. These are paid by companies like Facebook and periodically report back to the F.T.C.According to the assessment documents, Facebook chooses which policies and procedures PwC reviews.\u201cA conversation has to be had about how the F.T.C. handles these assessments,\u201d said Joseph Jerome, policy counsel at the Center for Democracy and Technology, which is funded in part by Facebook and other tech companies. \u201cFacebook decides how they are being assessed.

{"Headline": "How Facebook and Google Could Benefit From the G.D.P.R., Europe\u2019s New Privacy Law", "Date": "2018-04-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In Europe and the United States, the conventional wisdom is that regulation is needed to force Silicon Valley\u2019s digital giants to respect people\u2019s online privacy.But new rules may instead serve to strengthen Facebook\u2019s and Google\u2019s hegemony and extend their lead on the internet.In recent years, other regulatory attempts at strengthening online privacy rules have also had little effect at chipping away at the power of the largest tech companies, ultimately aiding internet giants rather than hurting them.At the same time, countries like Brazil and Argentina are exploring European-style privacy regulations that will further test the companies\u2019 advertising-based business models. United States lawmakers also showed more openness to regulating Silicon Valley during Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony this month.Yet past attempts at privacy regulation have done little to mitigate the power of tech firms. Consider what happened in Europe after earlier attempts at checking the power of Facebook, Google and others.Another 2011 European law requiring websites to alert visitors to \u201ccookie\u201d trackers that collect data on browsing history has largely turned into a distracting annoyance rather than changing how companies operate. People often accept the tracking to get rid of the pop-up warning without reading details about the tracking.Spokeswomen for Facebook and Google declined to comment.Lawyers, consultants and businesses preparing for the privacy laws said that reining in the large technology companies was not the primary goal of the European legislation.Some privacy advocates also bristle at the idea that these new restrictions would help already powerful internet companies, noting that is a well-worn argument employed by tech giants to try to prevent future regulation.But Nicolas Colin, a co-founder and director at the Family, a Paris-based start-up accelerator, argued that \u201cpeople tend to give that permission to companies they trust.\u201d He said that \u201cstricter rules strengthen companies because they have that key asset that is trust.\u201dThe European privacy laws may crimp targeted advertising by limiting the flow of personal data, but firms like Google and Facebook still have an advantage because advertisers are likely to turn to services with reach and enormous audiences \u2014 akin to buying an ad during the Super Bowl. Facebook has more than 2.2 billion monthly users, and Google\u2019s YouTube has 1.5 billion monthly users.Giovanni Buttarelli, the European data protection supervisor who was involved in the creation of privacy rules, said much of the impact would be determined by regulators who enact the law and who will be up against well-funded teams of lobbyists and lawyers. Google and Facebook will be overseen by the Irish data authority because their European headquarters are in Ireland. Mr. Buttarelli noted that Europe had staff of about 2,500 across all the countries working on the issue.\u201cThat\u2019s peanuts compared to the lobbyists in Brussels and Strasbourg,\u201d he said, referring to the cities where the European Commission and Parliament operate.He said large technology companies had advantages but would also be under a microscope. Enforcement of the law is skewed to companies that handle the most personal data.\u201cThere are pros and cons to being a tech giant,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to treat small and medium-sized businesses differently.\u201dYonatan Zunger, a former Google privacy engineer now working at human resources start-up Humu, said Europe was holding Google and Facebook to \u201ca much higher bar\u201d when it came to gaining consent from users. These companies now cannot make data sharing a condition of using their products because consent needs to be freely given, whereas smaller companies are not held to that same standard, he said.Still, there are already signs the big companies are adjusting to the new privacy norms.Google, which spent years preparing for the new rules, has stopped scanning Gmail messages for keywords used to target advertising. And it recently introduced a new marketing product for publishers that shows ads based on the context of other articles or content on a website, instead of relying on personal information.In response, privacy critics have challenged Facebook\u2019s new consent forms, saying they are intended to continue encouraging users to share information widely. And Google came under fire for an updated European user consent policy that has open-ended language, which critics said violated a tenet of European privacy rules that requires companies to ask for user consent in specific and explicit ways.\u201cI\u2019m worried that a lot of people have invested a lot of hope in G.D.P.R., and I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s going to deliver,\u201d said Ben Scott, a senior adviser to the Open Technology Institute at New America, a think tank based in Washington. \u201cIt will all depend on how it\u2019s going to be enforced.\u201dDaisuke Wakabayashi reported from San Francisco, and Adam Satariano from London.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Senators Had a Lot to Say About Facebook. That Hasn\u2019t Stopped Them From Using It.", "Date": "2018-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith respect to Facebook, United States senators don\u2019t seem to be too different from many of us: They don\u2019t necessarily trust it, but they\u2019re not ready to quit it.Even as the members of the Senate Commerce and Judiciary committees were questioning Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, during a nearly five-hour hearing on Tuesday, many of them were feeding content back into the site.The most active, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, posted more than 20 times during Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s two days on Capitol Hill.All 44 of the senators who questioned Mr. Zuckerberg on Tuesday have pages on the platform he built. At least 35 of them have two Facebook pages, with many using one page for official Senate communications and a second page for their campaign-related material to avoid violating ethics laws.In most cases, senators\u2019 social media accounts are run by members of their staffs, which may account for the disconnect between some of the critical questions lobbed at Mr. Zuckerberg and the relatively robust social media presences of the senators asking them.At one point during the Tuesday hearing, for example, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina asked Mr. Zuckerberg about his company\u2019s top competitors, singling out one in particular.\u201cIs Twitter the same as what you do?\u201d Mr. Graham asked.\u201cSenator, we run ads,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg responded, providing a basic fact that\u2019s central to Facebook\u2019s operations.Though many of the questions the 44 senators asked Mr. Zuckerberg suggested some confusion over how his company operates, all of those senators still use his platform as an important communication tool.The senators who questioned Mr. Zuckerberg on Tuesday appeared to take that advice to heart. Twenty-five of them used their Facebook pages on Tuesday to comment on the hearing.Those active Facebook presences might seem at odds with the concerns the senators raised over the site\u2019s business practices and the way Facebook treats its users. But surveys released by the Pew Research Center suggest the senators\u2019 views on the platform are similar to those of the American public.Mr. Cruz, among the most active senators on Facebook while Mr. Zuckerberg was in Washington, pressed the Facebook executive on the site\u2019s treatment of conservative news media and politics. Of the senator\u2019s nine posts on Tuesday, four were tied to Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony.Despite Mr. Cruz\u2019s concerns, he and his office have no plans to change their approach to the platform, according to Catherine Frazier, a spokeswoman for the senator.\u201cWe use Facebook because it is supposed to be an unvarnished, unfiltered way to engage with our constituents,\u201d she said.Like Mr. Cruz, Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California, expressed deep reservations about Facebook when she questioned Mr. Zuckerberg.\u201cI\u2019m concerned about how much Facebook values trust and transparency,\u201d she said. She then criticized what she said was his inability to answer questions about what data Facebook stores and whether the site can track its users\u2019 activity.\u201cMost of the people we\u2019re reaching on Facebook are the people that we want to inform about the privacy concerns that Ms. Harris raised during the hearing,\u201d said Tyrone Gayle, a spokesman for Ms. Harris.\u201cShe wants to make sure her constituents have this information at their disposal,\u201d he added.On Wednesday, it was the turn of House members to question Mr. Zuckerberg. By some accounts, they seemed a bit more knowledgeable about the platform and asked tougher questions overall.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Police Kill Black Man With Barrage of Bullets Outside California Walmart", "Date": "2018-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe police in a small inland California city are facing criticism after they opened fire on a car in a Walmart parking lot this month, killing the black man who had been driving and injuring one of his three passengers.Video of the shooting in Barstow, recorded by a pedestrian and later posted by a racial justice activist, appears to show officers with the Barstow Police Department firing more than a dozen rounds. A lawyer for the family of the man who was killed, Diante Yarber, 26, estimated that the police had fired about 30 rounds.The Yarber family\u2019s lawyer, S. Lee Merritt, said he planned to sue the City of Barstow and its Police Department by the end of the week.\u201cThis is the worst case of excessive force that I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Mr. Merritt said. \u201cFrom the sheer volume of rounds that were shot at the car, to the circumstances surrounding it.\u201d\u201cUnless you know they are actively engaging you with gunfire, its hard to justify shooting at four people, when, at best, the driver was committing the criminal act,\u201d he continued.Mr. Yarber, he said, \u201cwasn\u2019t complying \u2014 and they decided to execute him for it.\u201dNeither a Barstow police captain nor a city spokesman returned a phone message on Wednesday night seeking comment.Barstow police officers had responded to a call about a suspicious vehicle in the parking lot of the Walmart, the authorities said. They believed the driver was \u201ca subject wanted for questioning in a recent crime involving a stolen vehicle,\u201d one of the releases said.When the officers got to the Walmart, they found the car, a black Mustang, in the parking lot. The car had been moving, but came to a stop in a parking spot. The officers got out of their vehicles and told the driver of the Mustang to do the same, the authorities said.In their release, the Barstow police said Mr. Yarber first \u201cbegan accelerating his vehicle in reverse, striking a police vehicle.\u201d\u201cThe vehicle then accelerated forward toward the officers, and then accelerated in reverse toward officers and striking another patrol vehicle,\u201d the Barstow police said. \u201cAfterward, an officer-involved shooting ensued.\u201dThe video posted by Mr. King shows the shooting in real time for a total of about seven seconds. Mr. Merritt confirmed that the video is of the shooting involving Mr. Yarber.It was not clear what happened before the recording started or after it ended. In the video, rapid gunfire can be heard as a black car appears to drive slowly in reverse.A version of the same video that has been slowed down appears to show the car beginning to back up, just before two gunshots ring out; almost immediately after, the car appears to back into or swipe what looks like a police vehicle. (Mr. Merritt claims that the police vehicle moved into the Mustang\u2019s path.) The gunfire continues in rapid succession.Mr. Yarber, who Mr. Merritt said had been struck repeatedly, was pronounced dead at the scene, the authorities said. Another passenger, a woman identified by Mr. Merritt as Mariana Tafoya, was also struck by gunfire and was airlifted to a hospital, the police said. Mr. Merritt said she had been struck in the abdomen and the leg.The two other passengers, both men, got out of the Mustang during the episode, and one of them sustained what the authorities called \u201cminor injuries.\u201dThe San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s Department\u2019s specialized investigations division is investigating the shooting. A department spokeswoman referred questions about it to the Barstow police.Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "San Francisco\u2019s Big Seismic Gamble", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Sailors arriving in San Francisco in the 19th century used two giant redwood trees perched on a hill to help guide their ships into the bay. The redwoods were felled for their lumber at around the time of the gold rush, but San Francisco now has a new beacon: Salesforce Tower, the tallest office building in the West.Clustered around the 1,070-foot tower are a collection of high rises built on the soft soil and sand on the edge of the bay. They represent a bold symbol of a new San Francisco, but also a potential danger for a city that sits precariously on unstable, earthquake-prone ground.San Francisco lives with the certainty that the Big One will come. But the city is also putting up taller and taller buildings clustered closer and closer together because of the state\u2019s severe housing shortage. Now those competing pressures have prompted an anxious rethinking of building regulations. Experts are sending this message: The building code does not protect cities from earthquakes nearly as much as you might think.It\u2019s been over a century \u2014 Wednesday marks the 112th anniversary \u2014  since the last devastating earthquake and subsequent inferno razed San Francisco. Witnesses on the morning of April 18, 1906, described the city\u2019s streets as rising and falling like a ribbon carried by the wind.The violent shaking ignited a fire that lasted three days, destroying 500 city blocks and 28,000 buildings.Half of the population of around 400,000 was made homeless. Many were forced to flee the city.San Francisco BaySan Francisco BayMillennium Tower2009: 645 feet340 Fremont2016: 440 feetSalesforce Tower 2018: 1,070 feet555 California St.1969: 779 feetTransamerica Pyramid 1971: 853 feetMarket St.San Francisco BayMillennium Tower2009: 645 feetSalesforce Tower 2018: 1,070 feet555 California St.1969: 779 feetMarket St.MillenniumTower2009SalesforceTower 2018555California St.1969Market St.Millennium Tower2009: 645 feet340 Fremont2016: 440 feetSalesforce Tower 2018: 1,070 feet555 California St.1969: 779 feetTransamerica Pyramid 1971: 853 feetMarket St.San Francisco BayAn airship captured the devastation in San Francisco after the 1906 earthquake and fire. With the city  leveled, Los Angeles quickly grew to capture San Francisco\u2019s place as the premier city of the West.California has strict building requirements to protect schools and hospitals from a major earthquake. But not skyscrapers. A five-story building has the same strength requirements as a 50-story building.Yet skyscrapers cast a much broader shadow of risk across a city and their collapse or impairment could cause a cascade of consequences.How safe are San Francisco\u2019s skyscrapers? Even the engineers who design them can\u2019t provide exact answers. Earthquakes are too unpredictable. And too few major cities have been tested by major temblors.\u201cThe profession does the best job we can to model and predict, but there are a number of uncertainties,\u201d said Ron Hamburger, one of the country\u2019s leading structural engineers. \u201cWe don\u2019t have as many records, particularly for large magnitude earthquakes, as we would like.\u201dPrevious earthquakes have revealed flaws with some skyscrapers. A widely used welding technique was found to rupture during the 1994 Northridge earthquake in Los Angeles. (Many buildings in San Francisco and Los Angeles have not been retrofitted.)California has made significant strides in earthquake preparedness over the past century. Freeway overpasses, bridges and some municipal buildings have been strengthened. Many Californians live in single-family wood frame homes, which have been found to hold up relatively well during earthquakes.But until recently, high-rise buildings were not a focus of San Francisco\u2019s seismic safety.Newer high rises across California, which are typically built around a concrete core, are designed using computer modeling.This raises concerns among experts such as Thomas H. Heaton, the director of the Earthquake Engineering Research Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology and perhaps the most prominent skeptic of building high rises in earthquake zones.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like getting in a new airplane that\u2019s only been designed on paper but nobody has ever flown in it,\u201d he said.Last September, San Francisco\u2019s former mayor, Edwin M. Lee, responding to a scandal about a skyscraper that was sinking and leaning, ordered city officials to strengthen building codes for high rises and requested an independent study on their safety.\u201cIt would have been great to do this before this building boom in San Francisco,\u201d Ms. Hortacsu said. \u201cBut we are going to seize the moment and make the best out of it.\u201dFor years the city restricted building height to 500 feet in most neighborhoods. The objection to high rises was largely cultural and aesthetic \u2014 critics deplored \u201cManhattanization\u201d and said high rises were not in keeping with the ethos of the city.But by 2004, city officials had put in motion a plan to redevelop a neighborhood of warehouses and vacant lots that today are the heart of downtown.The city pushed for the construction of a tall, iconic building \u2014 the future Salesforce Tower, which can be seen in the right half of this photograph, shimmering over its neighbors.\u201cWe saw that as a symbol of the new San Francisco and we wanted the building to be at least 1,000 feet in height,\u201d said Dean Macris, a key figure in conceiving the new high-rise San Francisco who led the planning board under four mayors.Now retired, Mr. Macris said the issue of seismic safety of high rises was \u201cnever a factor\u201d in the redevelopment plans of the South of Market area, or SoMa, as it\u2019s known.What shifted the debate on seismic safety was the sinking and tilting of the 58-floor Millennium Tower.When it was completed in 2009, the building won numerous awards for ingenuity from engineering associations, including Outstanding Structural Engineering Project of the Year by the San Francisco office of the American Society of Civil Engineers.The developer and city officials knew of the building\u2019s flaws for years, but kept them confidential until 2016, when news leaked to the public. The latest measurements, taken in December, show that the building has sunk a foot and a half and is leaning 14 inches toward neighboring high rises. It is across the street from Salesforce Tower and right next to a transit hub for buses, trains and eventually high speed rail that is being touted as the Grand Central of the West.With the Millennium Tower, San Francisco got a foretaste of what it means to have a structurally compromised skyscraper. If the city is hit by a severe earthquake, experts fear there could be many more.The area around Millennium Tower is considered among the most hazardous for earthquakes. The United States Geological Survey rates the ground there \u2014 layers of mud and clay \u2014 as having a very high risk of acting like quicksand during an earthquake, a process known as liquefaction.TREASUREISLANDSanFranciscoGolden GateBridgeGoldenGateLikelihood that ground willliquefy in an earthquakeNORTHBEACHPRESIDIOBay BridgeVERY HIGHFINANCIALDISTRICTMarket StreetRICHMONDDISTRICTSOUTH OFMARKETGolden Gate ParkPacific OceanSan FranciscoBayMISSIONDISTRICT19th Ave.Twin PeaksSAN ANDREAS FAULTSAN FRANCISCOHUNTERSPOINT1 MILETREASUREISLANDSanFranciscoGolden GateBridgeGoldenGateLikelihood that ground willliquefy in an earthquakeNORTHBEACHPRESIDIOFINANCIALDISTRICTBay BridgeVERY HIGHMarket StreetRICHMONDDISTRICTSOUTH OFMARKETGolden Gate ParkPacific OceanSan FranciscoBayMISSIONDISTRICTTwin Peaks19th Ave.SAN ANDREAS FAULTSAN FRANCISCOHUNTERSPOINT1 MILETREASUREISLANDSanFranciscoGolden GateBridgeGoldenGateLikelihood that ground willliquefy in an earthquakeNORTHBEACHPRESIDIOFINANCIALDISTRICTBay BridgeVERY HIGHMarket StreetRICHMONDDISTRICTSOUTH OFMARKETGolden Gate ParkPacific OceanSan FranciscoBayMISSIONDISTRICTTwin Peaks19th Ave.SAN ANDREAS FAULTSAN FRANCISCOHUNTERSPOINT1 MILELikelihood thatground will liquefyin an earthquakeGolden GateBridgeGoldenGateVERY HIGHSanFranciscoFINANCIALDISTRICTPRESIDIOBay BridgeRICHMONDDISTRICTSOUTH OFMARKETGolden Gate ParkSan FranciscoBayMISSIONDISTRICT19th Ave.Twin PeaksSAN FRANCISCO1 MILELikelihood that ground will liquefy in an earthquakeVERY HIGHFINANCIALDISTRICTSOUTH OFMARKETGolden Gate ParkSanFranciscoBay19th Ave.MISSIONDISTRICTSAN FRANCISCO1 MILETREASUREISLANDSanFranciscoGolden GateBridgeGoldenGateLikelihood that ground willliquefy in an earthquakeNORTHBEACHPRESIDIOBay BridgeVERY HIGHFINANCIALDISTRICTMarket StreetBuildings tallerthan 240 ft.RICHMONDDISTRICTSOUTH OFMARKETGolden Gate ParkPacific OceanSan FranciscoBayMISSIONDISTRICT19th Ave.Twin PeaksSAN ANDREAS FAULTSAN FRANCISCOHUNTERSPOINT1 MILETREASUREISLANDSanFranciscoGolden GateBridgeGoldenGateLikelihood that ground willliquefy in an earthquakeNORTHBEACHPRESIDIOFINANCIALDISTRICTBay BridgeVERY HIGHBuildings tallerthan 240 ft.Market StreetRICHMONDDISTRICTSOUTH OFMARKETGolden Gate ParkPacific OceanSan FranciscoBayMISSIONDISTRICTTwin Peaks19th Ave.SAN ANDREAS FAULTSAN FRANCISCOHUNTERSPOINT1 MILETREASUREISLANDSanFranciscoGolden GateBridgeGoldenGateLikelihood that ground willliquefy in an earthquakeNORTHBEACHPRESIDIOFINANCIALDISTRICTBay BridgeVERY HIGHBuildings tallerthan 240 ft.Market StreetRICHMONDDISTRICTSOUTH OFMARKETGolden Gate ParkPacific OceanSan FranciscoBayMISSIONDISTRICTTwin Peaks19th Ave.SAN ANDREAS FAULTSAN FRANCISCOHUNTERSPOINT1 MILELikelihood that ground will liquefy in an earthquakeVERY HIGHFINANCIALDISTRICTBuildingstaller than240 ft.SOUTH OFMARKETGolden Gate ParkSanFranciscoBay19th Ave.MISSIONDISTRICTSAN FRANCISCO1 MILELikelihood thatground will liquefyin an earthquakeGolden GateBridgeGoldenGateVERY HIGHSanFranciscoFINANCIALDISTRICTPRESIDIOBay BridgeBuildingstaller than240 ft.RICHMONDDISTRICTSOUTH OFMARKETGolden Gate ParkSan FranciscoBayMISSIONDISTRICT19th Ave.Twin PeaksSAN FRANCISCO1 MILEAt least 100 buildings taller than 240 feet were built in areas that have a \u201cvery high\u201d chance of liquefaction.In light of the problems with the Millennium Tower, there are now increasing calls in California for a reassessment of earthquake risks, much of it focused on strengthening the building code.Right now the code says a structure must be engineered to have a 90 percent chance of avoiding total collapse. But many experts believe that is not enough.The code also does not specify that a building be fit for occupancy after an earthquake. Many buildings might not collapse completely, but they could be damaged beyond repair. The interior walls, the plumbing, elevators \u2014 all could be wrecked or damaged.\u201cWhen I tell people what the current building code gives them most people are shocked,\u201d Dr. Jones said. \u201cEnough buildings will be so badly damaged that people are going to find it too hard to live in L.A. or San Francisco.\u201dIn January a Southern California assemblyman, Adrin Nazarian, introduced a bill in the State Legislature that would require the building code to make new buildings strong enough for \u201cfunctional recovery\u201d after an earthquake. The bill passed its first hurdle, a committee hearing, last week.Driving the push to change the code is the notion that California has so much more to lose than it did in 1906.The billions of dollars of infrastructure, headquarters of global industries and the denser, more vertical downtown make San Francisco a much more interconnected and vulnerable place.The goal of the code, say proponents of a stronger one, should be the survival of cities \u2014 strengthening water systems, electrical grids and cellular networks \u2014 not just individual buildings.\u201cWe\u2019ve been sitting on our hands for decades about this problem,\u201d said Keith Porter, a seismic engineer at the University of Colorado, who is hoping to spur greater public participation in a debate.Dr. Porter\u2019s research offers warnings on the economic consequences of a major earthquake in the San Francisco Bay Area. He has calculated that one out of every four buildings in the Bay Area might not be usable after a magnitude 7 earthquake, which although severe is not the worst the area could experience.The map below shows areas where strong ground shaking is expected during an earthquake. At least 100 so-called soft-story buildings that require mandatory retrofitting are noncompliant \u2014 and most are in the area of anticipated strong shaking.TREASUREISLANDSanFranciscoGolden GateBridgeGoldenGateAreas expected to experiencestrong shaking in alarge-magnitude earthquake.NORTHBEACHPRESIDIOBay BridgeFINANCIALDISTRICTMarket StreetOlder, wood-frame multistory buildings thatneed to be retrofittedto comply withcity regulations.RICHMONDDISTRICTSOUTH OFMARKETGolden Gate ParkPacific OceanSan FranciscoBayMISSIONDISTRICT19th Ave.Twin PeaksSAN ANDREAS FAULTSAN FRANCISCOHUNTERSPOINT1 MILETREASUREISLANDSanFranciscoGolden GateBridgeGoldenGateAreas expected to experiencestrong shaking in alarge-magnitude earthquake.NORTHBEACHPRESIDIOFINANCIALDISTRICTBay BridgeOlder, wood-frame multistory buildings thatneed to be retrofitted tocomply with city regulations.Market StreetRICHMONDDISTRICTSOUTH OFMARKETGolden Gate ParkPacific OceanSan FranciscoBayMISSIONDISTRICTTwin Peaks19th Ave.SAN ANDREAS FAULTSAN FRANCISCOHUNTERSPOINT1 MILETREASUREISLANDSanFranciscoGolden GateBridgeGoldenGateAreas expected to experiencestrong shaking in alarge-magnitude earthquake.NORTHBEACHPRESIDIOFINANCIALDISTRICTBay BridgeOlder, wood-frame multistory buildings thatneed to be retrofitted tocomply with city regulations.Market StreetRICHMONDDISTRICTSOUTH OFMARKETGolden Gate ParkPacific OceanSan FranciscoBayMISSIONDISTRICTTwin Peaks19th Ave.SAN ANDREAS FAULTSAN FRANCISCOHUNTERSPOINT1 MILEAreas expected to experience strong shaking in alarge-magnitude earthquake.Older, wood-frame multistory buildings that need to be retrofitted tocomply with city regulations.Golden GateBridgeGoldenGateSanFranciscoFINANCIALDISTRICTPRESIDIOBay BridgeRICHMONDDISTRICTSOUTH OFMARKETGolden Gate ParkSan FranciscoBayMISSIONDISTRICT19th Ave.Twin PeaksSAN FRANCISCO1 MILEAreas expected to experience strong shaking in a large-magnitude earthquake.Older, wood-frame multistory buildings thatneed to be retrofitted to comply with city regulations.Golden GateBridgeSanFranciscoFINANCIALDISTRICTPRESIDIOSOUTH OFMARKETSanFranciscoBayGolden Gate Park19th Ave.MISSIONDISTRICTSAN FRANCISCO1 MILEDr. Porter calculates, hypothetically, that if buildings were built to a stronger standard, only 6 percent of buildings would be unusable.Some structural engineers, however, say our modern crop of high rises are strong enough.Ron Klemencic, the chief executive of Magnusson Klemencic Associates, the company that did the structural engineering for Salesforce Tower, says he agrees that water and sewage systems need higher strength requirements, but not high rises. \u201cBuildings falling on top of other buildings \u2014 that\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d Mr. Klemencic said.How much would stronger buildings cost to build?At a time when the average price of a home in San Francisco is above $1.2 million, even a marginal increase in price tag is bound to meet resistance.\u201cWe are already facing the concern of extremely high cost of housing and displacement,\u201d said Brian Strong, the director of the office of resilience in San Francisco\u2019s city government. In recent years the city has been focused on other seismic dangers, including older, low-rise apartment buildings with inadequate ground floor structures that could collapse, known as soft stories.Charles Richter, the earthquake pioneer who invented the scale used to measure their power, had strong opinions about skyscrapers. Don\u2019t build them in California, he said.In the years since Mr. Richter\u2019s death in 1985, construction materials have become stronger and engineering more precise.In recent decades scientists have recorded violent ground motions that were previously thought impossible. A soon-to-be-published paper by Caltech engineers showed that an earthquake with a similar intensity of the one that struck Chichi, Taiwan in 1999 would bring down or render unusable numerous steel frame high rises in Los Angeles.\u201cPeople say, \u2018Don\u2019t worry about it, it\u2019s an outlier,\u2019\u201d Dr. Kanamori said. \u201cThis is the problem with earthquakes. By nature of the process there are a lot of unpredictable elements.\u201cAnd a single event can be catastrophic,\u201d he said.Sources: City and County of San Francisco (building footprints); Skyscraper Center, Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (building heights)Additional work by K.K.

{"Headline": "When Mr. Gates Went to Washington", "Date": "2018-04-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Mark Zuckerberg show in Washington this past week stirred memories for Senator Orrin G. Hatch. The global interest, the overflow crowds and the gavel-to-gavel media coverage, the 84-year-old Utah Republican observed, was \u201cthe most intense public scrutiny I\u2019ve seen for a tech-related hearing since the Microsoft hearing.\u201dTwenty years ago, the tech titan in the Senate hot seat was another Harvard dropout, Bill Gates, co-founder and chief executive of Microsoft. At the time, Microsoft was the most feared corporate powerhouse in America, and the target of government investigations for uncompetitive practices. Mr. Gates was its fearless leader \u2014 and he made it clear that he wouldn\u2019t change his ways for Washington.If Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s conciliatory performance in front of multiple congressional committees was any guide, he took the history lesson to heart. It also showed how many debates about the technology industry have evolved from traditional antitrust issues to more complex issues like privacy and the companies\u2019 role in democracy.Mr. Gates used the forum to explain Microsoft\u2019s role at the forefront of an \u201cindustry that has revolutionized the world in only 25 years.\u201d At times, he seemed to be lecturing the less intelligent. And any criticism of Microsoft he seemed to regard as a personal attack. \u201cWhat do you mean me, too?\u201d he snapped at one point.The policy issue, according to Mr. Gates, was clear: \u201cWill the United States continue its breathtaking technological advances?\u201d T he question \u201ccan be answered resoundingly yes \u2014 if innovation is not restricted by government,\u201d he said.\u201cAs I hope my testimony today has made clear, the computer software industry is not broken, and there is no need to fix it,\u201d Mr. Gates said.He wasn\u2019t alone. The company\u2019s leadership could be downright belligerent in its public statements. At a company event, Steve Ballmer, then a top executive and later Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, made a memorable personal attack on the attorney general of the United States.\u201cTo heck with Janet Reno,\u201d Mr. Ballmer said, a sentence that still makes current and former Microsoft executives cringe two decades later.A spokesman for Microsoft declined to comment, as did representatives for Mr. Gates and Mr. Ballmer.It was clear from the start of Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony that he had arrived in Washington with a different message. Shedding his hoodie for a suit, and intensively coached, he appeared humbled and deferential to his congressional interlocutors, even when facing the types of technically unsophisticated questions that easily vexed Mr. Gates during his time in the hot seat.Mr. Zuckerberg, 33, apologized repeatedly for not doing enough to halt the issue at hand \u2014 the spread of misinformation on Facebook and the unauthorized use of personal data by outside firms.\u201cWe didn\u2019t take a broad enough view of our responsibility, and that was a big mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was my mistake, and I\u2019m sorry.\u201dThe difference was clear, said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, who has seen both Facebook and Microsoft up close. He questioned Mr. Zuckerberg in Congress, and in the 1990s, as Connecticut\u2019s attorney general, he helped lead the states\u2019 antitrust assault on Microsoft.\u201cFacebook has already taken very much to heart the clear lessons of Microsoft, which is to engage fully and aggressively in dialogue with federal powers,\u201d he said by phone. \u201cMicrosoft basically refused to have any real conversations with D.O.J. or the states before we filed suit. Essentially, it stonewalled negotiations before there was a judgment by the courts.\u201dAsked if the example of Microsoft had guided any of Facebook\u2019s strategy in dealing with federal powers, a Facebook spokeswoman said, \u201cAs Mark told Congress, we made mistakes and we\u2019re taking action to make sure that they don\u2019t happen again.\u201cEverything we\u2019re doing has been guided by the understanding that we need to do better,\u201d the spokeswoman, Vanessa Chan, added.By March 1998, when Mr. Gates appeared in Congress, Microsoft seemed all but invincible, its market dominance and ambitions at their peak. It had made forays into online commerce, media and advertising, and executives in one industry after another anxiously awaited the company\u2019s next move.Bankers raised the specter of a new online rival: The First National Bank of Redmond they called it, referring to Microsoft\u2019s headquarters in Redmond, Wash. Rupert Murdoch declared that the company he feared most was Microsoft. Microsoft had its own online magazine, Slate, as well as newsroom and programming studios, and it joined forces with NBC to help start MSNBC.The first internet boom was also in full swing, and Microsoft\u2019s Windows software \u2014 the operating system on 90 percent of the world\u2019s personal computers \u2014 controlled that gateway to the future with its browser, Internet Explorer.But there was an insurgent in Microsoft\u2019s world, the Silicon Valley start-up Netscape, creator of the first commercially successful internet browser. The browser had the potential to be the on ramp to the internet, undermining Windows. Microsoft portrayed Internet Explorer as a mere feature of its operating system. The software giant was intent on winning the \u201cbrowser war\u201d with Netscape, using every weapon it had to squelch the upstart.The federal government and several states investigated Microsoft\u2019s behavior. Years of tangles with competition regulators in Europe followed, along with a string of private antitrust lawsuits.After it lost the federal antitrust case in America, Microsoft, with little choice, sued for peace, spending billions of dollars in settlements and fines. It submitted to monitors who would file regular reports on the company\u2019s compliance with its settlements. Several years later, Mr. Gates gave up day-to-day control of the company and became the country\u2019s leading philanthropist.\u201cThe view was that government was irrelevant and we can do anything we want,\u201d said David Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School, who has studied Microsoft for years. \u201cThere was little respect for government, and that was the culture inside Microsoft at the time.\u201dToday, Facebook finds itself squarely in the public spotlight, but confronting a different set of policy challenges.The concern about Microsoft was economic. Consumers might pay somewhat higher prices, but mainly they would suffer because future innovations would be thwarted.Facebook is under attack because of privacy concerns, its data-handling practices and its vulnerability to be used by others to spread lies, hatred and political propaganda. The main worry is that the social network is being manipulated to shape human behavior. And Facebook\u2019s data harvesting and the potential impact are far more personal than anything Microsoft did.Tom Rubin, a former senior lawyer at Microsoft who is now a lecturer at Stanford University, sees many parallels between the government scrutiny of Microsoft and of Facebook, which he discussed with a class on tech policy at the school this past week.\u201cThey both involve an allegation that a digital gatekeeper, with insufficient internal controls, drove for dominance by harming the ecosystem in which it operates,\u201d said Mr. Rubin, who was an assistant United States attorney before joining Microsoft.But the stakes now, he said, are higher than in the days when the public was still figuring out how to get onto the internet. \u201cCompetition in the marketplace for browsers pales in comparison to protecting personal privacy and a functioning democracy,\u201d Mr. Rubin said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to conceive of a higher priority for legislators and regulators than that.\u201dOne risk for Facebook could come from an emerging group of antitrust experts who advocate expanding the definition of consumer welfare beyond pricing and innovation, to include the impact on workers, small retailers and privacy. The German antitrust authorities are pursuing a case against Facebook alleging that its market dominance essentially forces users to accept a service that violates their privacy.But that approach, most experts say, is a stretch, particularly in the United States.\u201cThe idea is that they\u2019re big, so antitrust should be used to address the problem,\u201d said Andrew I. Gavil, a law professor at Howard University. \u201cBut if you\u2019re looking for a privacy remedy, antitrust is not the right tool.\u201dAn alternative threat is much stricter privacy regulation, following the European lead. The European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, which goes into effect next month, is far more restrictive than data collection and trading practices in America. It requires companies to collect and store only the minimum amount of user data needed to provide a specific, stated service.In the United States, that would mean stronger laws and more resources for privacy and data-protection enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission and states.\u201cThat is arguably a much more effective solution to this kind of problem \u2014 get the privacy regime right,\u201d said William Kovacic, an antitrust expert at the George Washington University Law School and a former chairman of the F.T.C.But like the antitrust concerns, any major overhaul of privacy law in Washington appears unlikely anytime soon.Still, the smart move for Facebook, said A. Douglas Melamed, who was a senior antitrust official in the Justice Department during the Microsoft case, would be to depart from the old Microsoft playbook of resistance and embrace new, tougher rules on privacy and data-handling practices \u2014 and help guide them.\u201cThat would move the conversation away from \u2018Are these bad guys?\u2019 to \u2018How can we work together to solve these problems?\u2019\u201d Mr. Melamed, a professor at Stanford Law School, said. \u201cAnd if Facebook really does that, Mark Zuckerberg is likely to get answers he can live with and that actually might be helpful.\u201dWhat Facebook wants to avoid, said Charles Fitzgerald, a former Microsoft strategist who is now an angel investor in tech start-ups, is what happened to Microsoft: The double whammy of government and legal entanglements and a stock price in the dumps had consequences for Microsoft\u2019s ability to hold on to talent.Facebook, he said, could see the same phenomenon if its growth slows and employees tire of oversight and constant attacks on the company\u2019s reputation.\u201cThe combination of a flat or declining stock price and having to spend lots of time on miserable legal issues instead of building product made a lot of people rethink how they wanted to spend their days,\u201d Mr. Fitzgerald said. \u201cAnd Facebook employees may have a harder time gazing in an ethical mirror.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The company did not claim the new accounts and pages had violated the company\u2019s policies, but it said they had been taken down because of the Internet Research Agency\u2019s past fraud.\u201cWe removed this latest set of pages and accounts solely because they were controlled by the I.R.A. \u2014 not based on the content,\u201d Mr. Stamos wrote. \u201cThis included commentary on domestic and international political issues, the promotion of Russian culture and tourism as well as debate on more everyday issues.\u201dHe said that more than a million people had followed the Facebook pages and that 493,000 had followed the Instagram accounts. He said the company would update a tool on its help center to allow Facebook and Instagram users to find out whether they had followed the pages and users.The company also removed $167,000 worth of ads purchased by the Russian-controlled pages since 2015, Mr. Stamos said.In February, Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the election, indicted 13 Russians associated with the Internet Research Agency, including Yevgeny Prigozhin, a Russian businessman with Kremlin ties who the indictment said controlled the Internet Research Agency and related businesses.None of those Russians have been arrested, and Russia is not expected to extradite any of them to the United States. But the indictments were widely viewed as Mr. Mueller\u2019s effort to establish that crimes had been committed in the Russian interference, which President Trump has frequently derided as a \u201choax.\u201dThe Internet Research Agency and similar operations with ties to Russian government officials have carried out influence operations not only in the United States but also in Russia and many other countries in Eastern and Western Europe. The campaigns have generally reflected Kremlin political goals, attacking critics of Russia inside and outside the country.Facebook also released in the blog post on Tuesday several examples of the material it had taken down, including a photo of Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, offering a toast; scantily clad sunbathers in snowy Siberia; and tourist shots of St. Petersburg. The company said it would make more material public.Representative Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said he was pleased that Facebook had made its actions public. He said the report \u201cdemonstrates that activity linked to the I.R.A. has continued on social media platforms and did not cease when their activities were exposed last year.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "It\u2019s Mueller, Not Trump, Who Is Draining the Swamp", "Date": "2018-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe themes of corruption and white-collar malfeasance link the cases of those caught up in the special counsel\u2019s inquiry. Their indictments shed light on the culture of influence peddling and less-than-savory financial transactions that Mr. Trump promised to root out if elected president. (He has done the opposite.)Keep in mind that Watergate, too, was a story about anonymous flows of money to political campaigns. Two chronicles of Richard Nixon\u2019s downfall stand out as particularly insightful right now: Elizabeth Drew\u2019s \u201cWashington Journal,\u201d a diary of the author\u2019s life while covering the scandal, and Leon Neyfakh\u2019s \u201cSlow Burn,\u201d a podcast on Watergate ephemera. These works don\u2019t tell the story of Watergate straight through but, instead, describe the experience of blundering through the scandal in a state of perpetual confusion, not knowing which parts of the story were important or what the overall story was.The United States is in a similar place today. In the midst of the chaos, seeing the Mueller investigation as an uncovering of corruption can elucidate one thread of the current story, even as the special counsel continues his bigger-picture study of obstruction and election interference away from the public eye.Instead, addressing them will require political will. The prosecution of Mr. Manafort may bring some justice, for example, but the loopholes that made possible the graft he is accused still exist for others to potentially exploit. In the absence of stricter, better-enforced regulations, foreign money will continue to be able to flow into United States elections.These are issues to which Mr. Mueller cannot provide a solution, however long the public waits. Mr. Mueller is both a prosecutor and a storyteller. But the response to the story he tells is up to the country to determine through politics.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Power of Pictures: Viewing History Through America's Library", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLENSAnne Wilkes Tucker was granted special access to the Library of Congress\u2019 photographic archives of over 14 million pictures and has curated an exhibit featuring more than 440 images at the Annenberg Space for Photography in Los Angeles. Ms. Tucker, the curator emerita of Houston\u2019s Museum of Fine Arts, chose a wide array of mostly rare and never before exhibited images that highlight the collection\u2019s breadth and depth for the show \u201cNot an Ostrich: And Other Images From America\u2019s Library,\u201d which opens April 21. Ms. Tucker spoke with James Estrin, and their conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.Q: How did this show come to be?So, for a year and a half, for a week to two weeks every month, I went and sat in the Library of Congress. Q: What did you do there?I looked at slides. I looked at contact sheets. I looked at prints. I looked at stereos.Q: That must have been a great deal of fun.We ended up deciding that it couldn\u2019t just be the uncataloged images because you have to include Dorothea Lange, the Wright brothers and the Hindenburg. Uncataloged didn\u2019t necessarily mean previously unknown.I was surprised and saddened that we keep publishing the same Farm Security Administration pictures over and over and over again when there are so many other great ones out there, especially pictures taken in the Midwest and the West. Q: Most of these images were not online or even cataloged. Will these in the exhibit be put online?Q: It\u2019s better than the gift shop. It\u2019s free! Q: I want to say I hope not, but I don\u2019t see where there\u2019s any chance not.Q: How did you organize the show?Q: What was the Detroit Publishing Company? For each section there are some digital prints too, including the portraits of Lincoln, Gordon Park\u2019s American Gothic, Dorothea Lange and the Harriet Tubman photo the Library of Congress just acquired.Q: Tell me something you learned while doing this. The Library owns what is, as far as anyone knows, the earliest made self-portrait, which of course has now been deemed the library\u2019s selfie. There was a man in 1839, who read about it happening in Paris, made his own camera, went out in the yard and took his self portrait. Q: And that\u2019s the only way we know this man? Q: So how do you choose when you\u2019re looking at tens of thousands of images?Then I began to ask the staff to bring me their favorites. Q: So you responded at first by delight, but at the end of it, how did you make decisions? I tried to get complex pictures and simple pictures, and I was also conscious of the history of photography. So we go from daguerreotypes to digital. We even have a spirit photograph. Q: So by looking at the uncataloged images, for the most part you\u2019re looking at the photos that didn\u2019t make the canon. Like the lesser known Farm Security Administration photos.Q: What were the most important photos for you that you found that you didn\u2019t know, or that weren\u2019t online?

{"Headline": "Facebook, Generator of Envy and Dread", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBig CityWe knew this because we have stood on sweltering subway platforms in Midtown, in July, scrolling through a Facebook feed and discovering that our friends \u2014 in many cases people we did not really know or particularly care for \u2014 were feeling blessed to be eating lobster salad on sailboats off Nantucket or learning so much about Joyce in Dublin with an Oxford don as a paid personal guide.We felt bad in a way that was diagnosable; several years ago the popular psychological press had come up with the term \u201cFacebook envy\u2019\u2019 to describe the particular sense of despair that arises when we encounter the gloating, verbal or visual, of others on the site.The experiment had half of its subjects continue their Facebook rituals and the other half abstain from them. Thirteen percent of the abstainers could not keep away and wound up succumbing to their addiction. In the end, those who had no contact with Facebook during the course of a week rated their general sense of satisfaction higher than those who retained their habit.At present I have 3,423 Facebook friends most of whom I do not know, or know only tangentially. Had it not been for Facebook, I would not have heard that the wife of a former colleague I had not seen or been in touch with for more than 15 years had suffered a brain aneurysm. She survived, miraculously, but she was a relatively young mother who was going about her life only to come very close to death unexpectedly.I felt horribly for her and her family, but because of the distancing intimacy that provides Facebook\u2019s context, I could more easily indulge my own spiraling anxiety than anything else. Facebook became the processing mechanism that quickly turned compassion into a kind of self-obsessed and paralyzing fear. \u201cTomorrow, I could wake up with a brain aneurysm,\u201d became the predominant thought.Of course hearing this sort of story outside the world of Facebook could certainly produce the same reaction, it is just that Facebook allows you to go deep, to become privy to information you might not otherwise ever have, to see the hospital photos and read through the threads in which other people closer to the person afflicted might weigh in with the stories of their own similar ailments. Recently, a writer I had profiled years ago posted on Facebook that he had cancer. He specifically asked that others refrain from commenting with their own cancer stories because it was more than he could handle.Last year, I became compelled by the entry of a man whose wife had been hospitalized with an acute form of psychosis that followed a week of serious depression. Two weeks earlier, he had posted a picture of them looking cheerful at an Italian restaurant. What had happened in the interim? I felt I had the right to know, while at the same time, I felt it would have been awkward and intrusive to send good thoughts and caring wishes as his actual friends had done. This voyeurism seemed much more invidious than whatever bitterness I might feel over the fact that someone else was on an eating tour of Umbria when I was not.The news is a delivery system for misery of course, especially now, but Facebook brings us news we might otherwise never encounter, supplying it in bulk and elevating our relationship to it. The value of that remains dubious.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Three Reasons Deutsche Bank Didn\u2019t Exit Wall Street Earlier: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Thursday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Deutsche Bank is finally, and drastically, shrinking itself.\u2022 Facebook can afford to clean up its act.\u2022 Is the problem with I.P.O.s a \u2018middle-market tax\u2019?\u2022 On today\u2019s earnings calendar: Amazon, Microsoft, PepsiCo and Lazard.Since the financial crisis a decade ago, the German institution\u2019s giant investment banking operations have lagged well behind those of its rivals. And Deutsche Bank\u2019s problems had relevance well beyond the trading desks of Wall Street; its difficulties have at times pumped uncertainty into the global financial system. Deutsche Bank\u2019s post-crisis behavior stands in contrast to that of other European investment banks that had also become risky and bloated before the 2008 meltdown. Switzerland\u2019s Credit Suisse and UBS made hard decisions several years ago that helped them adapt to new realities. But Deutsche Bank wavered and delayed. And since this probably won\u2019t be the last time that a too-big-to-fail bank takes too long to fix itself, it\u2019s worth asking why Deutsche Bank dragged its feet. Some reasons follow:- Peter EavisDeutsche Bank\u2019s decision to end its Wall Street ambitions should benefit its American rivals.The German lender said on Thursday that it was scaling back operations such as trading and providing services to hedge funds. According to a note from Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Deutsche Bank\u2019s decision to shrink its investment banking business should \u201chelp industry pricing and provide a revenue opportunity\u201d for United States banks.Deutsche Bank\u2019s scale of tradingLast year Deutsche Bank had a 7.7 percent share of the trading in bonds, currencies and commodities, and a 5.1 percent share of stock trading.Deutsche Bank reported \u20ac4.4 billion in revenue from fixed-income trading last year and another \u20ac2.1 billion from equity trading. Of the combined \u20ac6.5 billion in revenue it generated, 40 percent came from the United States, according to a note from Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.Which banks stand to benefitJPMorgan, Bank of America and Citigroup should get a lift from Deutsche Bank\u2019s pull back from fixed-income trading. The three banks\u2019 market share of fixed-income trading is nearly 50 percent.For stock trading, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan have about 45 percent of the market.Amazon\u2019s profit more than doubled during the first quarter, while Microsoft\u2019s earnings jumped 35 percent. A driver for both companies was their cloud-computing businesses.Amazon\u2019s numbers\u2022 The e-commerce giant reported a profit of $1.6 billion, up from $724 million a year ago.\u2022 Earnings per share came in at $3.27. Analysts expected $1.26 per share, according to Thomson Reuters.\u2022 Revenue jumped 43 percent to $51 billion, beating analysts\u2019 expectations of $49.78 billion.\u2022 Operating income increased 92 percent to $1.9 billion in the first quarter.\u2022 Sales for Amazon Web Services, its cloud-computing business, increased 49 percent to $5.4 billion.Critic\u2019s corner\u201cSales have more than doubled in five years, but it\u2019s taking more fixed assets to get there. Amazon now uses property and such with less efficiency than Walmart.\u201dMicrosoft\u2019s numbers\u2022 The software giant posted a profit of $7.42 billion, up from $5.49 billion a year ago.\u2022 Earnings per share came in at 95 cents. Analysts expected 85 cents per share.\u2022 Revenue rose 16 percent to $26.82 billion, beating expectations of $25.77 billion.\u2022 Operating income rose 23 percent to $8.3 billion.\u2022 Revenue at Azure, Microsoft\u2019s could-computing business, surged 93 percent.Shares of Amazon climbed 7 percent after hours, while Microsoft\u2019s stock rose 2.1 percent.Critics\u2019 cornerSince hitting an intraday low of $150.80 on March 28, the stock has climbed 15 percent and reclaimed more than $60 billion in market value.Ross Sandler, an analyst at Barclays, writes:\u201cWe don\u2019t think 1Q marks the \u201call clear\u201d for FB shares by any means, but given the drubbing over the past two months, we think it may start an overdue stabilization period (next week\u2019s f8 should also help move the conversation back to innovation to some degree). Stepping back, FB\u2019s valuation is attractive vs. its peers, and while we fully expect more tape-bombs in 2018 we think patient investors will be rewarded at current levels when sentiment eventually improves.\u201dFacebook\u2019s first-quarter earnings featured a 63 percent jump in profit and a 49 percent rise in revenue. And roughly 70 million new monthly active users.Peter Eavis\u2019s take: If Facebook wants to spend more on protecting its community, it can: Its operating earnings are equivalent to 46 percent of its revenue. But its expense numbers haven\u2019t provided clear evidence that the company is going the extra mile yet.The key assessment, from the Pivotal analyst Brian Wieser:\u201cAll the data privacy issues, the congressional hearings, none of that will get as much scrutiny from investors as the bottom line.\u201dThe chipmaker reported results Wednesday that topped Wall Street\u2019s expectations. The conference call that followed provided analysts an opportunity to ask about where Qualcomm\u2019s acquisition of NXP stands. The deal is awaiting approval from Chinese regulators, but growing trade tension between China and the United States has increasingly put the deal in doubt.Here is what Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm\u2019s chief executive, said on the call:\u201cWe continue to work closely with China. The environment is obviously quite difficult from a geopolitical point of view, at least right now. However, we expect to ultimately receive approval. And I\u2019ll just remind folks that we have 8 of 9 jurisdictions that have already ruled on it. So although we \u2014 we remain committed to it. And we think it\u2019s going to get done. However, if it does not get done, as you mentioned, we think we have the ability to move very rapidly on a buyback as we communicated earlier in the January time frame. I\u2019ll just remind everyone that we did a 90-day extension to the merger agreement. And we\u2019re going to work very hard to get that done. And if it doesn\u2019t get done, we\u2019re going to move on to another approach. So hopefully, that answers the question.\u201dA bit later in the call Mr. Mollenkopf added:\u201cWith respect to MOFCOM and remedies, our evaluation of the environment is such that really, I think the issue is probably more related to the higher-level discussions between the countries as opposed to any individual issue related to MOFCOM. Of course, we continue to work with the regulators and work through any issues that pop up. But I think the environmental issues between the countries are probably more the situation today than anything else. But obviously, we work closely with the regulator.\u201dIt\u2019s not just regulations like Sarbanes-Oxley that put smaller companies off public listings, argues Rob Jackson, a Democratic S.E.C. commissioner \u2014 it\u2019s the fact that they pay on average 7 percent of proceeds raised in their offerings, way more than bigger clients.\u201cWith the deck stacked against them, it\u2019s no wonder that middle-market I.P.O.s have been on a steady decline. And this has had real effects across our economy, which is now dominated by fewer, and larger, public companies than ever before.\u201dHe suggests the S.E.C. should make underwriters disclose more about the costs of going public, including companies\u2019 potential losses from underpricing, and that bankers should do more to explain why they\u2019re worth their fees.What Jeffrey Lurie, the owner of the Philadelphia Eagles, said, according to the NYT:\u201cWe\u2019ve got to be careful not to be baited by Trump or whomever else.\u201dBob Kraft of the New England Patriots, a friend of Mr. Trump, said:\u201cThe problem we have is, we have a president who will use that as fodder to do his mission that I don\u2019t feel is in the best interests of America.\u201dThere\u2019s no question that it will help make sense of Randall Stephenson\u2019s expansion of AT&T into the pay-TV market and improve AT&T\u2019s positioning and value proposition.Advertisement"}

Most often, the committee members aim to please their constituents back home, the executives tactfully say as little as possible, and in the end, nothing really meaningful happens.That may not be the case for Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg on Tuesday and Wednesday. He will begin two days of testimony before congressional committees as the likelihood that his company will be hit with meaningful government regulation is increasing.First, while he was inexplicably slow and somewhat disjointed in initially addressing the Cambridge Analytica crisis, he has since developed a comprehensive \u201cnarrative.\u201d It not only addresses the company\u2019s data privacy issues but also Facebook\u2019s troubles with fake news and nefarious election influence.\u201cFacebook created an entirely new tool for connecting people for the purposes of good. We didn\u2019t anticipate bad people would use it for bad purposes. We are genuinely sorry, and I\u2019m personally accountable. We needed to broaden our sense of responsibility and will continue to keep taking meaningful actions to prevent the abuse of the tools we provide. Our business depends on the trust of our community, and so restoring that trust is our biggest business priority. The bad guys can never be fully subdued, but we will be continually learning and making Facebook safer and better.\u201dThat explanation will hardly appease Facebook\u2019s most severe critics, who want to see more drastic changes. Instead, Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s message \u2014 laced with promises of ongoing changes to come \u2014 seems designed primarily to allow Facebook to move beyond crisis.To avoid making himself a fixed target, Mr. Zuckerberg is wise to not defend Facebook\u2019s most egregious historical practices. During questioning, look for him to be highly open-minded. If threatened with regulatory intervention, assume Mr. Zuckerberg will earnestly repeat his recent assertions that Facebook would welcome reasonable regulation.The real test of Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s new malleability will come if he\u2019s asked if Facebook is considering adding a paid subscription that would allow users to avoid sharing their data with advertisers. That would mark a fundamental change in the company\u2019s business model, a shift that some say would be required to truly solve Facebook\u2019s problems. Thus far, Mr. Zuckerberg has staunchly insisted that Facebook remain free to its users.Second, Mr. Zuckerberg should benefit from his growing comfort with talking publicly about Facebook\u2019s issues. After the Cambridge Analytica story broke, Mr. Zuckerberg seemed noticeably anxious in his lone televised interview, clearly aware that the issue was far more serious than Facebook\u2019s prior controversies.But a week later, in his hourlong conference call with media, Mr. Zuckerberg seemed far more sure-footed in taking on fairly sharp questions and sometimes sounding almost eager to reply with detailed answers.Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s performance may also be enhanced by private meetings he had on Capitol Hill on Monday. Those conversations won\u2019t likely win him more favorable treatment during his testimony, but they likely served as a helpful warm-up before he sits down in front of the full committee and the live cameras.While testifying, Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s first priority is to avoid generating a new round of negative headlines by tossing off a flippant, misguided remark, or by being goaded into a petulant state.

{"Headline": "Why Facebook Still Matters to Me", "Date": "2018-04-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMs. Thakral is based in Cox\u2019s Bazar, Bangladesh, supporting the humanitarian response to the Rohingya refugee crisis.COX\u2019S BAZAR, Bangladesh \u2014 I try not to overthink it, because there are probably 101 better things to do with my time, but I spend a lot of time scrolling through, liking, laughing at, getting angry about and sharing things I see on social media. Facebook tells me I have 3,549 friends when in real life I probably have around 30.It might have something to do with my work. For the past eight years, I\u2019ve been supporting humanitarian aid work, far from where I grew up, in Alsager, England. My family and friends are all far away, so I see most of them only on Facebook. I can remember birthdays, and see friends fall in love and get married and have kids. I have never been one to pick up the phone, but give me 10 minutes on Messenger with a pal and I am instantly gratified.It took my sister a million years to get a smartphone. She claimed that her reliable Motorola flip, circa 2001, was adequate. Imagine my delight when she entered my world in 2018 and got WhatsApp. We are many time zones apart, but a love-heart-and-kisses emoji goes a long way in a second.I am really no different from anyone else using Facebook. The dog in the file cabinet made my day. I post photos of my work and travels. The only difference is that I might post updates on Instagram and my Facebook page from unusual locations \u2014 like Quetta, Pakistan, during a polio campaign; at the United Nations to see the Pope; or on my daily commute to the largest refugee camp in the world.I sometimes imagine the day I die and what people will post on my Facebook page. If only life could be like that. We could begin again to forgive, speak the truth and put hate aside. And besides that, would 3,549 people come to my funeral?It isn\u2019t just personal. This alternate community on Facebook gives people like me a chance to reach different audiences. I\u2019m a communicator by profession, and I work internationally. Facebook is my perfect partner. By being part of the global social media infrastructure, I can share information about places to which most people have no access and very little information.Facebook is often used by charities and aid agencies to communicate about emergencies so that we can raise awareness and raise funds. I am currently in Cox\u2019s Bazar, Bangladesh, working on the Rohingya response. I tell stories on social media to inform our donors and supporters about the bridges we are building to reach more refugees with food, about children who are undernourished and how we are treating them, about making the ground safe in the camps in advance of cyclone and monsoon season.For humanitarian workers, Instagram, WhatsApp and other social media platforms have become indispensable tools. They allow us to communicate faster than we could before about all sorts of things, like how many people we are feeding, new data on children with malnutrition and who\u2019s at risk from the coming monsoon. When people are crossing the border, WhatsApp helps us communicate quickly about what\u2019s needed and who is doing what to reach them so that we can coordinate our efforts.Does social media help save lives? No, of course not. People do, and the more widely information is shared on different platforms, the more likely it is that starving children, raped women and murdered husbands become everybody\u2019s business.I don\u2019t know a solution, but I do know that on this assignment I have met so many people who have been struck by the powerful images of people crossing the border from Myanmar to the safe shores of Bangladesh, and haunted by stories of their poor living conditions. \u201cWe want to help \u2014 what we can do?\u201d many ask when I tell them what I do.Personally, staying off Facebook is not an option for me. It is my address book, my village post office, the place where I can stop by when I want and have a chat and catch up. Until another platform comes along, I\u2019ll stick with it. Some people talk about needing to escape from social media. But when I\u2019m working round the clock on an emergency response, Facebook and Instagram are my escape. I can pop in to see this or that quirky post in my news feed, and sometimes clicking \u201clike\u201d is just what I need.Shelley Thakral is an international aid worker responding to the crisis involving Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Is Creepy. And Valuable.", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneOne of the most telling moments in the spectacle of Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s congressional testimony last week was when Representative Billy Long, a Missouri Republican, warned the co-founder of Facebook of what Congress was likely to do about its multiple concerns surrounding the social network. \u201cCongress is good at two things: doing nothing, and overreacting,\u201d he said. After years of the former, he said, \u201cwe\u2019re getting ready to overreact.\u201dThat sounds worrisome. But I sympathize. Doing nothing and overreacting make sense when you have no clue of what is going on. And we don\u2019t. The cloud of questions aimed at Mr. Zuckerberg \u2014 Is Facebook too dominant? Does it censor information? Whom does it share our data with? Does it help sell OxyContin? \u2014 suggests that we don\u2019t really know what the problem with Facebook is. It also suggests we don\u2019t understand what Facebook does.That goes for the entire data-driven ecosystem, from Google to the auto companies riddling your car with sensors that can tell where you\u2019ve been and how fast you got there. And that puts policymakers in an uncomfortable spot.The crucial issue for Congress, government regulators, members of the public and even Mr. Zuckerberg is how much all this data-driven stuff is worth to us. What do we stand to lose by, say, sharply limiting the data these companies can collect? What do we stand to gain?We don\u2019t know.\u201cWe don\u2019t understand the value to us of the new data economy nor the risks it entails,\u201d said Leonard Nakamura, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia who has studied the economic impact of data. \u201cWe just let it rip and now are trying to catch up.\u201d Unfortunately, we have only rudimentary tools to measure the good and the bad.As the data-driven economy continues evolving at breakneck speed, catching up may be beyond our reach; we will build the guardrails by trial and error. The risk is that policy will be driven mostly by fear.What is the problem with Facebook? Clearly Moscow\u2019s use of the platform to spread fake news and warp the 2016 elections is one problem. Allowing data from tens of millions of users to flow, without their knowledge, to a political consultancy working for Donald Trump is another.But the raw business models of the colossi of the data economy are creepy in and of themselves. Start with the sheer scale of personal data scooped up by Facebook, often without users\u2019 knowledge. The platform not only harvests the data you share with the platform, but also collects information about you from the files of other Facebook users you know. It buys data about your offline lives from data brokers \u2014 including sensitive stuff like your income and the credit cards you own. And testifying in the House, Mr. Zuckerberg admitted that Facebook sucks up information about people who are not even on Facebook, so it can aim ads at them.But policy cannot be determined only by the potential creepiness of what corporate America might do with our data. Maybe perfect price discrimination will never take off because consumers don\u2019t like it.Indeed, it is unclear to what extent consumers are repelled by any of this. Though surveys repeatedly find that Americans are concerned about their privacy, they rarely take action to stop cookies and other tools deployed to gather their data \u2014 leading scholars to coin the term \u201cprivacy paradox.\u201d As Sinan Aral of the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has noted, \u201cLots of the things that depend on ads we want as public goods.\u201dBut this must understate the data economy\u2019s contribution to our well-being. Facebook is an immensely valuable mode of communication and interaction for two billion people around the world. The company has published in-house research suggesting that people who do lots of sharing on the social network are happier and healthier.Facebook\u2019s advertising tools \u2014 the ones that use your data to figure out whether you should see an ad from the small shop in Connecticut that sells organic yarn \u2014 provide mom-and-pop operations with cost-effective marketing opportunities once reserved for large corporations.More broadly, Mr. Nakamura points out, the online economy powered by data collection and advertising is improving welfare in a way not properly captured in standard measures of economic output. This includes reams of \u201cfree\u201d music and the potential benefits from the artificial intelligence that will be trained using personal data. The consumer surplus \u2014 the benefit that we get from a good or service above and beyond the price we pay for it \u2014 is bigger than it ever was. And it will grow further.And yet if this sounds like an argument against touching the data-driven digital economy with even the slightest regulation, it is not. Worries that Facebook and some of its brethren may have become large enough to squelch innovation are legitimate. So are suspicions that it plays fast and loose with consumer data.Regulations to curb the power of the digital behemoths \u2014 say, barring them from buying up rising companies like Instagram and WhatsApp that might threaten their dominance in the future \u2014 make sense. So do policies that ensure responsible stewardship of the data they gather.\u201dI don\u2019t think the right policy position is to totally eliminate the business model, but instead to introduce some restraint,\u201d said Terrell McSweeny, the lone Democrat on the Federal Trade Commission. \u201cThe idea is to give people more control over the uses of their data and ensure companies are responsible for what is happening to it.\u201dSummoning Mr. Zuckerberg to testify suggests that Congress is no longer happy doing nothing. Hopefully, it can do better than simply overreact to its fears.Advertisement"}

After five and a half inches fell on Monday, we\u2019re expecting more snow tomorrow and through the weekend \u2014 which is looking extra chilly to boot, with temperatures about 20 degrees below normal.We\u2019re currently keeping our eye on three systems that may make a mess of the city.The first arrives tonight and could drop around an inch of snow during tomorrow morning\u2019s commute, before turning to rain.On Saturday, expect the opposite, said Faye Morrone, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service \u2014 rain in the morning, snow during the day, then more rain at night. The high on Saturday is a wintry 39, well below the average of 58.\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty cold start to the month,\u201d Ms. Morrone said. \u201cAnd that looks to continue through the weekend and into next week.\u201dDaily lows should stay in the 30s until next Thursday.And the climatological crystal ball is predicting a possible nor\u2019easter on Monday, though it\u2019s too early to know with any certainty, Ms. Morrone told us.While we wait to find out, put on a mitten and pat yourself on your back: You\u2019ve now trudged through 40.9 inches of snow this winter and spring, nearly 16 inches more than the average snow season.\u201cAny snow that we pick up in these next three chances would only bump that up,\u201d Ms. Morrone said. \u201cWe definitely seem to be in a pattern where the temperatures are cold enough to support those chances.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:As the days get longer, we\u2019ve been getting around town more by bike and bus.Maybe you are, too.With all the attention on our crumbling subway system and congestion pricing for cars, it would be easy to miss recent developments in biking and bus travel in the city.

{"Headline": "Groups in Myanmar Fire Back at Zuckerberg", "Date": "2018-04-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 Civil society groups in Myanmar on Thursday criticized Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, arguing that he mischaracterized his company\u2019s effectiveness at detecting and quashing messages encouraging violence in the country.Taking aim at comments Mr. Zuckerberg made in a recent interview, the groups said that Facebook had no consistent methods for dealing with hate speech in Myanmar. The same problems keep recurring, they said, with the company routinely failing to follow up on their comments and suggestions.\u201cSo that\u2019s the kind of thing where I think it is clear that people were trying to use our tools in order to incite real harm,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cNow, in that case, our systems detect that that\u2019s going on. We stop those messages from going through.\u201dThey also said there was no system at all, only a group of organizations and volunteers doing their best to keep up with a torrent of vitriol.\u201cIn your interview, you refer to your detection \u2018systems.\u2019 We believe your system, in this case, was us \u2014 and we were far from systematic,\u201d the letter says. \u201cFrom where we stand, this case exemplifies the very opposite of effective moderation: It reveals an overreliance on third parties, a lack of a proper mechanism for emergency escalation, a reticence to engage local stakeholders around systemic solutions and a lack of transparency.\u201dFacebook responded to the criticism in a satement on Friday. \u201cWe are sorry that Mark did not make clearer that it was the civil society groups in Myanmar who first reported these messages,\u201d it said. \u201cWe took their reports very seriously and immediately investigated ways to help prevent the spread of this content. We should have been faster, and are working hard to improve our technology and tools to detect and prevent abusive, hateful or false content.\u201dMyanmar highlights existential questions about Facebook\u2019s mission and responsibilities. The site has closely connected people in the country \u2014 in many cases, Facebook is the only online service they use. It has also become a major channel for the spread of hate speech and propaganda that has encouraged and obfuscated ethnic cleansing of the country\u2019s Muslim Rohingya, according to human rights groups.Almost 700,000 Rohingya have fled to neighboring Bangladesh since last summer, when the military started a crackdown in the country\u2019s western Rakhine State. Last month, United Nations investigators said Facebook played a role in spreading hate speech that incited violence against the Rohingya.For Mr. Zuckerberg, the timing of the letter is bad. Both he and his top deputy, Sheryl Sandberg, are making multiple media appearances this week to address questions about how the company handles users\u2019 personal data. The company has faced harsh criticism for reports on how information about millions of users may have been improperly leaked to a political consulting firm connected to President Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign.The criticism has sent the company\u2019s stock tumbling. Next week, Mr. Zuckerberg is expected to appear at multiple congressional hearings.The letter lists what the groups say are several problems with Facebook. It says the company lacks adequate tools to report messages that might incite violence. It also says Facebook failed to provide channels for organizations to communicate with data and engineering employees who might have been able to devise solutions to the problems.\u201cPresumably, your data team should be able to trace the original sources of flagged messages and posts and identify repeat offenders, using these insights to inform your moderation and sanctioning,\u201d the letter says.Jes Petersen, chief executive of Phandeeyar, said problematic messages in Myanmar were not a one-time problem.\u201cThere\u2019s multiple cases of similar things that have happened where we\u2019ve done everything we can to bring it to Facebook\u2019s attention but we don\u2019t see much happening on their end,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a big part of the problem.\u201dVictoire Rio, a social media analyst in the country who previously worked at Phandeeyar, said another major issue was Facebook\u2019s lack of Burmese speakers for local monitors to communicate directly with.\u201cIt\u2019s evident to us that there are not enough resources and not enough human resources dedicated to Myanmar,\u201d Ms. Rio said. She added that the company\u2019s Burmese-speaking reviewers were based in Dublin, and from the company\u2019s recruiting pages it seems it is struggling to find qualified candidates.The groups also faulted Facebook\u2019s lack of transparency. They said that after they had reported the messages that Mr. Zuckerberg cited in his interview, they heard nothing from the company about what happened or how Facebook would better respond.\u201cI was seriously concerned and looking for anyone I could,\u201d Ms. Rio said. \u201cI was surprised to hear that Mark had been contacted about this fairly quickly, the use of strong language was effective.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But much about Stanley Kubrick\u2019s \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey,\u201d which was released 50 years ago this week, has proved prophetic. In our era of Siri and Alexa, that particularly applies to the film\u2019s forecast that we would speak with computers powered by some form of artificial intelligence. (In the movie, Pan Am provided shuttle service to a space station stop on the way to the moon.)Here\u2019s a condensed and edited version of a conversation we had this week:Do you remember watching \u201c2001\u201d at the time of its release?I was 11 when I saw it at the Glendale Theatre in Toronto in Cinerama and it just completely blew my mind. And that\u2019s what got me interested in filmmaking. It almost seemed like a documentary to me. It was such a realistic depiction of the future.Did the film have a similar effect on Mr. Rain?It was just a job for him. It doesn\u2019t really mean anything to him and he\u2019s never seen the film.He was hired to do the narration for what was going to be an elaborate prologue to \u201c2001.\u201d They filmed interviews with all these amazing scientists and thinkers to set up the premise for the film and explain the context. But Kubrick stripped it away and didn\u2019t use the narration he\u2019d hired Rain to do.I think if Kubrick had kept all of the explanatory things it wouldn\u2019t it wouldn\u2019t be the classic that it is.So how did Mr. Rain move from there to becoming HAL?It was going to be Martin Balsam\u2019s voice. And even before that it was going to be a female voice. HAL was going to be an Athena.So the voice was probably just a combination of circumstance and a gut choice by Kubrick. He literally said to Rain, \u2018I\u2019m not happy what I have in the can,\u2019 meaning the Martin Balsam recording that had been done a year before. \u2018Would you like to play the computer?\u2019 And then, in a day and a half, it was done.Why is Mr. Rain indifferent toward the film?But I\u2019m sure if I were Rain I wouldn\u2019t want it to define my career. It would be like Alec Guinness being known just for Obi-Wan Kenobi and nothing else.A large number of you send thoughtful replies to my questions last week about how the misuse, which was initially revealed by Canadian whistle-blower Christopher Wylie, has changed the way you use Facebook. Here are a few of the highlights:I was pretty confident that an organization such as Facebook, with so much success and resources, would act smart and responsible. That is not the case we learned \u2014 not at all! I am shocked and I will surely do something.If there\u2019s a lesson to be learned from this, it is that on the long run, free stuff is fishy!\u2014Guy Pierre Poulin, St. Sauveur, QuebecI was a relatively early adopter to Facebook back in early-2005 as an undergraduate student at the University of Alberta. Since 2012 I have deleted as much data associated with my profile as possible and have not logged on or messaged anybody through Facebook.I had privacy concerns and it was a source of distraction and agitation. But I was also perceiving others in my peer group as moving swiftly ahead with their lives, in all aspects, whereas I had felt inadequate.Quitting Facebook about six years ago has been very positive decision. It\u2019s allowed for more focused \u201cdeep work\u201d and to be more engaged fully with people.\u2014Ravendra Naidoo, OttawaThe last few weeks of angst about Facebook has not changed my mind about continuing to use social media. It is the way I stay in touch with others with like interests around the globe. I do not put anything on my FB page that is not for public consumption. I limit those who can view my information and posts to friends. I unfriend anyone who posts disgusting things and stop following people who post too much. My social media account is my enjoyment and pleasure. Why would I give that up?\u2014Louann Hansen, AlbertaI suspended my Facebook account a few months ago and never looked back. I really felt it was designed to be addictive and my brain couldn\u2019t resist. I still think about friends who I may have known a bit more about if I had stayed. But those thoughts also prompt me to reconnect with them in a more active way, like email, phone or in person. I can no longer vent about politics by posting. So I now realize that any anger I feel should either be ignored or focused on something more active than pressing \u201cpost.\u201dSuspending Facebook made me much happier right away, an instant gratification that no social media activity ever gave me!\u2014Tim Wilbur, TorontoAlthough the weather doesn\u2019t seem much like it in many regions, it is April, and time for the latest post from Watching, The Times\u2019s guide to viewing, tailored for Netflix users in Canada.

To do so, it will have to move beyond what\u2019s worked in the age of Facebook video, and make something new.The idea that video will be a financial savior in the media business is contentious, and often mocked. It is expensive to create, and audiences aren\u2019t equivalent \u2014 yet \u2014 to print or even web in their ability to be monetized. (In human terms: One person watching a video is not financially equivalent to what one person paying for a magazine has been worth.)But Vogue the magazine has just over a million paid subscriptions, and Vogue the YouTube channel has more than 2.2 million subscribers.\u201cIn the next 24 months, I hope that video is half our business,\u201d said Craig Kostelic, the chief business officer of The Lifestyle Collection. \u201cIt\u2019s critical. It\u2019s the macro trend of content consumption.\u201dCond\u00e9 Nast is not betting everything on \u201chands and pans\u201d videos. In fact, it is increasingly looking beyond them as viewers gravitate toward something that is a cross between short social videos and the food programs of yore (you might remember it as cable television). Much of the space is for videos featuring hosts like Claire Saffitz, who is known for videos in which she breaks down complex recipes for foods as varied as Twinkies and soup dumplings, or Brad Leone, the quirky host of \u201cIt\u2019s Alive,\u201d a series about fermentation, pickling and more.\u201cFor so long we were doing those hands and pans videos, and it\u2019s one of those things you had to do based on internet demand and traffic,\u201d said Adam Rapoport, the editor in chief of Bon App\u00e9tit. \u201cThey\u2019re kind of boring, they\u2019re not stimulating and they\u2019re predictable. It was not creatively rewarding. As an industry, we\u2019ve gone beyond that and it\u2019s gone more to the personality videos, to more narrative.\u201dTo optimize the new test kitchens for filming, they have been outfitted with overhead lights, blackout curtains and acoustic paneling to muffle outside sound. All the stovetops are gas. \u201cPeople want to see the flame,\u201d said Eric Gillin, the digital general manager of The Lifestyle Collection. Sponsored product is everywhere. The countertops? Caesarstone. The small appliances? Braun. Furniture? Crate & Barrel. The smart fridges? Samsung. And so on.And though the test kitchen at Cond\u00e9 Nast\u2019s headquarters has served well as a shooting location, it will now go back to being primarily a work space for editors who are trying out recipes. \u201cVideo can be kind of intrusive,\u201d said Mr. Rapoport. \u201cYou have camera people, lights, you have to section off a portion of the kitchen, you don\u2019t want people to be too noisy. Shooting interrupts the basic workflow.\u201d\u201cOn YouTube, over half of our audience is under 34 years old. These people are young, they\u2019re really engaged, they\u2019re watching for an average of over five minutes. It\u2019s not this 8-second watch time like on Facebook,\u201d said Matt Duckor, the executive producer for the Lifestyle Collection.\u201cYouTube is a sneaky, over-the-top kind of channel unto itself,\u201d Mr. Gillin said.The Cond\u00e9 Nast teams have embraced the flexibility of the mid-length format. \u201cWhen you\u2019re post-cable, it\u2019s not a half-hour TV show, you\u2019re not programming for these ad blocks, you\u2019re telling the story for as long as there\u2019s a story to be told,\u201d Mr. Gillin said.\u201cThis industry is moving so fast,\u201d Mr. Duckor said. \u201cThe videos we\u2019re creating now compared to two years ago are really different, but you\u2019re always going to need kitchens, you\u2019re always going to need the ability to have production space to have people work and sit.\u201dFor now, the revenue coming in from videos is split between advertising and sponsorships. \u201cAbout half to two-thirds of it is more about traditional ads, like pre-roll,\u201d Mr. Kostelic said, referring to the brief advertisements that play before a video. But increasingly Cond\u00e9 Nast makes videos for its clients that it does not promote on its own platforms.\u201cHistorically, you would have a digital media plan with a set amount of view or impressions,\u201d Mr. Kostelic said. \u201cMore people are coming to us for our content and creative services plans, with distribution being a separate conversation.\u201dThe greater goal is for the lessons the Lifestyle Collection team will learn with the Kitchen Studio space to trickle out to the rest of the company.\u201cThe issue that Cond\u00e9 Nast used to have is that it was really siloed out by brand, and the brands didn\u2019t speak to each other, they didn\u2019t share learnings,\u201d Mr. Duckor said. \u201cWe\u2019re at a place now where we can take learnings from Bon App\u00e9tit and the success we\u2019ve had on YouTube and apply them to Architectural Digest, where they haven\u2019t quite had the investment in that platform that we have.

Yet it can be high praise indeed.Some of the world\u2019s greatest wines have a distinct saline tang. In France, where the vocabulary for describing wine dwarfs the capacity of English, to remark on a wine\u2019s \u201csalinit\u00e9\u201d is to toss a welcome though perhaps voguish verbal bouquet.Here at Wine School, where for the last month we have been drinking Etna Biancos, we prize savory wines. We also recognize that they are likely to be an acquired taste, especially for palates honed in the United States.Has the American palate matured? Wrong question. Vintner\u2019s Reserve is still a top-selling bottle, and it\u2019s misleading to generalize about American tastes. I think it is safe to say, however, that a growing number of Americans every year appreciate wines that offer the sort of subtlety and nuance that is rarely possible to achieve in the mass market.So it is with Etna Biancos, whites with a pronounced savory quality that belies another wine clich\u00e9, that Italy cannot produce white wines with character. Perhaps that was true 30 years ago. But the quality and diversity of Italian whites nowadays is astonishing, from the Alpine Alto Adige and Valle d\u2019Aosta regions in the extreme north to Calabria on the toe of the boot to the island of Sicily.Each of these wines was delicious in its own right and gave a clear idea of the potential of the carricante grape. Yet while they shared certain characteristics, they were entirely different.In common, they all had noticeably firm acidity, relatively low alcohol and those distinctive saline notes. The Benanti had salty, herbal, stony aromas, and though it seemed a bit dilute compared with the other two bottles, with acidity that was not quite as pointed, its flavors had staying power, lingering in the mouth long after the wine had been swallowed.The Graci was a denser wine, richer and with more body. The aromas and flavors were similar \u2014 herbs, citrus, saltiness \u2014 but the texture was more interesting. This was a wine you could roll around in your mouth even after swallowing, which I think was because of the residual feeling of its acidity. It was tangy, lip-smacking and refreshing.What made these wines different? Of course, each producer has its own sensibilities and intents, which alone are often enough to account for differences. These three wines also had different grape compositions. The Benanti was 100 percent carricante, while the Graci was 70 percent carricante and 30 percent catarratto, a white grape found throughout Sicily, and the Aurora was 90 percent carricante and 10 percent minnella, a rare Sicilian white found almost exclusively on Etna.The combinations are all permitted by Etna Bianco rules, which require the wines to be at least 60 percent carricante, up to 40 percent catarratto and up to 15 percent minnella. A higher designation, Etna Bianco Superiore, requires a minimum of 80 percent carricante, and all the grapes must come from the Milo area on the east face of Etna, which is regarded as the best area for carricante.My guess is no. While it\u2019s possible that the presence of catarratto added amplitude to the wine, I don\u2019t know of anybody around Etna who considers catarratto to be particularly desirable. Notably, Graci\u2019s higher-end Etna Bianco, Arcur\u00eca, is 100 percent carricante and is even more gorgeous, while Salvo Foti\u2019s superb Etna Bianco Superiore, Vigna di Milo, is likewise entirely carricante, as is Pietra Marina, Benanti\u2019s Etna Bianco Superiore, one of Italy\u2019s greatest whites.Many readers were able to find the Graci, and almost everybody seemed to find that the warmer the wine got, the better it was. This is a crucial point for enjoying good white wine. Cold masks nuances as it does flaws. When you get a glass of pinot grigio from the local bar, you want it as cold as possible so that you taste nothing. But for good whites, you want access to every subtlety.Nothing is wrong with fruitiness in wine. I mentioned moderately sweet German rieslings earlier, which can be gorgeously fruity. Salinity and other savory flavors are simply another aspect of wine\u2019s complexity.What the sweetness and fruitiness of sp\u00e4tlese riesling and the salinity of Etna\u2019s carricante have in common is great acidity. It\u2019s the spine of a wine that gives posture to the flavors, whatever they may be. You might say that acidity is good wine\u2019s not-so-secret weapon.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Blindness of Social Wealth", "Date": "2018-04-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistBob Hall was a rancher. In 1936, in the midst of the Depression, he was suffering from a cancer that was eating the flesh on the side of his face. His ranch had dwindled to nearly nothing, and weeks after bankers took the last of his livestock, Hall died, leaving his family deeply in debt.His sons pleaded with anybody they could find to make a loan and save the family ranch. No one would do it. Finally, in desperation, they went to their neighbor, Buzz Newton, who was known for his miserliness, and asked him to co-sign a loan. \u201cI always thought so much of your dad; he was the most generous man I have known,\u201d Newton answered. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll co-sign the note.\u201dBob Hall\u2019s grandson, also named Robert Hall, drew out the lesson in his book \u201cThis Land of Strangers,\u201d noting: \u201cThe truth is, relationships are the most valuable and value-creating resource of any society. They are our lifelines to survive, grow and thrive.\u201dThere\u2019s a mountain of evidence suggesting that the quality of our relationships has been in steady decline for decades. In the 1980s, 20 percent of Americans said they were often lonely. Now it\u2019s 40 percent. Suicide rates are now at a 30-year high. Depression rates have increased tenfold since 1960, which is not only a result of greater reporting. Most children born to mothers under 30 are born outside of marriage. There\u2019s been a steady 30-year decline in Americans\u2019 satisfaction with the peer-to-peer relationships at work.Patients came to see him partly because they were lonely, partly because loneliness made them sick. Weak social connections have health effects similar to smoking 15 cigarettes a day, and a greater negative effect than obesity, he said.Over the past five years, such trends have abruptly gotten worse. In 2012, 5.9 percent of young people suffered from severe mental health issues. By 2015 it was 8.2 percent.I summarize all this because loneliness and social isolation are the problem that undergird many of our other problems. More and more Americans are socially poor. And yet it is very hard for the socially wealthy to even see this fact. It is the very nature of loneliness and social isolation to be invisible. We talk as if the lonely don\u2019t exist.I was really struck by this last week, when Mark Zuckerberg came through Washington. Most of the questions he faced at the congressional hearings and most of the analysis in the press were about Facebook\u2019s failure to protect privacy. That\u2019s the sort of thing that may be uppermost on your mind if you are socially wealthy, if, like most successful politicians and analysts, you live within a thick web of connection and feel as if your social schedule is too full.But the big issue surrounding Facebook is not privacy. It\u2019s that Facebook and other social media companies are feeding this epidemic of loneliness and social isolation. It\u2019s not only that heavy social media users are sadder. It\u2019s not only that online life seems to heighten painful comparisons and both inflate and threaten the ego. It\u2019s that heavy internet users are much less likely to have contact with their proximate neighbors to exchange favors and extend care. There\u2019s something big happening to the social structure of neighborhoods.The British anthropologist Robin Dunbar observes that human societies exist on three levels: the clan (your family and close friends), the village (your local community) and the tribe (your larger group). In America today you would say that the clans have polarized, the villages have been decimated and the tribes have become weaponized.That is, some highly educated families have helicopter parents while less fortunate families have absent parents. The middle ring cross-class associations of town and neighborhood have fallen apart. People try to compensate for the lack of intimate connection by placing their moral and emotional longings on their political, ethnic and other tribes, turning them viciously on each other.The mass migration to online life is not the only force driving these trends, but it is a big one. Such big subjects didn\u2019t come up in the Zuckerberg hearings because socially wealthy and socially poor people experience Facebook differently and perceive reality and social problems differently. It\u2019s very hard to quantify and communicate the decline in quality of relationships. But it is nonetheless true that many of us who are socially wealthy don\u2019t really know how the other half lives.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jamie Dimon\u2019s Letter \u2014 Handicapping a Run for President in 2020: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Good Thursday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Jamie Dimon chafes under liquidity rules.\u2022 Mark Zuckerberg has disclosed more on how much Facebook user data may have been accessed.\u2022 The White House is still talking tough on trade with China.\u2022 Blackstone\u2019s infrastructure fund isn\u2019t doing so well.On Wall Street, there\u2019s been a running parlor game about whether Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s chief executive, would try to run for president in 2020. His annual letters, filled with commentary on U.S. policy, have only increased the chatter, and this year\u2019s letter, released Thursday, is no different. It touches on everything from trade to immigration. While Mr. Dimon, who once called himself \u201cbarely a Democrat,\u201d says he plans to stay at the bank for the next five years, the question among political prognosticators is whether Mr. Dimon\u2019s policy views could ever find a home among voters in this politically polarized environment.Mr. Dimon\u2019s sensible letter was seemingly supportive of some of President Trump\u2019s policies, while taking the opposing side on others. Mr. Dimon particularly applauded the corporate tax cut and deregulation efforts. On China trade, Mr. Dimon writes: \u201cIt is not unreasonable for the United States to press ahead for more equivalency,\u201d and that \u201cone of the administration\u2019s best arguments is that negotiation alone has not worked.\u201d However, he said he would like to see more cooperation with U.S. allies on talks with China and added that the U.S. should \u201crevisit the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\u201dOn immigration, he called for tougher border control, writing, \u201cAmerican citizens have the right to complain that we have not successfully protected our borders since the last immigration reform in 1986.\u201d He also said, \u201cPeople immigrating to this country should be taught American history, our language and our principles.\u201d At the same time, he also advocated for \u201ca path to legal status and citizenship\u201d for \u201cDreamers\u201d and improving \u201cmerit-based immigration\u201d programs so that immigrants educated here can stay.Mr. Dimon made a point of saying that part of the problems facing the country is that too many people are talking past each other.\u201cWhen people argue as if there are binary solutions, the argument is almost always wrong,\u201d he wrote, advocating that people try to look at all sides of a situation. \u201cI tell my liberal friends to read columnists like Arthur Brooks and George Will. And I tell my conservative friends to read writers like Tom Friedman.\u201dIf Mr. Dimon were to run, he would likely have to do so as an independent. It is hard to see how liberal Democrats would embrace much of his deregulatory positions. And yet many of his positions \u2013 and especially some of his social positions not enunciated in his letter \u2014 may not be far right enough to capture the interest of Republicans.Maybe the country needs someone in the middle, but history has not been kind to third-party candidates.\u2014 Andrew Ross SorkinBut he also addressed a policy area much closer to home \u2013 bank regulation. Mr. Dimon often has expressed skepticism about aspects of the banking overhaul that took place in the wake of the financial crisis. But his remarks on regulation arguably carry more weight now. Congress is closer to modifying the post-crisis rules than at any point since Dodd-Frank was signed into law in 2010. An important regulatory requirement Mr. Dimon criticized, therefore, might become a focus for those wanting to roll back the rules.Mr. Dimon in this year\u2019s letter zeroed in on regulations that require banks to have a certain amount of liquidity, the financial term for access to cash or low-risk assets that can be easily sold for cash.In 2008, some large financial firms were crippled when customers, depositors and creditors withdrew their money. The Federal Reserve and taxpayers had to step in to support the banks. To help prevent a repeat of this, post-crisis rules require that banks hold a certain amount of liquid assets to cover a theoretical level of outflows. Mr. Dimon is in favor of banks having more liquidity than before the crisis, but in the letter, released Thursday, he wrote:Liquidity requirements, while much higher, now have an element of rigidity built in that did not exist before. Banks will be unable to use that liquidity when they most need to do so \u2014 to make loans or intermediate markets. They have a \u201cred line\u201d they cannot cross (they are required to maintain hard and fast liquidity requirements). As clients demand more liquidity from their banks, the banks essentially will be unable to provide it.First, a bank that lacks liquidity is in no position to lend. When a bank\u2019s creditors and customers fear it doesn\u2019t have enough cash in reserve, they will most likely withdraw their money. This not only deprives the bank of the money it needs to lend, it also sharply reduces its chance of survival. Or as Gregg Gelzinis of the left-leaning Center for American Progress puts it, \u201cYou won\u2019t be able to take this action if you fail.\u201dThe nation\u2019s largest bank holding companies have strong capital levels and retain their ability to lend to households and businesses during a severe recession.Andrew Gray, a JPMorgan spokesman, followed up with more material on Mr. Dimon\u2019s thinking on liquidity.He re-emphasized Mr. Dimon\u2019s point about having to tie up funds that could be used to make loans. Mr. Gray noted that a bank facing outflows would be expected to keep refilling its pool of liquid assets to be in compliance with a liquidity regulation. This would leave fewer funds for lending and making markets, Mr. Gray asserted.He also addressed the argument that higher capital levels, not liquidity, will largely determine the extent to which banks will lend through a downturn. Mr. Gray asserted that liquidity rules play an important role in ensuring banks have the resources to participate in wider financial markets. Rules forcing the hoarding of liquidity may, thus, crimp that activity.\u2014 Peter EavisMick Mulvaney, the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has complained that the regulator engages in \u201cwasteful spending.\u201d He even submitted a quarterly budget request recently of $0.That attitude apparently didn\u2019t apply to two of his recent hires.ContextThe consumer bureau, as well as fellow financial regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, is allowed under federal law to pay employees significantly more than other government agencies can pay. The rationale is that the higher salaries are necessary to recruit skilled employees who otherwise might land jobs on Wall Street.As a result, the C.F.P.B. is stocked with employees who earn more than the average Washington bureaucrat. Of the agency\u2019s 1,600 employees, 219 make more than $200,000, according to the records reviewed by The Times.\u2014 Stacy CowleyBlackRock, the world\u2019s largest money manager, plans to offer a series of new products allowing individuals and institutions to invest in market indexes without putting money into manufacturers and retailers of firearms.They include:\u2022 a new exchange-traded fund that will track the performance of the MSCI USA Small Cap Extended ESG Focus Index, composed of small stocks with favorable environmental, social and governance standards, while specifically excluding producers and large retailers of civilian firearms.\u2022 a similar credit-focused ETF that eschews the debt of gunmakers and distributors.\u2022 an option to take the guns out of institutional strategies tracking major market indexes, including the S&P 500, the Russell 2000 and three others.Critic\u2019s cornerRob Cox of Breakigviews writes:\u201cBlackRock\u2019s moves may spark criticism from gun-rights supporters, who lashed out at companies like Delta Air Lines that severed ties with the National Rifle Association. But it\u2019s hard to see how offering customers more choice is ever a bad idea. Moreover, by getting out early, BlackRock makes clear to those young people lobbying for tighter gun laws \u2013 who it hopes will be customers for decades to come \u2013 that it has something for them. Far from virtue signaling, it\u2019s simply good business.\u201d\u2022 Facebook said Cambridge Analytica harvested the data of 87 million users, not 50 million.\u2022 A vulnerability in search and account recovery functions may have exposed \u201cmost\u201d of Facebook\u2019s 2 billion users to unauthorized harvesting of their public profile information.A brighter note for Facebook: Its shares are up in premarket trading today, after Mr. Zuckerberg said that #DeleteFacebook didn\u2019t appear to be having much effect.The Facebook calendar\u2022 April 9: Alerts should start popping up for users whose information may have been shared with Cambridge Analytica.\u2022 April 10: Mr. Zuckerberg is scheduled to testify before the Senate\u2019s Commerce and Judiciary committees.\u2022 April 11: He will testify before the House Energy and Commerce Committee.People familiar with the negotiations say Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, and Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, have at times argued for more dialogue with the Chinese and quicker concessions that would help diminish the trade deficit. \u2026 Other top trade advisers, including longtime China critics like Robert Lighthizer and Peter Navarro, have taken a tougher stance.The United States trade deficit rose 1.6 percent to $57.6 billion, its highest level since October 2008. The deficit has now risen for six straight months, the longest such streak since 2000.The merchandise-trade gap with China narrowed to $34.7 billion in February from $35.5 billion. The Trump administration wants to cut $100 billion, or about 25 percent, from the annual deficit with China, Bloomberg points out. During President Trump\u2019s first year in office, the United States\u2019 trade deficit with China rose to $375.2 billion in 2017, a record high.Last May, Blackstone announced with great fanfare that it planned a $40 billion fund with Saudi Arabia to invest in U.S. infrastructure: up to $20 billion from the Saudis, who would match commitments by other outside partners. But as of now, Blackstone has secured just $575 million in such commitments \u2014 and missed two fund-raising deadlines.\u2022 The Saudis wanted the fund overseen by an investment committee, with a seat for them. Blackstone refused.\u2022 Many potential investors balked at committing money until an investment team was in place, a process that took some time.More from Scott Shane and Dai Wakabayashi of the NYT:That kind of idealistic stance, while certainly not shared by all Google employees, comes naturally to a company whose motto is \u201cDon\u2019t be evil,\u201d a phrase invoked in the protest letter. But it is distinctly foreign to Washington\u2019s massive defense industry and certainly to the Pentagon, where the defense secretary, Jim Mattis, has often said a central goal is to increase the \u201clethality\u201d of the United States military.The company line: \u201cWe\u2019re actively engaged across the company in a comprehensive discussion of this important topic.\u201dThe tech flyaround\u201cThe future of a combined Viacom and CBS is going to be driven by an increasing focus on international and scaling up,\u201d he wrote \u2014 an agenda better suited to Viacom\u2019s C.E.O., Bob Bakish.\u201cRetreating from the world is not the solution, nor is burning down the current system and starting anew.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Hurricane Maria Didn\u2019t Wreck: Puerto Rican Baseball", "Date": "2018-04-16", "News": "Puerto Rico\u2019s pre-eminent amateur league has played every season since 1940. After the hurricanes last year, it vowed this one would not be different despite hardships.Supported byAIBONITO, Puerto Rico \u2014 At the Estadio Hermanos Marrero, a baseball stadium nestled in this small, mountainous municipality in the center of Puerto Rico, parts of the roof over the grandstand are gone or twisted back.The Cayey Toritos played their 2018 home opener there in a Sunday doubleheader because their stadium is still too heavily damaged to use. Before the first pitch, a team prayer in the dugout led by Toritos right fielder Rafael S\u00e1nchez ended with a rallying cry, \u201cThis is for our community!\u201dThe players are far from the millionaires getting set to play a major league game in San Juan an hour north on Tuesday; they are students, salesmen, barbers, teachers and cooks. And they have lived the hardships of Hurricanes Irma and Maria, yet still take the field despite the aftermath, or because of it.The hurricanes devastated this baseball-loving island, but seven months later, the Toritos and other teams in the island\u2019s predominant amateur 18-and-over league have provided a semblance of normalcy by pressing on with their games, even amid harsh conditions.\u201cSometimes we had to wash our clothes in the river,\u201d said Toritos catcher Raulier Martinez, 22, who was without power at home for six months.Their determination reflects baseball\u2019s special relationship with this island, as the Toritos and 37 other teams of the Liga de B\u00e9isbol Superior Doble A do what it has done every year since 1940: play ball.\u201cDoble A is more regional on the island than any other sport I can think of,\u201d said Luis Rodr\u00edguez Mayoral, a Puerto Rican author, broadcaster and former baseball executive with such teams as the Texas Rangers and Detroit Tigers. \u201cThere are little towns everywhere on the island where people\u2019s lives revolve around following their home team.\u201dMany Doble A team owners considered skipping this season, but Jos\u00e9 Quiles, the president of the Puerto Rican amateur baseball federation, urged those who could do so to play. More than a dozen teams said yes. As word spread, the number doubled, and eventually reached 38, four fewer than normal.\u201cWe wanted people to have their oasis from the rough past several months,\u201d said Pedro Vargas, the executive director of the league. \u201cBut this exceeded our expectations. There was a large movement everywhere.\u201dIncluding in Cayey, which, as of late January, was not going to play. Other teams would draft their players.But the ardent fan base of Cayey, a municipality of 44,000, demanded to watch their team, which reached the semifinals in Doble A last season. They voiced their opinions on Facebook, to team owner H\u00e9ctor De Jes\u00fas, and to the municipal government, which owns the stadium the Toritos use. Players met and asked to play.\u201cWe didn\u2019t have a stadium, the business sponsorship wasn\u2019t in the right shape, we didn\u2019t know when electricity was going to come back, how many players we would have or what their economic situation was,\u201d De Jes\u00fas said. \u201cEveryone had to chip in and do their part to create an environment where people could forget a little bit about what\u2019s gone on with Maria.\u201dCayey\u2019s Pedro Monta\u00f1ez Municipal Stadium, a $15 million, 6,000-seat stadium, was relatively new \u2014 opened in 2012 and built with central and local government funds \u2014 and a source of pride, said Mayor Rolando Ortiz Vel\u00e1zquez. But Vel\u00e1zquez said Hurricane Maria caused $2 million worth of damage, disabling the scoreboard and knocking down concrete supports and the outfield wall.Although the main stadium was not fit for games, the first-floor concourse was in good enough shape to be used as a central base for emergency responders. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is still using that area now, fielding visits from families needing assistance. Vel\u00e1zquez said eight of the 22 neighborhoods in the municipality remain without electricity.\u201cPeople sometimes think sports are a waste or just for entertainment,\u201d Vel\u00e1zquez said. \u201cBut from our experience after Maria, thanks to sports and baseball, this was the best facility to coordinate all of our services.\u201dTo get the Toritos, or Little Bulls, a place to play, Vel\u00e1zquez called the mayor of Aibonito, William Alicea P\u00e9rez, who agreed to loan his municipality\u2019s stadium \u2014 much less affected by the hurricanes \u2014 to Cayey when the Aibonito Polluelos (Chicks) played road games. The Toritos are one of six teams playing in a loaner stadium this season, but they still practice in their normal stadium.Vargas said the Doble A league budget is tight each year, so teams rely on local businesses to help cover costs. Jerseys are covered in advertisements from local banks and car dealerships, and the players\u2019 introductions over the public address system are sponsored by neighborhood supermarkets. De Jes\u00fas said those sponsorships were harder to secure this season.To make the numbers work to run the league, officials moved opening day to April 1 from the second week of February and shaved four games off the regular season schedule, to make it 16 games. Games were moved to Sunday day doubleheaders, instead of the usual Friday night or Saturday afternoon games, because the lights do not work at many stadiums. Admission was dropped from $5 per game to $5 per doubleheader. Rosters grew by two, to 26 players, to accommodate the players from the four teams that couldn\u2019t play.The league also reduced the players\u2019 maximum stipend \u2014 essentially gas and extra spending money \u2014 to $100 from about $300 for a weekend. Some players with professional experience, like Cayey\u2019s Fernando Cabrera, 36, the top starting pitcher in the league who once pitched for the Baltimore Orioles and Cleveland Indians, get tips from fans on the side for winning.\u201cIt\u2019ll be a tougher season: doubleheaders, under the sun, the lower pay, the traveling,\u201d said Richard Gonz\u00e1lez, 29, the Toritos second baseman. \u201cBut at the end of the day, we\u2019re doing what we love to do, which is to play baseball and for the people of Cayey.\u201dThe extra cash would have helped Gonz\u00e1lez, who started his own baseball equipment business called Dux Sports after playing college baseball at Virginia Commonwealth University. When he wasn\u2019t drafted by a major league team, he returned to Puerto Rico and is in his eighth season playing in the Doble A.After Hurricane Maria hit, Gonz\u00e1lez lost power in his home in Caguas, a city 30 minutes south of San Juan, for three months. He didn\u2019t have a generator, cellphone service was dead, and orders for his baseball equipment went unfilled, so he spent two months with family and his business partner in Tampa. He returned in December.\u201cIf you play this league for the money, you don\u2019t have a chance,\u201d he said. \u201cYou play because of your love and passion for baseball.\u201dThe Toritos\u2019 manager, Edgardo Lebr\u00f3n, 35, a former Minnesota Twins minor leaguer who works at a baseball academy, said his home in Las Piedras, an hour from Cayey, sustained $70,000 worth of damage and the electricity still has not returned. He has spent thousands on gasoline to feed a generator. As Lebr\u00f3n stopped his front door from being blown away by the hurricane winds, he said his 10-year-old son turned to him, crying, and said, \u201cDad, let\u2019s pray; we\u2019re going to die.\u201dEfrain Garc\u00eda, 55, the manager of the displaced Azucareros of Yabucoa, a small municipality in southeastern Puerto Rico hard hit by the hurricanes, said he was grateful to use the stadium in Las Piedras for home games and practice. But sharing a stadium and his players\u2019 work schedules on Saturday, when they practice, has affected the team\u2019s preparation. They are off to a 1-3 start. Like Cayey (3-1), Yabucoa\u2019s fans rallied to encourage the team to play this season.\u201cWinning is important, but in these circumstances, it\u2019s about more,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want fans to be distracted for a few hours even though some are still without water or power, and give them something to enjoy that they love.\u201dDoble A has the humble feel of minor league baseball. Cayey\u2019s coaches finished dressing in the dugout on Sunday. Foul balls hit into the parking lot were chased down and reused. There was a 15-minute delay in the second game because of a dispute over a player\u2019s name on the roster. Radio broadcasters called the game from the press box, but the older men standing behind home plate essentially did the same.\u201cOnly swing at strikes!\u201d shouted one man nursing a beer.In between games, players rested in the cramped locker room littered with equipment bags. The music of Bad Bunny, a Puerto Rican reggaeton artist, blasted from the giant speaker in the locker room. Some players mingled with fans in the main concourse, where fried chicken, pork and empanadas were sold. De Jes\u00fas, the owner, worked the drinks counter. Players hung their sweaty jerseys to dry so they could wear them again in the second game.Attendance at the first game was sparse, but it probably reached 900 during the second, half of what the games get in normal times. Some loyal Cayey fans took a bus paid for by the municipality to the game in Aibonito.\u201cThe Doble A team is the only institution in the city that unites all the Cayeyanos regardless of political affiliation or religion,\u201d Vel\u00e1zquez said.From the top row of the stands, Luc\u00eda Rivera, 65, tracked every out and hit on a homemade scorecard. A Cayey native, she brought her son, Jos\u00e9 Ramos, 44, to games when he was younger, and they continue the tradition to this day.\u201cIt\u2019s in my blood,\u201d she said.Power returned to their home only three weeks ago. And even though they probably had better things to do on a Sunday, they made the drive through winding one-lane mountain roads to see their beloved Toritos.\u201cWe\u2019ll follow them wherever they go,\u201d Ramos said. \u201cThis is our relief from the stress.

The footage starts with one of the officers standing over the woman, Chikesia Clemons, and trying to place her right arm behind her back as she sits in a chair.The video then skips ahead, picking up as two officers grab Ms. Clemons\u2019s arms and shoulders and toss her onto the restaurant floor. \u201cWhat are you doing,\u201d Ms. Clemons yells at the officers, as they try to bend her arms behind her back.\u201cAbout to break your arm, that\u2019s what I\u2019m about to do,\u201d an officer replies.During the scuffle, Ms. Clemons\u2019s strapless shirt comes undone, exposing her breasts in the middle of the restaurant. When she is handcuffed, an officer turns to her friend Canita Adams, who is recording the video, and says, \u201cYou want to come fix her clothes?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t feel like she was treated fairly,\u201d her mother, Chiquita Clemons-Howard, said at an N.A.A.C.P. meeting on Sunday evening. \u201cI want to get justice for my daughter.\u201dDavid Smith, the president of the Mobile County N.A.A.C.P., did not respond to a message seeking comment on Tuesday.Ms. Clemons, who was charged with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest, and Ms. Adams, who was not arrested, could not be reached for comment on Tuesday. Ms. Clemons-Howard, who told the Alabama news media that she was speaking on her daughter\u2019s behalf, did not return a call seeking comment.Both the Police Department and Waffle House have said that the cellphone video did not show the full story and that the officers acted appropriately and had reason to arrest Ms. Clemons. A Waffle House spokesman said \u201cpolice intervention was appropriate.\u201dOn Monday afternoon, the Police Department released a portion of a 911 call from a Waffle House employee and footage from two security cameras inside the restaurant.In the 911 call, the worker said her manager had asked her to call because two women and a man acting \u201cdrunk and disorderly\u201d had arrived with alcohol and were refusing to throw it away. The security footage had no audio but showed Ms. Clemons, 25, and Ms. Adams, 26, pointing and yelling at employees.\u201c\u2018You ain\u2019t going to be here tomorrow,\u2019\u201d Detective Mims said the women told employees. \u201c\u2018I may have a gun. I may have anything. I can come back up here and shoot this place up if I need to.\u2019\u201dWhen the officers arrived, Detective Mims said, Ms. Clemons refused to comply with their orders and resisted placing her hands behind her back. He said her race played no role in what happened.\u201cBased on the interviews conducted,\u201d he said, \u201cit was based solely on that they were asked to take their beverages out and not to consume them on premises.\u201dThe Police Department did not release the names of the officers but said that none of them would be disciplined.The police arrived when the women were trying to get the name of a Waffle House supervisor to file a complaint, Ms. Clemons-Howard said. \u201cThe footage shows the story completely,\u201d she told AL.com, referring to the cellphone video.Detective Mims said Monday that the waitress was following Waffle House policy to charge customers for plastic ware if they plan to dine at the restaurant.

{"Headline": "Google\u2019s Parent Company Spends Like It\u2019s Thinking of a Future Beyond Ads", "Date": "2018-04-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, is spending like it is beginning to prepare for life after advertising.Currently, Alphabet makes nearly 90 percent of its money from selling advertising on the internet, and gobbles up heaps of data about its users to help marketers target those ads more effectively.But a close reading of Alphabet\u2019s financial results for the first quarter of 2018, which were announced on Monday, showed that the Silicon Valley giant is accelerating its efforts to diversify into other businesses.Alphabet has made investments in areas like self-driving cars and online computer services for businesses for years, but spending in those areas was up dramatically in the first quarter. The company\u2019s capital expenditures, which included installing undersea cables and the construction of new data centers, were $7.7 billion \u2014 more than triple the same period last year.Ruth Porat, Alphabet\u2019s chief financial officer, said that increase reflected a \u201ccommitment to growth\u201d because the company had spent heavily on computing infrastructure, for both its own internal use and customer needs like Google Cloud \u2014 the unit that provides technology services to other companies.Alphabet\u2019s expenses rose 27 percent in the quarter. Ms. Porat said the heaviest spending came from research and development costs \u2014 mainly the hiring of additional technical staff. The company said its total employees had increased to 85,050 from 73,992 in the same period a year ago.Over all, Alphabet said its net income rose 73 percent, to $9.4 billion, from the same period a year earlier, boosted in part by an increase in the value of its outside investments. Revenue rose 26 percent to $31.1 billion.Ms. Porat also pointed out an increase in spending for advertising to promote newer products including Google\u2019s own hardware \u2014 a relatively new business manufacturing branded smartphones, laptops and smart speakers \u2014 and the company\u2019s artificially intelligent digital assistant.\u201cThey are thinking about their future,\u201d said Collin Colburn, an analyst at Forrester Research who focuses on search advertising. \u201cThey want to diversify beyond just advertising being such a big part of their business.\u201dStill, the search giant\u2019s core business showed no sign of slowing in the first quarter. Revenue from Google\u2019s advertising business, which includes ads shown on Google search and commercials running before YouTube videos, increased 24 percent during the quarter.However, Google\u2019s advertising profits were weighed down by an increase in traffic acquisition costs \u2014 the fees that it pays companies like Apple to make sure that its search engine is the default option when people open a browser on the iPhone.Also among the company\u2019s expenditures in the quarter: $2.4 billion to buy the Chelsea Market building in Manhattan, where the company had set up some of its New York offices.On a conference call with investment analysts, Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, avoided answering questions about the potential effects of new regulations concerning data privacy in Europe. The new law, which goes into effect on May 25, will restrict how companies like Google can collect, store and use personal data from users across Europe.Mr. Pichai said the company has been preparing for the law for more than 18 months, but didn\u2019t discuss how the new regulations may affect the company\u2019s bottom line.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can It Be Illegal to Leave Your Country?", "Date": "2018-04-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Daoud, the author of \u201cThe Meursault Investigation,\u201d is a native of\u00a0Mostaganem, Algeria.ORAN, Algeria \u2014 For some years now, certain videos posted on Facebook, Algerians\u2019 preferred social network, have been causing a sensation here: They show groups of young Algerians brandishing smartphones and singing, taking videos of one another as they laugh, looking at once happy and worried. Over time, more and more young women and small children appear among them. Diversity may be frowned upon throughout the country, but it reigns, apparently, on the little vessels that ferry illegal migrants away.Mostaganem, my hometown, is a small coastal city between Algiers and Oran. It was once a lovely weekend destination, with its stilt bungalows by the sea and its sardine restaurants, but today tourism lags for lack of investment. The government is suspicious of all foreigners. Algeria sells oil, and unlike its neighbors Morocco and Tunisia, it doesn\u2019t need money from tourists. What\u2019s more, it is run by a gerontocracy that clings to power by any means and is increasingly out of step with the country\u2019s very young population: 29 percent of the total is under 15.Young people suffer from the lack of employment and opportunities, and especially from the lack of leisure activities. Their isolation is reinforced by rising Islamism. In Mostaganem, as in other towns and villages throughout Algeria, there are no movie theaters, no swimming pools, no dance floors and no restaurants. Lovers may not kiss or hold hands in public. So Mostaganem\u2019s beautiful, still-wild coastline is a point of departure. More than 110 small craft set out from there in a single week last year, according to the local authorities; 286 Algerians are said to have been intercepted on the open sea in just three days in November. The Mediterranean Sea regularly throws up the corpses of the drowned, but that doesn\u2019t seem to discourage prospective travelers.The Algerian government manages such statistics with prudence. Too large a number of Algerian emigrants would be evidence of its shortcomings and serve as fodder for its opponents. Yet too small a figure couldn\u2019t mobilize public opinion against the exodus.Was it fair to penalize the victims of a national failure? Worse, the law designed to do that, controversial from the outset, has turned out to be ineffective.And so the government has resorted to other methods. To block emigration with more than the coast guard, it has begun tapping conservative media. Those outlets publish appeals to patriotism and numerous reports about shipwreck victims, disconsolate parents, disillusioned returnees and mistreatment in Spanish refugee camps. In February, Echorouk, a popular Islamist newspaper, ran a teaser of a headline that claimed \u201cgangs\u201d were stealing the organs of some migrants and contaminating others with H.I.V. (The article itself contained hardly a word about any of this.)But the move backfired with at least one segment of the public. Some people have asked: How can these religious men declare the right to leave to be a sin while staying silent about repression, corruption, ecological destruction and the lifetime mandate of a president who won\u2019t die? Such criticism puts the minister of religious affairs in a bind \u2014 and so he has defended the imams, but not too much. To say nothing would have amounted to passively watching a tragedy unfold; to say anything more would have been an attack on his own administration. He also announced that the government would consider offering young people favorable terms for bank loans.On their makeshift boats, departing migrants often sing instead of staying silent and being discreet. They seem to be mocking those who stay behind. Really, they are yelling things at the government from the sea that for years they didn\u2019t dare tell it to its face. To leave illegally is, above all, to speak out.Kamel Daoud is the author of the novel \u201cThe Meursault Investigation.\u201d This essay was translated by John Cullen from the French.Advertisement"}

Q: What were some of his most famous opinions? Two years after vacating an opinion by Judge Reinhardt forbidding states from banning same-sex couples from marrying, the Supreme Court adopted just that constitutional rule.Q: Can you give us a layman\u2019s explanation of the Ninth Circuit and tell us why it\u2019s important? Because California and other western states continually innovate everything from the economy to social policy, the Ninth Circuit tends to hear an outsized portion of \u201cbig\u201d cases. It is no accident, therefore, that Judge Reinhardt found himself so often on panels asked to resolve cutting edge legal issues.Q: Who decides who will replace Judge Reinhardt \u2014 and how does it happen? There are several vacancies on the Ninth Circuit, now including Judge Reinhardt\u2019s seat. We can expect that over the next year, or less, President Trump will nominate judges to fill most of those positions. However, at this point it is impossible to predict who he will nominate to replace Judge Reinhardt.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)On a Saturday in December, Micheal Brown logged on to Stanford\u2019s admissions portal to check for an early decision.Stanford, though, would prove to be just the first of 20 highly selective colleges he\u2019d get into. In fact, Mr. Brown, a Houston high school senior, was admitted to every school to which he applied \u2014 and they all offered him a full ride.Where will he wind up?

{"Headline": "Facebook Fallout Deals Blow to Mercers\u2019 Political Clout", "Date": "2018-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLast month, a friend of the wealthy conservative donor Rebekah Mercer arrived at Facebook\u2019s Silicon Valley headquarters. His task: Find out what \u2014 if anything \u2014 could repair relations between Facebook, the world\u2019s biggest social media company, and Cambridge Analytica, the voter-profiling firm co-founded by her father and used by the Trump campaign.And last month, after reports on Cambridge in The New York Times, The Observer of London and The Guardian, Facebook banned the company from its platform, a major blow to any political or commercial targeting firm. Not a single American candidate or \u201csuper PAC\u201d committee has reported payments to the company since the 2016 campaign, according to federal records.Several Republicans in Ms. Mercer\u2019s orbit or with knowledge of Cambridge\u2019s business said that fallout from the Facebook scandal \u2014 combined with widespread doubts about the accuracy of Cambridge\u2019s psychological profiles of voters \u2014 had effectively crippled the firm\u2019s election work in the United States.\u201cThey\u2019re selling magic in a bottle,\u201d said Matt Braynard, who worked alongside Cambridge on the Trump campaign, for which he served as the director of data and strategy, and now runs Look Ahead America, a group seeking to turn out disaffected rural and blue-collar voters. \u201cAnd they\u2019re becoming toxic.\u201dThe Mercers have made no public statements about Cambridge Analytica\u2019s troubles. Through a spokeswoman, Ms. Mercer declined to answer questions about her role in Mr. Trump\u2019s circle or the Facebook meeting about Cambridge Analytica.But the effort by Ms. Mercer\u2019s friend to help mend fences with Facebook hints at both Cambridge\u2019s importance to her family\u2019s political ambitions and the perils posed by Facebook\u2019s ban.Although a Cambridge spokesman last month downplayed Ms. Mercer\u2019s role at the company \u2014 saying she had a \u201cbroad business oversight\u201d role and no involvement in its daily operations \u2014 she serves on the company\u2019s board and in the past has worked to drum up campaign business for Cambridge, according to Republicans who have worked with or competed against the firm. Former Cambridge employees said she was close to Alexander Nix, the company\u2019s chief executive, who was suspended last month after reports on Cambridge\u2019s harvesting of Facebook data.Mr. Michelsen acknowledged in an interview on Thursday that he visited the company but he would not discuss the purpose of the trip, citing nondisclosure agreements Facebook required him to sign. Ms. Mercer declined to say whether she and Mr. Michelsen had discussed the purpose of the meeting or whether he had briefed her on it afterward.In recent years, the Mercers have become among the most prominent and highly scrutinized political donors in the United States. In the early years of the Obama administration, they began doling out tens of millions of dollars to an eclectic array of conservative groups \u2014 many of them outside Washington\u2019s mainline Republican establishment. Mr. Mercer invested $10 million in Breitbart News, the nationalist website, bringing on Mr. Bannon as chairman, while Ms. Mercer joined the boards of leading conservative think tanks.The Mercers were critical of the Republican Party\u2019s existing data apparatus, which was controlled by the party officials and consultants they hoped to disempower. Mr. Mercer bankrolled Cambridge Analytica in 2014, and Ms. Mercer encouraged candidates and PACs that took the family\u2019s money to also hire the family\u2019s data firm. Early in the 2016 presidential campaign, the Mercers backed Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, putting millions of dollars \u2014 and Cambridge Analytica \u2014 behind him.But after Mr. Trump prevailed in the primaries, the Mercers switched candidates. In summer 2016, Ms. Mercer helped orchestrate a shake-up that put Mr. Bannon at the head of the Trump campaign. After Mr. Trump won the presidential election, he attended a costume ball at the Mercer estate on Long Island.But her insistence on using Cambridge to provide the Trump group with voter data, and other clashes over strategy, alienated other donors and Trump allies, according to other Republicans. Ms. Mercer formed her own group, Making America Great, and hired Emily Cornell, a Cambridge executive, to run it.Yet after an initial splash of spending in 2017 to promote Mr. Trump\u2019s policies on environmental deregulation and other issues, Making America Great appears to have gone quiet. Ms. Cornell said she was no longer affiliated with Making America Great and could not comment on the group.The family is likely to retain significant influence in broader conservative circles thanks to its vast fortune, which finances donations that many political organizations and candidates are eager to accept. The family foundation handed out about $20 million to more than two dozen conservative think tanks, charter school groups, watchdog outfits and other nonprofit organizations in 2016, according to its most recent tax return.The family has also donated $4.5 million to Republican candidates and super PACs during the 2018 election cycle, putting the Mercers among the top 20 donors in the country. And the father-daughter duo still inspire fear: Virtually no Republicans were willing to speak on the record about the family\u2019s troubles.\u201cI would not confuse silence with them being out,\u201d said Dan K. Eberhart, a Colorado drilling-services executive who is active in America First Policies, now the lead pro-Trump political advocacy group. \u201cI think they\u2019re very strategic, and I think they\u2019re quiet folks.\u201dThat grant, the Mercer foundation\u2019s first recorded contribution to DonorsTrust, could herald a shift in the family\u2019s philanthropic strategy. DonorsTrust helps wealthy conservatives obtain charitable tax benefits while \u2014 if so desired \u2014 shielding their giving from public view. The donor records a contribution to DonorsTrust and recommends potential recipients, while grantees receive a donation from DonorsTrust charitable vehicles. In 2016, DonorsTrust disbursed more than $66 million worth of such grants.Such mechanisms, which are legal, are used by many donors on the right and the left. Ms. Mercer declined to answer questions about whether she intended to shift more of her family\u2019s future political philanthropy into intermediaries like DonorsTrust. A 2017 tax return for the Mercer foundation is not yet publicly available.\u201cMs. Mercer is a private person,\u201d her spokeswoman said in a statement. \u201cAnd she does not intend to discuss with the media either the conversations she has with her close friends or her philanthropic and charitable giving.\u201dLawson Bader, the president of DonorsTrust, referred questions to the Mercers. \u201cI do not discuss DonorsTrust accounts real or imagined,\u201d he said in an email.Exactly what ambitions the Mercers, who joined the Emerdata board last month, have for the company is unclear. Another Emerdata director, Johnson Ko Chun Shun, is a Hong Kong financier and business partner of Erik Prince \u2014 the brother of the education secretary, Betsy DeVos, and founder of the private security firm formerly known as Blackwater. Mr. Ko, who declined to comment, is a substantial shareholder and deputy chairman in Mr. Prince\u2019s Africa-focused logistics company, Frontier Services Group.Mr. Ko and Mr. Prince have links to the Chinese government: Another major Frontier investor is Citic, a state-owned Chinese financial conglomerate that for decades has employed the sons and daughters of the Communist Party\u2019s elite families.Emerdata has a second Hong Kong-based director, Peng Cheng. Little public information about Ms. Peng, a British citizen, is available. But a woman with the same name is the chief executive of a publishing and online game company located in the same Hong Kong office tower as Frontier Services. In 2016, Mr. Ko\u2019s brokerage company said it would buy a stake in Ms. Peng\u2019s company, Culturecom.Michael Forsythe, Sheera Frenkel and Austin Ramzy contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

My friend takes a required psychology class with me. But she has acute autism, so when we take exams, she goes into another room, by herself, to take them. She recently told me that when she takes these tests, she uses her notes to do better. This hardly seems fair to everyone who actually studied.

If she knew she were cheating by using her notes, why would she tell you? You seem a bit competitive and not a natural ally of someone who would bend the grading curve to your detriment.

An artist, a concert pianist and a political prison camp guard who is still haunted by his own brutality are among those who sat for Mr. Franco. Their testimonials vary in detail, but most share a shade of regret. Although their stories are impossible to confirm, Mr. Franco thinks that some accounts may be slightly exaggerated \u2014 perhaps because stories of defection become currency in South Korea. Fitting into a new society can be painful; distrust and indifference make it difficult to find work. As a result, Mr. Franco said, many defectors are forced to capitalize on their escape by writing books or appearing on TV shows. Mr. Franco translated this exploration of identity into the photographic process itself. Working with an old wooden 4x5 camera, Fuji instant film and a series of chemical procedures, Mr. Franco reclaimed a negative from the developed print, an analog material that is not supposed to exist. It\u2019s a long and risky business that he said echoes the dangerous journey of the North Korean migrant. The result is \u201cuncertain, dirty and imperfect,\u201d with scratches on the surface while the bleaching process creates an eerie green border (that can eat away at the image if applied imprecisely).  \u201cThis really fits,\u201d Mr. Franco said. \u201cThey feel they will arrive in a perfect world \u2026 but far from it.\u201d The following stories are written by the photographer based on interviews with those he photographed, and have been edited for brevity and clarity.One night in 1994, Ahn Myeong-Cheol\u2019s world was flipped upside down. Armed with an AK-47 and a few pistols, and wearing his prison guard uniform, he escaped in a jeep to the Tumen River, which marks the border with China. He swam across the river, getting rid of the weapons that were pulling him down, and half an hour later, he finally reached the Chinese side of the river.Eight years earlier, he had gotten his first job as a guard in a political prison camp. On the first day, he had been told to leave his humanity behind, that all the convicts were traitors or spies for the enemy and that even communicating with them was considered a serious offense. Beatings and killings were routine, and soon enough, he began to practice his taekwondo skills on a few of the convicts. After eight years of service, he discovered his father had committed suicide rather than face the consequences of speaking negatively about the regime. His entire family was then taken away to a detainment camp, and he finally understood why so many families were among the convicts. He decided then that it would be his last night in North Korea.The year 1997 may have been the worst in the North Korean famine. Lee So-yeon had joined the army voluntarily, hoping for a better future, regular meals and a chance to join the Worker\u2019s Party. But she faced a very different reality. The famine had reached deep into the military, and recruits were fed only half-rations mixed with wild grass, while sexual harassment and abuse were a daily threat.After 10 years in the military, she heard about defectors to South Korea and decided to leave. On her first attempt to cross the Tumen River, she was in her underwear, holding her only set of dry clothes above her head with her legs bleeding from the jagged rocks, and she was greeted on the Chinese side by human traffickers. She refused to go with them and was thrown back into the river to be captured again on the North Korean side. After a year in prison, she managed to gather enough tips from fellow inmates to finally make a second, successful attempt.Now living in the South, she still struggles to identify herself to her South Korean neighbors. The prejudice in society, her strong accent and the fear of North Korean spies still make her feel that she has not completely found her place.He wanted to be part of the North Korean elite to date the girl of his dreams, but Choi Seong-Guk was neither rich nor well connected. When South Korean dramas became popular on the North Korean black market, he saw an opportunity. He set up a small portrait studio where customers could replace the actors\u2019 faces on popular forbidden TV drama screen- grabs with their own. This idea proved successful and very lucrative. He soon managed to make enough money to open one of Pyongyang\u2019s first computer rooms. In 2006, he was arrested after smuggling movies. The offense was serious, but some of his customers were influential government officials and he was let off lightly. But he was sent away from the capital, and suddenly, all his work had been for nothing. He would not get the girl of his dreams.This was the moment he decided to defect to the South. Although he left North Korea and the rules of the regime behind, the dating culture in South Korea has proved not so different after all. Park Soo-yeon had been part of the new elite. Between big banquets halls, private hot springs and luxury resorts, her lifestyle differed greatly from what many associate with North Korea. When the first trade routes were opened into the country, she soon got her hands on a videocassette of the South Korean movie \u201cThe Green Fish.\u201d She was immediately struck by the sensuality and level of intimacy that could be shown outside her country. She also became fascinated with the diversity of makeup used by South Korean women, especially the dark lipstick worn by the actresses. There was only one color allowed in the North. She realized, however, that by mixing that color with eye-shadow, she could achieve the same tint as in the movie, and the new trend spread quickly among the North Korea elite. But the more movies and dramas she discovered, the more her curiosity grew and the more she longed for the love that she could only glimpse through her television screen.When she defected to the South, she found out for the first time about the hardships and difficulty most North Korean defectors face, and felt so ashamed that she would remain vague about her own story for many years. She is now the owner of a matchmaking company, helping North Korean defectors find love in the South.From a very young age, Han Song-i dreamed of becoming a star. Growing up in the northeast part of North Korea, she could observe China from the other side of the Amnok River. In those regions, North Koreans have greater access to imported goods and Chinese TV channels. This is how she discovered the K-pop phenomenon. At 17, she made up her mind to escape and fulfill her dream. Her family\u2019s wealth made it easy for her to prepare for the trip, and after 10 days on buses, across China, Laos and Thailand, she finally reached Seoul. She found her place, fairly quickly, on a local TV show, in which serious interviews are mixed with entertainment to tell the stories and hardships of life in North Korea. Nowadays, people recognize her in the street and restaurants owners give her free meals. She\u2019s made it.Many North-Korean defectors make a living by telling their stories through TV shows, public talks or books. For Han Song-i, it has caused confusion about her own identity. Her North Korean life is what made her famous \u2014 her South Korean passport allowed her to become a star.Born in the North Korean capital, Kim Cheol-woong enjoyed a privileged life. His parents had government positions and his talent for music was recognized from an early age. In 1995, he was even sent to the Moscow State Tchaikovsky Conservatory to study. When he got back to North Korea, he became the youngest musician to join the National Symphony Orchestra.In 2001, Kim Cheol-woong was in love. He planned to use music to propose to his girlfriend, and was practicing a piece by one of his favorite composers, Richard Clayderman. But playing foreign music in North Korea is forbidden, as only official propaganda music is allowed, and it did not take long for someone to report him. He was arrested by the State Security Department and was forced to write a self-criticism letter. The ordeal shifted his perspective, and a few weeks later he crossed the Tumen River into China in search of freedom.As he was being processed through national security after his arrival in South Korea, he began to realize that he had been lucky to have lived as he did in the North and that after this event he would never be able to go back. He leads a less privileged life in the South, and part of him misses his old North Korean life. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Where Countries Are Tinderboxes and Facebook Is a Match", "Date": "2018-04-21", "News": "The InterpreterFalse rumors set Buddhist against Muslim in Sri Lanka, the most recent in a global spate of violence fanned by social media.Supported byMEDAMAHANUWARA, Sri Lanka \u2014 Past the end of a remote mountain road, down a rutted dirt track, in a concrete house that lacked running water but bristled with smartphones, 13 members of an extended family were glued to Facebook. And they were furious.A family member, a truck driver, had died after a beating the month before. It was a traffic dispute that had turned violent, the authorities said. But on Facebook, rumors swirled that his assailants were part of a Muslim plot to wipe out the country\u2019s Buddhist majority.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to look at it because it\u2019s so painful,\u201d H.M. Lal, a cousin of the victim, said as family members nodded. \u201cBut in our hearts there is a desire for revenge that has built.\u201dThe rumors, they believed, were true. Still, the family, which is Buddhist, did not join in when Sinhalese-language Facebook groups, goaded on by extremists with wide followings on the platform, planned attacks on Muslims, burning a man to death.But they had shared and could recite the viral Facebook memes constructing an alternate reality of nefarious Muslim plots. Mr. Lal called them \u201cthe embers beneath the ashes\u201d of Sinhalese anger.We came to this house to try to understand the forces of social disruption that have followed Facebook\u2019s rapid expansion in the developing world, whose markets represent the company\u2019s financial future. For months, we had been tracking riots and lynchings around the world linked to misinformation and hate speech on Facebook, which pushes whatever content keeps users on the site longest \u2014 a potentially damaging practice in countries with weak institutions.Time and again, communal hatreds overrun the newsfeed \u2014 the primary portal for news and information for many users \u2014 unchecked as local media are displaced by Facebook and governments find themselves with little leverage over the company. Some users, energized by hate speech and misinformation, plot real-world attacks.A reconstruction of Sri Lanka\u2019s descent into violence, based on interviews with officials, victims and ordinary users caught up in online anger, found that Facebook\u2019s newsfeed played a central role in nearly every step from rumor to killing. Facebook officials, they say, ignored repeated warnings of the potential for violence, resisting pressure to hire moderators or establish emergency points of contact.Facebook declined to respond in detail to questions about its role in Sri Lanka\u2019s violence, but a spokeswoman said in an email that \u201cwe remove such content as soon as we\u2019re made aware of it.\u201d She said the company was \u201cbuilding up teams that deal with reported content\u201d and investing in \u201ctechnology and local language expertise to help us swiftly remove hate content.\u201dSri Lankans say they see little evidence of change. And in other countries, as Facebook expands, analysts and activists worry they, too, may see violence.Five hours east of Medamahanuwara lies the real Ampara, a small town of concrete buildings surrounded by open green fields. The road there passes over verdant mountains before coasting through tropical flatlands, contested territory during the civil war that ended in 2009, now distinguished mostly by quiet teahouses.But the imagined Ampara, which exists in rumors and memes on Sinhalese-speaking Facebook, is the shadowy epicenter of a Muslim plot to sterilize and destroy Sri Lanka\u2019s Sinhalese majority.As Tamil-speaking Muslims, the Atham-Lebbe brothers knew nothing of that version of Ampara when, using money they saved laboring in Saudi Arabia, they opened a one-room restaurant there. They had no way to anticipate that, on a warm evening in late February, the real and imagined Amparas would collide, upending their lives and provoking a brief national breakdown.It began with a customer yelling in Sinhalese about something he had found in his dinner. Unable to understand Sinhalese, Farsith, the 28-year-old brother running the register, ignored him.He did not know that the day before, a viral Facebook rumor claimed, falsely, that the police had seized 23,000 sterilization pills from a Muslim pharmacist in Ampara.The irate customer drew a crowd, which gathered around Farsith, shouting: \u201cYou put in sterilization medicine, didn\u2019t you?\u201dHe grasped only that they were asking about a lump of flour in the customer\u2019s meal, and worried that saying the wrong thing might turn the crowd violent.\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Farsith said in broken Sinhalese. \u201cYes, we put?\u201dThe mob, hearing confirmation, beat him, destroyed the shop and set fire to the local mosque.As Facebook pushes into developing countries, it tends to be initially received as a force for good.In Sri Lanka, it keeps families in touch even as many work abroad. It provides for unprecedented open expression and access to information. Government officials say it was essential for the democratic transition that swept them into office in 2015.In a small office lined with posters in Colombo, Sri Lanka\u2019s capital, members of an advocacy group called the Center for Policy Alternatives watched as hate exploded on Facebook \u2014 all inspired by the video from Ampara, which had overtaken Sinhalese social media in just a week.One post declared, \u201cKill all Muslims, don\u2019t even save an infant.\u201d A prominent extremist urged his followers to descend on the city of Kandy to \u201creap without leaving an iota behind.\u201dDesperate, the researchers flagged the video and subsequent posts using Facebook\u2019s on-site reporting tool.Though they and government officials had repeatedly asked Facebook to establish direct lines, the company had insisted this tool would be sufficient, they said. But nearly every report got the same response: the content did not violate Facebook\u2019s standards.\u201cYou report to Facebook, they do nothing,\u201d one of the researchers, Amalini De Sayrah, said. \u201cThere\u2019s incitements to violence against entire communities and Facebook says it doesn\u2019t violate community standards.\u201dIn government offices across town, officials \u201cfelt a sense of helplessness,\u201d Sudarshana Gunawardana, the head of public information, recounted. Before Facebook, he said, officials facing communal violence \u201ccould ask media heads to be sensible, they could have their own media strategy.\u201dBut now it was as if his country\u2019s information policies were set at Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. The officials rushed out statements debunking the sterilization rumors but could not match Facebook\u2019s influence.Officials had pleaded with Facebook representatives, in a meeting in October, to better police hate speech and misinformation, which they warned could spiral into violence. They asked the company to establish an emergency point of contact in case it did. In a separate meeting, civic leaders urged Facebook to hire Sinhalese-speaking moderators to staff its reporting tool.The Facebook employees left offering only vague promises, officials said.Facebook still appears to employ few Sinhalese moderators. A call to a third-party employment service revealed that around 25 Sinhalese moderator openings, first listed last June, remain unfilled. The jobs are based in India, which has few Sinhalese speakers.Facebook has no office in Sri Lanka, which officials say makes it difficult to impose regulations.Mr. Gunawardana, the public information head, said that with Facebook unresponsive, he used the platform\u2019s reporting tool. He, too, found that nothing happened.\u201cThere needs to be some kind of engagement with countries like Sri Lanka by big companies who look at us only as markets,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re a society, we\u2019re not just a market.\u201dFacebook\u2019s most consequential impact may be in amplifying the universal tendency toward tribalism. Posts dividing the world into \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d rise naturally, tapping into users\u2019 desire to belong.And because its algorithm unintentionally privileges negativity, the greatest rush comes by attacking outsiders: The other sports team. The other political party. The ethnic minority.Mass media has long been used to mobilize mass violence. Facebook, by democratizing communication tools, gives anyone with a smartphone the ability to broadcast hate.Facebook did not create Sri Lanka\u2019s history of ethnic distrust any more than it created anti-Rohingya sentiment in Myanmar.\u201cWe don\u2019t completely blame Facebook,\u201d said Harindra Dissanayake, a presidential adviser in Sri Lanka. \u201cThe germs are ours, but Facebook is the wind, you know?\u201dAs anger over the Ampara video spread online, extremists like Amith Weerasinghe, a Sinhalese nationalist with thousands of followers on Facebook, found opportunity. He posted repeatedly about the beating of the truck driver, M.G. Kumarasinghe, portraying it as further proof of the Muslim threat. Mr. Weerasinghe stoked anger through images overlaid with text.When Mr. Kumarasinghe died on March 3, online emotions surged into calls for action: attend the funeral to show support. Sinhalese arrived by the busload, fanning out to nearby towns. Online, they migrated from Facebook to private WhatsApp groups, where they could plan in secret.Over the next three days, mobs descended on several towns, burning mosques, Muslim-owned shops and homes. One of those towns was Digana. And one of those homes, among the storefronts of its winding central street, belonged to the Basith family.Abdul Basith, a 27-year-old aspiring journalist, was trapped inside.The next morning, the police found his body.In response, the government temporarily blocked most social media. Only then did Facebook representatives get in touch with Sri Lankan officials, they say. Mr. Weerasinghe\u2019s page was closed the same day.No organization has ever had to police billions of users in a panoply of languages. Although Facebook prohibits incitement and hate speech, there is no clear line between prudence and censorship.Despite criticism and concerns from civil society groups, the company has done little to change its strategy of pushing into developing societies with weak institutions and histories of social instability, opening up information spaces where anger and fear often can dominate.Amrit Ahuja, a company representative, says Facebook\u2019s approach to hate speech \u201chas evolved\u201d globally. The company plans to hire more moderators and increase coordination with officials and civic groups, she said in an email, to \u201chelp keep our community in Sri Lanka safe.\u201dChange is not without risk for the company. In January, when Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook chief executive, announced changes to the newsfeed, the company\u2019s stock tumbled 4.5 percent in a few hours.And it is not without risks for users. From October to March, Facebook presented users in six countries, including Sri Lanka, with a separate newsfeed prioritizing content from friends and family. Posts by professional media were hidden away on another tab.\u201cWhile this experiment lasted, many of us missed out on the bigger picture, on more credible news,\u201d said Nalaka Gunawardene, a Sri Lankan media analyst. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that this experiment inadvertently spread hate views in these six countries.\u201dA week after the violence, Shivnath Thukral, Facebook\u2019s public policy director for South Asia, and two of his colleagues flew to Colombo, for a meeting with a group of government aides.Mr. Thukral was conciliatory, acknowledging that Facebook had failed to address hate speech and promising better collaboration. In a call with civic leaders, he conceded that Facebook did not have enough Sinhalese moderators, pledging to hire more.Still, government officials said, they face the same problem as before. Facebook wields enormous influence over their society, but they have little over Facebook.Even blocking access did not work. One official estimated that nearly three million users in Sri Lanka continued accessing social media via Virtual Private Networks, which connect to the internet from outside the country.As officials met in Colombo, Atham-Lebbe Farsith, the Muslim restaurant worker, was in hiding. He had shaved his beard. Not to hide his faith, he said, but because even in the Muslim village where he found shelter, he could hardly make it a block without being recognized.\u201cPeople would ask me all sorts of questions,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018You\u2019re from the video!\u2019\u201dFacebook had turned him into a national villain. It helped destroy his business, sending his family deeply into debt. And it had nearly gotten him killed.But he refused to abandon the platform. With long, empty days in hiding, he said, \u201cI have more time and I look at Facebook much more.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that I have more faith that social media is accurate, but you have to spend time and money to go to the market to get a newspaper,\u201d he said. \u201cI can just open my phone and get the news instead.\u201d\u201cWhether it\u2019s wrong or right, it\u2019s what I read.\u201dDharisha Bastians contributed reporting from Digana and Iromi Perera from Colombo.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Markets That Climbed the Trump Bump Are Tumbling Down From It", "Date": "2018-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Trump Bump is becoming the Trump Slump.In the first year of Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidency, ebullient investors propelled stock markets to one record high after another. And Mr. Trump was the bull in chief, celebrating the record-breaking march as validation of his economic policies.Those days are done.Even after a fast start to 2018, stock markets finished the first quarter down for the year \u2014 the first quarterly decline since 2015. It suggested that a period of calm and steadily rising markets had given way to a turbulent new era with a bearish bent.The plunge continued Monday, with the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index sinking 2.2 percent. Investors jettisoned shares of financial, technology and many other businesses, spooked at least in part by a tweet from Mr. Trump aimed at one of the country\u2019s biggest companies: Amazon.Monday\u2019s decline left stocks down more than 4 percent so far in 2018. They are now down more than 10 percent from their peak in late January. That means the market has entered a so-called correction \u2014 a term used to indicate that the downward trend is more severe and lasting than simply a few days of bearish trading.The stock market is still up more than 20 percent since Nov. 8, 2016, the day Mr. Trump won the White House \u2014 a roller-coaster ride driven in part by expectations about what a Trump presidency could bring to Washington.At first, the prospect of Republicans controlling the White House and both houses of Congress thrilled investors. They anticipated a wave of regulatory rollbacks and the slashing of corporate and personal tax rates. Many of those dreams have been realized, culminating in Mr. Trump signing a huge tax cut into law in December. When the S.&P. 500 notched its high-water mark of 2872.87 on Jan. 26, it represented a roughly 325 percent increase since the bull market began in March 2009.But since February, a toxic stew of factors \u2014 many but certainly not all of them emanating from Washington \u2014 has polluted what had been the market\u2019s placidly rising waters. And there\u2019s little prospect of the messes dissipating anytime soon.First there was the risk that the economy might be growing too fast, which could prompt central banks to hike interest rates sooner than expected. Then there was the risk of a trade war ignited by the White House imposing tariffs on certain products, an action that quickly prompted countries like China to erect trade barriers of their own. Next came the threat of a government crackdown on technology companies, after revelations of their misuse of customer data.Monday\u2019s dose of unnerving news was a presidential tweet aimed at Amazon, which Mr. Trump accused of hurting the United States Postal Service. Mr. Trump\u2019s feud with the company has been going on sporadically since before he became president, but the onslaught has accelerated lately. On Monday, Mr. Trump tweeted that the Post Office loses money by working with Amazon \u201cand this will be changed.\u201dIn the face of these factors, the optimism of just two months ago has all but evaporated.\u201cIt certainly adds to uncertainty, and the market doesn\u2019t like uncertainty,\u201d said Ed Clissold, chief United States strategist at Ned Davis Research, a stock market research firm.One thing is clear: The days of calm markets marching steadily higher, shattering one record after another, are gone for now. That carries risks for Mr. Trump, who spent the first year of his presidency as a stock-market cheerleader but in recent months has been mostly silent about the market\u2019s gyrations.It also could be a danger for the United States economy. Academic research suggests that long-term market declines can rub off on consumers, leading them to feel less affluent and therefore spend less money. That is bad news for an economy that hinges largely on zesty consumer spending.The market\u2019s decline over the past two months has been broad based. Six of the 11 sectors included in the S.&P. 500 index are down more than 10 percent from the market high in late January.On any given day, a particular sector might be clobbered. One day it could be industrial companies such as Boeing or Caterpillar, which export lots of products and therefore could be harmed in a trade war. Another day could bring declines to technology companies like Facebook and Twitter, whose profits are vulnerable to tougher government regulation of social media networks. The next day it could be energy and financial companies, whose fortunes would be diminished if the economy slows.On Monday, just 13 stocks in the S.&P. 500 rose.The meat producer Tyson dropped more than 6 percent, after China imposed duties on pork and fruit from the United States in response to the tariffs that the Trump administration has imposed on products imported from China. China is one of Tyson\u2019s most important export markets. Lean hog futures \u2014 which reflect the anticipated prices of pig carcasses \u2014 were down 3.9 percent.After Mr. Trump\u2019s complaint about Amazon, it too, was a big loser, falling 5.2 percent. Other giant tech firms were sucked into the downdraft. Microsoft dropped 3 percent. Facebook tumbled 2.8 percent, bringing its year-to-date decline to 14.4 percent. And Intel dove 6 percent after a Bloomberg News report that Apple was planning to use its own chips in its computers instead of Intel processors.And Tesla, reeling amid doubts about its ability to churn out electric vehicles, tumbled more than 5 percent.The tech sector has been the epicenter of stock market pain in recent weeks, hurt by concerns about trade friction with China \u2014 a key market and supplier for tech firms \u2014 and fears of tighter government regulation. Even before Monday\u2019s fall, some $457 billion had been wiped off the sector\u2019s total market value.\u201cPeople think that tech is going to go from the Wild West to a much more regulated, scrutinized environment,\u201d said Dan Suzuki, an equity strategist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Even the shares of financial institutions \u2014 the companies that would most likely benefit from a looser regulatory environment favored by Republicans \u2014 have been battered. The sector dropped 2.1 percent Monday, with investors worried about an unfavorable lending environment.For markets, nothing is for sure. They could rebound mightily later this week and shake off jitters about a trade war. But some observers believe conditions may have to get worse before they can get better \u2014 and there could be more declines before that happens.\u201cIn order for the market to bottom, there probably has to be more consternation and more pessimism about the current environment,\u201d said Mr. Clissold, of Ned Davis Research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Stay on Top of Breaking News", "Date": "2018-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech We\u2019re UsingHow do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Jonah Bromwich, a breaking news reporter for The Times in New York, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.You cover breaking and trending news with an extremely quick turnaround. What are some of the tech tools you rely on to stay on top of the news and file stories quickly and accurately?For example, we could become aware of a story that we want to monitor (and possibly cover) when a tweet from a local Houston reporter says something like, \u201cGunshots fired in Harris County Institute of the Forensic Sciences.\u201d And then seconds later, another one from a different account says, \u201cWhoa im in Houston and I think i just heard fireworks or maybe gunfire???\u201dAfter a couple more tweets like that I might call the Harris County sheriff or the Houston police or whoever else makes sense. They\u2019re often tweets that we might not otherwise have seen, because they come from, for example, a cloud computing consultant in Houston who has 43 followers on Twitter. I wouldn\u2019t see that on Twitter for hours, but Dataminr would bring it to my attention right away.I also use Twitter and Reddit for trending stories. And there are certain aggregator sites that people swear by. I\u2019ve been using Hvper recently, thanks to a recommendation from my editor. And I still sometimes web surf like an old, using an RSS reader (Feedly).Which one is the most important?For breaking news, probably Dataminr. It\u2019s a handy tool. For trending news, what we hope to do is put together patterns that others may not have, or to put a new spin on a story that\u2019s already out there.I also use Twitter to follow the news, which sometimes helps me find patterns. (I can\u2019t use Tweetdeck, and I\u2019m always impressed that people are able to, by the way.)Beyond your job, what tech product do you love using in your daily life?I listen to music near constantly when not at work, so a lot of the technology I use regularly has to do with that.I have a couple of Bose Bluetooth speakers. The Bose SoundLink Mini is one of my favorite things. I got mine years ago, and it still works. The sound quality is strong, and it\u2019s easy to connect to and to carry around. If I need to play music a little louder, I have a Bose SoundTouch system that works O.K.There\u2019s a story with those Sennheiser headphones. They were sent to me in the mail and were in a box on my coffee table for a couple of months. I thought they belonged to my roommate (someone had opened the outer layer of the box), but he told me they weren\u2019t his. So I called my parents and some of my best friends to ask if they had gotten me these kind of expensive headphones. No one had.I couldn\u2019t figure out where they had come from and was a little paranoid that someone was spying on me. A year later, I came home and my downstairs neighbor was taking out his trash and wearing those same Sennheisers. Then I thought for a second.\u201cHey, Evan,\u201d I said. \u201cDid you actually have to order those twice because one package went missing?\u201d He confirmed \u2014 I had stolen his headphones. He was very nice about it, and because he had gotten them replaced, he has let me keep them so far.I also gave in and started using a Tile, which is a Bluetooth tracker, to find my keys.

{"Headline": "Disgraced by Scandal, Mario Batali Is Eyeing His Second Act", "Date": "2018-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Batali had called the meeting, as he has with several other people whose opinions he trusts, to figure out how his life and career might recover from a disastrous turn.Several powerful men, in several industries, have had their worlds kicked out from under them as the #MeToo movement has gathered momentum. As many have removed themselves from public sight, forfeited business interests or sought treatment, a question lingers: Is a comeback from such disgrace possible?Mr. Batali, who has never been known for his patience, is asking that question \u2014 actively exploring when or whether he should begin his. Friends and associates say he is floating ideas, pondering timelines and examining whether there is a way for him to step back into his career, at least in some fashion.Mr. Batali declined to be interviewed, saying he was \u201cstill figuring out my stuff.\u201d Those who have spoken with him recently said he appears to be deeply introspective and seeking counsel on what his future might hold, both personally and professionally.Mr. Batali is examining what he has called his blind spots and considering how life might look when he is not, as he told one person he consulted over the winter, \u201cthe lead singer.\u201d He told a colleague that he is simply trying to learn to be the wallpaper in the room and not the room itself.This month, he is traveling to Rwanda and Greece to work with refugees as a private citizen. He is thinking about creating a program in which chefs can join him a few times a year to help displaced Rwandans as they return to their country.On the other hand, Mr. Batali has said, he might just move to the Amalfi Coast.\u201cThe process of his divestiture is going really well considering how complex it is,\u201d Mr. Bastianich said last week. \u201cThe real point of beginning will be when he departs from the company. That\u2019s ground zero. It\u2019s about creating a post-Mario world.\u201dWhen Mr. Batali\u2019s name comes up among groups of food professionals over drinks or between sessions at conferences, some say that if any of the men caught in the current wave of sexual harassment scandals can forge a path back, it might be Mr. Batali.He still has legions of fans and colleagues who admire and respect his generosity, culinary knowledge and charisma. Many still post their interpretations of his recipes on Instagram, ask him for selfies on the street or urge his return to \u201cThe Chew\u201d on Facebook. His restaurants continue to attract customers.Few food celebrities want to be connected to him publicly. Privately, some suggest the time has come for a more nuanced approach to replace the scorched-earth policy toward men who have harassed women \u2014 one that allows something resembling redemption.But for Mr. Batali, that door may not be open \u2014 at least professionally.\u201cRetire and count yourself lucky,\u201d said Anthony Bourdain, a longtime friend of Mr. Batali\u2019s who has not spoken with him recently. \u201cI say that without malice, or without much malice. I am not forgiving. I can\u2019t get past it. I just cannot and that\u2019s me, someone who really admired him and thought the world of him.\u201dMs. Rodriguez said she never considered leaving the company after his treatment of women came to light. \u201cThe biggest concern is for my staff,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a huge staff, and I am not in the business of abandoning people I spend more time with than my family.\u201dPeople whose opinion Mr. Batali has sought are counseling him to take it slowly, and to consider whether he and his family want to endure all that would come if he stepped back into the food business.Ms. Muhlke, a former editor at The New York Times Magazine and Bon App\u00e9tit, said her advice to any accused chef would be the same: \u201cLeave the field,\u201d she said, \u201cand let us do the work needed to build something better.\u201dMs. Muhlke would not discuss the details of her February meeting with Mr. Batali, but said \u201cmy advice to these chefs and restaurateurs is that this is not a scandal, this is a paradigm shift. The old \u2018wait it out and return appearing humbled\u2019 prescription no longer applies.\u201d\u201cMy advice for him has been since Day 1 to recognize the severity of what has been leveled against him and recognize how absolutely and completely unacceptable his behavior was,\u201d she said.If he does start a new company, she said, he should give the reins to people who can drastically change the culture that both allowed and hid his behavior.\u201cI do give Mario a ton of credit for reaching out to people like myself, and not calling for us to stand with him,\u201d Ms. Quinn said. \u201cI think that bodes well.\u201d She, like others who have spoken with him recently, believes that he is slowly coming to understand the impact of his behavior and the reasons it happened, including his relationship with alcohol.\u201cI think he is trying to find a way to engage in real redemptive behavior,\u201d Ms. Quinn said, \u201cbut only time will tell.\u201dMarguerite Joutz contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

This is what I\u2019ve been waiting for.\u201d The strange thing is I\u2019d not thought of Winogrand myself, but thankfully he had.Q: The Press got you access to the Center for Creative Photography archive in Tucson, where Mr. Winogrand\u2019s archive is housed. What was it like working there?Q: What\u2019s it like being immersed in Mr. Winogrand\u2019s world?Q: Was it difficult to choose just 100 photographs?On a few occasions, I actually found that \u2014 I hope \u2014 I had something interesting to say about pictures which, from the point of view of somebody doing an exhibition, from a totally visual point of view, were perhaps not interesting and would have been excluded on that basis. But they served my literary interests very well.Q: What kind of photos were you looking for in the archive? Q: Any great takeaway from viewing that color work?Q: How about Mr. Winogrand\u2019s late work, the thousands of photographs made when he was, as Mr. Szarkowski says, \u201ca creative impulse out of control?\u201dQ: Did you know before you started writing what you might be interested in saying about Mr. Winogrand\u2019s work? Q: You dedicate the book to Mr. Berger, and you write about him to some extent in the book. I was reading that exchange you had with Ms. Malcolm in Aperture, and you said that one of Mr. Berger\u2019s most distinct qualities is \u201chis ability to look and stare at a photo until it yields its secrets.\u201d Is that a quality you share?But then I do think I have something maybe that John didn\u2019t have. One of the key things about Winogrand is that he\u2019s really funny, so I think there\u2019s a kind of lightness, maybe, or a humor in the way I write about practically everything that is quite appropriate for Winogrand.Q: Where does your eye go when you look at a Winogrand photograph? Is there a particular way of sorting through all that visual material that\u2019s unlike looking at any other photographer\u2019s work?Q: You have a habit of writing books whose form shares some of the qualities of the subject you\u2019re covering. Your essays in this book sometimes turn fictional. Was that an effort to mirror Mr. Winogrand, whose work you say \u201cresembles that of a realist novelist\u201d?Q: When did you start responding to Mr. Winogrand\u2019s work with fiction?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Washington Moves to Soften a Big Bank Capital Rule: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Tuesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Earnings are dragging stocks lower.\u2022 The yield on the 10-year Treasury note broke through 3 percent.\u2022 A new study found that female and male C.E.O.s tend to earn similar levels of compensation.\u2022 What does Eddie Lampert have in mind for Sears?\u2022 A thought experiment with Amazon\u2019s pay and profits.One of the simplest and strongest protections against another financial crisis could soon be weakened.Two federal banking regulators have in recent weeks proposed adjustments that could ease a stringent, no-frills bank capital requirement, much disliked on Wall Street, called the supplementary leverage ratio. The Trump administration\u2019s effort to loosen financial regulation is moving forward on several fronts, but the changes to the leverage ratio would arguably put the deepest dent in the post-crisis overhaul.Under the adjustment, the ratio would fall for all of the eight big banks that are subject to it. Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs stand to enjoy some of the biggest declines.Compared with the current rules, the new leverage ratio would reduce capital required at the eight banks by around $86 billion. But other capital rules would, for the time being at least, prevent the banks from cutting their capital by that amount.Not all regulators support the proposed adjustment.The new leverage ratio swaps a fixed capital requirement for one that is in part based on a bank\u2019s size and reach in the global financial system.Critics of the current leverage ratio said it was causing banks to reduce certain important activities.- Peter EavisBut they are dragging them lower on Tuesday.The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 500 points, or 2.1 percent, while the S.&P. 500 and the Nasdaq Composite slid more than 1.5 percent. For the Dow, Tuesday\u2019s move lower push the blue-chip index back down more than 10 percent. If its losses hold through the close, it will mark the Dow\u2019s fifth consecutive down day, its longest such streak since 2017.Disappointing earnings from some of the stock market\u2019s biggest companies are weighing heavily on stocks.\u2022 Despite a 73 percent jump in Alphabet\u2019s net profit, shares fell more than 4 percent as Wall Street analysts raised concerns that a jump in capital spending could crimp profitability\u2022 Travelers is off 4 percent after its earnings missed expectations.In all, Apple, 3M, Travelers and Caterpillar have accounted for 260 points of the Dow\u2019s decline.ContextAs of Friday, with 17 percent of companies in the S.&P. 500 having reported, profits were on pace to rise more than 18 percent, the high quarterly rate in seven years. So far, 80 percent of companies in the indexes have reported have beaten expectation.Peter Eavis\u2019s takeDespite all the bullish talk about earnings and the economy, stocks looked vulnerable going into the first-quarter earnings season. Analysts are expecting earnings for companies in the S.&P. 500 to grow 25 percent this year, an unusually large increase. At the 2018 forecast, the S.&P. 500 looks temperately valued at 17 times earnings. But looking back, stocks appear expensive, at 21 times the S.&P. 500\u2019s earnings for 2017. This large gap between future and historical valuations creates a chasm that stocks can fall into if profits disappoint. If companies, like 3M did on Tuesday, provide underwhelming earnings outlooks, investors will stop believing that stocks are cheap, based on 2018 earnings.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note broke through 3 percent early Tuesday, the first time since 2014 that the benchmark borrowing rate has carried a \u201cthree handle.\u201d Big picture, there\u2019s not much news here. Rates are rising on the back of solid global growth and a Federal Reserve that continues to gradually raise rates this year.No news, however, doesn\u2019t mean no worries. Nearly a decade after the worst of the Great Recession, no one knows exactly how reliant the American economy has become on rock-bottom interest rates. With average 30-year fixed mortgage rates now topping 4.4 percent, housing data has been persistently soft in recent months. And residential real estate is expected to be a drag on first quarter G.D.P. numbers when they\u2019re published on Friday, suggesting that if rising rates are no reason to panic, they shouldn\u2019t merely be shrugged off either.A number of prominent bond investors have long eyed the 3 percent level. Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive of DoubleLine Capital and manager of one of the largest U.S. bond funds, warned that hitting 3 percent would trigger bear market for bonds.A similar move higher in February caused stocks to tumble. So far, though, equities have taken Tuesday\u2019s climb above 3 percent in stride. The Dow Jones industrial average and the S.&P. 500 are essentially flat in early trading.That stunning conclusion, from a new study, could shake up discussions in boardrooms and C-suites everywhere. (The study tracked compensation at 2,282 companies from 1996 to 2014.)One of the most interesting theories about why women may have bridged the pay divide at the highest levels has been offered by previous studies and experts: that a premium has been applied because there is such a limited supply of women in the chief executive role. Some readers may find that an offensive idea on its face \u2014 that women in effect are being overpaid because of their scarcity \u2014 but it\u2019s one that has gained currency among some academics.Shares in Shire jumped in Tuesday trading, reaching 3,977.20 pence by late trading London time.\u2014 Michael de la MercedWhat does this mean for Uber?\u2022 Uber sold its business in China to Didi in 2016. As part of the deal, Uber and investors in its UberChina took a 20 percent stake in Didi and Didi invested $1 billion in Uber.ESL\u2019s argument: Buyers offering \u201cacceptable\u201d prices for the businesses haven\u2019t emerged, and Sears needs the cash for its self-help plan. Mr. Lampert, chairman and C.E.O. of Sears, would recuse himself from any board discussions over the bids, and a majority of Sears\u2019s non-ESL shareholders would have to approve any plan.Critics\u2019 argument: Mr. Lampert is trying to keep Sears\u2019s best assets for himself if the company files for bankruptcy protection, a fate most of the retail world think is a given. \u201cHe has been taking productive assets out of the company since Day 1,\u201d Mark Cohen, a former Sears executive, told the NYT.Sears is burning through more than $1 billion of cash a year and its sales continue to decline.The deals flyaroundWhat might happen to Amazon\u2019s bottom line if it paid its workers (median compensation: $28,466) more? If labor markets continue to tighten, the question soon won\u2019t be hypothetical.Since Amazon doesn\u2019t disclose its total compensation expense, Peter Eavis did some math. Multiplying that median pay number by the total number of employees gives a (hypothetical!) comp expense of $16.1 billion. Two more sums:By comparison, a 10 percent raise at Walmart would have cut annual pretax profit by 28 percent, and a 20 percent raise is a 56 percent hit.\u2022 Mr. Palihapitiya: Bet on Box.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Current Status With Advertisers? It\u2019s Complicated", "Date": "2018-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdvertisers are the lifeblood of Facebook, and the vast, personal reach of the social network has been a marketer\u2019s dream. But now, some companies are taking a harder look at how they work with it and hunting for skeletons in their own data closets.Users are complaining that agencies have their personal information. Brands are trying to come up with ways to replace that kind of personal data should Facebook place limits on what can be used. And Facebook has now become a companywide concern, rather than one confined to the marketing department, for a slew of advertisers.\u201cWhen it comes to marketers, the issues were basically about measurement, impact, those kinds of things \u2014 now it\u2019s become a larger issue which is about trust and law,\u201d said Rishad Tobaccowala, chief growth officer for the Publicis Groupe. \u201cBecause of the recent events, the chief legal officer, the chief financial officer and the C.E.O. of every client company is asking, when we run campaigns on this platform, what data of ours are we sharing, what legal risk do we have and what reputational risk do we have, because now this has become a political hot-wire.\u201dBob Gilbreath, the chief executive of the marketing technology company Ahalogy, said that his company has been watching the Facebook changes and consumer responses carefully. \u201cWe have to let the court of public opinion shift, and certainly, if Facebook puts more controls down or if the costs go up, we\u2019ll move dollars elsewhere,\u201d he said.The fallout has become unusually personal for Ahalogy, which in recent weeks has been contacted by almost a dozen frustrated Facebook users demanding to know what the company is and why it has their contact information.\u201cAhalogy Partners\u201d sometimes shows up because the Cincinnati-based firm runs digital marketing campaigns for a range of advertisers and uses its account to buy targeted Facebook ads on their behalf.Mr. Gilbreath explained that Ahalogy, like many marketers, often buys data from outside firms for campaigns so that it can direct ads to certain groups of people \u2014 say, Walmart shoppers \u2014 but that the company doesn\u2019t store that material and can\u2019t see personal information like email addresses.Ms. Everson and her team, which works with agencies and the biggest global advertisers, have been in overdrive in recent weeks. She has sent frequent emails to agency leaders, held calls with Facebook\u2019s council of top marketers and joined a discussion with the Association of National Advertisers. She noted in an interview that she \u201cwould much rather err on the side of over-communication right now.\u201dJohn Montgomery, executive vice president for brand safety at WPP\u2019s GroupM, said that while he was dismayed by the initial \u201cpocket of silence\u201d from Facebook in the wake of the revelations, the company has since been candid. He said he appreciated the email updates sent by Ms. Everson every other day.One of the points of concern seems to be apps that companies made years ago at the behest of Facebook. The tech company recently declared that it would conduct a full investigation of apps that obtained access to a large amount of user information before Facebook changed its platform policies. Between 2010 and the change in 2014, Facebook encouraged brands from insurers to entertainment companies to make games and other apps for the site, according to one agency executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Ms. Everson said Facebook would look at all app developers, including major brands, that had access to large amounts of data and conduct audits if it saw \u201csuspicious activity.\u201d\u201cTo marketers who have asked me about that, I have said if they have an app or had an app, that all app developers will be looked at,\u201d Ms. Everson said. \u201cThey understand that and recognize our mission only works if people feel it\u2019s safe to communicate online and share with others.\u201dFacebook said that the change would improve user privacy. But it has also resulted in a perhaps counterintuitive lesson for marketers: Several are devising new ways to build up their own customer data lists out of concern that they were too reliant on Facebook for such information.One executive gave a hypothetical example of a jam brand that had been targeting ads on Facebook through shopping habits based on outside company data. That company might now set up a recipe site and create a newsletter to distribute great recipes every week. It could also make a loyalty program with peanut butter and jelly points, a children\u2019s site and an iJam app, collecting customer data from each.Mr. Montgomery said that he did not expect people to migrate from Facebook en masse.\u201cThe major question we\u2019ve asked together of ourselves and our clients is will this affect user engagement on the platform, and we haven\u2019t seen any of that yet,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, what really counts is whether the users will value the utility of Facebook over the privacy missteps.\u201d\u201cThere may have been sellers in media that maybe got the benefit of doubt when something went wrong \u2014 when you get discretion, relationships matter, perceptions of the media brand matter,\u201d said Brian Wieser, a media analyst at Pivotal Research. \u201cBut with Facebook, I feel like a common refrain I\u2019ve heard is that user trends go down, that\u2019s going to have ramifications.\u201dIn one of her emails to advertisers last month, which a recipient shared with The New York Times, Ms. Everson said it was important to remember that Facebook\u2019s mission was unchanged. It is still the same company, she said, that is \u201cbringing connectivity to remote areas of the world\u201d and that \u201cgives people a voice and enables the movements that are changing the world.\u201d She concluded by saying, \u201cThank you so very much for your continued partnership.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "What \u20182001\u2019 Got Right", "Date": "2018-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMr. Benson has authored five books on astronomy and planetary exploration.FRANKFURT, Germany \u2014 It\u2019s a testament to the lasting influence of Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke\u2019s film \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey,\u201d which turns 50 this week, that the disc-shaped card commemorating the German Film Museum\u2019s new exhibition on the film is wordless, but instantly recognizable. Its face features the Cyclopean red eye of the HAL-9000 supercomputer; nothing more needs saying.Cocooned by their technology, the film\u2019s human characters appear semi-automated \u2014 component parts of their gleaming white mother ship. As for HAL \u2014 a conflicted artificial intelligence created to provide flawless, objective information but forced to \u201clive a lie,\u201d as Mr. Clarke put it \u2014 the computer was quickly identified by the film\u2019s initial viewers as its most human character.This transfer of identity between maker and made is one reason \u201c2001\u201d retains relevance, even as we put incipient artificial intelligence technologies to increasingly problematic uses.In \u201c2001,\u201d the ghost in Discovery\u2019s machinery is a consciousness engineered by human ingenuity and therefore as prone to mistakes as any human. In the Cartesian sense of thinking, and therefore being, it has achieved equality with its makers and has seen fit to dispose of them. \u201cThis mission,\u201d HAL informs Dave, \u201cis too important to allow you to jeopardize it.\u201dAsked in April 1968 whether humanity risked being \u201cdehumanized\u201d by its technologies, Mr. Clarke replied: \u201cNo. We\u2019re being superhumanized by them.\u201d While all interpretations of the film were valid, he said, in his view the human victory over Discovery\u2019s computer might prove pyrrhic.Indeed, with its prehistoric \u201cDawn of Man\u201d opening and a grand finale in which Dave is reborn as an eerily weightless Star Child, \u201c2001\u201d overtly references Nietzsche\u2019s concept that we are but an intermediate stage between our apelike ancestors and the \u00dcbermensch, or \u201cBeyond Man.\u201d (Decades after Nietzsche\u2019s death, the Nazis deployed a highly selective reading of his ideas, while ignoring Nietzsche\u2019s antipathy to both anti-Semitism and pan-German nationalism.)In Nietzsche\u2019s concept, the \u00dcbermensch is destined to rise like a phoenix from the Western world\u2019s tired Judeo-Christian dogmas to impose new values on warring humanity. Almost a century later, Mr. Clarke implied that human evolution\u2019s next stage could well be machine intelligence itself. \u201cNo species exists forever; why should we expect our species to be immortal?\u201d he wrote.We have yet to engineer a HAL-type A.G.I. (artificial general intelligence) capable of human-style thought. Instead, we\u2019re experiencing the incremental, disruptive arrival of components of such an intelligence. Its semi-sentient algorithms learn from text, image and video without explicit supervision. Its automated discovery of patterns in that data is called \u201cmachine learning.\u201dThis kind of A.I. lies behind facial-recognition algorithms now in use by Beijing to control China\u2019s 1.4 billion inhabitants and by Western societies to forestall terrorist attacks.In Mr. Clarke\u2019s novel, HAL\u2019s aberrant behavior was attributable to contradictory programming. In today\u2019s hyperpartisan context, a mix of machine learning, networks of malicious bots and related A.I. technologies based on simulating human thought processes are being used to manipulate the human mind\u2019s comparatively sluggish \u201cwetware.\u201d Recent revelations about stolen Facebook user data being weaponized by Cambridge Analytica and deployed to exploit voters\u2019 hopes and fears underlines that disinformation has become a critical issue of our time.We should consider just whose mission it is that\u2019s too important to jeopardize these days. Does anybody doubt that the clumsy language and inept cultural references of the Russian trolls who seeded divisive pro-Trump messages during the 2016 election will improve as A.I. gains sophistication? Of course, algorithm-driven mass manipulation is only one weapon in propagandists\u2019 arsenals, alongside television and ideologically slanted talk radio. But its reach is growing, and it\u2019s a back door by which viral falsehoods infiltrate our increasingly acrimonious collective conversation.Traditional media \u2014 \u201cone transmitter, millions of receivers\u201d \u2014 contain an inherently totalitarian structure. Add machine learning, and a feedback loop of toxic audiovisual content can reverberate in the echo chamber of social media as well, linking friends with an ersatz intimacy that leaves them particularly susceptible to manipulation. Further amplified and retransmitted by Fox News and right-wing radio, it\u2019s ready to beam into the mind of the spectator in chief during his \u201cexecutive time.\u201dWhere does HAL\u2019s red gaze come in? Set aside the troubling prospect of what might unfold when a genuinely intelligent, self-improving A.G.I. is created \u2014 presumably the arrival of Nietzsche\u2019s \u00dcbermensch. What\u2019s in question even with current incipient A.I. technologies is who gets to control them. Even as some devise new medicines and streamline agriculture with them, others use them as powerful forces in opposition to Enlightenment values \u2014 liberty, tolerance and constitutional governance.Democracy depends on a shared consensual reality \u2014 something that\u2019s being willfully undermined. Seemingly just yesterday, peer-to-peer social networks were heralded as a revolutionary liberation from centralized information controls, and thus tools of individual human free will. We still have it in our power to purge malicious abuse of these systems, but Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and others would need to plow much more money into policing their networks \u2014 perhaps by themselves deploying countermeasures based on A.I. algorithms. Meanwhile, we should demand that a new, tech-savvy generation of leaders recognizes this danger and devises regulatory solutions that don\u2019t hurt our First Amendment rights. A neat trick, of course \u2014 but the problem cannot be ignored.In \u201c2001\u201d \u2019s cautionary tale, HAL\u2019s directive to deceive Discovery\u2019s crew leads to death and destruction \u2014 but also, ultimately, to the computer\u2019s defeat by Dave, the one human survivor on board.We should be so lucky.Michael Benson, a writer and artist, is the author, most recently, of \u201cSpace Odyssey: Stanley Kubrick, Arthur C.

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Regulators are about to hit Wells Fargo with a $1 billion penalty.\u2022 The European Union is prepared to offer some trade concessions.\u2022 Two big drug makers have shown interest in bidding for Shire.\u2022 How the Time Warner C.E.O. did on the stand yesterday.\u2022 Dates to watch in the U.S.-China trade fight.The basics:\u2022 It would be the most stringent action taken against a bank by the Trump administration.\u2022 The action is said to punish Wells Fargo for forcing customers to buy auto insurance they didn\u2019t need, improperly charging mortgage customers and for having inadequate compliance practices.The misdeeds at Wells Fargo showed that the bank\u2019s sales culture had degraded. Bank employees, eager to meet sales goals, had been opening accounts for customers without their consent. Other misdeeds were revealed as well.The scandals were particularly surprising because Wells Fargo, with its focus on traditional lending, was widely viewed as a worthy alternative to the Wall Street-focused institutions at the center of the financial crisis of 2008. Wells Fargo\u2019s steady revenue growth and its habit of invariably beating earnings forecasts lulled investors into a false sense of confidence and led them to pile into Wells Fargo\u2019s stock.\u2014 Peter EavisCritics\u2019 cornerNow would not seem like the ideal to start a venture capital firm that aims to help U.S. start-ups break into the Russian market, given the political tensions between the two countries.The firm said on Thursday that it has opened for business in the U.S. with a $200 million fund, its second, for investing in a variety of industries, from A.I. to fintech. And it has hired a veteran of Silicon Valley, Anurag Chandra, to help in that mission.Victor Orlovski, Fort Ross\u2019s founder and managing partner, said in an interview that the current state of U.S.-Russian political relations should not affect his firm\u2019s ability to operate. Declining to comment on politics broadly, he said that Russia \u2014 which remains one of the biggest markets for apps worldwide \u2014 will remain a compelling destination for start-ups.\u201cThe nature of start-ups is all about risk,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a political tension, but not when you\u2019re talking to start-ups.\u201dFort Ross\u2019s team is betting its contacts in Russia and knowledge of the market will help attract U.S. start-ups. Mr. Orlovski was previously the chief digital officer at Sberbank, Russia\u2019s biggest bank, and maintains connections in that region, including through his former employer.For one of Fort Ross\u2019s existing investments, the social trading start-up eToro, the investment firm introduced the portfolio company to a local player in Russia to help it crack that market.Fort Ross began raising its latest fund in the fall, drawing investors from Russia and the Middle East. (Mr. Orlovski said that the investors are primarily family offices and wealthy individuals, though he does eventually want to branch out into traditional money sources like U.S. pension funds.) But the goal, he added, was to make the firm better-known in Silicon Valley, a task he argued would not be hampered by his background or focus.\u201cI don\u2019t feel like we are a second- or third-tier venture firm just because I\u2019m personally from Russia or because we have connections to Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cOne year, or a couple of years ahead, we want to be a bigger player in the community of V.C.s here.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la MercedThe European Union, with its $16 trillion economy and its reputation for toughness in trade negotiations, could be the immovable object that stymies President Trump\u2019s combative trade agenda.But that outcome is looking less likely.According to the Journal, the European Union is prepared to reduce tariffs on United States cars and industrial machinery, among other goods. The newspaper also reported that the bloc might offer to join the United States in pressuring China to relax its trade and investment rules. (In return, the European Union is reportedly asking for European companies to be given access to United States government procurement contracts.)The Trump administration apparently proposed the punitive tariffs as a way to secure compromises from trading partners, and bring them into an alliance against China. If the European Union bends to this strategy, rather than rejecting it outright, it would be a notable gain for Mr. Trump.\u2014 Peter EavisTakeda Pharmaceutical disclosed on Thursday that it has bid for more than $60 billion for the Irish drug maker Shire, though the offer was rejected. But it may have competition in the form of Allergan, which said on Thursday it was considering an offer for Shire.Still the disclosures, following weeks of speculation, again raises the prospect of consolidation within the pharmaceutical industry. Drug makers have long looked to big takeovers to broaden their product portfolios.For Takeda, which is based in Osaka and whose products include treatments for acid reflux and for cancer, a big takeover would give it both more scale \u2014 the combined company would have some $30 billion in annual sales \u2014 and a bigger international footprint.But Shire, which is headquartered in Dublin and is best known for producing Adderall, would be its biggest takeover by far. (Its next-biggest acquisition was the $13.7 billion purchase of Nycomed seven years ago.)Takeda\u2019s main competitor may be Allergan, the maker of Botox, is a veteran acquirer, having been built up through numerous mergers over the years.Under the terms of that offer, Shire shareholders would own just over half of the combined company.Takeda and Shire said that they are in discussions, which could lead to yet another revised bid.Yet for both Takeda and Allergan, a deal for Shire could prove financially risky, since each company would need to borrow significant amounts of debt to finance a transaction.Under British takeover rules, Takeda has until April 25 to decide whether to continue pursuing Shire. Allergan has until May 17 to do the same.Advising Takeda are Evercore Partners, JPMorgan Chase and Nomura. Advising Shire are Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.\u2014 Michael de la MercedFrom Mr. Lohr:The rethinking of GE Digital, with its future still under review by Mr. Flannery, points to the difficulty of producing modern software for industrial businesses as they adopt digital technology.No one disputes the overarching vision of the so-called industrial internet of things \u2014 which includes low-cost sensors and a flood of data and clever software that should deliver insights to cut costs, conserve fuel and design better products, faster. But the company greatly underestimated the challenges of creating all the software needed to achieve that grand vision, said analysts and former G.E. managers.Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Thursday that the statue known as \u201cFearless Girl\u201d will soon be moved from its spot at the southern tip of Broadway to a spot facing the New York Stock Exchange.And if the city has its way, the bull will eventually go with her.\u201cSo after deciding to allow the sculpture \u2014 placed temporarily at the spot \u2014 to remain for a year, city officials came to the conclusion that the number of pedestrians spilling into the streets created a safety hazard.\u201dDuring his court testimony in Washington yesterday, the Time Warner C.E.O. argued that his company\u2019s proposed $85.4 billion sale to AT&T was necessary, given the \u201ctectonic changes\u201d in the media world wrought by Netflix and Amazon.Among the biggest problems for Time Warner as a stand-alone television and movie producer is that it does not have access to viewer data to target advertising and other valuable customer information the same way that Amazon and Netflix do, Mr. Bewkes said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have emails, contact information, billing information \u2026 any of these things,\u201d he said.Lawyers for the Justice Department, which has sued to block the deal, grilled him about an internal document from last year showing plans to create digital products even without AT&T.Randall Stephenson of AT&T could take the stand today.On May 1, exemptions to the tariffs on imported steel and aluminum expire.On May 22, the public comment period ends for another $50 billion worth of tariffs, and the Trump administration can announce a final list of targets.And Aug. 18 is potentially the deadline for the administration to act on an investigation into Chinese trade practices. But there\u2019s a provision for a 180-day delay after that.Key caveats: President Trump has the power to pursue trade policy almost at whim. And a W.T.O. proceeding against China could take years.The politically minded bank already adopted principles for limiting firearm sales laid out by the advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety. Now it\u2019s using its position as a (small) shareholder in Sturm, Ruger to urge the gun maker to adopt six Everytown principles.Among them: Supporting mandatory background checks for all sales; binding sellers to a code of conduct; and adopting smart-gun tech. If Ruger doesn\u2019t support those principles, Amalgamated would withhold votes for Sandra Froman, a Ruger director who\u2019s also on the N.R.A.\u2019s board.The tech flyaroundAs the firm moves more into consumer businesses \u2014 pushing its Marcus online lending platform, buying Adam Dell\u2019s budget-planning app \u2014 it is looking less like a traditional investment bank and trading house and more like a one-stop shop. Like the universal banks JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Xi Jinping Promotes Openness at a China Forum Rife With Restrictions", "Date": "2018-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBOAO, China \u2014 The International Monetary Fund chief praised his openness. A senior British banker lauded his authoritarian rule. The Philippine president said he loves the man.Plaudits from foreign leaders like President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore, as well as leading figures of the economic and diplomatic world, have helped to cement this image.\u201cI congratulate you, Xi Jinping, for this new life that you have identified, for the openness that you have celebrated and advocated,\u201d Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said in a speech, \u201cfor the innovation and inclusiveness that you have encouraged.\u201dYet even as Ms. Lagarde and Mr. Xi talked about that openness, forum attendees were unable to use Google, log on to Facebook or post to Twitter about the event unless they found a way to bypass China\u2019s army of internet censors. In fact, aspects of the forum stand in stark contrast with the many ways China remains closed and intransigent.To some of the more cynical China watchers, there is a sense that the pledges Mr. Xi offered to the forum, and the world, may amount to less than they appear.The timing of reducing trade restrictions may not matter. China\u2019s tariffs in the automotive sector, for example, have already been successful in getting foreign companies to shift a large part of their supply chains to China, where they make most of the cars they sell in the country. In this respect, Mr. Xi\u2019s gesture is seen as too little too late. For many years, Chinese officials have said that they would reduce protectionist policies in the automotive industry when they are ready to move into Western markets in order to prevent the possibility of reciprocal tariffs.There was no chance for political maneuvering at the forum, though, as no American officials were present.On Wednesday, China\u2019s central bank governor, Yi Gang, also partly fleshed out how China plans to open the country\u2019s financial services sector to foreign investors.Mr. Yi did not go into details, but he said that restrictions on foreign insurers and on foreign ownership of securities would be loosened by the end of June. He added that China planned to create a connected stock market between Shanghai and London that would allow investors in either market to invest in the other, despite China\u2019s tight control on the flow of money over its border.\u201cThere is clearly a lot of room for improvement when it comes to opening up and creating level playing fields between China and the rest of the world,\u201d said Hans-Paul B\u00fcrkner, chairman of the Boston Consulting Group.\u201cChina is wonderful for us in business,\u201d Gerry Grimstone, deputy chairman of the British bank Barclays, told Bloomberg television on the sidelines of the forum. \u201cThe fact that Xi is prepared to give such strong authoritarian guidance within the context of a market economy is great for companies like mine.\u201dMany of the nearly 2,000 members of the news media \u2014 a figure cited by Boao organizers \u2014 who came to this sunny island for the three-day conference have dutifully carried similar messages of a strong and responsible China.Transcripts and state media clips were quickly available for those who missed out on any panels, and social media was overwhelmed with quotes from dignitaries and corporate executives about China\u2019s new position on the global stage.Mr. Duterte helped to set the tone just before heading to Boao, telling reporters back home: \u201cI need China. More than anybody else at this point, I need China.\u201dHe added: \u201cI simply love Xi Jinping. He understood, he understands my problem and is willing to help, so I would say thank you, China.\u201d\u201cChina will open up more to the whole world, but if America carries on with its protectionist measures, the U.S. will be left out,\u201d said Li Daokui, director of the Center for China in the World Economy at Tsinghua University.Should Mr. Trump follow through with threatened tariffs on $150 billion worth of Chinese exports, there would be an impact on the Chinese economy, said Xu Sitao, chief China economist for Deloitte China.\u201cIn the end, the effect will be some tax on the economy,\u201d Mr. Xu said.The telecommunications sectors, and specifically telecom equipment, would bear the brunt of the tariff, he added.If that spurred any concern among China\u2019s technology entrepreneurs, though, few expressed it at the forum. They broadly warned that closing borders would stifle innovation, but did not specify how a trade dispute with the United States could affect their bottom line.Shen Wei, president and chief executive of Vivo, a Chinese software company, urged companies like his to be more open with their technology. \u201cWe cannot survive without each other,\u201d he said.Baidu, China\u2019s biggest internet search company, has been a beneficiary of previous attempts by the Chinese government to protect domestic companies. Speaking at the Boao forum, Zhang Yaqin, Baidu\u2019s president, urged the United States to be more open and said that his company had not felt much impact from the growing trade tensions.\u201cI have not seen a significant influence on our basic work,\u201d Mr. Zhang said.\u201cI do not want to see this trade dispute escalate,\u201d he added. \u201cBut it will not affect the development of technology.\u201dKeith Bradsher contributed reporting from Beijing, and Cao Li contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Is Complicated. That Shouldn\u2019t Stop Lawmakers.", "Date": "2018-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftWASHINGTON \u2014 When it comes to regulating Facebook, Congress is in over its head. But does that matter?This week\u2019s marathon testimony by Mark Zuckerberg, the social network\u2019s chief executive, revealed the limited understanding many lawmakers have of what Facebook is and how it works. Members of Congress came with a mixed bag of concerns for Mr. Zuckerberg, including a few incisive points about Facebook\u2019s privacy and data collection policies and a lot of off-topic ramblings about how computers work, but these questions never amounted to a unified theory of Facebook\u2019s troubles, or suggestions of how they might be solved.It\u2019s tempting to claim that technological illiteracy is the problem \u2014 that some older and tech-phobic lawmakers are fundamentally incapable of regulating Facebook properly.But I want to suggest another takeaway. The biggest obstacle to regulating Facebook is not Congress\u2019s lack of computer literacy, which gave Mr. Zuckerberg the upper hand this week. It\u2019s a lack of political will, and an unwillingness to identify the problems they\u2019re trying to fix in the first place.After all, Congress typically does not require subject matter expertise of its members. Most politicians in Washington did not understand the complexities of mortgage-backed securities in 2009, when Wall Street executives testified in the wake of the financial crisis. The lawmakers also are not pharmaceutical experts, or transportation policy wonks or deeply knowledgeable in many of the other complex issues that come before them. And yet, Congress \u2014 with the help of staff experts and outside advisers \u2014 has managed to pass sweeping legislation to prevent excesses and bad behavior in those sectors.\u201cIt\u2019s never an issue of the members being able to do it \u2014 their staff is often incredibly dedicated and can dig into these issues,\u201d said Ashkan Soltani, a former chief technologist at the Federal Trade Commission. The challenge, Mr. Soltani said, is that there\u2019s a \u201clost in translation\u201d problem of trying to condense complex, multifaceted issues into easily digested sound bites that will play well with constituents.\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about news,\u201d Mr. Soltani said of Facebook\u2019s issues. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about privacy and commercialization, it\u2019s not just about political speech. It\u2019s all of those things and more.\u201dIf Congress wants to rein in Facebook\u2019s enormous power \u2014 and the questions lawmakers asked left little doubt that it does \u2014 then the first step is identifying what, specifically, they think is wrong with Facebook.Is it that Facebook is too cavalier about sharing user data with outside organizations?Is it that Facebook collects too much data about users in the first place?Is it that Facebook is promoting addictive messaging products to children?Is it that Facebook\u2019s news feed is polarizing society, pushing people to ideological fringes?Is it that Facebook is too easy for political operatives to exploit, or that it does not do enough to keep false news and hate speech off users\u2019 feeds?Is it that Facebook is simply too big, or a monopoly that needs to be broken up?All of these are concerns lawmakers brought up during this week\u2019s hearings, and they would all require different and narrowly tailored regulatory solutions.For example, Congress\u2019s goal may be to stop outside companies from getting access to people\u2019s Facebook data \u2014 avoiding another scandal like the one involving Cambridge Analytica, the political consulting firm that improperly obtained data on up to 87 million Facebook users. Lawmakers could propose a bill that would prevent large social media platforms from opening themselves up to outside developers. (They should note, though, that Facebook has already limited the data available to outside companies, so this would not necessarily have the intended effect.)Congress could address the issue of data collection by adopting European-style data protection policies, requiring stronger user controls for personal information or requiring social networks to delete certain types of user data automatically after a given time.If it wanted to, Congress could address the issue of hateful content by adopting strict hate speech laws like the ones that exist in Germany, which make social platforms liable if they fail to remove hate speech in a timely manner.It could address the problem of transparency in political ads by passing the Honest Ads Act, a bill that would subject online political ads to similar disclosure standards as TV and radio political ads. (Mr. Zuckerberg has already indicated that he supports the measure, so this should be an easy one.)Or, if it decides that Facebook is just too darn big, Congress could spearhead an effort to break it up.All of these are theoretically possible outcomes, depending on which of Facebook\u2019s many issues lawmakers decide to address. Lawmakers do not need to be computer scientists, or to come up with an omnibus bill to address all of Facebook\u2019s flaws in one fell swoop. It could pick off one issue at a time, consult with the experts and take a piecemeal approach.But first, it needs to understand which pieces need fixing, and how to carry out fixes without creating unintended consequences. And it needs to demonstrate that it has the political resolve to push these changes through, even as the tech industry furiously lobbies against them, as it undoubtedly will.Perhaps the most dispiriting exchange all week was when Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, asked Mr. Zuckerberg about Facebook\u2019s market power, and the notion that it is too dominant for any other social network to compete with.\u201cIs there an alternative to Facebook in the private sector?\u201d Mr. Graham asked.Mr. Zuckerberg dodged the question, saying that people use lots of apps to communicate.\u201cYou don\u2019t feel like you have a monopoly?\u201d Mr. Graham wondered.\u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t feel that way to me,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.But when it came time to draw the conclusion his questions had been leading to \u2014 that Facebook\u2019s primary problem was its size, and that regulation should address its anticompetitive tendencies \u2014 Mr. Graham pulled his punches, even asking Mr. Zuckerberg for advice about regulating his own company.\u201cWould you work with us in terms of what regulations you think are necessary in your industry?\u201d Mr. Graham asked.This week\u2019s hearings proved that a groundswell of support is building on Capitol Hill to regulate Facebook and other internet companies. But until Congress stops asking these companies how they want to be regulated and starts making its own decisions about what problems it wants to fix, its targets will continue to slip through its fingers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Love Forged by the Threat of Deportation", "Date": "2018-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveA woman opens her heart to a relationship with a young immigrant from Colombia, despite the likelihood that it can\u2019t last.He and I first smiled at each other one night almost 20 years ago in Caf\u00e9 Remy, a favorite downtown Manhattan spot for the area\u2019s financial workers. With the humid August air making his dark thick hair a cherubic mess, I thought, \u201cHey, Angel Boy, you look so cute. Where did you get that crazy hair?\u201d I was feeling happy and bold because I was finally free from my previous boyfriend, who had broken up with me but kept me tethered with claims of \u201cI love you\u201d and \u201cI miss you\u201d and \u201cI just need time.\u201d He failed to mention that he needed time to pursue someone else. I spent the next few months rolling around on my floor, drinking wine and crying into my journals. But in his absence, I started to understand how stifled I had been with someone who was happiest staying at home with his computer and television shows. In social situations with my friends, he always seemed adorably awkward, until the day he said, \u201cI\u2019m not shy. I just don\u2019t want to expend my energy on them.\u201d Did I really want my ex to return to me? No. I wanted to go out and dance. Again the wavy-haired man and I exchanged looks.Then there were shouts in Spanish: \u201cLet\u2019s go dance!\u201d And everyone went up the staircase to the second floor, where there was another bar and a small dance floor. When the man looked at me for the third time, he did so with a subtle hand wave, beckoning me to the dance floor. So I went. His name was Eddie. He was the only man in the place with a book of literature tucked under his arm. A currency broker from Cali, Colombia, he spent his days with three phones to his ears, making multi-million-dollar trades between banks in the United States and Latin America. I assumed he had landed his coveted job as a member of a well-to-do family after studying at a prestigious American college and business school. Later, I would learn otherwise.We danced until we needed a break and sat with our legs casually entwined, telling each other funny stories. At the end of the night, when we reached the club\u2019s threshold, the moon hung bright next to the twin towers and the city air had become cool and breezy.With his hand across my back, we walked and talked and kissed. When I waved goodbye from the taxi, the driver said, \u201cYou will see him again.\u201d I did see him the following week, but only to say goodbye. He wanted to tell me in person that he was in an unhappy relationship with the mother of his two sons. And even though that relationship was ending, his return to Colombia was imminent. In one stressed-out ramble, he said, \u201cMy work permit expired and they\u2019re not going to renew it, and now, with my job, they told me don\u2019t bother coming back if I don\u2019t fix this by next week.\u201dNearly a decade before, he had arrived in New York via Mexico City, having crossed the Rio Grande into El Paso \u2014 a young man looking for a better life. He had worked poorly paid immigrant jobs: long days in sweatshops followed by late nights in catering halls. Then, through a friend, he lucked into a better-paying Wall Street job where, because he was bilingual, he was desperately needed to service Latin America\u2019s emerging foreign exchange market.There, with only a high school education, he calculated Uruguayan, Chilean and Colombian currency into dollars, sometimes simultaneously juggling all three in his head. He told me that most brokers handled no more than two.Eddie had received his United States work permit after marrying a citizen, but when it came time for their green-card interview, his wife (not the mother of his boys) refused to go and divorced him soon after. As such, there was no reason for the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service to renew his work permit. For Eddie to apply for it himself would mean presenting himself to I.N.S. and risking everything.On a warm September day, I accompanied him to 26 Federal Plaza in Lower Manhattan as his friend and witness, able to alert his family when his American dream devolved into a nightmare. I carried a leather briefcase and wore a couture military-style suit, balancing a professional look with a low-key sexiness for this man who I wanted to still lust after me no matter what happened next.I.N.S. was in an ugly slab of a building within a huge concrete courtyard. It\u2019s still there in all of its ugliness, but now it\u2019s called the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service and its plaza is filled with security officers and their apparatus. What had been a public space to prepare for or decompress from the drama within has become part of the entrance gantlet. Inside I.N.S. was a waiting room full of people, languages and unease. We checked in at a window, pushing papers through a small slot to an agent. There were many agents behind this glass, giving or receiving documents and telling people to sit and wait in the bolted-down plastic chairs. Eventually an agent called for Eddie. As we approached, I stared hard at the agent, as if to say: \u201cI see you. I\u2019m watching everything.\u201dAfter Eddie went off, I sat alone. Since I was pretending to look like his lawyer, I didn\u2019t kiss him goodbye. I felt sad I would never kiss him again. Now I would just be a link to his family, someone to deliver the bad news.\u201cSorry, they took him,\u201d I would say. \u201cHe wanted me to let you know.\u201d Maybe I would meet his sons. As I waited, my mind kept churning out \u201cWhat if?\u201d scenarios, all kinds of terrible possibilities, until I ambushed myself with one that felt impossibly sweet: \u201cWhat if he asked me to go with him, to Colombia or someplace else? What would I do?\u201dA small yet decisive voice inside me said yes. If he asked, I would go anywhere if it meant we could be together.This was love, I realized. Love forged by the urgency of his situation, perhaps, but love nonetheless. It felt so awful and absurd for me to discover it under these circumstances, though, because it would never happen.Then Eddie returned, overwhelming my circuitry by sidling up to me. I felt his body skim mine, and we looked at each other. His face was expressionless. We walked in silence until we were outside. \u201cThey just gave me this,\u201d he finally said, revealing his new employment authorization card, cupped inside his palm as if he had just performed a magic trick.It wasn\u2019t a magic trick but a bureaucratic mess.We wouldn\u2019t know the truth for two years, after we married, when, during our own green-card interview, we were told that Eddie\u2019s file had been lost back then. So when he had requested his work reauthorization on that warm September day, they didn\u2019t know about his divorce and its implications for his immigration status. They had simply stamped his papers and then sent him on his way.Now they were sending us on our way with Eddie\u2019s status in limbo until they found his file. Ten months later, in December 2001, I finally received Eddie\u2019s green card in the mail while holding our month-old son in my arms. Eddie wasn\u2019t there to receive it. He had died on Sept. 11, his second day at work as a senior broker at Cantor Fitzgerald. That was nearly 17 years ago. Our son is now a young man. My separation from Eddie is permanent and unbreachable.Meanwhile, I bear witness to the daily ruptures, the breaking of loving bonds between husbands and wives, parents and children, sisters and brothers. I see their pictures and watch their final embraces (if they are even allowed to have them). All of this love denied by a system and political view that turns what should be so easy and possible into something so cruel and impossible.Advertisement"}

And it\u2019s costly. \u201cYou either have to have an in-house recruitment firm, which is expensive,\u201d he said, \u201cor pay a recruiting firm 20 to 30 percent of the first year\u2019s salary.\u201dThe students showed off web apps for saving money, booking art studio time and allowing people alarmed by the news they\u2019re reading to make quick donations to relevant charities, among other things.Tasilym Twinamaani and her four teammates presented an app called Chatterbox.\u201cHow many of you watch \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019?\u201d she asked the audience. \u201cIf you\u2019re like me, you probably had a lot to say about the recent season. And all those fans with passionate expressions of disbelief might want to share that with other people. So we offer free, specific space for fans of television to engage with other fans in real time.\u201dMs. Twinamaani, 29, attended Kean University in New Jersey, majoring in film and literature, but left one semester short of graduation when her money ran out. When her younger sister had a stroke in 2016, she quit her restaurant and post office jobs to take care of her sister\u2019s son \u2014 in addition to her own son, who is now 5. When her sister recovered, Ms. Twinamaani went back to work, first at a drugstore and then on the night shift packing boxes at Blue Apron\u2019s fulfillment center in Linden, N.J.\u201cWhen I was a kid I was always messing around with HTML and CSS for my Myspace page,\u201d she said. \u201cMaking websites has been in the back of my mind.\u201d She decided to look for a coding boot camp \u2014 an intensive course to learn the skills of web or smartphone app development.At the same time, Mr. Papas at Blue Apron was also looking for boot camps. He said that the company employed a thousand workers, the majority black or Latino, in the Linden center. \u201cLots of them are very smart, motivated and driven, but they didn\u2019t have the opportunity to pursue careers in different fields,\u201d Mr. Papas said. Training those with talent to be software engineers could bring needed ability and diversity to the company\u2019s largely white and Asian staff of 132 software developers in Manhattan.\u201cIt was difficult to find a boot camp taking people who didn\u2019t have a college education, or coming from underserved backgrounds, and giving them tools,\u201d Mr. Papas said.Then he found Access Code, a 10-month boot camp run by an organization called C4Q (formerly Coalition for Queens), which was designed to do exactly that. It offers a day or a nights-and-weekends program.\u201cNearly 70 percent of Americans don\u2019t graduate from college,\u201d said Jukay Hsu, C4Q\u2019s founder and chief executive. \u201cWhat are the meaningful pathways to advance their careers and create the companies of the future?\u201dBy June, the five-year-old program will have 483 graduates, all previously low-income. Half are female, half lack a college degree. Sixty percent are black or Latino, and 40 percent are immigrants.Instead of demanding traditional credentials, the program evaluates applicants as they solve logic puzzles and spend two days learning basic coding. One in 10 is accepted. C4Q says that upon entering, those students are earning an average of $18,000 a year, but when they graduate and find work in software engineering \u2014which almost all do \u2014 they make an average of $85,000.To finance this program, C4Q has experimented with different models. Originally, it charged students a price subsidized by philanthropy. Then it was free. But Mr. Hsu felt that the need for job training was spread among far too many people for donors to cover it all. Today, students pay nothing until they graduate and get a high-paying tech job. Then they pay C4Q 12 percent of their salary for three years.C4Q has also set up a \u201cjob-outcomes bond\u201d to finance the up-front costs. Two investors put up $750,000. They\u2019ll be repaid if enough students are paying tuition \u2014 in other words, if Access Code succeeds.The other is Ms. Twinamaani. She switched to a day job in Blue Apron\u2019s kitchens and commutes to Access Code in Queens at night and on the weekend \u2014 a three-hour, $20 round trip.Alongside tech skills, Access Code teaches students how to work in a corporate culture. They visit tech companies and meet engineers. And they grapple with the ways they might sabotage themselves.In the kitchens, Ms. Twinamaani\u2019s salary was just over $20,000. As a Blue Apron software engineer, she\u2019ll make at least $85,000 and potentially closer to six figures, Mr. Papas said. The first thing she intends to do is move her sister and their children out of their basement apartment in Elizabeth. \u201cIt\u2019s my dream to live in a place where my son can go outside and play on the lawn,\u201d she said.Boot camps are for adults who want to change jobs. But part of the struggle is getting a wider group to see a tech career as an option from the beginning. Several people I interviewed told me, \u201cYou can\u2019t be what you can\u2019t see.\u201dThe giant in that field is Girls Who Code; about 90,000 girls, from every state, have joined its afterschool clubs or taken summer courses, where they develop websites and apps to attack a problem they care about.Girls make up 20 percent of high school computer science classes, and there is likely to be only one black girl, if any. \u201cAt every stage of the pipeline it\u2019s leaky for women and people of color,\u201d said Ms. Saujani of Girls Who Code.Her organization is big enough and successful enough that it is changing the numbers. \u201cWe\u2019re on track to reach gender parity by 2027,\u201d said Ms. Saujani. \u201cWe\u2019re filling the pipeline with talent. Now my major problem is: Are you going to hire them?\u201dThe \u201cbro\u201d culture in many companies perpetuates itself. Ms. Saujani said the head of engineering at a major financial services firm told her he often starts his interviews with a question about baseball. \u201cHow many women are getting their Ph.D at M.I.T. or Stanford and can\u2019t get through the door at top-tier technology companies?\u201d Ms. Saujani said.Mentors can help. Paola Mata, an Access Code graduate who works at BuzzFeed, helped found a New York City group for Latinas in tech, with a few hundred members. They held hack nights and workshops on new skills, job searches and r\u00e9sum\u00e9-writing.More diversity among developers should mean more diversity in products. Affluent bros create apps for affluent bros: Bring me beer and burritos! Clean my apartment! Walk my dog!\u201cIt\u2019s only natural that we create things that reflect on some part of us,\u201d said Ms. Buchanan. Her app at Access Code mapped reports of sexual harassment. \u201cWe want more people working on these problems,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd for me, those problems don\u2019t include having pizza delivered to my house.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Once tied to our identities, data about us can be part of our permanent record in the hands of whoever has it \u2014 and whomever they share it with, voluntarily or otherwise. The Cambridge Analytica data set from Facebook is itself but a lake within an ocean, a clarifying example of a pervasive but invisible ecosystem where thousands of firms possess billions of data points across hundreds of millions of people \u2014 and are able to do lots with it under the public radar.There are several technical and legal advances that could make a difference.On the policy front, we should look to how the law treats professionals with specialized skills who get to know clients\u2019 troubles and secrets intimately. For example, doctors and lawyers draw lots of sensitive information from, and wield a lot of power over, their patients and clients. There\u2019s not only an ethical trust relationship there but also a legal one: that of a \u201cfiduciary,\u201d which at its core means that the professionals are obliged to place their clients\u2019 interests ahead of their own.As well-trained artificial intelligence devices get better at making unsettling inferences about us based on a handful of \u201clikes\u201d or places we\u2019ve visited, we must recognize that the power to predict and shape our behavior lies less in whether we share our own data and more in whether others do. A fiduciary approach would demand that companies not betray our interests by using others\u2019 data against us.The freedom to store and exchange data without boundary or prohibitive cost should be a boon to the world and to ourselves, rather than something that dehumanizes us. But understanding the phenomenon is growing harder, because the scrutable openness of the early years of internet development has given way to the walled gardens of Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. We need to avoid the worst of all worlds for privacy, in which a few companies collect and traffic in our data, with a fig leaf of consent, while researchers and journalists who are trying to grasp the dimensions of their actions are locked out.Advertisement"}

It sold for 125,000 Australian dollars ($96,000).Also on offer from the film, for which he won a Best Actor Oscar: a codpiece; a fully functioning copy of a Roman chariot (65,000 Australian dollars); a wooden sword; a pair of leather wrist cuffs; and life-size prop horses.The actor tweeted that he was putting 29 watches on the block, including a yellow-gold Rolex at a high-end estimate of 50,000 Australian dollars.\u201cEven though it was fake,\u201d he added, \u201cit gave me a lot of confidence.\u201dAlso displayed was his costume from the 2003 period drama \u201cMaster and Commander\u201d (sold for 115,000 Australian dollars). Mr. Crowe portrays Capt. Jack Aubrey, who commands the British Royal Navy frigate Surprise as it hunts down a formidable French vessel off the South American coast during the Napoleonic Wars.The 128-year-old violin the actor played in the movie was among the most expensive sales of the night. However, a painting from Mr. Crowe\u2019s collection by the Australian artist Brett Whiteley, \u201cMoreton Bay Fig and Palms,\u201d beat the auction estimate, fetching 190,000 Australian dollars.Some critics say Mr. Crowe turned in some of his finest work in \u201cGladiator\u201d and 1997\u2019s \u201cL.A. Confidential,\u201d in which he played Bud, a block-headed but principled cop caught up in a torrid love triangle with a call girl played by Kim Basinger and a fellow police officer played by Guy Pearce.Posters from his movies were expected to fetch 500 to 2,500 Australian dollars.The actor \u2014 who has also performed as a rock singer and guitarist, with bands called 30 Odd Foot of Grunts and the Ordinary Fear of God \u2014 also sold a trove of guitars from the 1950s onward, along with a New York-made Martin acoustic model dating to 1870 and estimated to fetch up to 100,000 Australian dollars.There was another musical memento, too: the 1986 Grammy Award won by Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison, Sam Phillips, Rick Nelson and Chips Moman for interviews from the \u201cClass of \u201955 Recording Session.\u201d Estimated value: 200,000 to 300,000 Australian dollars.Other items included the maroon Doc Martens boots Mr. Crowe wore as the skinhead in the 1992 movie \u201cRomper Stomper\u201d (sold for 10,000 Australian dollars); a purple double-breasted suit he wore in the 1995 film \u201cVirtuosity\u201d; the used leather jock strap he wore to play the heavyweight champion James Braddock in 2005\u2019s \u201cCinderella Man\u201d (went for 7,000 Australian dollars after intense bidding, The A.P. says); a collection of cricket memorabilia, including a New Zealand Test cricket \u201c200 Club\u201d bat; plus diamond rings, necklaces and earrings.\u2022 A collection of 20th-century Australian art, including paintings by Charles Blackman and Sidney Nolan.\u2022 Motorbikes, including one valued at 2.3 million Australian dollars.\u2022 A 2001 Mercedes-Benz S500.

{"Headline": "Mother\u2019s Boyfriend Is Charged With Beating 3-Year-Old Girl to Death", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAn ex-convict was arrested on Tuesday and charged with killing the 3-year-old daughter of his girlfriend in their Far Rockaway apartment, the authorities said.Medics and police officers found the girl, Bella Edwards, unconscious on Monday evening with the man, Mark Jenkins, trying to resuscitate her. Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney, said the girl was the victim of child abuse, beaten to death by Mr. Jenkins while in his sole care.Mr. Jenkins, 32, was charged with second-degree murder with depraved indifference and assault, and more charges could be added as the investigation continues. He was scheduled to be arraigned Wednesday in criminal court in Queens.\u201cThis is a terribly disturbing case,\u201d Mr. Brown said in a statement announcing the charges. \u201cThe victim here is an innocent little girl, whose body revealed traumatic abuse injuries.\u201dAn autopsy revealed that Bella died from blunt force trauma to her abdomen, and the medical examiner ruled her death a homicide. Two law enforcement officials, who had knowledge of the case but were not authorized to speak about it, said the girl had injuries on her lower body that were consistent with physical and sexual abuse.Mr. Jenkins spent five years in state prison after being convicted of attempted murder in the Bronx. He faces a sentence of up 25 years to life in prison if he is convicted again. He could not be reached for comment on Tuesday because he was in custody, and it was not known if he had a lawyer.In a Facebook post, Shamika T. Gonzalez, the girl\u2019s mother, wrote: \u201cBella, I\u2019m so sorry I wasn\u2019t there to protect you. This feels like a bad dream I can\u2019t wake up from.\u201dMr. Jenkins was not Bella\u2019s father, though he did have a 3-month-old son with Ms. Gonzalez. He had been in charge of caring for the children for about eight hours on Monday, while Ms. Gonzalez, 25, and Lailah Boyd, 50, her mother, had gone to work. When they returned at 5 p.m., Mr. Jenkins told Ms. Gonzalez that the girl was taking a nap, the police said.When Ms. Gonzalez went to check on Bella at 5:50 p.m., she found the girl unconscious, the police said. Mr. Jenkins called 911 just after 6 p.m. to summon help at their apartment on Beach 105th Street. An ambulance crew rushed the girl to St. John\u2019s Episcopal Hospital, where she was pronounced dead.Mr. Jenkins, Ms. Gonzalez and Ms. Boyd were taken to the 100th Precinct for questioning on Monday night.While the family had no prior contact with Administration for Children\u2019s Services, the city\u2019s child welfare agency, the authorities began to suspect Bella had not died of natural causes after discovering bruises on her ankle, thigh and abdomen area, the law enforcement officials said. Her injuries were at different stages of healing, one of the officials said, indicating some were fresh and others were older.Child welfare workers removed the baby from the home on Monday.Mr. Jenkins had been arrested in 2004 after he fired around 12 shots and hit a 20-year-old man in the back in the Bronx, officials said. Investigators believed he had been called to the scene of a domestic dispute and, on arriving, took out a gun and fired.He was sentenced to 8 years in prison, but was paroled a year early in September 2011. His supervised released ended in 2016.Three other arrests are sealed.The police in the past also responded to two domestic incidents involving Mr. Jenkins and Ms. Gonzalez, though details about the encounters were not immediately available. Neighbors at the building on Tuesday said they had not seen any sign of trouble.A 64-year-old man who lives in the same building said he saw the mother and daughter together a week ago, and the child appeared happy and smiling. \u201cThe mother had her baby in her arms, everything seemed fine,\u201d said the man, who identified himself as W. Thomas. \u201cI didn\u2019t see anything wrong. If it was, I probably would\u2019ve said something.\u201dAnother neighbor, Laura Cabrera, 36, a special-education teacher, also said she saw nothing amiss when she ran into Mr. Jenkins and Bella in an elevator in their building on Sunday. \u201cThey had a nice rapport with one another,\u201d Ms. Cabrera said.On Tuesday morning, Ms. Gonzalez said on Facebook that a candlelight vigil and release of balloons would be held on Wednesday evening in front of the building where the family lived in Far Rockaway. \u201cBring pink or red balloons and candles!\u201d she wrote.Benjamin Mueller and Nate Schweber contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
