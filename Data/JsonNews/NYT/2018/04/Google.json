{"Headline": "Facebook Faces Tough Questions in Britain That It Avoided in the U.S.", "Date": "2018-04-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe dueling experiences highlight the different approaches taken on both sides of the Atlantic toward oversight of personal data and the social media giants who hold it. While the United States has largely eschewed regulating companies like Facebook, Britain and other countries in Europe have taken more aggressive stances, seeking to make tighter rules to better protect consumer privacy.In London, Facebook\u2019s chief technology officer, Mike Schroepfer, faced more than four hours of questions from a British parliamentary committee over the company\u2019s data-collection techniques, oversight of app developers, fake accounts, political advertising and links to the voter-targeting firm Cambridge Analytica.If American politicians have been lampooned for being Luddites, the British Parliament\u2019s Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee has built a reputation for thoroughness and detailed questioning. Damian Collins, the committee\u2019s chairman, had more than 11 pages of questions for Mr. Schroepfer, including how facial recognition technology is used and the methods Facebook uses to track people even when they are not on the site.\u201cThis is the pipe through which the fake news comes, and there doesn\u2019t seem to be much you can do to control it,\u201d Mr. Collins said.\u201cThe Europeans are far more alert about this problem and far more willing to tackle it than the U.S.,\u201d Stephan Lewandowsky, a cognitive scientist at the University of Bristol who studies how people process misinformation, said in an interview.The parliamentary committee is attempting to punch above its weight. Working out of small hearing room near Big Ben and Westminster Abbey, the panel is composed of 11 members who are mostly rank-and-file members of parliament. It has a staff of about 10 clerks, and little authority beyond being able to summon witnesses \u2014 it can\u2019t write new laws or enforce penalties if it discovers wrongdoing.So far, there has been little of the rancor and political speechifying that takes over high-profile American hearings. The stereotype of British manners was mostly maintained, even during the tensest moments \u2014 lots of \u201cplease,\u201d \u201cthank you,\u201d and sarcasm.\u201cI\u2019m delighted to hear you have a head of integrity,\u201d one member noted dryly when Mr. Schroepfer referred to a colleague in charge of ethics. In criticizing the number of fake accounts on Facebook, another lawmaker wondered why he, an overweight middle-aged man, was getting Facebook invitations from attractive young women.\u201cIt is obvious that this is a serious inquiry and that the committee is doing its homework and asking very detailed questions trying to get to the heart of some complicated problems,\u201d said Justin Hendrix, executive director of NYC Media Lab, a New York-based research group that met with members of the panel this year.The panel has been led by Mr. Collins, a member of the governing Conservative party. The inquiry started as a broad investigation into fake news and how misinformation spreads, and whether those capabilities influenced the 2016 referendum when Britain voted to leave the European Union.As the panel heard from more witnesses, it became more focused on how easily user data from Facebook could be accessed and used for political gain.In a separate interview this week, Mr. Collins talked about his education on the social platform. \u201cI\u2019ve been genuinely surprised by how much data Facebook gathers,\u201d he said, pulling out books he had been reading, including \u201cThe People Vs. Tech,\u201d a critical examination of how social media is influencing society, and \u201cChaos Monkeys,\u201d a memoir by a former Facebook executive.Between television interviews this week, Mr. Collins sat with staff watching a small set as a Canadian parliamentary committee questioned an executive from an online advertising company, Aggregate IQ, that had been involved in the Brexit referendum. When Mr. Collins heard a discrepancy in the testimony, he messaged a member of the Canadian panel. \u201cHe read out my text during the hearing,\u201d Mr. Collins laughed.Aware that he doesn\u2019t have the same financial resources as Facebook and other global tech firms, or even as much as his counterparts across the Atlantic, Mr. Collins has been coordinating his investigation with others around the world. He has been in touch with regulators in France, Germany and Ireland, and even as far afield as Singapore.Mr. Collins plans to publish a report with policy recommendations by this summer.\u201cMany people would look at what\u2019s happened over the past couple of months and say the case for greater regulatory scrutiny of the way the tech companies work would be appropriate,\u201d Mr. Collins said in the interview. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can put that genie back in the bottle now.\u201dOn Thursday, he exited the hearing frustrated, saying Mr. Schroepfer hadn\u2019t fully answered at least 40 questions. He plans to use a \u201cformal summons\u201d to require Mr. Zuckerberg to attend, a rarely deployed legal step.He could be in the area soon. The European Parliament has invited Mr. Zuckerberg to testify as early as next month, though a parliament spokesman said it hasn\u2019t been finalized.An earlier version of this article misstated who was hit by a pie to the face at a hearing before the British Parliament\u2019s Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee. It was Rupert Murdoch, not his son James.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Key Dates to Watch in China-U.S. Trade Dispute: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Tuesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 The will-he-or-won\u2019t-he Trump trade policy\u2022 Will Google become the next target of privacy inquiries?The world needs a way to tell whether President Trump wants to pursue his combative trade policies.The Trump administration has in recent weeks announced a barrage of trade actions. First, Mr. Trump said he was imposing tariffs against steel and aluminum imports from a range of countries. Then came announcements of actions against China that included tariffs on a large number of products.Very few restrictions have come into effect, though. President Trump has allowed temporary exemptions to the steel and aluminum tariffs. The moves against China have to go through a public comment process before they can take place.Investors, executives and farmers who have concerns about the economic impact of the trade actions may like that little has so far happened. And they may hope that Mr. Trump uses the leeway he has under trade law to step back from his threats. But supporters of tougher trade policies will be watching closely to see if Mr. Trump actually carries them out.In the coming months, there are a number of important dates at which the Trump administration has to decide whether it wants to retreat, delay, negotiate, fight on or escalate. To help assess the stance of the United State in this trade standoff, DealBook has compiled these dates.Before looking ahead, it\u2019s important to note that the Trump administration has imposed new restrictions on some countries.Much remains up in the air, though.\u2014 Peter EavisOne of Wall Street\u2019s biggest (and nerdiest) contests is between Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. With each quarter\u2019s earnings, the banks disclose their return on equity, a number that shows the profitability of the equity capital they have deployed in their businesses.Goldman usually wins. From 2010 until 2017, Morgan Stanley\u2019s annual return on equity was stronger in only two of those eight years, and those two years were not good ones for Wall Street overall.A big test was going to be how these banks fared in unambiguously good conditions, like those that existed in the first quarter of this year, when trading activity was strong and the economic outlook bullish. Goldman\u2019s return on equity in the first quarter was 15.4 percent, compared to 14.9 percent for Morgan Stanley.In other words, Goldman clinched the bragging rights. But with some rounding, they both achieved a 15 percent return.\u2014 Peter EavisThe Wall Street firm reported record revenue and profit for the first quarter driven by a jump in trading and the new tax law.\u2022 Morgan Stanley reported profits of $2.58 billion, up 40 percent from a year ago. That also topped analysts\u2019 expectations of $2.2 billion in earnings, according to Thomson Reuters.\u2022 Earnings per share came in at $1.45, beating the $1.25 analysts had expected.\u2022 Revenues increased 13.7 percent to $11.08 billion. Analysts expected revenue of $10.36 billion.\u2022 Total trading revenue rose 26 percent to $4.40 billion.\u2022 Equity trading revenue increased to $2.6 billion, up 30 percent from a year ago\u2022 Fixed-income trading revenue rose 9 percent to $1.8 billion.\u2022 Fees from investment banking rose 7 percent to $1.51 billion.\u2022 Fees from advising on mergers and acquisitions gained 16 percent to $574 million.\u2022 Underwriting revenues rose 2 percent.\u2022 Wealth management revenues increased 8 percent to $2.37 billion.The I.M.F. numbers are just the latest highlighting the negative impact the $1.5 trillion in tax cuts could have on the fiscal outlook of the United States.Fact-check: Despite Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet, South Korea isn\u2019t in the TPP.Facebook has born the brunt of fury over the tech industry\u2019s practices, particularly after the Cambridge Analytica scandal shed light on how user data is shared. But another behemoth\u2019s practices could come under scrutiny, particularly if Democrats take back Congress in the midterm elections.Two years ago, Google altered its offerings in a way that makes it more vulnerable to data-sharing scrutiny. Advertisers using its DoubleClick system to target and measure ads could start anonymously combining web-tracking data (from \u201ccookies\u201d that follow users online) with potent Google information including search queries, location history, phone numbers and credit card information. Until then, Google had steadfastly kept that data separate.Justice Sonia Sotomayor said that Congress, rather than the Supreme Court, should settle the matter. But Chief Justice John Roberts said \u201cit would be very strange for us to tell Congress it ought to do something in any particular area.\u201dThe stakes: The case in question, South Dakota v. Wayfair, could upend a decades-old status quo in online retail \u2014 and bring states some much-needed revenue.More from Nathaniel Popper and Nicholas Confessore of the NYT:The goal of Cambridge Analytica\u2019s own coin offering? Raise money that would pay for the creation of a system to help people store and sell their online personal data to advertisers, Brittany Kaiser, a former Cambridge Analytica employee, said in an interview. The idea was to protect information from more or less what the firm did when it obtained the personal data of up to 87 million Facebook users.The tech flyaroundStock and bond markets are unpredictable, even in good times, so the helpful trading conditions this quarter may not last. What can Goldman\u2019s senior executives offer to persuade investors that the bank far more than a trading house? More explanations, perhaps \u2014 and time.\u201cI\u2019m proud of what we achieved at Yahoo. That said, we had a quickly decaying legacy business. All we really managed to do was offset the declines.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spring Fashion, Facebook, Animal Welfare and the Power of Books to Teach: Our Favorite Student Comments of the Week", "Date": "2018-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCurrent Events ConversationEnjoy!Please note: All student comments have been lightly edited for length, but otherwise appear exactly as they were originally submitted._________Will befriending outcasts stop all school shootings? No. But it certainly isn\u2019t hurting anything. Both actions are positive goods; one has a more personal, immediate impact and the other has a potential to change national policy. Whether you choose to walk out or up doesn\u2019t make you a better or worse person, and who knows? If everyone felt included, maybe school violence will decrease. It is certainly worth trying, especially when large-scale activism, although widely visible, doesn\u2019t seem to be directly resulting in any hard legislation. (Note: You can \u201cwalk up\u201d any day, preferably every day. It isn\u2019t necessarily revolutionary, it\u2019s just a decent thing to do. Why not walk out on the 14th, and walk up on the 15th, 16th\u2026).A student cannot \u201cstop\u201d a school shooter. Psychopaths do not feel empathy for other people, they are callous, cruel, and do not care what others think. They can never be cured of their disorder but can manage it through professional help, which is part of the reason I agree with Ms. Robinson\u2019s views on the situation. Students are not professional counselors and therapists and should not be tasked with the responsibility of being them to unstable kids. Furthermore, Mr. Petty\u2019s #WalkUpNotOut tweet sounds like more of a stand against bullies/a stand for eliminating exclusion than it does against school shooters; kids who fully intend to seriously injure or kill their fellow students. Dealing with a psychopath is different than dealing with a normal bully, for one is solved through anti-bullying campaigns and counseling, while the other requires psychotherapy and (in some extremely serious cases) institutionalization to be contained. The schools we attend have so far failed to identify and give proper treatment to individuals who display psychopathic tendencies and are mentally disturbed.If the government really wants to stop school shootings, they need to provide funding to the necessary departments and programs to carry out these actions AND make it harder for a mentally unstable teenager to get their hands on a gun in America. Until then, I would rather speak up and let my voice be heard, than shut up and quietly hope not to be gunned down in a high school hallway.Treat others the way you want to be treated. That\u2019s the Golden Rule, right? The #WalkUpNotOut movement suggests that being kinder to your classmates can prevent them from becoming violent shooters in the future. I don\u2019t completely believe in the effectiveness of this movement. Of course, we should all be kind and accepting of each other. We shouldn\u2019t leave individuals out and we should never be rude or hostile. But I am taking Ms. Robinson\u2019s side: victims of school shooters should not be blamed for that person\u2019s actions. How can you justify the deaths of thousands of children by accusing staff and students of being \u201cmean\u201d to the shooter in his/her youth?Ryan Petty tweeted that walk outs are nothing more than exercise. These same walk outs are catching the eyes of the media, public officials, global citizens. They consist of students making their voices heard, talking to their national leaders. To me, that is more than just getting \u201cexercise\u201d. So yes, you should \u201cwalk up\u201d to the student eating alone in the cafeteria, but you shouldn\u2019t be held accountable for a mass tragedy just because you didn\u2019t.I struggle to understand how the father of one of the victims of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School would create the hashtag #WalkUpNotOut that, despite with good intentions, essentially blames students, like his daughter, for the massacre that occurred in February.The hashtag dismisses the cry of thousands of terrified students calling for action from their leaders to restrict the access to weapons in this country. I don\u2019t promote bullying or exclusion, but they shouldn\u2019t be used as the form of justification for the motivation for tragedies like this. The advocacy of kindness should be continuous, and not highlighted when fourteen students have lost their lives to an armed fellow student. Students should be kind because they are simply kind people, being taught and mentored by adults who exemplify kindness often.As a student, I never want to express kindness because I\u2019m trying to prevent being shot one day in class. This is why we are choosing to walk out. We cannot be sure that walking up will cure the serious issues that lie within the hearts and minds of certain students. We can be sure that walking out will make it harder for those students to obtain deadly weapons will prevent the creation of hashtags in the first place. While inclusion and kindness are positive things, the most effective action, the action that students want to witness the most, is the urgency and concern of our lawmakers to keep weapons out of dangerous hands.I think the #WalkUpNotOut movement started with good intentions, but the idea that this could have been prevented by students at the school being nicer to the shooter, is victim blaming, and utterly disproved by Isabelle Robinson\u2019s story. She takes issue with it for the same reason I do. \u201cThe idea that we are to blame for the murders of our friends and teachers is a slap in the face to all Stoneman Douglas victims and survivors,\u201d she says, and I agree. Saying that this horrible, traumatizing event is because of the victims\u2019 failure to \u2018be nicer\u2019 is just another way for people to ignore the fact that there is something deeply wrong with our country right now.\u2026 Should we be nicer to people and stand up for others? Yes! But can kind words stop a bullet? No, they can\u2019t. The issue of school shootings is so complex it probably won\u2019t have one solution. We need to support the victims in this troubling time, not tell them the trauma is their fault.#walkupnotout seems to me a means of shaming and silencing protesters trying to see change in policy. Those behind it say that if we were just a little nicer to others, maybe they wouldn\u2019t kill us. This tag puts the blame on victims of gun violence and shames them.Do we tell victims of domestic violence they should have been nicer to their partner? Or victims of child abuse that they should have been more respectful towards their parents? From Isabelle Robinson\u2019s account, we know Nikolas Cruz was a violent, cruel, and unkind person, who despite his disposition, had friends, and despite having friends, attacked those at his school, before and during the shooting. There are billions of people on Earth who have experienced isolation, trauma, depression, anger, rejection, and any other negative experience imaginable. Only very few of us become as violent as the perpetrator of the Stoneman Douglas shooting. If we want to prevent these violent people from harming others, we should invest more into school counselors and students\u2019 mental health. These situations should never be placed on the backs of victims.Ryan Petty is right. A march will without a doubt show support and spread awareness of a vital issue- but will it really help? I don\u2019t think so. That said, I think that a \u201cwalkup\u201d won\u2019t help much either.As Isabelle Robins says, \u201cthe idea that we are to blame, even implicitly, for the murders of our friends and teachers is a slap in the face to all Stoneman Douglas victims and survivors.\u201d If someone could have managed to befriend Nikolas Cruz, it wouldn\u2019t have done a thing. The fault lies within the legal system, and with our schools. No 19 year old, especially one who has received treatment for an existing mental illness, should ever be able to legally purchase a semi-automatic rifle \u2014 I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s used for hunting, because it shouldn\u2019t be. That\u2019s where our legal system failed Stoneman Douglas.\u2026 The #WalkUpNotOut movement is just another useless cause taking away from the real issue at hand. Something needs to be done, and it\u2019s much greater than a march or a change in attitude towards your peers.I do not agree with the #WalkUpNotOut Movement, because I don\u2019t think students should be blamed in any capacity for such horrific displays of violence. Students cannot change the mental health of their peers. Not even a therapist can 100% fix a student\u2019s mental health. The only way to truly prevent mass shootings is to take away guns. Nicholas Cruz showed signs of uncontrollable anger and other mental illnesses from a young age. When he threw the apple at Isabelle Robinson, he did not do it because he hurt by her or her friends, she did nothing to provoke him. He enjoyed watching her cry. She said, \u201cHis eyes were lit up with a sick, twisted joy.\u201d Despite this, she still helped him do his homework and organize his binder, while he terrorized her by cursing at her and staring at her breasts. Isabelle showed him kindness and compassion despite his violence and crude nature towards her. Nicolas Cruz was not a victim. He victimized his classmates long before he brought an AR-15 to school. Students should not be expected to prevent shootings, our law enforcement should._________I have stated on multiple occasions that I prefer dogs to humans. A person could die in a movie, and I\u2019ll be fine, but as soon as the dog gets hurt \u2014 instant tears. I believe most people feel more sympathetic towards animals because we see them as helpless and without a voice. Who\u2019s going to stand up for them if we don\u2019t? And this isn\u2019t a pick-and-choose matter, we need to advocate for human suffering just as much as the mistreatment of animals.I see my pets as much of a part of my family as I am, so shouldn\u2019t the wildlife be just as much a part of our global community as humans are? In the article Dieudonn\u00e9 Kemb\u00e9 said that what\u2019s good for the animals is good for the people. They add just as much to culture and society as humans do. They provide food, labor, and love. The point of charity and volunteer work is to help those less fortunate, no matter the species, so it doesn\u2019t matter if you write your check out to the animal conservatory or the children\u2019s orphanage, just make sure you pick one of them.Animals are great. Having a pet is like having a best friend that always has your back. I love all three of my pets, but if it came to it, I would always choose to save a human from danger over my pet. A human\u2019s life is much more valuable than an animal\u2019s life.\u2026 The author asked an interesting question, \u201cIs it wrongheaded to fight for elephants and rhinos (or farm animals at home) while five million children still die each year before the age of 5?\u201d yes, but only for the most part. If animals are something you care deeply about you can help them alongside helping the humans in the area. The world would be so much better if everyone who cared so deeply about saving the rhinos put half of their effort into building a new school, establishing a new source of water, or even buying the $5 mosquito net the author wrote about. I agree with the author\u2019s point of view, but I would always prioritize human needs over the needs of animals, endangered or not. With humans suffering around the world it\u2019s our duty to help them before we turn to the elephants and rhinos.Focusing more on animal welfare more than focusing on sick humans is something that is absolutely okay. If you think about it most animals are suffering & dying because of us and the changes we\u2019ve made to this world. Maybe that\u2019s also why were more empathetic towards the suffering of animals. We have some blame in their suffering. Also, animals do nothing to purposely hurt us and have malice in them.When comparing humans and other animals, one thing becomes apparent: humans are especially vile. Never has an animal so deliberately devastated an environment for personal gain nor exterminated entire populations (even some of its own) based on superstition such as racism or sexuality. This is important in finding why humans care more for animals than their own kind as humans have other interests, mainly profit, that will trample over others of their own species. Humanity\u2019s role as the \u201cdominant life form\u201d also gives it a \u201ccalling\u201d to defend \u201clesser beings\u201d, we can see this in politics; the U.S. defends weaker nations like Israel and South Korea (some would even say it does this while neglecting its own people) despite the very few unique benefits they would bring. Animal welfare opens the door for human welfare; it\u2019s not uncommon for breakthroughs in animal treatment to make its way into the treatment of people (the Animal Welfare act of 1966 gave ethical guidelines for the testing of subjects and in the \u201870s push for ethical treatment of human subjects became common).I am more dedicated to helping humans than animals, but do feel a large amount of sympathy for animals. I feel guilty about animals, because they were doing just fine before humans came and interfered. The reason animals need protection and help is because of humans.Despite this, I would still help humans because there are innocent people all around the world who are suffering, and children who are starving. People are more empathetic towards animals because they are cute, furry, and entirely innocent. It isn\u2019t their actions that put the animals in danger, but ours. I don\u2019t believe it is wrong to help animals, many animals would be extinct by now if it weren\u2019t for human intervention, and many ecosystems would be off-balance, which would affect human-life as well. It is wrong, however, to focus primarily on animals. There are people all around the world who are starving, and in constant danger, but many people prefer to look at the cute puppies. That is wrong, and I agree with Mr. Kristoff.For me, I am definitely more dedicated to helping humans, but I try to help animals in every way I can. I believe that if you help our fellow humans, there will be more people that can go out to help even more people and animals. People tend to be more empathetic toward animals because we see them as being \u201chelpless\u201d and \u201cinnocent,\u201d while when we see people suffer, we tend to have that the attitude that \u201cthey did something to deserve it\u201d or \u201cthey will get over it.\u201d I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s wrong to focus on animal welfare. Animals have lives just like humans, and they have real emotions and pain. Not looking out for animals is just humanely wrong. People in general should devote their time to try to help both parties without harming the other.I don\u2019t understand how anyone can think there is a one or the other in this debate. Why must one species be denied of their rights for the other to have it?In the article, it states that there were more signature on a petition for the shooting of Cecil the lion than the shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice. It\u2019s not that people care more about animals lives than they do humans. Many people view animals as small, and without a voice, so who else to speak up for them but us? The problem with this is that we tend to forget our fellow humans. The people we interact with and see everyday.Although we shouldn\u2019t forget about animals, we need to also keep humans in our mind. Just because each person has their own voice, does not mean they don\u2019t need others to speak up for them. Just because animals don\u2019t have the same size brain or opposable thumbs, does not mean their lives are any less precious than ours. There should be absolutely no debate for one or the other._________I have always had a sensitive scene of smell but I realized it after my grandpa died. I went to his house two weeks later and smelled his shirt and it reminded me of days when we used to go out to eat and he used to help play ball in his back yard. Every time I smell sawdust I think of my dad because he is a carpenter and every time he came home from work I smelled sawdust. Another smell that reminds of something is the black ice air freshener that is used for cars. I smelled the fragrance the first time when I got in the work truck when I started my first job it was filled with the unique smell black ice fragrance. One of the last smells that get to me the most is the smell of a smoldering smoky fire. The smell of the smoke is a constant reminder of all the late nights out side in my back yard with my friends and my family laughing and having a good time. That\u2019s all the smell that get to me emotionally and in a way sentimental that makes me go back down memory lane.Fresh, soft, clean, and salty air. The smell of clean bedsheets and pool chlorine. These scents seem to be profound in my memory. During my childhood I had spent lots of time vacationing at Disney with my family. We went on cruises, Disney World, and hotels around Florida. I remember seeing my favorite Disney characters around every corner, and the imagination from watching all Disney movies. The smell of the ocean reminds me of walking the ship and feeling the waves crash and make it rock. The smell of clean sheets remind me of adventuring through each and every hotel room and playing hide and seek, even though we had been there a million times before. The scent from a memory can be very powerful, it can bring back flushes of memories.I will forever remember the smell at my grandma\u2019s house on Thanksgiving and Christmas day of all the food that she and my aunties cook for the family to enjoy. Also my grandma is in love with growing flowers and have an entire family of flowers around her house and the different smells that flowers let out into the air is something that I will always remember sense every time I go to her house I smell her beautiful flowers. I also remember the smell of coffee because before my granddad passed away coffee was his favorite drink in the morning and anytime I smell coffee I instantly remember the times my granddad would drink it early in the morning. That\u2019s all the smells that bring backs good memories and have me excited for upcoming holidays.The smell of fresh cut grass I loved the smell of our yard after my Dad cut the grass. People cut grass all the time, I know we do here, but it doesn\u2019t smell like it did when my Dad cut our grass. Still when I smell freshly cut grass I can see my father out back mowing our yard. Freshly washed clothing that was hung outside to dry as my Mom and I folded the wash or put the clean sheets on the bed, the smell was overwhelmingly crisp and it made me feel so fresh, clean and renewed. Even if you put something out to dry these days, and most places it isn\u2019t even allowed, it doesn\u2019t quite smell the same as it did back then.Smell and memories, there are so many smells that remind me of great memories. the smell of smoke remind me good many good Friday nights beside a fire. The smell of gun powder remind me of early morning duck hunts that I have been on with my buddy\u2019s. That sweet smell of perfume reminds of my women. There are so many smells that make me excited every time I catch a scent of them. Sometimes I wish I could make a candle out of all the smells I enjoy and memorize through my life. I would burn that candle any time I have a bad day to take a trip down memory lane. Smell can determine so many things. sometimes I feel like my nose has its own little brain. Like sometimes I will smell something and aromatically know what it is. Its crazy how our brains memorize all the smells we have smelled through our life and the even crazier part is I still have many years to go hopefully and many more smells to discover. But smells can be a blessing and a curse, present smells make us happy but bad smells make us quiver and sick to are stomachs. Smells will always be important in our life. Without smell we couldn\u2019t do a lot things that we do. It plays a very important role in our life._________My reaction to the punishments was the same as Ms. Sran\u2019s in the article, being that if they don\u2019t understand the meaning of what they are doing, then just sending them to do community service won\u2019t do them, or society any good. The books give them a good look into the severity of what they did. I don\u2019t think that the judge who sentenced the teenagers to read the books meant it as a punishment, it was meant to be a learning experience. Watching one of the movies could do the same thing, but the judge saw the benefit of reading the book. When reading a book, one is immersed in the imagery that is sometimes hard to show in a movie. If I were a judge, I would do all that I could to solve the problem, not suppress it, and I think this is exactly what this judge did. Other forms of community service may teach the people a lesson, but the idea of learning why what they did was wrong would be the best thing to do to change their lives.Take away the word, \u201cpunishment\u201d in this article. I agree with Emily. \u201cLearning experience\u201d or another word or phrase emphasizing the assignment as positive is needed.This punishment that the juveniles were given, reading books to expand their knowledge and remove their ignorance, was a very creative idea. Becoming more knowledgeable about the meanings behind the symbols they used or the insults they said would make them more remorseful on their actions, not just regretful that they were caught. Reading being used as a punishment would not lead to resistance to it in the future, but would rather motivate the juveniles to read more to develop a more intuitive mind. One book is all it takes to open one\u2019s mind and help one realize how much potential they have. However the punishments these teenagers received was in itself to soft. Of course reading was an innovative way to teach them about their mistakes, they should still be punished for them. The judge should have had them serve community service in order to show others that there are real consequences to their actions. Reading a book can literally place you in someone else\u2019s story, giving you an insight on their ideas and cultures. Reading gives you a look on how others live their lives, and you can find similarities and differences in that. That is why this idea with reading works because the vandals will have the great opportunity to not only learn from their mistakes, but to grow from them and help them become a better human being.The use of books being a form of \u2018punishment\u2019 for teenagers is the best type of reform to implement on them. Personally, I am a book lover. Any genre, any size, I will read. In my opinion, I believe that the characters in books have the ability to change the way someone thinks. I know it did for me. However, instead of enforcing specific books onto the juvenile offenders, I think that they should be able to choose any book of their choice from a specific genre. Most of the time, I feel like it\u2019s a burden when an individual forces me to read a book. By allowing the offenders to have a sense of control over what they read, they will be encouraged to read more and expand their narrow perspective.Most people would agree that they seem to enjoy a book more when they just get to read it. No marking passages, no time limit. Just you and a book of your choice. I believe this really helped these teens. Yes, this group of vandals that had defaced a historical black schoolhouse with insensitive racist symbols, had to pick from a list, but they got to chose the book, and they learned from it. You learn so much better just reading other\u2019s stories and what they had to go through than sitting in a room, listening to someone list the reasons why what you did was wrong. Books can be so powerful, and obviously, these reads left a lasting impression on the group. At first they didn\u2019t understand what what they were doing even meant, but after being able to read about how others had to go through thing such as the holocaust in \u201cNight\u201d by Elie Wiesel, racism in the South in \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d by Harper Lee, and what it is like being an immigrant in \u201cThe Tortilla Curtain\u201d by T.C. Boyle.It just proves how you can learn so much just by picking up a book, even how to be a better person._________I would call this story \u201cfind your friends and don\u2019t get lost yourself.\u201d This is a very bright spot, very bright campus that symbolizes a wonderful student days. When you are a student, you live on your own, study, walk and enjoy walks with friends. Sounds great! students in the picture dressed in different clothes, which distinguishes them from other faculty. The division into faculties does not prevent students from communicating, so everyone goes for a walk and just enjoy communicating with each other. To summarize, I would say that this is the story of a simple College life, where the youth simply enjoys lifeIt\u2019s pretty busy, and bright, and loud \u2026 All of these colours and sounds. I\u2019m just making my way through the street like I do every day. Just the same as the last, the same colours as the last, the same sounds as the last. The same movements as the last. There\u2019s nothing particular here, we\u2019re all different I know, but it\u2019s all the same. If an artist portrayed us we\u2019d all be made of different brush strokes, but we\u2019re all the same, are we not? Trying to get somewhere, trying to do something, so we never really pay attention to the colors of others. Her and his and their fluorescent pinks, they don\u2019t glance at my bright yellow. Until our eyes meet. But that\u2019s a story for another day. When I\u2019m not busy and rushing on my way.I need to find out where I am going \u2026 I am a freshman in my college and I\u2019m trying to get to my history class on time. I\u2019ve got to be the only one as dressed up as I am for my first day. Surrounding me are people in all different colors with unique outfits and friends that are all doing different things. I am alone until I almost run into a cat in front of me. Realizing that it was being chased by a boy I returned the cat to the owner. He thanked me for returning his pet and asked if I knew where world history was. I smiled and laughed as I told him you\u2019re not alone and I realized how wrong I was. We ended up becoming great friends throughout college and became roommates.My heart is pounding as I embark on this journey. The wild and colorful beasts are all around me, pushing and shoving me so much that I feel like I might be trampled. I think to get out my phone and text my mother to tell her I love her, just in case this expedition is fatal. Just when it seemed like I was never going to come back from this, I realize I have successfully crossed the commons without my panic attack getting too bad. We didn\u2019t need a repeat of last year. I shudder at the thought. Time to get to class, until the next bell rings and we do it all again.I standing dead center of the great lawn, planning my route to get through the massive crowd of people. Left at the group playing frisbee, then a hard right towards the couple laying on the lawn. I had somewhat of an idea of where I was going, then all of a sudden, my feet started moving and next thing I knew, I was in the middle of the Great Lawn. My plan kinda worked, but I intended to be a little more to the left than where I was right now. I ended up running the rest of the way, through the lawn, dodging people left and right. All I had to do was make it to the other side, then I was basically in my classroom._________I have a facebook account which I never use nor do I really care about it anymore. After the data leak, I don\u2019t know how anyone could trust facebook. It\u2019s clear what lengths people, such as Zuckerberg, go to just to make more money than they already do. Zuckerberg violated the \u201cbranch of trust\u201d that he extended to all Facebook users and in turn, got caught red-handed. The company clearly doesn\u2019t have the people\u2019s interest in mind whatsoever. Violating a slogan which was used to start the company does not show sympathy or care for any users they have.This recent data leak sums up the problems that come with social media. The fact that a company like Cambridge Analytica is able obtain your private information that easily is scary to me. It makes me wonder what the real purpose of all this social media really is. Is it a way for us to be able to share things with friends and family and to keep up with the world, or is it just a platform for companies and the government to learn anything they want about you. Facebook not only displays information about where you live, your birth date, and name, but just from the pictures you like, companies can know about your personality and how to persuade you in certain situations. Without ever meeting some of companies, they may know your entire life.Some might say that if you don\u2019t want you privacy taken away, then just don\u2019t use Facebook. For some, this is very easy, but it is hard for others because of the instant gratification that Facebook and other sites bring in. Whenever someone likes or comments on your post, you feel a sense of gratification. It\u2019s almost like social media keeps sucking you in because of your desire for likes. Facebook should be more protective or their users privacy instead of handing it out to the rest of the world.the facebook data leak was dangerous to everyone who uses facebook. Our privacy is the most important thing and social media shouldn\u2019t be trusted with it. I don\u2019t trust facebook or any social media since it is so easy for people to hack accounts and reach all your information. the company doesn\u2019t have people\u2019s best interests in mind seeing as they allowed this to happen. I do not think that social media platforms should be regulated by the government because that breaks our freedom of posterity and doesn\u2019t allow us to use social media as our ways to express ourselves as who we really are. The government regulating our posts will just bring back censorship and it will allow the government to start taking away our rights. Facebook should protect users data better because even though users can chose what the post, they should still have some type of privacy to share things with their friends online and not have anyone else be able to access it.Multiple times I\u2019ve been told, and perhaps some of the whole hasn\u2019t, that anything you post on Social Media that\u2019s \u201cyour\u201d privacy, now becomes anyone\u2019s privacy. Whenever you sign up for a social media site, or for anything in the world, there is always a contract; a contract that few ever feel the need to read. For Facebook there was a very clear Terms of Service; \u201cFor content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos (IP content), you specifically give us the following permission, subject to your privacy and application settings: you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post\u2026\u201d.How people share their personal experiences and in-depth details of their life on Social Media, for the whole world to see, not paying attention to the contract, or the simple fact that anyone can see it, befuddles me. Who are you to blame but yourself? The social platform must be to blame, right?I am Facebook user about 6 years ago. In these time, I wrote my personality information but I dint know what importance is to share this information about myself. Now, I am very meticulous about what shared with my friends, what tweets I like and what information I put about me. When you answer an online test or poll you do not know for what or for who is these information, and these is very dangerous. Facebook did a very bad activity sharing our privacy because they are supposed to protect our personal information, but we are responsibilities too. We are responsibilities because we need to be smart and think that in these world so computerizing, our personal data is being exposed all the time and you do not know who is going to see it, and with what purpose. When we are in the internet, we read that the page used cookies and we accept, but we know exactly what it means? So, I think that we need know more about all of these things and act accordingly.In my opinion, this Facebook data leak was responsibility of the company because they have the whole information that people bring to them. Most of this people bring their information and do not know what this company should do with it, even though you do not want to bring too much information about you Facebook push people to give unnecessary information in my point of view. People have to be a little more reserved with things that they shared with other people because now it is a great issue, we aren\u2019t take a due responsibilities with our information and private life. We have to learn to make a good use about this kind of tools such as communicate with important people to us, if you think that you do not bring too much information to Facebook you already did with google. Why does Facebook need all those information about us? We do not know even though we accept terms and conditions; well, no one is going to take a little time to read all those small words, neither do I._________I myself am a huge fan of older fashion trends making a reappearance and mixing with modern trends to create something new and unique. The woman in the photograph is wearing clothing that appears to be very old fashioned; the brown blazer and short culottes are extremely 90s-esque, but her hairstyle and the black shoes, that appear to be similar in style to Gucci\u2019s popular classic black slides, make the look feel more modern.An older fashion trend that I would like to see revived is fit and flare jeans/pants. They are being included more and more into high end runway looks and have already trickled down to Instagram models everywhere. The idea that skinny jeans/pants are the only attractive pant is a misconception; realistically, fit and flare pants make the body look more proportional, and with more emphasis on embracing different body types, I think these pants would be suitable for everyone when styled correctly.Vintage is becoming the new sensation of our generation. We are learning to appreciate the fashion of our forefathers and mothers. I think that going vintage is a great trend to follow, while it\u2019s great to come up with your own original idea it I also great to learn from history to make something equally impressive. Personally, I love the 50s swing dresses and I wish those would come back because honestly, they are so cute. They were dresses that were easy to move in, seeing that they were made to dance in. Something that I think should stay in the past is wearing leotards on top of our clothing, it really wasn\u2019t a very flattering outfit.Spring is one of the best times for fashion. The colors of nature are finally starting to bloom, the sun is out and it is finally warm again. Many see Spring as a time for fashion designers to release new lines of clothes. Nowadays, many fashion designers like to look to clothes in the past for inspiration like neon windbreakers, denim jackets and track pants. These are all great fashion pieces that came back and are killing it in the fashion game. Now, there are other fashion trends that should stay dead like sweatbands, leg warmers, and MC Hammer pants. They just shouldn\u2019t come back.Enough with this nostalgia fashion! Today, the walls of fast fashion stores are lined primarily with the trends of the \u201880s and \u201890s making this age seem like copycat fashion. High-end fashion companies, like Balencia and Gucci, have been taking trends that blossomed on the runway decades ago but slightly modernized them to be made the \u201ctrend\u201d of this decade. Sure, a few trends could come back like bell-bottoms have over the years, but it has become overwhelming when the major fashion trends of 2018 are crushed velvet, statement chokers, track pants, and more that also started in the \u201880s and \u201890s. I say, we as a fashion community must end the recycling of style comebacks, and start generating styles of our own._________At first glance, this picture seems to be depicting the attainment of a degree between two different groups. One group, the more privileged, have a grand, red-carpeted staircase which allows them to easily descend up and collect their \u201cprize\u201d. On the other hand, the other group is desperately trying to pull themselves up by means of the tassle. They are in the shadows and seem to be completely overlooked by the people relaxing on the top of the cap. I believe this shows the struggles of those less fortunate in their journey to receiving a proper college or high-school education. Some people just have everything working for them: grades, socioeconomic status, opportunities, but others have to find another way to achieve the same goal. After reading the article, it seems the other is trying to prove this very point. He feels guilty that while he and his family could afford a great Ivy league education, others cannot simply because of their family\u2019s income. While there is some economic diversity, most high ranked colleges have more students from the top 1% than the entire bottom 60%. I agree that college opportunity shouldn\u2019t be unavailable just because of an individual\u2019s inability to pay a large sum. As a country, we need to work towards making college more accessible to those who deserve it but can\u2019t attend just because of a poor economic situation.This image depicts an extremely significant message toward the young adults of our generation. It is illustrated that some people find their way to college quite easily, making their way to university with little struggle. However, others are faced with more challenges when try to go to college. The hardships are endless, this could consist of financial aid, lack of acceptance, GPA/SAT scores, and more. Despite the obvious problems, these students will still find their way to college one way or another \u2014 it just may not be as easy for them. Nonetheless, college is an achievable goal for every high school graduate. Students should be encouraged and motivated by this picture and look forward to the upcoming years.This photo prompt conveys a very important message. The act of people climbing the stairs to reach the top of the graduation cap represents that college is the way to reach success. The message in this is that education can help anyone reach the top of their goals. In the photo, there are two sets of people depicted. Although one group appears to be struggling to climb the tassel of the cap, the other group has red carpet stairs to walk up. Either way, with or without difficulty, eventually, the students will reach their goals and be on top for graduation.In this picture, I see two groups going towards the same goal but on two completely different paths. This picture is signifying the wealthy and the poor I believe. The wealthier can walk their red carpet into anywhere or anything and receive something they might not deserve. Then there is the people cast in the shadow of the red carpet, showing they are hidden behind all the \u201csuccessful\u201d people. They are trying to climb up the tassel and begging for help but are simply ignored because they are less valuable than the wealthy. This image is showing the struggles of the less fortunate in society and college. People should be chosen by a college for who they are academically and actions they took to get here, not by how much money they have or if there family is alumni. In the Harvard class of 2021, 29% had a parent or grandparent attend there. Legacy admission should no longer be around, it is unfair for the people who have worked so hard to get into an Ivy League but have a lesser of a chance because their parents didn\u2019t attend that college. More colleges need to start following the footsteps of Emory and Princeton, by not looking at if the applicant has taken tours or visited the college into consideration when looking to see if they will be accepted. It is unfair because some people can not afford to take a tour. We need to work towards a fair college admissions process, so everyone can have a chance at getting great education._________I like the idea a lot, and feel it could be very beneficial. I would probably choose to go to a class like this if it would interest me, because when it comes down to it, knowledge is power. I would probably do the \u00b4drones and rockets\u00b4 class that was stated in Ellin\u00b4s article. This is because I really enjoy STEM type classes. I wish our school would offer something first aid related, because it is very important. I would teach a class about LEGO\u00b4s. I would teach it very hands on, and tie it into architecture and creativity.I really like the idea of \u201cpop-up\u201d classes because they give students the opportunity to explore and experiment in different fields that they may be interested in. Many people pay a lot of money to go to specialized classes, but pop-up classes allow every student the opportunity to try something new. With that said, I would definitely choose to go to a pop-up class in my free time because I love to learn more about something that I am interested in. I would like to take the gun control class at Bennington College that was mentioned in the article because I think that with the recent gun violence that has been plaguing the United States, it is important to learn more about gun policy.I think \u201cpop-up\u201d classes would be a great addition to my school. They allow students who wish to explore a topic to do so, and students who feel too stressed out aren\u2019t forced to go. I believe that pop-up classes would create a better learning environment because every student that attends one, wants to be there, and when the room is full of students that want to learn, it is very effective. Many students want to take initiative in their education and learn about topics they care about, and these classes are a perfect opportunity. I would attend a pop-up class if it was one of my interests because the more you know about different topics, the more equipped you are to deal with adulthood and I believe that everything you learn will benefit you. The class mentioned in the article that I would take is \u201cWhite Privilege\u201d, because I have heard a lot of different opinions about the topic of race, and I would want to be more educated. I wish my school offered a pop-up class about social media and how it affects our society. If I taught a pop-up class, it would be about creative writing because I love creative writing and although we write plenty of essays in school, we never write creatively.I think the idea of \u201cpop-up\u201d classes is very creative and innovative. It gives students a chance to explore outside of their comfort zone. After a while, going along with the regular curriculum gets a bit dull. This would be a breath of fresh air. I would take the \u201cwhite privilege\u201d class because I feel like it\u2019s such an important issue that affects many people. I wish my school offered a pop-up class about our country\u2019s politics. I know, I know, this topic is so overrated. But everything moves so fast that I can\u2019t keep up, and can\u2019t really understand what\u2019s going on. Discussing it and debating about it would be great. If I could teach a pop-up class, it would be about psychology, and more specifically, the social aspect. Many people have a hard time connecting with others, and I want to break it down to understand how the mind works and reacts to certain things.I love the idea of \u201cpop up\u201d classes I think this type of classes is not only benefitting the students but the teachers as well. The change of environment and the timing I believes tricks the mind that school or class is not really taking place and gives you reassurance in the mind that you normally would be worrying in a normal class setting. This also gives teachers elbow room because now they can talk about other topics further on without needing to care what they say for school\u2019s purposes and judgement. I really thought the class: \u2018Self-Determination: Restoration and Resiliency,\u2019 at St. Michael\u2019s College because I love that it is not just something academic but something you can apply in life and I love things that exercise my mind. I would love to teach a pop up class on art history like going to a museum to see different arts or a something with culture to enrich students with different ethnicities and customs. The class could be maybe at culture center or even where there is prone to be only one type of culture in that area while still teaching the history of that culture._________Although far from perfect, I believe that now is the best time to be alive. The world is changing and globalizing at a record speed. Places once closed off are becoming more accesible. Even some of the most remote nations, Myanmar, Micronesia and Tanzania, just to name a few, are opening up. With this move towards an interconnected world comes the empowerment of those once undermined, fueled by the Internet. This is the world of the future. Driverless cars are a reality, along with holograms of once deceased singers and potential commercial space flights. There is so much room for innovation, in every field imaginable and more. Inequality and poverty are becoming less prevalent. There are more opportunities for rural women and girls, whose options once looked bleak. More females are running for office than ever before. Minorities are rising up. Whenever I read the news each day, I see an endless stream of articles about war and tragedy. But, I choose to look past the grim and focus on the positive. Of course, no world is perfect, certainly not ours, but there is so much growth in our society that one cannot help but embrace it.I believe that today in time we are certainly lucky to have many new advancements, especially in technology. We can easily get in touch with friends and family in case of emergency. However there are times I wish I grew up 10 years ago when no one had to worry about how many followers they have or how long ago someone opened a snap chat. Back then without advanced technology and media, life was probably much easier and less complicated. Now teenagers today live in panic and are worrying about their phones at all times. With the internet, teens are more exposed to the dangers of the world and it puts them in a constant panic.According to Steven Pinker, your beliefs regarding the progress and quality of today\u2019s world is all dependent on how you look at things- and he\u2019s absolutely right. You can look at things in terms of how bad they\u2019ve gotten, or you could look at things in terms of how much we\u2019ve improved upon those bad things; and once you do, it\u2019s hard to disagree with him. Throughout our evolution, we\u2019ve lost things, but we\u2019ve definitely gained things too. And your personal \u201cgolden age\u201d will reflect what you believe to be most important. For example, environmentalists might say it was back before the industrial revolution \u2014 or even further \u2014 when humans didn\u2019t have such an impact on the environment. My ideal time to be born is in the future when humans have built successful colonies on other planets, and I fully credit this to my interest in astronomy.The one thing you can\u2019t argue with is our capacity to change and evolve. Steven Pinker said that \u201cThe Enlightenment\u201d changed everything for the better; it worked. And it\u2019s also working now. As time has gone on, humans have been advancing at an exponential rate. Pinkers understand that, overall, the world has become a better place- despite the media\u2019s exaggerated image of our Earth. The Enlightenment started a movement that I don\u2019t think will ever be stopped, and I\u2019m sure that future humans will say the same things about their vastly improved world too.I am not at all surprised by Mr. Pinker\u2019s claim, the world is without a doubt a better place to live in now than ever before. Like he said, lifespans are longer, human rights are better, and lives are more comfortable (in general) than in the past. Yes, the past may have been simpler, but I know for a fact that I would choose high taxes, bad internet connection, and some social issues over having more than half of my country\u2019s population wiped out by the plague.I feel that the reason we hear so much more bad news these days is not because there is more bad news to hear, but more ways to hear it. The sources that supply news are businesses, they need to make money. If they see that bad news sells better, they will sell more bad news. I think acknowledging progress motivates people to keep advancing. They appreciate it when you take notice of their accomplishments and it makes them want to do it more, not less.Overall I do believe now is the best time to be alive due to a multitude of technological advancements along with the new equality movements that have risen in the past decade. However, when I first read this article my original answer was that the world isn\u2019t becoming a better place or it isn\u2019t the best time to be alive due to the latest displays of gun violence, inequality of gender and race, opioid epidemic, and terrorism. This article changed my mind because statistics show that extreme poverty has improved, life expectancy is much longer, and \u201c90% of the world\u2019s population under the age 25 years can read and write\u201d. All of these are extraordinary accomplishments, and are overlooked because this type of improvement is not immediate, it takes time. Furthermore, I agree with the author of Enlightenment Now because when all we do is look at the negative, we will always fail to see the good.In the midst of the sensationalized stories and journalism spoon-fed to us by commercialized news stations, it can be hard to take a step back and acknowledge the significant progress humans have made in the past couple of centuries. As Pinker said, the immense improvement of global health, affluence, and intelligence, as well as other more recent progressions such as the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency, seem to go virtually unnoticed in the interest of pushing for even more regulations. However, this seemingly endless hunger for progress seen in our very politically active generation has been and forever will be crucial to achieving the goal of equality on our planet.Many hundreds of years ago, the impoverished citizens living under the oppressive rule of their oftentimes coronated male leader knew they weren\u2019t being treated fairly, but they had no choice but to accept the fate they were born into or be executed for speaking against the government. Now, with the spread of democracy, many citizens are allowed to protest and vote on hot-topic issues, and we have the ability to push for progress until we can reach the most realistically equal state possible. That\u2019s why I believe it\u2019s currently the best time to be alive in human history, but I don\u2019t doubt that, assuming humans continue their pressuring of politicians to make positive progress for human rights and the environment, the future will hold a society that\u2019d make living in 2018 seem awful in comparison.I believe the best time in human history would be when the leaders of the world stop thinking more nuclear missiles is the path to world peace. Only then would I be able to think that it\u2019s the best time in human history. with such weapons of mass destruction, the condition of our planet is at constant risk.The idea that the world is becoming a livelier, healthier, and an overall improved place doesn\u2019t shock me at all. Around the world, the standard of living in the last century has drastically improved surpassing any point of recognition. So, do I believe that right now is a better time than ever to be alive? Of course I do. That said, there\u2019s still obvious work to be done. Equality is something many oppressed minorities long for and never achieve. Another pressing issue nowadays is public education, underfunded and underdeveloped educational systems around the world are stunting the growth of youthful minds. There have been so many great advancements in medicine, science, politics, and so much more that it\u2019s impossible to suggest there has been a better time for man.Progression is the key to human advancement. Steven Pinker made a great point disproving claims that tragedy put an end to progress. Those who feel our society is not advancing due to various tragedies or epidemics are naive and two-dimensional. I feel just as Pinker does, that progress cannot always be defined by the expulsion of evil, but by the transformation of society\u2019s most pressing issues. I also agree with Pinker\u2019s views on ignoring progression and the result of that. If groups of people band together to deny or resent the state of progression, how are we to move forward? Denying man\u2019s strides in environmentalism, equality, politics and economics hinders the progression of the future._________Advertisement"}

But Americans, including President Trump, have lost interest.President Trump went to West Virginia this month to talk about tax cuts, but he got a bit distracted. He talked about China, the North American Free Trade Agreement, border security, \u201csanctuary cities\u201d and states he won in 2016. Eventually he turned to his prepared comments on taxes. Several topics on cable have displaced taxes. In March, mentions of the word \u201cStormy\u201d spiked on MSNBC and CNN, for example. All three networks have begun talking more about \u201ctrade\u201d over the past two months, as Mr. Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and threatened additional tariffs on products imported from China. Trade concerns have overtaken tax cut inquiries among users of online search engines, too. Data from Google Trends shows a surge of searches for the \u201ctax cut\u201d topic in November and December.

{"Headline": "In This Space Race, Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk Are Competing to Take You There", "Date": "2018-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionLaunch Pad 39A, just north of Cape Canaveral, Fla., was the storied site where America\u2019s space dreams and the imaginations of its youth were sent soaring. The first manned mission to the moon blasted off from there in 1969, as did the last, in 1972; so did the first space shuttle mission, in 1981, and the last, in 2011. But by 2013, with the shuttle program grounded and America\u2019s half century of space aspirations having ended with bangs and whimpers, 39A was rusting away and weeds were growing through its flame trench. A crippled NASA was eager to sell it.The space agency knew there was a natural customer: Elon Musk, the cheeky PayPal co-founder and Tesla creator whose SpaceX venture had become the first private rocket company to launch into orbit with a payload. Musk\u2019s mesmerizing style \u2014 skittering on the border between visionary and eccentric \u2014 made it seem at times that his obsession with space travel involved a desire to return to some celestial home, but his Falcon rockets had won NASA\u2019s respect. Surprisingly, a second bidder emerged: Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, who pursued his passion for all things, including space travel, with an awesome talent for being both exuberant and methodical. His company, Blue Origin, was building a reusable launch vehicle that, among other things, planned to take tourists into space.Musk won the bidding for Launch Pad 39A, but a few months later Bezos bought the nearby Launch Complex 36, from which missions to fly by Mars and Venus had been launched. The transfer of these hallowed pads represented, both symbolically and in practice, John F. Kennedy\u2019s torch of space exploration being passed from government to the private sector \u2014 from a once-glorious but now sclerotic federal agency to a new breed of boyish billionaires who embodied the daring passion and imagination of history\u2019s great pioneers, adventurers and innovators.Two new books chronicle this fascinating transition. \u201cThe Space Barons,\u201d by Christian Davenport, a Washington Post reporter, is an exciting narrative filled with colorful reporting and sharp insights. The book sparkles because of Davenport\u2019s access to the main players and his talent for crisp storytelling. \u201cRocket Billionaires,\u201d by Tim Fernholz, a reporter for Quartz, is not quite as vibrant a narrative and lacks some of Davenport\u2019s memorable scenes, but it provides smart analysis of the New Space sector as well as historical context about NASA\u2019s triumphs and failures.In the class that I teach on the history of the digital revolution, the students discuss whether innovation is driven more by big government projects or by nimble entrepreneurs. The answer, of course, is that it usually involves a symbiotic mix, like the semiconductor industry, which arose out of the Pentagon and NASA\u2019s need to put guidance systems in the nose cones of rockets. Vannevar Bush was the dean of engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a co-founder of Raytheon, and oversaw the government science programs that resulted in the atom bomb and electronic computer. He wrote a seminal paper in 1945, called \u201cScience \u2014 the Endless Frontier,\u201d which described how a collaboration of all three sectors he had been part of \u2014 academia, business and government \u2014 would drive innovation. Government funding of basic research in university labs would lead to discoveries in fundamental science that would be the \u201cseed\u201d for future inventions.Many innovations have progressed along that path. The ENIAC computer funded by the United States Army and built at the University of Pennsylvania was the genesis for UNIVAC and then most other electronic computers. The network funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and designed by a consortium of academic and private labs led eventually to today\u2019s internet. The National Science Foundation, started based on Vannevar Bush\u2019s paper, created a multiagency Digital Library Initiative that funded the academic research of Larry Page and Sergey Brin, which led to Google. The sequencing of the human genome, largely funded by the National Institutes of Health, planted the seeds for the biotech industry.Now space endeavors are following this \u201cinnovation progression,\u201d as we can call it. \u201cJust as Darpa served as the initial impetus for the internet and underwrote a lot of the costs of developing the internet in the beginning, it may be the case that NASA has essentially done the same thing by spending the money to build sort of fundamental technologies,\u201d Musk said a year after launching SpaceX. \u201cOnce we can bring the sort of commercial, free enterprise sector into it, then we can see the dramatic acceleration that we saw in the internet.\u201dOne of the first private pioneers was Burt Rutan, a mutton-chopped aircraft designer who regarded NASA as a bloated and unimaginative bureaucracy and in 1982 founded a company called Scaled Composites that designed aircraft so innovative that, as Davenport writes, \u201cit was as if his inspiration came not just from the laws of aerodynamics but from Picasso.\u201d One of his ideas was for a manned aircraft that could reach the edge of space and then fold its wings upward to act as a feather allowing the craft to re-enter the earth\u2019s atmosphere, land on a runway, and be reused. It would become his entry in the Ansari X Prize, which offered $10 million for the first private company that could launch a reusable vehicle to space twice within two weeks.Rutan attracted two billionaire partners. The first was the Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, who as a schoolboy in Seattle yearned to become an astronaut but, being nearsighted, realized that was impossible so spent his time coding in the school\u2019s computer room with his friend Bill Gates. Rutan\u2019s second partner was the toothy goldilocked Richard Branson, a thrill-addicted serial adventurer and entrepreneur who was as enthusiastic about publicity as Allen was averse to it. Branson\u2019s personal motto for his company, Virgin, was \u201cScrew it, let\u2019s do it,\u201d which was no longer a guiding principle at NASA, and he created Virgin Galactic with the goal of taking tourists into space. \u201cPaul, isn\u2019t this better than the best sex you ever had?\u201d Branson asked Allen during one test flight as the spaceship climbed higher.In 2004, Rutan\u2019s craft (with a Virgin logo on its tail) flew twice to space and back to win the X Prize. At the celebration, Rutan took a shot at NASA. \u201cI was thinking a little bit about that other space agency, the big guys,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they\u2019re looking at each other now and saying, \u2018We\u2019re screwed.\u2019\u201d Branson began selling tickets at prices that started at $200,000 to those who wanted to ride in a similar plane he began building, the launch date of which always seems to be about a year away.Elon Musk\u2019s love of adventure came partly from his maternal grandfather, an accomplished amateur pilot in South Africa who in 1952 completed a 22,000-mile journey across the globe with no electronic instruments. Musk founded SpaceX in 2002 with the eventual goal of colonizing Mars. \u201cThe more Musk studied, the more he realized that there had been very little advancement in rocket technology in the past 40 years,\u201d Davenport writes. \u201cTo a self-made Silicon Valley tech entrepreneur, this was stunning.\u201d His company\u2019s mantra was, \u201cSet audacious, nearly impossible goals and don\u2019t get dissuaded.\u201dMusk\u2019s entrepreneurship had a social purpose. SpaceX, Tesla, his electric car company, and SolarCity, his renewable energy company, Fernholz writes, \u201cwere explicitly intended to further human civilization.\u201d Along the way, he developed a cultlike following. When SpaceX managed to launch a space capsule into orbit and dock it at the International Space Station in 2012, something NASA could no longer do on its own, the employees at his headquarters broke into a chant, \u201cWe love Elon!\u201dBezos was likewise inspired by his own maternal grandfather. Lawrence Preston Gise, an upright but loving naval commander, helped develop the hydrogen bomb during a stint at the Atomic Energy Commission and then retired to his sprawling Texas ranch to enjoy his family \u2014 and in particular his insatiably curious little grandson with very big ears, smile and laugh. Bezos\u2019 passion for space began when he was 5 and he watched with his family the launch of Apollo 11, the manned moon mission commanded by Neil Armstrong. \u201cIt really was a seminal moment for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember watching it on our living room TV, and the excitement of my parents and my grandparents. Little kids can pick up that kind of excitement.\u201dBezos spent every summer at his grandfather\u2019s ranch, where he fixed windmills, castrated cattle and geeked out on the tiny county library\u2019s surprisingly large sci-fi collection. His high school valedictorian speech was about space: how to colonize planets, build space hotels and save our fragile planet. \u201cSpace, the final frontier, meet me there!\u201d he concluded.When Bezos founded Blue Origin in 2000, naming it after that pale blue planet where humans originated, he called upon one of his favorite science fiction writers, Neal Stephenson, to be an adviser. They kicked around wildly novel ideas, such as using a bullwhip-like device to propel objects into space. Eventually Bezos focused on reusable rockets. \u201cHow is the situation in the year 2000 different from 1960?\u201d Stephenson asked him. \u201cWhat\u2019s different is computer sensors, cameras, software. Being able to land vertically is the kind of problem that can be addressed by those technologies that existed in 2000 that didn\u2019t exist in 1960.\u201dBezos began putting together a huge tract of ranch land in Texas where he could build his reusable rockets in secret. One of the great scenes in Davenport\u2019s book is the description of the helicopter trip Bezos took to find the land, which ended with a terrifying crash. He survived, and it conditioned him to the fact that flying machines sometimes fail. Among Bezos\u2019 many strengths is to be exuberant patiently, to have a long-term horizon, as he has done at Amazon. At his Texas ranch, he has begun construction of a 10,000-year \u201cClock of the Long Now\u201d designed by the futurist Danny Hillis, which has a century hand that advances every hundred years and a cuckoo that comes out every millennium. In the mission statement for his space company, he wrote, \u201cBlue will pursue this long-term objective patiently, step by step.\u201d As Elon Musk pushed forward with very public fits and starts, Bezos advised his team, \u201cBe the tortoise and not the hare.\u201dAt the end of 2015, within a month of each other, Musk and Bezos both launched rockets that returned safely to earth and were reusable. For the moment, Musk the hare had darted ahead: His powerful Falcon 9 rocket had lifted a payload into orbit, whereas Bezos\u2019 smaller New Shepard craft had merely gone up into the edge of space and returned. But as happens with scrappy entrepreneurial business competitors, in contrast to government bureaucracies, Bezos and Musk were goading each other on. And unlike the race between the tortoise and the hare, they can both triumph \u2014 as can, one hopes, Richard Branson and others.Indeed, even NASA and its big corporate contractor, the United Launch Alliance, a venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing, can come out winners from competition. As is often the case with the innovation progression, the greatest technological advances come when a symbiosis is reached that combines the resources of a visionary government and the scrappiness of risk-taking entrepreneurs, each spurring the other onward and upward.Walter Isaacson is a professor of history at Tulane. His books include \u201cThe Innovators\u201d and biographies of Benjamin Franklin, Albert Einstein, Steve Jobs and Leonardo da Vinci.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Employees Jump at Genetic Testing. Is That a Good Thing?", "Date": "2018-04-15", "News": "Genetic disease risk screening is becoming a popular employee benefit. But the tests may not be all that beneficial for the general population, experts say.Supported byLevi Strauss & Company introduced a novel benefit for employees at its San Francisco headquarters last fall: free genetic screening to assess their hereditary risks for certain cancers and high cholesterol.\u201cIt really is a differentiator,\u201d Mr. Bergh said.The tests screen for inherited gene mutations that can greatly increase a person\u2019s risk of developing diseases like colon cancer or breast cancer. Doctors now regularly suggest them for high-risk patients, such as people who have close family members with certain cancers.But for people of average risk in the general public, a screening may not be all that useful \u2014 and could even cause harm, experts said. A person without a family history of cancer may have the same problematic mutations as high-risk patients, they said, but could have lower risk of developing cancer.In fact, most cancers are not the result of the hereditary mutations in single genes that these tests detect. Some experts cautioned that extending use of the tests to the broader population may lead some people of average risk to forgo recommended screening tests like colonoscopies. And they warned that it could also lead people to undergo unnecessary medical procedures, including going to the extreme of having surgery to remove their breasts.\u201cYou could scare the living daylights out of people unnecessarily,\u201d said Dr. Stephen J. Chanock, director of the division of cancer epidemiology and genetics at the National Cancer Institute.Color, the genomics company, takes something of a middle road. It markets comprehensive medical diagnostic tests that screen for all mutations of certain genes known to be linked to certain kinds of heredity cancers and heart risks. It has doctors available to order its tests online for users and provides genetic counseling to discuss users\u2019 results.\u201cBy using genetics, you can help some people prevent or interrupt something at an earlier stage where the costs are much lower,\u201d said Othman Laraki, chief executive of Color Genomics. The start-up advises users that they could develop major diseases even if their test results show no harmful mutations.Executives at SAP and Nvidia said they hoped genetic screening might ultimately help prevent at least a few late-stage cancers, the kinds of life-threatening illnesses that can debilitate employees and cost companies with self-funded health plans more than $1 million in medical fees.After Nvidia began offering free screening from Color last year, about 27 percent of its 6,000 eligible employees in the United States took the test. After SAP started subsidizing the genetic tests last year, about 17 percent of the company\u2019s 30,000 eligible employees and family members participated.\u201cIn the long-term view of a program like this, it\u2019s going to pay for itself,\u201d said Jason J. Russell, who oversees employee compensation and benefits for SAP North America. And, he added, \u201cYou are creating good will with employees.\u201dGiven the expense of screening more people of average risk \u2014 as well as follow-up costs from additional tests, medicines, surgery and potential complications from surgeries \u2014 experts said that overall medical expenditures were actually likely to increase. Even so, they said, spending on screening for conditions like hereditary high cholesterol, which increases risk for strokes and heart attacks before the age of 50, could ultimately prolong some lives.\u201cYou are getting good preventive care value for money, \u201d said David L. Veenstra, a professor at the University of Washington who studies health outcomes and economics.Color has raised $150 million from venture capital firms like General Catalyst as well as Bay Area tech luminaries including Max Levchin, a PayPal co-founder; Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive; and Laurene Powell Jobs, a philanthropist-investor who is the widow of the Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.The company has reduced genetic testing costs by using robotics and machine learning and eliminating tasks like in-person prescreening by doctors. It charges $249 for hereditary risk screening for eight of the most common cancers and began offering that price while more established medical diagnostics firms were charging $4,000 for similar tests.The price point appealed to OpenTable. It started offering genetic screening benefits after an employee with a history of cancers told executives she was spending thousands of dollars out of her own pocket to pay for hereditary risk tests.\u201cThis was a really interesting opportunity to provide some choice to our employees that was accessible and affordable so they could better understand their own personal health,\u201d said Christa Quarles, chief executive of OpenTable.As for privacy concerns, executives at several companies said that Color regularly sent them aggregated data on the number of employees with harmful disease mutations, but that the data is not tied to identifying details like employees\u2019 names or birth dates.Executives at several companies that have signed up with Color said they were aware of the debate over genetic screening, but said they believed the start-up was simply ahead of the curve.\u201cOver time, innovation becomes consensus science,\u201d said Mr. Russell of SAP.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "European Regulators Ask if Facebook Is Taking Too Much Data", "Date": "2018-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byData. It is the gasoline that fuels advertiser-supported internet giants like Facebook and the gold that companies mine for their algorithms.Now regulators in Europe are asking whether Facebook is excessively collecting details about the online activities of internet users \u2014 in effect, forcibly extracting a valuable commodity from consumers.Until recently, few consumers stopped to consider the value of their personal information or how much of it they were forking over in exchange for free online services.They say consumers in Germany have little choice of social networks, forcing users to consent to Facebook\u2019s collection of their web-browsing data if they want Facebook accounts. According to the regulators\u2019 analysis, Facebook has a 95 percent market share of social networking in Germany.Because users in Germany lack a real choice, he added, Facebook in effect is able to extract whatever data it wants from them. \u201cThe Facebook case is really about excessive pricing vis-\u00e0-vis the consumer,\u201d Mr. Mundt said.The regulators are not trying to quantify the specific monetary value of data. German, Italian and Belgian regulators are arguing in different ways that certain Facebook data practices are unfair or misleading, not directly causing financial harm to consumers.\u201cLike Facebook, many of those services are supported by ads and offer tools to other apps and websites, then use information they collect to improve people\u2019s experience,\u201d Mr. Steinfeld said in a statement. \u201cThis is not the picture of an internet dominated by a single renegade company.\u201dHe said the company looked forward to answering questions from regulators in Italy.Marketers have long contended that consumers willingly trade their data for more customized ads and personalized services.Ms. Sekar, the start-up employee, said she had long accepted that using Facebook and Facebook-owned services like Instagram meant that the company would collect information about her for ads.But that exchange has become more complicated, she said, as new questions emerge about how consumers\u2019 data could be mined to profile and potentially manipulate them. While she is still using Facebook and Instagram and has a \u201cdecent sense\u201d of what the company collects, she added, \u201cit\u2019s probably worse than I know.\u201d\u201cIt really frustrates me that all of this is done under the guise of: \u2018Well, you made this choice. Nobody is making you sign up for Facebook,\u2019\u201d Ms. Sekar said.Some industry experts, however, said it was illogical to suggest that Facebook was overcharging in data \u2014 because consumer data does not have a face value like a dollar bill. It\u2019s a commodity with a fluctuating value, they said, depending on what it is used for.Facebook made about $84 on average per user in the United States and Canada last year and about $20 on average from users globally, up from $13.50 and $5 in 2012, the year it went public. Targeting ads to its 2.2 billion users helped Facebook generate revenue of $40.6 billion in 2017.The consumer-tracking techniques underpinning that revenue are not unique to Facebook. But the Cambridge Analytica revelations and Facebook\u2019s gargantuan online reach have put the social network in the hot seat. The company has compounded its problems by being unclear about its practices.In two days of questioning during congressional hearings this month, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, told legislators that he did not know how many data points Facebook collected about individual users or how many non-Facebook sites the company tracked users on, and he offered incomplete answers about how the tracking worked.Although Facebook allows users to opt out of seeing ads based on their use of other sites and apps, they cannot opt out of the company\u2019s collection of details about their activities on those services.\u201cWe can and will do more to help people understand how Facebook works and the choices they have,\u201d Mr. Steinfeld, the Facebook spokesman, said.Ms. Sekar\u2019s ambivalence lines up with a sense of resignation that researchers at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Annenberg School for Communication found when they asked Americans about their feelings on sharing unknown quantities of their data with companies.While much of the ad industry views the consumers from whom it extracts information as willing and informed participants, the Penn researchers say users are in the dark about what they\u2019re giving up.This year, 63 percent of consumers who responded to the researchers\u2019 questions said they wanted to have control over what companies can learn about them online, but have come to accept they have little control over that. That\u2019s up from 58 percent in 2015.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "I Downloaded the Information That Facebook Has on Me. Yikes.", "Date": "2018-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixBut when I opened my file, it was like opening Pandora\u2019s box.With a few clicks, I learned that about 500 advertisers \u2014 many that I had never heard of, like Bad Dad, a motorcycle parts store, and Space Jesus, an electronica band \u2014 had my contact information, which could include my email address, phone number and full name. Facebook also had my entire phone book, including the number to ring my apartment buzzer. The social network had even kept a permanent record of the roughly 100 people I had deleted from my friends list over the last 14 years, including my exes.There was so much that Facebook knew about me \u2014 more than I wanted to know. But after looking at the totality of what the Silicon Valley company had obtained about yours truly, I decided to try to better understand how and why my data was collected and stored. I also sought to find out how much of my data could be removed.But that\u2019s an overstatement. Most basic information, like my birthday, could not be deleted. More important, the pieces of data that I found objectionable, like the record of people I had unfriended, could not be removed from Facebook, either.Beth Gautier, a Facebook spokeswoman, put it this way: \u201cWhen you delete something, we remove it so it\u2019s not visible or accessible on Facebook.\u201d She added: \u201cYou can also delete your account whenever you want. It may take up to 90 days to delete all backups of data on our servers.\u201dDigging through your Facebook files is an exercise I highly recommend if you care about how your personal information is stored and used. Here\u2019s what I learned.A history of the steps the company took to become an advertising giant.When you download a copy of your Facebook data, you will see a folder containing multiple subfolders and files. The most important one is the \u201cindex\u201d file, which is essentially a raw data set of your Facebook account, where you can click through your profile, friends list, timeline and messages, among other features.This was unsettling. I had hoped Messenger would use my contacts list to find others who were also using the app so that I could connect with them easily \u2014 and hold on to the relevant contact information only for the people who were on Messenger. Yet Facebook kept the entire list, including the phone numbers for my car mechanic, my apartment door buzzer and a pizzeria.My Facebook data also revealed how little the social network forgets. For instance, in addition to recording the exact date I signed up for Facebook in 2004, there was a record of when I deactivated Facebook in October 2010, only to reactivate it four days later \u2014 something I barely remember doing.Facebook also kept a history of each time I opened Facebook over the last two years, including which device and web browser I used. On some days, it even logged my locations, like when I was at a hospital two years ago or when I visited Tokyo last year.Facebook keeps a log of this data as a security measure to flag suspicious logins from unknown devices or locations, similar to how banks send a fraud alert when your credit card number is used in a suspicious location. This practice seemed reasonable, so I didn\u2019t try to purge this information.But what bothered me was the data that I had explicitly deleted but that lingered in plain sight. On my friends list, Facebook had a record of \u201cRemoved Friends,\u201d a dossier of the 112 people I had removed along with the date I clicked the \u201cUnfriend\u201d button. Why should Facebook remember the people I\u2019ve cut off from my life?Facebook\u2019s explanation was dissatisfying. The company said it might use my list of deleted friends so that those people did not appear in my feed with the feature \u201cOn This Day,\u201d which resurfaces memories from years past to help people reminisce. I\u2019d rather have the option to delete the list of deleted friends for good.What Facebook retained about me isn\u2019t remotely as creepy as the sheer number of advertisers that have my information in their databases. I found this out when I clicked on the Ads section in my Facebook file, which loaded a history of the dozen ads I had clicked on while browsing the social network.Lower down, there was a section titled \u201cAdvertisers with your contact info,\u201d followed by a list of roughly 500 brands, the overwhelming majority of which I had never interacted with. Some brands sounded obscure and sketchy \u2014 one was called \u201cMicrophone Check,\u201d which turned out to be a radio show. Other brands were more familiar, like Victoria\u2019s Secret Pink, Good Eggs or AARP.Facebook said unfamiliar advertisers might appear on the list because they might have obtained my contact information from elsewhere, compiled it into a list of people they wanted to target and uploaded that list into Facebook. Brands can upload their customer lists into a tool called Custom Audiences, which helps them find those same people\u2019s Facebook profiles to serve them ads.Brands can obtain your information in many different ways. Those include:\u25a0 Getting your information in simpler ways, too. Someone you shared information with could share it with another entity. Your credit card loyalty program, for example, could share your information with a hotel chain, and that hotel chain could serve you ads on Facebook.The upshot? Even a Facebook lurker, like myself, who has barely clicked on any digital ads can have personal information exposed to an enormous number of advertisers. This was not entirely surprising, but seeing the list of unfamiliar brands with my contact information in my Facebook file was a dose of reality.I tried to contact some of these advertisers, like Very Important Puppets, a toymaker, to ask them about what they did with my data. They did not respond.Let\u2019s be clear: Facebook is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to what information tech companies have collected on me.In another folder, labeled Android, Google had a record of apps I had opened on an Android phone since 2015, along with the date and time. This felt like an extraordinary level of detail.Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.On a brighter note, I downloaded an archive of my LinkedIn data. The data set was less than half a megabyte and contained exactly what I had expected: spreadsheets of my LinkedIn contacts and information I had added to my profile.Yet that offered little solace. Be warned: Once you see the vast amount of data that has been collected about you, you won\u2019t be able to unsee it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Trade Tensions Rise, Here Are Some Lessons From Brexit: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Wednesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Another bank takes steps toward gun safety.\u2022 The next steps in the tariffs tit-for-tat.\u2022 Investigators are looking into the motive behind the shooting at YouTube\u2019s headquarters.Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union provides pointers for investors as President Trump ratchets up trade tensions with China.In the weeks following Britain\u2019s vote in 2016 for \u201cBrexit,\u201d fears grew that the post-war economic order was under serious threat. But European stock markets recovered, including Britain\u2019s. Investors came to see that the European Union was not going to break up, and Britain was not going to erect tall walls around its economy. Looking back, the panicky early reaction to Brexit seems to have sprung more from a fear of the unknown than any big threats to the global trading system. Investors took a deep breath and gained some perspective.Movements in the United States stock market suggests the same thing is happening in response to President Trump\u2019s trade policies. China on Tuesday evening announced the tariffs it plans in retaliation against those President Trump is threatening. Reacting to China\u2019s announcement, the S.&P. 500 index plunged early on Wednesday but recovered strongly to close up 1.2 percent.Investors may believe China\u2019s move will lead to drawn-out negotiations. Here, Brexit is again illustrative. As the back and forth between the European Union and Britain has gone on, investors have gained more clarity and confidence. If talks between the U.S. and China gain steam, the uncertainty now clouding relations between the two countries may gradually clear.But the standoff between the U.S. and China differs in important ways from the Brexit tensions. The U.S., for instance, is in a much stronger position than Britain. China exports far more to the U.S. than the U.S. does to China. Limiting access to the U.S. economy could hurt China\u2019s growth at a time when it is trying to overhaul important economic sectors. If investors believe that the U.S. can successfully exploit its advantages to make China more friendly to foreign businesses, they may even see the trade skirmish as positive for the global economy.But Brexit also flashes a warning to those expecting a big win for Mr. Trump. One of the reasons that the European Union has presented a united front is that it sees Brexit as a threat to its values and goals. Similarly, China may believe that Mr. Trump\u2019s trade attack puts some of its most deeply held aspirations under threat \u2013 and will fight back hard.- Peter EavisAfter Citigroup announced plans to limit firearms sales by business customers, the question was which lenders would be the next to make a move on guns. The latest: Amalgamated Bank, the union-owned bank known for its socially minded policies.\u2022 Require gun dealers to protect merchandise from burglary and theft and refuse sales to people who appear in distress or intoxicated\u2022 Require retailers to stop selling high-capacity magazines and bump stocks\u2022 Require gun makers to \u201ccommit to developing innovations in firearms that will allow law enforcement to more easily solve gun crimes\u201dAmalgamated said that it would not only require all business customers to adhere to those guidelines but added that it won\u2019t invest any of its own money in gun manufacturers or distributors.Here\u2019s what Amalgamated\u2019s C.E.O. Keith Mestrich, said in a news release:\u201cCollectively, banks and lenders have the power to promote responsible business practices from gun manufacturers and distributors, and ultimately contribute to a safer society for all. Amalgamated will do whatever we can to achieve that goal and we hope other banks and financial institutions will agree and act.\u201dThe new figure sharply increased the company\u2019s previous estimate of how many users\u2019 information was harvested by Cambridge Analytica. The number had been put at more than 50 million users.The sharing of the user data has unleashed a torrent of criticism at Facebook, the world\u2019s largest social network. The company\u2019s stock is down sharply since The New York Times and The Observer of London reported on how Cambridge Analytica improperly acquired users\u2019 data.The company released the revised estimate of affected users in an extended statement on Wednesday about its plans for handling personal data. The company said it will start alerting users on April 9 about whether their information may have been shared with Cambridge Analytica.In related Facebook news\u2022 Earlier on Wednesday, lawmakers in Washington had said Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, would testify before the House Energy and Commerce Committee on April 11 about the company\u2019s handling of sensitive user data.And is dragging down the Dow Jones industrial average. The blue-chip index is off nearly 350 points, or 1.4 percent. That slide is worse than the declines of the S.&P. 500 and the Nasdaq Composite, which are both down less than 1 percent.Boeing\u2019s 4 percent fall has shaved 87 points off the Dow Wednesday. Boeing is the highest priced stock in the price-weighted index, which means Boeing has an outsized impact on the index\u2019s moves.Boeing\u2019s shares have served as a proxy for investor concern about a possible trade war with China since the Trump administration announced tariffs on aluminum and steel.Over that period, the stock has fallen 12 percent.The streaming-music company\u2019s shares opened at $165.90, but they steadily decline throughout their first day of trading, closing at $149.01.The stock is down 4.1 percent to $142.91 in early trading Wednesday.Because Spotify eschewed a typical initial public offering in favor of a direct listing, there is no I.P.O. price off which to base the performance of its shares. But the company\u2019s current shares price remains well above the $132.50 its private shares changed hands at earlier this year.Sony.At Tuesday\u2019s close, Sony\u2019s 5.7 percent stake was worth $1.5 billion.What may change: security in Silicon Valley. YouTube, like many other big tech companies, doesn\u2019t have visible metal detectors or armed guards.Diversity, they argue, will help investors spot future successes like Stitch Fix.The deals flyaroundThe tech flyaroundNote: While we congratulated Villanova yesterday, we did not congratulate Notre Dame for its win on Sunday, which we heartily do so now.An earlier version of this article attributed incorrectly an estimate that 50 million Facebook users\u2019 personal information may have been improperly shared during the 2016 election.

{"Headline": "Mark Zuckerberg Testimony: Day 2 Brings Tougher Questioning", "Date": "2018-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOver the two days, there were nearly 10 hours of hearings, during which almost 100 lawmakers grilled Mr. Zuckerberg.While Tuesday\u2019s Senate hearing contained tough questions, the lawmakers were generally deferential to the executive. That was less the case in the House, where lawmakers repeatedly interrupted Mr. Zuckerberg and chided him for not answering questions to their satisfaction.Lawmakers on both side of the aisle on Wednesday pushed Mr. Zuckerberg on his company\u2019s handling of user data. They were particularly focused on the platform\u2019s privacy settings, which put the onus on users to protect their privacy. He was also asked about:\u2022 Whether the social network should be regulated.\u2022 What Russians did on Facebook during the 2016 election.\u2022 Whether the social network had a liberal bias.\u2022 What Facebook ultimately is as it has grown into a global behemoth.READ MORE:Representative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon and chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee, kicked off the hearing by declaring that \u201cwhile Facebook has certainly grown, I worry it has not matured.\u201dMr. Walden floated the prospect of regulation, saying that \u201cI think it is time to ask whether Facebook may have moved too fast and broken too many things.\u201dLater in the hearing, Mr. Zuckerberg said regulation was \u201cinevitable.\u201d But he repeated that the right kind of regulation mattered and he pointed out that some regulation could only solidify the power of a large company like Facebook, which could hurt start-ups.A history of the steps the company took to become an advertising giant.On Tuesday, several senators sounded a similar tune, saying Facebook couldn\u2019t be trusted with the vast amounts of data being collected, much of which was being done without users\u2019 full understanding. Three senators introduced privacy legislation that would require users\u2019 permission to collect and share their data.On Wednesday, Mr. Zuckerberg was asked to agree to privacy legislation that requires permission for data collection. Mr. Zuckerberg demurred and did not express support for any specific legislative proposal.Representative Frank Pallone Jr., a New Jersey Democrat, pressed Mr. Zuckerberg on whether Facebook would agree or refuse to change Facebook\u2019s default settings to minimize collection and use of users\u2019 data.\u201cThis is a complex issue that deserves more than a one word answer,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg answered.\u201cThat\u2019s disappointing to me,\u201d Mr. Pallone responded.The concern was echoed by Representative Bobby L. Rush, a Democrat of Illinois, who pointed a finger at Mr. Zuckerberg and asked: \u201cWhy is the onus on the user to opt in to privacy and security settings?\u201dBut Mr. Zuckerberg also did not dismiss a proposal from Representative Raul Ruiz, a Democrat from California, to create a digital consumer protection agency that would subject Facebook and its peers to some degree of government involvement.Mr. Zuckerberg called the idea one \u201cthat deserves a lot of consideration\u201d but said that the \u201cdetails on this really matter.\u201dThis morning, Representatives Gene Green, a Texas Democrat, and Jan Schakowsky, an Illinois Democrat, pressed him repeatedly on the issue. And Mr. Zuckerberg repeated his commitment to give all users those controls.But European regulators and privacy advocates said over the last week that a number of Facebook\u2019s current practices seemed violate the new law, called the General Data Protection Regulation.For one thing, the European law requires privacy by design and default. European experts said that, in their view, that would require Facebook turn off a number of advertising and privacy settings which are currently set to sharing and instead ask user permission to turn them on.Mr. Zuckerberg answered the legislators\u2019 questions by saying that the company plans to put a tool \u201cat the top of everyone\u2019s app\u201d where users will be able to make privacy and sharing choices. But the company may not offer affirmative consent \u2014 asking users to explicitly opt-in \u2014 in every country, depending on legal issues, he said.Facebook currently allows users to download a copy of their personal data like their messages, likes and posts.But Mr. Green wanted to know if Facebook would comply with the European law \u2014 and extend those protections to users worldwide \u2014 by providing individuals with the complete records and profiles the Facebook has compiled on them. That would include any data the company collected about its users by tracking them on other websites, and any data the company bought or acquired from third parties about users, and any categorizations or algorithmic scores Facebook created about users, regulators said.Mr. Zuckerberg said he believed all of the data is available.That isn\u2019t true for the moment \u2014 at least for a couple of reporters who recently downloaded their Facebook data. But Facebook has about six weeks to figure out how to give users a copy of their algorithmic scores, web tracking data and other records the social network has compiled before the law goes into effect in Europe.Facial recognition \u2014 a technology that scans your face and converts into a mathematical code that can be used to identify you in any other facial photo or video still \u2014 is a hot-button topic on both sides of the Atlantic. That is because it involves measuring and collecting data about people\u2019s unique physical attributes.Facebook uses the technology in a name-tagging feature that can automatically suggest the names of people in users\u2019 photographs. But regulators in Europe have cracked down on Facebook for rolling it out without users\u2019 explicit opt-in consent. And privacy groups in the United States filed a complaint last week to the Federal Trade Commission saying Facebook\u2019s recent expanded use of the technology violated a settlement the company made with the agency in 2011.When legislators asked him about the tough new European privacy rules today, Mr. Zuckerberg said he was generally concerned that some constraints could restrict companies based in the United States from innovating with technologies like facial recognition \u2014 allowing China to take the lead in developing the technology.Even so, Mr. Zuckerberg said, technologies like face recognition should require permission from users.For sensitive technologies, he said, \u201cI do think you want a special consent.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg pushed back against suggestions that Facebook is essentially a monopoly, \u201cwithout any true competitor,\u201d as put by Representative Fred Upton, Republican of Michigan.Reiterating a point made Tuesday before the Senate, Mr. Zuckerberg said that there is a \u201clot of competition\u201d that Facebook managers \u201cdefinitely feel in running the company.\u201d He mentioned, but did not name, eight apps that users rely on to communicate.He left out that, according to comScore, Facebook owns three of the top ten mobile apps used in the United States: Facebook, Facebook Messenger and Instagram.Of the remaining seven, Google owns five (YouTube, Google Search, Google Maps, Google Play and Gmail). Only Snapchat and Pandora are independent.Mr. Pallone, the New Jersey Democrat, chided Mr. Zuckerberg for his company\u2019s na\u00efvet\u00e9 in not realizing how Facebook data could be utilized.\u201cFor all the good it brings, Facebook can be a weapon for those, like Russia and Cambridge Analytica, that seek to harm us and hack our democracy,\u201d he said.Several lawmakers have pointed out to Mr. Zuckerberg, repeatedly, that the Obama campaign used a Facebook app to also scrape data from users and their friends in 2012.But those lawmakers have failed to mention one very important distinction between the Obama campaign\u2019s app and Cambridge Analytica\u2019s app: The Obama app was actually on Facebook itself, and it was very clear about who and what the data would be used for.The app used to scrape data for Cambridge Analytica was accessed through a personality questionnaire hosted on a site outside of Facebook, and it appeared to users to be for academic research, not for a political data company owned by a wealthy Republican donor and dedicated to reshaping the American electorate.Representative Joe Barton, Republican of Texas, zeroed in on a line of questioning that his Texas counterpart in the Senate, Ted Cruz, also asked, pressing Mr. Zuckerberg on why Facebook has been allegedly censoring content from conservative organizations and Trump supporters such as Diamond and Silk.Mr. Barton also asked Mr. Zuckerberg if he would agree that Facebook would work to ensure it is \u201ca neutral public platform,\u201d a question also asked by Mr. Cruz.\u201cI do agree that we should give people a voice,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.Republican lawmakers returned several times to the issue of bias on Facebook.Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana questioned whether Facebook\u2019s newsfeed algorithms tamp down conservative news in favor of more left-leaning outlets, to which Mr. Zuckerberg responded that \u201cthere is absolutely no directive\u201d to have \u201cany kind of bias in anything we do.\u201dThe proliferation of so-called fake news has put Mr. Zuckerberg in an awkward spot, as the company promises to do a better job of weeding out propaganda and falsehoods but insists it cannot police free speech.Out in the hall during a break in the hearing, Representative Billy Long, a Republican from Missouri, also expressed frustration about Facebook\u2019s treatment of Diamond and Silk, two pro-Trump video personalities who have complained about being censored by the platform.\u201cIt seems like they take down a lot more conservative content than they do liberal,\u201d he said.Mr. Long said that he needed more answers about the Diamond and Silk situation, and that he hoped Mr. Zuckerberg could ensure that the company\u2019s thousands of moderators weren\u2019t biased against conservatives.\u201cHe better hope he does it, not us,\u201d Mr. Long added. \u201cOr Congress is going to get involved, and regulate a private industry.\u201dMr. Walden of Oregon foreshadowed a line of questioning for Mr. Zuckerberg on how Facebook works and if the social media site has become a publisher or utility service that deserves regulation.\u201cWhat exactly is Facebook?\u201d Mr. Walden asked, listing industries like advertising, publishing and even telecom, or \u201ccommon carrier in the information age.\u201dThe definitions matter. If Facebook is viewed as a telecommunications service that is more like a utility, it may be regulated by the Federal Communications Commission. If lawmakers define Facebook as a publisher, it could also fall under regulations at that agency.\u201cI consider us to be a technology company,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg answered. \u201cThe primary thing we do is have engineers that write code and build services for other people.\u201d\u201cDo we have a responsibility for the content people share on Facebook? I think the answer to that question is yes,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Time Warner C.E.O. Testifies That AT&T Merger Is Needed to Battle Silicon Valley", "Date": "2018-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Time Warner\u2019s chief executive, Jeffrey Bewkes, vigorously defended his company\u2019s $85.4 billion merger with AT&T on Wednesday, saying the deal was necessary to confront \u201ctectonic changes\u201d in entertainment caused by internet competitors like Netflix and Amazon.Before a packed courtroom on Wednesday, Mr. Bewkes portrayed Time Warner as an underdog against Silicon Valley giants that can reach hundreds of millions of users and are spending billions of dollars a year to produce original shows that compete with Time Warner\u2019s HBO and Turner Broadcasting.\u201cWe don\u2019t have the tech platform, don\u2019t have the engineers, don\u2019t have the infrastructure,\u201d Mr. Bewkes said in arguing for his company\u2019s need to combine with AT&T, a mobile wireless and satellite television giant with access to more than 150 million subscribers nationwide.In cross-examination, a lawyer for the Justice Department grilled Mr. Bewkes on the underdog narrative, and presented an internal document that Mr. Bewkes wrote in January 2017 to Time Warner\u2019s board that touted the company\u2019s revenue projections. The document also showed that Time Warner was planning to introduce digital products even without the potential merger.AT&T\u2019s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, is expected to testify as soon as Thursday. John Stankey, the AT&T executive who is poised to run Time Warner after the merger, also began testimony on Wednesday afternoon. Arguments are expected to close as early as April 30. Judge Richard J. Leon of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, who is presiding over the case, is expected to take about a month before giving his opinion.For Mr. Bewkes, 65, the courtroom appearance was a rare public pleading to salvage a career-defining deal. The media titan is a 39-year veteran of Time Warner and has been chief executive since 2008, overseeing the spinoff of Time Warner Cable a year later, the rise of HBO and the turbulent evolution of CNN and the Warner Bros. movie studio.Confident and congenial, Mr. Bewkes engaged directly with Judge Leon, leaning forward in his chair and making eye contact as he explained how the media industry is being challenged by Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google and Netflix. He described the Justice Department\u2019s theory that the merged company would threaten to withhold Time Warner content from rival cable operators as \u201cridiculous.\u201dAmong the biggest problems for Time Warner as a stand-alone television and movie producer is that it does not have access to viewer data to target advertising and other valuable customer information the same way that Amazon and Netflix do, Mr. Bewkes said.\u201cWe don\u2019t have emails, contact information, billing information \u2026 any of these things,\u201d he said.At the center of the antitrust trial are arguments over consumer and competitive harms, with attention focused on economic analyses presented by both sides last week. The Justice Department and several consumer groups said the deal would hurt consumers, who would have to pay bigger bills as a result of higher prices for Time Warner programs.The companies have argued that the Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit is at least a decade behind the times. Time Warner said companies like Google and Facebook have the most valuable data on users but they are not willing to share that information.Mr. Bewkes said he has also unsuccessfully tried to buy data on viewers from distributors like Comcast, which was only willing to sell limited sets.These trends prompted Mr. Stephenson and Mr. Bewkes in the summer of 2016 to meet to discuss business options, Mr. Bewkes said Wednesday. In late August 2016, over a three-hour lunch on the 10th-floor dining room of the Time Warner building in New York, they agreed a merger made the most sense. The companies\u2019 boards approved the plan soon after.Judge Leon, who has not commented much throughout the trial, has said the action was a \u201crare breed of horse\u201d but not a \u201cunicorn.\u201dMr. Bewkes and Mr. Stephenson have previously suggested that the Justice Department was influenced to block the deal by presidential politics. President Trump said during his election campaign that the deal should be denied. Mr. Trump has also repeatedly bashed CNN for its coverage of his administration.The Justice Department has denied any political interference in its suit to block the deal.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 T-Mobile and Sprint have their eye on regulators.\u2022 HNA is set to drop its pursuit of SkyBridge Capital\u2022 How close are the U.S. and Europe to a trade war?But from that, Mr. Legere sought to change the way U.S. wireless providers did business:\u2022 Lowering prices\u2022 Ending some long-term contract requirements\u2022 Offering unlimited data plans\u201cThe company took off like a rocketship and has sustained that momentum ever since the AT&T merger was blocked,\u201d the analyst Craig Moffett of the research firm MoffettNathanson told me in an interview.More on the legacy of Mr. Legere, from my and Cecilia\u2019s story on the deal:Those policies helped T-Mobile add nearly 40 million customers over the last five years, with 5 million new customers added last year alone. AT&T, Verizon and Sprint all followed suit, and in recent years the overall price of basic wireless plans has stayed flat or fallen, according to Obama-era regulators.The Un-carrier campaign helped propel T-Mobile ahead of Sprint in 2015. As of Dec. 31., the company had 58.7 million retail subscribers, compared to Sprint\u2019s 40.9 million. T-Mobile\u2019s market value also outstripped that of Sprint\u2019s, contributing to the structure of Sunday\u2019s deal: Mr. Legere would become C.E.O. of the combined company, which would keep the T-Mobile name.In an ironic twist, completion of the Sprint deal would put T-Mobile ahead of its former suitor, AT&T, in terms of retail subscribers. AT&T had 93.2 million at the end of 2017.But Mr. Moffett said that the very success of Mr. Legere and T-Mobile could pose problems for the Sprint deal, since it proves that regulators\u2019 opposition to the two companies\u2019 effort to merge in 2014 was justified.When I asked about the tweet in a phone interview on Sunday \u2014 which also involved Marcelo Claure, Sprint\u2019s C.E.O. \u2014 Mr. Legere chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re expecting me to remember tweets from 2014?\u201d he responded.\u2014 Michael de la Merced\u201cThe 5G aspects that are critical for the country and critical for us really was the flipping point as to this is the time.\u201d\u201cServices are going to be broadened, prices are going to go down, speeds are going to go up. The 5G capability is going to be beyond anything the United States has seen before.

At that deal price, Mr. Claure\u2019s long-term award of 10 million Sprint shares is worth $66.2 million. Those shares \u201cwill fully vest if he\u2019s terminated within 18 months of the deal\u2019s completion, or if his responsibilities change materially.\u201dHe also \u201cis eligible for cash severance of about $11.6 million and $54,000 of other benefits.\u201dSo far this year, companies and other buyers have announced $1.68 trillion of acquisitions, according to Dealogic.

Acquirers have struck $674 billion of deals for U.S. companies through April 30, the highest level on record and exceeding the $607 billion agreed to through the same period in 2007.Whether they will succeed is another matter. Michael and Cecilia Kang point out that while the F.C.C. commissioner, Ajit Pai, has signaled an open mind toward mergers, many antitrust staffers at the Justice Department are the same people who opposed the deal in 2014.No matter how much hyperbole Sprint and T-Mobile expend, it is hard to see how the deal will pass muster with regulators.\u201cIt would not surprise me if they can come up with an economist with a model that says this is all unicorns and cupcakes,\u201d said Michael Kades, a former lawyer at the F.T.C. who is now the director of markets and competition policy for Washington Center for Equitable Growth. \u201cBut the market concentration is presumptively anticompetitive.\u201dFrom AnnaMaria Andriotis, Telis Demos and Emily Glazer of the WSJ:The financial companies have explored creating a new credit-card code for firearms dealers, similar to how they code restaurants, or department stores, according to people familiar with the matter. Another idea would require merchants to share information about specific firearm products consumers are buying, some of the people said.If the credit card companies and banks agreed, they could come up with a series of subcodes that would identify retailers that sold guns under a \u201cbest practices\u201d policy \u2014 like the policy that Citigroup proposed or the one that Walmart and Dick\u2019s follow \u2014 and the ones that don\u2019t. It would add transparency to the process, and it would give banks that issue credit cards the opportunity to decide which retailers they wanted to associate with.But such a move might concern opponents of gun control, who worry that keeping tabs on firearms sales would be contrary to the government\u2019s hands-off approach to monitoring such transactions. And then there are general privacy concerns: Adam Levitin, a law professor at Georgetown, told the WSJ: \u201cThere\u2019s the slippery slope danger if it\u2019s guns today maybe it is pornography tomorrow and the day after it\u2019s right-wing literature.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la MercedThe country says it will refuse to discuss President Trump\u2019s two toughest trade demands when American officials arrive in Beijing this week, potentially derailing the high-level talks.Keith Bradsher of the NYT reports:The Chinese government is publicly calling for flexibility on both sides. But senior Beijing officials do not plan to discuss the two biggest requests that the Trump administration has made over the past several months, according to people involved in Chinese policymaking. Those include a mandatory $100 billion cut in America\u2019s $375 billion annual trade deficit with China and curbs on Beijing\u2019s $300 billion plan to bankroll the country\u2019s industrial upgrade into advanced technologies like artificial intelligence, semiconductors, electric cars and commercial aircraft.What\u2019s behind China\u2019s stance?

This year\u2019s conference will touch on hot topics like the trade tensions between the U.S. and China, the #MeToo movement, the planned talks with North Korea, and the backlash against Silicon Valley.Attendees include Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Tim Sloan of Wells Fargo, Leon Black of Apollo Global Management and Eric Schmidt of Google.The worries of some critics, according to Nathaniel Popper:Countries that devote more resources to the process could successfully push their preferred cryptographic algorithms to be the standards, potentially creating so-called back doors that could be used in the future to spy on blockchain activity.More from Julie Creswell, Kevin Draper and Rachel Abrams:While Nike executives have told investors that the women\u2019s category was a crucial part of its revenue growth strategy, former employees said it was not given the budget it needed to roll out the sophisticated marketing campaigns that were the hallmark of traditional men\u2019s sports, like basketball.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018The Business of War\u2019: Google Employees Protest Work for the Pentagon", "Date": "2018-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Thousands of Google employees, including dozens of senior engineers, have signed a letter protesting the company\u2019s involvement in a Pentagon program that uses artificial intelligence to interpret video imagery and could be used to improve the targeting of drone strikes.The letter, which is circulating inside Google and has garnered more than 3,100 signatures, reflects a culture clash between Silicon Valley and the federal government that is likely to intensify as cutting-edge artificial intelligence is increasingly employed for military purposes.\u201cWe believe that Google should not be in the business of war,\u201d says the letter, addressed to Sundar Pichai, the company\u2019s chief executive. It asks that Google pull out of Project Maven, a Pentagon pilot program, and announce a policy that it will not \u201cever build warfare technology.\u201dThat kind of idealistic stance, while certainly not shared by all Google employees, comes naturally to a company whose motto is \u201cDon\u2019t be evil,\u201d a phrase invoked in the protest letter. But it is distinctly foreign to Washington\u2019s massive defense industry and certainly to the Pentagon, where the defense secretary, Jim Mattis, has often said a central goal is to increase the \u201clethality\u201d of the United States military.Google employees have circulated protest petitions on a range of issues, including Google Plus, the company\u2019s lagging competitor to Facebook, and Google\u2019s sponsorship of the Conservative Political Action Conference.Employees raised questions about Google\u2019s involvement in Project Maven at a recent companywide meeting. At the time, Diane Greene, who leads Google\u2019s cloud infrastructure business, defended the deal and sought to reassure concerned employees. A company spokesman said most of the signatures on the protest letter had been collected before the company had an opportunity to explain the situation.But improved analysis of drone video could be used to pick out human targets for strikes, while also better identifying civilians to reduce the accidental killing of innocent people.Without referring directly to the letter to Mr. Pichai, Google said in a statement on Tuesday that \u201cany military use of machine learning naturally raises valid concerns.\u201d It added, \u201cWe\u2019re actively engaged across the company in a comprehensive discussion of this important topic.\u201d The company called such exchanges \u201chugely important and beneficial,\u201d though several Google employees familiar with the letter would speak of it only on the condition of anonymity, saying they were concerned about retaliation.The statement said the company\u2019s part of Project Maven was \u201cspecifically scoped to be for non-offensive purposes,\u201d though officials declined to make available the relevant contract language. The Defense Department said that because Google is a subcontractor on Project Maven to the prime contractor, ECS Federal, it could not provide either the amount or the language of Google\u2019s contract. ECS Federal did not respond to inquiries.Google said the Pentagon was using \u201copen-source object recognition software available to any Google Cloud customer\u201d and based on unclassified data. \u201cThe technology is used to flag images for human review and is intended to save lives and save people from having to do highly tedious work,\u201d the company said.An uneasiness about military contracts among a small fraction of Google\u2019s more than 70,000 employees may not pose a major obstacle to the company\u2019s growth. But in the rarefied area of artificial intelligence research, Google is engaged in intense competition with other tech companies for the most talented people, so recruiters could be hampered if some candidates are put off by Google\u2019s defense connections.The employees\u2019 protest letter to Mr. Pichai, which has been circulated on an internal communications system for several weeks, argues that embracing military work could backfire by alienating customers and potential recruits.\u201cThis plan will irreparably damage Google\u2019s brand and its ability to compete for talent,\u201d the letter says. \u201cAmid growing fears of biased and weaponized AI, Google is already struggling to keep the public\u2019s trust.\u201d It suggests that Google risks being viewed as joining the ranks of big defense contractors like Raytheon, General Dynamics and the big-data firm Palantir.Like other onetime upstarts turned powerful Silicon Valley behemoths, Google is being forced to confront the idealism that guided the company in its early years. Facebook started with the lofty mission of connecting people all over the world, but it has recently come under fire for becoming a conduit for fake news and being used by Russia to influence the 2016 election and sow dissent among American voters.Paul Scharre, a former Pentagon official and author of \u201cArmy of None,\u201d a forthcoming book on the use of artificial intelligence to build autonomous weapons, said the clash inside Google was inevitable, given the company\u2019s history and the booming demand for A.I. in the military.\u201cThere\u2019s a strong libertarian ethos among tech folks, and a wariness about the government\u2019s use of technology,\u201d said Mr. Scharre, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security in Washington. \u201cNow A.I. is suddenly and quite quickly moving out of the research lab and into real life.\u201dScott Shane reported from Washington, and Daisuke Wakabayashi from San Francisco.

{"Headline": "Marissa Mayer Is Still Here", "Date": "2018-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCorner OfficeThe former Yahoo chief is renting Google\u2019s original office, where \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of good juju,\u201d and planning her next act. She just won\u2019t say what it is. Marissa Mayer was celebrated as a savior when she left Google to become chief executive of Yahoo in 2012. A brilliant computer scientist, Ms. Mayer was the 20th employee at Google, and influenced many of the company\u2019s signature features \u2014 including Gmail and Google Maps.But could she save Yahoo? The company was reeling from boardroom tumult and a series of executive changeovers when she arrived, and Google and Facebook were winning the war for online eyeballs and ad dollars. Her tenure was ferociously controversial. Investors did well during Ms. Mayer\u2019s five years at the helm, seeing the value of their shares more than triple. But Ms. Mayer\u2019s every decision was second-guessed by Silicon Valley, and she was unable to make Yahoo relevant again. Last year, Yahoo was sold to Verizon, and Ms. Mayer left the company. This interview \u2014 Ms. Mayer\u2019s first since leaving Yahoo \u2014 was condensed and edited for clarity, and conducted in her personal office in Palo Alto, Calif. I rented the old Google office. So this is actually the office where I started my career in 1999. This is also where PayPal started, so there\u2019s a lot of good juju here. Coming back here, it reminds me of what Google felt like in those early moments. I remember running up those steps, because if you didn\u2019t get here fast enough on Saturday morning, someone in the world was going to get worse search results, and it might change their life for the worse. So you haven\u2019t joined a company or founded a company yet?We have this little lab that we\u2019re working on called Lumi Labs. In Finnish, lumi means snow, and I just love snow. I had a snowflake-themed wedding. We have some ideas in the consumer space. So I\u2019ve been meeting with different founders and just seeing what\u2019s happening in the industry.What kind of managers were Larry Page and Sergey Brin during the early days, and how did you think about developing your own management skills?Larry and Sergey just yelled at us until we became what they needed us to become, and get done what they needed to be done. And so I said, look, I\u2019m going to just rinse and repeat that, hopefully with less yelling. We ultimately brought in management coaches and all kinds of mentoring.I think you can have high expectations as a leader, and as long as they\u2019re consistent and clearly communicated, a lot of people find that really inspiring. I always knew what Larry and Sergey wanted. I knew what good looked like to them, and so I never got discouraged by them saying, \u201cWait, I don\u2019t think this is ready\u201d or \u201cI think this is overly ready.\u201d At a start-up you never really know when should you launch something. So Google built the philosophy of launching early and often. Try things out and see what works.As Google grew, how did you work to maintain a cohesive culture?There are different phases of companies. When you\u2019re in the tens of people, the idea itself either attracts people or it doesn\u2019t. People are there because they think the problem you\u2019re trying to solve is just that important.The next phase is where it\u2019s really critical and it\u2019s hard. Getting from 100 employees to 1,000, you have to be very careful. There\u2019s a strategy around compensation at that point, where you really want somebody who\u2019s coming for the right reasons. To get the people who are really aligned with the mission, you want to make sure that they\u2019re fairly compensated, but not necessarily motivated by that compensation. I had a strategy both at Yahoo and at Google of \u201cmeet, not beat.\u201d It\u2019s the trade-off between mercenaries and missionaries. And then around 1,000 people, the culture and the mission become self-reinforcing. At Google I\u2019d always ask new people, \u201cWhy did you come?\u201d When we were about 1,200 people, all of a sudden, for the first time, I actually heard the answer, \u201cI came for the culture.\u201d Why did you leave Google? I was 37, and I had been working at Google for 13 years. I had been on search for 10 of those years and just had very recently made the change over to focus on Maps as a search technology. And I was like, \u201cYou know, I\u2019m just not sure that I want to be like the 50-year-old search girl.\u201dI\u2019d always had huge respect for Yahoo as a company. When we were here in this office, we dreamed of maybe getting the Yahoo contract, maybe one day powering Yahoo search. In 1999, Yahoo was the internet. And I knew that while there were a lot of things going wrong for the board and leadership at Yahoo, there were a lot of really good people there working on the products. What was the best-case scenario for Yahoo when you took over? Returning it to the pre-eminence in its users\u2019 daily lives, where it used to be people were on Yahoo for half an hour to many hours a day. Could we get back to that type of usage? Yahoo had to deal with some nasty shareholder activist campaigns, and several readers asked about your thoughts on activism. Were there upsides, or was it more of a distraction? One of the more tragic cases of Yahoo is the Alibaba stake. Both Carl Icahn\u2019s campaign and some of the people who were part of Dan Loeb\u2019s campaign really wanted a commitment to see that stake sold. And Yahoo sold half of that stake in a $35 billion market cap for Alibaba, eroding tens of billions of dollars of upside. So certainly that was not positive. Sometimes that shortsightedness of wanting to get a return quickly can cause you to miss a much bigger gain.What would it have taken to fix Yahoo? I was playing with Magna-Tiles with my son one Sunday, and we had built this giant kind of castle complex, and it collapsed. And my son was crestfallen. I stopped, and I said: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be upset about. We built it and it worked once, and we\u2019ll just rebuild it.\u201d When I said that to him, I realized that\u2019s how I felt about Yahoo. You\u2019re rebuilding something and you know that it worked once, so it should be able to work again. With #MeToo in the news, lots of readers wanted to hear your thoughts on being a woman in Silicon Valley right now. I think it\u2019s an important set of conversations that\u2019s happening. I also want to take a longer-term view. As important as these conversations are, I hope we\u2019re able to have them in a concentrated way, fix the problems and move on from them. Because I worry about what happens to the next generation.You\u2019ve just got to keep at it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Microsoft\u2019s Cloud Has Business Booming Again", "Date": "2018-04-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMicrosoft, more than any other traditional software company, has swiftly and profitably made the shift to delivering software as an internet service.The technology giant reinforced how well it has made that transition on Thursday, when it reported strong gains in both profits and sales in its fiscal third quarter, led by the rapid growth of its cloud software business.The company\u2019s net income rose 35 percent from a year earlier, to $7.4 billion. Revenue rose 16 percent to $26.8 billion in the quarter, exceeding the Wall Street consensus forecast of nearly $25.8 billion.Microsoft\u2019s earnings per share increased 36 percent to 95 cents a share, well above the analysts\u2019 average estimate of 85 cents a share, compiled by Thomson Reuters.Since Satya Nadella became chief executive in 2014, the cloud portion of Microsoft\u2019s revenue has soared from 3 percent to more than 21 percent this year, according to estimates by Credit Suisse.Azure, the company\u2019s unit supplying cloud-based computer processing and storage, grew by 93 percent compared with the same quarter a year ago. Microsoft is now a strong No. 2, behind Amazon, in this market for the foundation layer of cloud technology. Microsoft finished 2017 with 13 percent of the cloud infrastructure services market, according to Synergy Research Group, a gain of three percentage points during the year.Microsoft\u2019s broader commercial cloud division, which includes Azure and customer and operations management software for corporations, grew by 58 percent.The cloud transition is changing the company\u2019s business model to one with a rising share of steady, recurring revenue from cloud subscriptions rather than traditional software sales. Including contributions from cloud-based versions of its Office productivity software and online gaming subscriptions, recurring revenue streams now account for about 30 percent of Microsoft\u2019s sales, said Michael Nemeroff, an analyst at Credit Suisse.That share, Mr. Nemeroff estimates, could reach more than 50 percent in four years.The successful shift to the cloud and the subscription sales model has pleased investors. Microsoft\u2019s shares have climbed roughly 40 percent in the past year. The company\u2019s share price slipped by 1 percent in after-hours trading on Thursday, after gaining 2 percent during the regular session.Not long ago, Microsoft was considered a faded power among big tech companies. Today its stock market value, while behind Apple, is neck and neck with Amazon\u2019s and slightly ahead of Google\u2019s.The personal computer software business, once Microsoft\u2019s mainstay, has been eroding for years, as people spend more of their computing time on smartphones. But personal computer shipments have held steady recently as businesses replace old PCs with new ones that use the latest Microsoft operating system, Windows 10.The Windows PC operating system business is in a division Microsoft calls \u201cmore personal computing,\u201d which grew by 13 percent. And Windows sales directly to PC makers grew by 4 percent.Advertisement"}

Even teenagers are paying attention to what they have to say.And for the first time, many privacy experts think internet users will be more willing to put up with a little more inconvenience in return for a lot more privacy.\u201cThis is the first blink of awakening of the world to a danger that\u2019s been present for a long time, which is that we are exposed,\u201d Mr. Searls said. \u201cCambridge Analytica is old, old news to privacy folks.\u201dJohn Scott-Railton, who researches digital rights and privacy at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, said he recently thought back to all the PowerPoint presentations and papers he had given and seen that cautioned about how third parties might access and abuse user data.\u201cIt didn\u2019t stick until now,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s changed, or at least people nod along when we talk about it.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re having the conversation now that we should have had over a decade ago,\u201d Ms. Singh Guliani said.But this Facebook scandal seems to be enduring even in the new frenetic news cycle.\u201cThis has kept the national attention for what: three or four weeks now?\u201d said Allie Bohm, policy counsel at Public Knowledge, a nonprofit in Washington that promotes an open internet. \u201cIt really feels like, hey, we could get some stuff done.\u201dOne reason it has always been hard to get consumers interested in security and privacy is that the harms were vague and hard to understand. With Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, the harms are identifiable and frightening, said Ashkan Soltani, an independent researcher specializing in privacy and a former chief technologist of the Federal Trade Commission.\u201cMuch like a car accident, the harms on social media are low-probablility events with extremely variable outcomes,\u201d he said. \u201c \u2018So what if my boss saw me doing a keg stand?\u2019 But all of a sudden the \u2018so what if\u2019 becomes more serious \u2014 \u2018I get denied insurance or my information is used by a nation state actor to manipulate me.\u2019 \u201dCambridge Analytica\u2019s work, which included using Facebook data to build psychological profiles of voters, tapped into an anxiety many Americans already had over the outcome of the 2016 presidential election.Privacy experts said this shift in public opinion was what they had been waiting for, because it is the only way to bring about change. Facebook will not willingly change its policies without pressure from shareholders or regulators, they added.Historically, public opinion is \u201cthe crucible\u201d for era-defining industry change, said Shoshana Zuboff, a professor at Harvard Business School and the author of a forthcoming book about tech platforms and power.\u201cIf you go back to the rapaciousness and lawlessness of Gilded Age capitalism, it was the slow burn of public opinion that gradually gathered force and ultimately became the driving force that provided cover for dramatic new legislative and regulatory efforts,\u201d she said. \u201cPublic opinion gave the Gilded Age a beginning, a middle and an end.\u201dFor Rohit Ghai, president of the cybersecurity firm RSA, whose SecurID technology has become an industry standard for companies protecting access to their internal systems, the change is evident even inside his home in San Jose, Calif.He previously tried to talk to his 13-year-old daughter about data privacy and social media \u2014 even providing examples of how much the tech companies know about people and what they can do with that information. She shrugged him off.Then the Cambridge Analytica revelations happened. For once, Mr. Ghai said, his teenager came to talk to him.\u201cShe just asked me about Mark Zuckerberg,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a sign.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Goldman\u2019s Gains in Trading Raise a Familiar Dilemma: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Tuesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 A \u2018Geneva Convention\u2019 for cyberwar?\u2022 Did Goldman\u2019s trading business perform too well?\u2022 The U.S.-China fight has pushed deeper into tech.Goldman Sachs\u2019s strong first-quarter earnings raise a familiar dilemma for the bank.The results got a significant fillip from trading, a business Goldman must do well in, but not so well that investors think the bank is too dependent on it. And a breakdown of first-quarter revenue shows the dominance of trading. Revenue from trading in stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities and derivatives totaled $4.39 billion during the first three months of the year. That works out at 44 percent of total revenue, well above the 37 percent share that trading had in 2017.Stock and bond markets are unpredictable, even in relatively good times, so the helpful trading conditions this quarter may not last. What can Goldman\u2019s senior executives do to persuade investors that the bank is a lot more than a trading shop? They can point to the fact that David M. Solomon is in line to succeed Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman\u2019s current C.E.O. Mr. Solomon ascent took place in the bank\u2019s powerful investment banking division, not its trading operations.Goldman\u2019s leaders can continue to talk about the steps the bank is taking to widen its client base and diversify into other businesses that might have more stable revenue, like its relatively new consumer lending operations. But such businesses are going to take time to make a meaningful contribution.And it\u2019s important to remember that other major businesses at Goldman are also volatile. Investing and lending, which mostly involves making longer-term investments in companies, and whose revenue can be unpredictable, made up 21 percent of total revenue in the first quarter, the second largest contribution.Despite the bumper results in trading along with investing and lending, Goldman\u2019s shares slid slightly on Tuesday, suggesting investors are waiting on longer-term trends than one quarter\u2019s results.But the volatility of revenue is not the only reason investors are often skeptical about Wall Street firms. The huge amounts that they pay out in compensation is also a concern. When revenue rises, so does pay. As a result, money that could have fallen to the bottom line at other types of companies instead gets paid out to traders and bankers. Compensation at Goldman Sachs made up 45 percent of non-interest revenue in the first quarter, up from 44 percent the first quarter of 2017.\u2014 Peter EavisHere are the numbers:The move comes amid an outcry prompted by the arrests of two African-American men at a Starbucks location in Philadelphia last week.The two men were arrested after asking to use the restroom in the shop. An employee refused their request, because the men had not bought anything, according to officials. The men sat down and were asked to leave, and an employee eventually called the police. The prosecutor\u2019s office in Philadelphia reviewed the case and declined to pursue charges against the men because of \u201ca lack of evidence that a crime was committed,\u201d according to a spokesman.Some may be optimistic that the $1.5 trillion tax cut will extend the business cycle.The strategists at Morgan Stanley are not among them.\u201cWhile there\u2019s a fair amount of debate about how much this fiscal expansion extended the economic cycle, for markets our analysis suggests we\u2019re closer to the end of the day than the beginning. Hence, there\u2019s less reason to behave like it\u2019s \u2018morning in America\u2019 than \u2018happy hour in America.\u2019\u201dKey points\u2022 Morgan Stanley argues that while the tax cuts will help lift growth in the near term, its benefits are already priced into the markets.\u2022 The new tax law creates economic cliffs, as many key provisions in the law are not permanent and end in just a few years.\u2022 The tax cuts may make it more difficult for the government to turn to fiscal stimulus to fight the next downturn.In conclusion\u201cWhile this policy supports growth in the near term, it may worsen the next downturn while limiting the fiscal reaction to it. Even if those concerns are unfounded, we think much of fiscal stimulus\u2019 \u2018good news\u2019 is already in the price of key markets.\u201dThe streaming video company added 7.41 million subscribers during the first quarter. Its profit jumped 62 percent, and sales grew 40 percent.Netflix also said it plans to spend $10 billion on content and marketing this year.Shares are up 8.6 percent Tuesday and 75 percent this year. That easily beats the S.&P. 500, which has gained just 0.2 percent this year. It also tops the performance of its fellow FANG stocks. Facebook is off 4.5 percent this year, Google-parent Alphabet is up about 3 percent, and Amazon has risen 28 percent.Stephen Ju, an analyst over at Credit Suisse, writes in a note titled \u201cGetting Closer and Closer to Achieving Escape Velocity\u201d:\u201cNetflix continues to reap the benefits of its programming win streak, as it wields its large content acquisition budget as a weapon to put greater distance between itself and its competitors (especially as Disney prepares to exit the platform). And we find it hard to argue with the accelerated pace of subscriber additions as the conceptual proof of its capital allocation decision, and we also expect the Street to continue to underwrite the investments.\u201dTwitter is having an even better day.The stock is up 87 percent over that period.The NYT\u2019s David Sanger says the impetus came largely from Microsoft\u2019s president, Brad Smith, \u201cwho has been arguing for several years that the world needs a \u2018digital Geneva Convention\u2019 that sets norms of behavior for cyberspace just as the Geneva Conventions set rules for the conduct of war in the physical world.\u201dAlso striking: Who hasn\u2019t yet signed, including Google, Apple and Amazon.More from Michael:Ms. Massenet and Mr. Brown are counting on Ms. Massenet\u2019s Net-a-Porter experience and contacts to help Imaginary Ventures stand out. The firm has already invested in companies like Glossier and Everlane, an upstart clothing brand.Mr. Ballmer said of the latest report, \u201cPublic companies owe this level of transparency to shareholders; I think citizens, as America\u2019s shareholders, deserve the same.\u201dAs more financial firms move to pressure gun makers and sellers into self-regulation, the advocacy group (backed by Mike Bloomberg) plans to ask them to press for more policy positions and operational changes.Among them: Requiring background checks for all gun sales; more funding for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; having gun makers require sellers to adopt a code of conduct; and adopting smart-gun tech.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Knowledge Gap Hinders Ability of Congress to Regulate Silicon Valley", "Date": "2018-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cI think we need to be careful,\u201d cautioned Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican. \u201cI think there are a number of different ideas, but I don\u2019t think anything has coalesced in terms of a consensus.\u201dFor the public, watching the many bursts of fireworks from Congress and the quick after-fizzle can be dizzying. But Representative Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey, the ranking Democrat on the House committee responsible for internet regulation, warned voters not to expect much.\u201cI hate to be such a pessimist, but I don\u2019t believe the Republicans will end up doing anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI just don\u2019t have any faith in their willingness to regulate to protect privacy in the context of Facebook.\u201dBeyond the typical political gridlock that has stymied action in Congress, technology and the companies that sell access to it are particularly protected.Inaction does not reflect a lack of will so much as a failure of expertise.\u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen an issue where everybody seemed to be on the same sheet of music,\u201d Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said Thursday.If Congress does not follow through with new rules for internet companies, \u201cwe\u2019ll look like a bunch of idiots,\u201d Mr. Graham added.Avoiding that dunce cap will be difficult. Lawmakers will confront Silicon Valley\u2019s powerful new lobbying establishment. Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple now hold the biggest corporate lobbying budgets in Washington and spent a combined $49.7 million in 2017 on direct lobbying, which does not include their outside lobbying trade groups, up 24 percent from the previous year. They have hired top privacy experts into their lobbying troops to defeat privacy and other internet laws.Facebook has said it would embrace some regulation, with Mr. Zuckerberg saying this week that rules for internet companies were \u201cinevitable.\u201d But he also indicated that it would have to be the \u201cright\u201d regulations, and he was not willing to commit on the spot to several ideas posed by lawmakers.The hearings spurred new momentum for the introduction of privacy laws. On Thursday, Senators Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, and John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, introduced legislation that would allow consumers to opt out of getting tracked on a site. The bill would also mandate simpler privacy policies.One new bill would restrict data collection of students using classroom technology, and another would require companies to get permission before collecting and sharing user data. That would move the United States closer to rules about to take effect next month in Europe. An earlier bill would mandate more disclosure on Facebook advertising purchases.Nevertheless, the creation of any regulations in coming months is doubtful. Most lawmakers said in the hearings that they were concerned about privacy and foreign interference on social media during the 2016 election. But several Republicans also expressed anxiety over regulations that could slow the growth of Silicon Valley, a beacon for the American economy.\u201cThese are tough ones. Privacy versus innovation versus security versus freedom \u2014 these are always tough questions,\u201d said Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona. He said he would most likely support the political ad disclosures bill but added, \u201cWhen we step in, are we always late?\u201dThis week, Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, introduced the Consent Act, which would require companies to get permission before tracking and sharing data. But even he pointed to Washington\u2019s short attention span. Companies like Facebook, he said, would try to stand in Congress\u2019s way.\u201cThey will try to make it more complex than it is,\u201d he said.\u201cThe question is timing,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal added, pointing to the difficult midterm elections in November and the desire by many legislators to do as little as possible until then. \u201cThis session, everybody says, is over as far as serious legislating is concerned.\u201dMr. Graham, who said regulations were necessary, also acknowledged the pitfalls of moving too fast.\u201cI\u2019d hate to be the senator that killed an effort to have reasonable regulation,\u201d Mr. Graham said. But, he conceded, \u201cYou really need to know what you are signing up for.\u201dBeyond the short term, the hearings may have laid the foundation for broader privacy regulations in coming years, analysts said. The most likely action to follow Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s grilling is the passage of a bill that requires financial disclosures of political advertising on social media, a law similar to broadcast television and radio political ad disclosures.Narrow regulatory ideas could gain momentum that prevent online location tracking, strengthen privacy protections for children and teens and require stronger disclosures for data breaches. But the government\u2019s light hand on Silicon Valley will continue for some time even as the European Union prepares to enact comprehensive privacy rules that limit data collection and push companies to ask permission before sharing information about users.Even if seats in the House and Senate shift after the midterm elections, any privacy laws would be at least a couple of years away, said Paul Gallant, a technology policy analyst at the Cowen Group.\u201cIf Democrats win the House in November, the chances of legislation would rise, although a likely Republican Senate would still make passage an uphill battle,\u201d Mr. Gallant said.A big problem is the lack of technological expertise in Congress, and the informational imbalance with the tech companies\u2019 lobbyists.In 2011, tech lobbyists blanketed the Senate Judiciary Committee after former Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, introduced a geolocation privacy bill.Internet firms brought in engineers and deployed their outside lobbying groups to warn lawmakers that Mr. Franken\u2019s bill was dangerous and technically flawed, said Alvaro Bedoya, a former staff member for Mr. Franken who is now the executive director of the Georgetown Center for Privacy and Technology.Another obstacle to action is a disagreement on regulatory priorities.Indeed, Mr. Graham identified a grab bag of problems that he wanted addressed with Facebook, most of which are not being addressed by any current legislative proposals.He mentioned terrorism content, Facebook\u2019s \u201cmonopoly\u201d and political bias as regulatory targets. At Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s hearings on Tuesday and Wednesday, other lawmakers brought up data breaches, foreign interference and censorship, particularly of the pro-Trump internet personalities Diamond and Silk.\u201cI want somebody to look at how they set these machines up, not just for Facebook, but other people, to make sure that the algorithms are not being politically motivated,\u201d Mr. Graham said.The lack of technological knowledge was glaring. Members mostly comprised lawyers or former business people, and many are just getting acquainted with social media, artificial intelligence, autonomous self-driving cars, drones and other technologies that they are charged to oversee.Diversity in government has become a platform issue for Brianna Wu, a former software designer who is running for the 8th House district in Massachusetts.Ms. Wu watched Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s hearings and was struck by the basic lack of knowledge members had in how the site works, such as the business model of ad-supported websites and how messaging apps like Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp works. Before the hearings, many of the members brought in technology experts from academic institutions to prepare them for Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s appearance.\u201cMost people can understand why guns are a threat,\u201d she said. \u201cWith technology, people don\u2019t understand fundamentally what the threat is. That is a threat to democracy.\u201dA photo caption with an earlier version of this article misidentified a member of the Senate attending the hearing. It was Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, not Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana.videovideoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mark Zuckerberg Testimony: Senators Question Facebook\u2019s Commitment to Privacy", "Date": "2018-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFacebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, began the first of two marathon hearings in Washington on Tuesday afternoon, answering tough questions on the company\u2019s mishandling of data.This was Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s first appearance before Congress, prompted by the revelation that Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm linked to the Trump campaign, harvested the data of an estimated 87 million Facebook users to psychologically profile voters during the 2016 election.Lawmakers grilled the 33-year-old executive on the proliferation of so-called fake news on Facebook, Russian interference during the 2016 presidential election and censorship of conservative media. Among the highlights:\u2022 Senators warned that they are skeptical that the company can regulate itself and threatened to enact privacy rules and other regulations. They said they weren\u2019t sure if they could trust a company that has repeatedly violated its privacy promises.\u2022 There were glimmers of a partisan divide: Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, asked about Facebook\u2019s handling of conservative media, including content related to Glenn Beck and a Fox News personality; Democrats probed Mr. Zuckerberg on how quickly Facebook responded to Russian meddling.\u2022 Mr. Zuckerberg, surrounded by his top legal and policy executives, appeared well-coached. He answered questions directly and without defensiveness as he tried to reiterate the mission of the social network to better connect the world.Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, zeroed in on the issue at the heart of Facebook\u2019s troubles, asking Mr. Zuckerberg whether he would be comfortable sharing the name of the hotel he stayed in last night or if he would be comfortable sharing the names of the people he has messaged this week.\u201cNo. I would probably not choose to do that publicly here,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.\u201cI think that may be what this is all about,\u201d Mr. Durbin said. \u201cYour right to privacy. The limits of your right to privacy. And how much you give away in modern America in the name of, quote, connecting people around the world.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg said Facebook would be \u201cinvestigating many apps, tens of thousands of apps, and if we find any suspicious activity, we\u2019re going to conduct a full audit of those apps to understand how they\u2019re using their data and if they\u2019re doing anything improper. If we find that they\u2019re doing anything improper, we\u2019ll ban them from Facebook and we will tell everyone affected.\u201d\u2014 Matthew RosenbergSenator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California, zeroed in on whether Facebook deceived consumers. She pressed Mr. Zuckerberg on whether the company made a decision not to inform users about the Cambridge Analytica episode when they learned in 2015 that data was sold by a researcher to the political consulting firm.\u201cI\u2019m talking about notification of users. And this relates to the issue of transparency and the issue of trust: informing users of what you know in terms of how their personal information was misused,\u201d Ms. Harris said.Mr. Zuckerberg did not admit that the company explicitly decided to withhold that information from consumers, but he said the company made a mistake in not informing users.The question was key to the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s investigation of Facebook\u2019s violation of a 2011 consent decree. If the company withheld information, which would be a deceptive act, the company could face record fines for violating its promises to the agency.The tough questions by Ms. Harris, were closely watched because she is from the San Francisco Bay Area and is seen as a rising political star within the Democratic Party.\u2014 Cecilia KangSenator Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, pressed Mr. Zuckerberg on Russia\u2019s exploitation of the platform during the 2016 presidential election.Mr. Zuckerberg admitted that the company\u2019s effort to find and stop the Russian meddling was \u201cslow,\u201d and called that failure \u201cone of my greatest regrets.\u201d He said Facebook was tracking known Russian hacking groups in real time but took much longer to recognize the inflammatory posts of the Internet Research Agency, a private company with Kremlin ties.\u201cThere are people in Russia whose job is to exploit our systems,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cThis is an arms race.\u201dBut the Facebook founder said the company deployed new artificial intelligence tools to detect malicious activity in elections in France, Italy and a special Senate race in Alabama. He said he believed the new technology would help protect the integrity of elections around the world from manipulation via Facebook.\u2014 Scott ShaneSenator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, questioned Mr. Zuckerberg over discriminatory uses of Facebook\u2019s advertising platform to target ads to users by race, and tools that law enforcement officials have reportedly used to surveil activists of color.Mr. Booker\u2019s questioning is notable given that he and Mr. Zuckerberg have a history of friendly collaboration dating back to 2010, when Mr. Zuckerberg donated $100 million to the public school system in Newark, where Mr. Booker was mayor at the time.Mr. Booker has long been seen as a tech-friendly lawmaker, and he has known Mr. Zuckerberg for longer than most lawmakers. His tough stance today is a sign of how dramatically the political winds around Facebook have shifted.Early impressions of Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony were positive. In his first appearance before Congress, he appeared confident and answered questions directly. At first he was grim-faced, looked tired and serious. But he warmed up after an hour and offered humor about the company\u2019s motto. He insisted on continuing questions when offered a break, eliciting smiles and laughter from staff sitting behind him.\u201cThis is a different Mark Zuckerberg than the Street was fearing,\u201d said Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer and head of technology research for GBH Insights in New York. \u201cIt\u2019s a defining 48 hours that will determine the future of Facebook and so far he has passed with flying colors and the Street is relieved.\u201dInvestors appeared pleased: Facebook\u2019s stock closed up nearly 4.5 percent.Not all lawmakers left appeased by Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony.\u201cI was unsatisfied,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut. \u201cMore of the apology tour,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich we have heard before.\u201dMr. Blumenthal said it was clear to him that Facebook could not and would not fully regulate itself and that Congress needed to provide a solution.\u201cThe old saying: There ought to be a law. There has to be a law. Unless there\u2019s a law, their business model is going to continue to maximize profit over privacy,\u201d he said.Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the majority whip, asked if Facebook\u2019s motto is still \u201cmove fast and break things.\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said it has been revised.\u201cI don\u2019t know when we changed it,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg replied, \u201cbut the mantra is currently \u2018move fast with stable infrastructure,\u2019 which is a much less sexy mantra.\u201d He appeared to be joking, eliciting laughs from the executives sitting behind him.Mr. Zuckerberg said that Facebook was working with Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election and potential ties to the Trump campaign.Replying to Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, Mr. Zuckerberg initially seemed to confirm that Facebook had been served with subpoenas along the way, before saying he was not certain.\u201cI want to be careful here because our work with the special counsel is confidential,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I want to make sure that in an open session I\u2019m not revealing something that\u2019s confidential.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg said he had not personally spoken with investigators from Mr. Mueller\u2019s team, but that he thought others at the company had.Mr. Zuckerberg has a history of apologizing for the company\u2019s mistakes and promising to do better. Wired Magazine recently noted that Mr. Zuckerberg has a 14-year history of apologizing. That seems to have caused some consternation on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers prodded Mr. Zuckerberg about why, exactly, they should believe his promises now.\u201cAfter more than a decade of promises to do better, how is today\u2019s apology different and why should we trust Facebook to make the necessary changes to ensure user privacy and give people a clearer picture of your privacy policies?\u201d Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, asked.Mr. Zuckerberg referred again to his company\u2019s humble beginnings in his dorm room at Harvard.\u201cSo we have made a lot of mistakes in running the company. I think it\u2019s pretty much impossible, I believe, to start a company in your dorm room and then grow it to be at the scale that we\u2019re at now without making some mistakes.\u201dMr. Thune, the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, called Facebook and its role in society \u201cextraordinary\u201d and began the hearing by explaining why Facebook is being singled out and why Mr. Zuckerberg was asked to appear alone.He said the Cambridge Analytica situation underscored how Facebook can be used for nefarious reasons, saying it appeared \u201cto be the result of people exploiting the tools you created to manipulate users\u2019 information.\u201dIn an indication that he may support legislation for internet companies, Mr. Thune said, \u201cIn the past, many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have been willing to defer to tech companies\u2019 efforts to regulate themselves. But this may be changing.\u201dSenator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, who chairs the Judiciary Committee, said the tech industry \u201chas a responsibility\u201d to protect its users and said \u201cthe status quo no longer works.\u201d\u2014 Cecilia KangThat was the accusation that Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, was leveling at Mr. Zuckerberg when he grilled him for several minutes as to why the social network has been allegedly censoring content from conservative organizations and Trump supporters.Mr. Zuckerberg declined to answer whether Facebook is a neutral public forum or if it is expressing its own views of free speech, avoiding a complex legal question that Mr. Cruz was posing.However, Mr. Zuckerberg insisted that the company does not discriminate against Republican employees and that its definition for what kind of language should be kept off the platform was rooted in common sense.\u201cI am very committed to making sure that Facebook is a platform for all ideas,\u201d he said after Mr. Cruz ticked off several examples of potential liberal bias on the social network.Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, pressed Mr. Zuckerberg on whether Facebook is a monopoly, asking him to explain what other options customers have if they get frustrated with the social network.While Mr. Graham, the South Carolina Republican, tried compare his industry to the car business, where people can switch from Ford to Chevrolet if they want, Mr. Zuckerberg insisted that in his case, it\u2019s complicated. He noted that Facebook overlaps with companies like Google and Twitter and that he faces competition from a variety of popular apps.\u201cYou don\u2019t think you have a monopoly?\u201d Mr. Graham asked.Mr. Zuckerberg replied: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel that way to me.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But it\u2019s a bit of a misnomer: he is more obsessed with crunch and pliability, lightness and heft. In other words, he is a crust man, whose years of experimentation have rendered a wild range of results, including some that are definitely pizza and others that are rather out-there interpretations.At Sapor\u00e8 Downtown, those range from crispy-chewy, almost-traditional round pies with no added yeast to his triangular, ethereally light aria di pane style and the oddball mozzarella di pane, inspired by Asian-style steamed buns. (They look like slightly smushed spheres of fresh mozzarella, hence the name.) The menu is only in Italian, but patient, bilingual servers helped my party of two plow smartly through much of the menu in two meals. We were especially enchanted with the no-added yeast \u201cPancetta\u201d pizza, which came slathered with pumpkin cream, dolloped with mozzarella, studded with pancetta cotta and topped with generous shavings of nutty, sharp asiago stravecchio. Mr. Bosco told me that he used the pumpkin cream to please the \u201cmany people\u201d who do not like tomato sauce. I love tomato sauce and didn\u2019t miss it at all here. Another winner was the \u201cTatin Cipolla\u201d in the rectangular \u201cPizzaCrunch\u201d category. (You can likely guess that style\u2019s distinguishing feature.) On top is a gloriously messy, multi-textured heap of red onion, radicchio, asiago and chopped hazelnuts. \u201cLa Classica Sempre Buona,\u201d in the aria di pane section, features burrata dripping out from under 30-month aged prosciutto as if it were melting ice cream. It is both Instagram-ready and delicious. Back to the main act: some of the more out-there creations might not be for everyone. The glistening, fatty slices of tongue topping a mozzarella di pane filled with celery-carrot cream was not my style and we didn\u2019t (dare to) try the PizzaBagels, their dough boiled in water aromatized with curry, Amarone wine or barbecue sauce. \u201cI believe very much in the importance of confrontation and exchange with cultures different from mine,\u201d Mr. Bosco said.

{"Headline": "Boys to Men: Teaching and Learning About Masculinity in an Age of Change", "Date": "2018-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat do boys in America think about being boys today?What do they imagine is expected of them? Whom do they look up to, and how are they navigating the transition from being boys to becoming men?The past 50 years have redefined what it means to be female in America. Girls today are told that they can do anything, be anyone. They\u2019ve absorbed the message: They\u2019re outperforming boys in school at every level. But it isn\u2019t just about performance. To be a girl today is to be the beneficiary of decades of conversation about the complexities of womanhood, its many forms and expressions.Boys, though, have been left behind. No commensurate movement has emerged to help them navigate toward a full expression of their gender. It\u2019s no longer enough to \u201cbe a man\u201d \u2014 we no longer even know what that means.In this unit, we explore some of the questions Mr. Black, and others, raise, and suggest ways to deconstruct definitions of masculinity as they manifest in our society and our lives. We end with suggestions for several projects students might take on to expand and reimagine what \u201cbeing a man\u201d might mean in their own lives and in our society at large.Note to teachers: This is a sensitive topic, and some of the readings, discussion questions or activities may not be suitable for your students. We hope you will tailor it to fit your needs, but we also hope you\u2019ll tell us how and why you did that, in the comments. If you are doing a larger study of gender issues, please see the links at the bottom of this post for related lesson plans, including one on the #MeToo movement, and one, contributed by a teacher, on pronoun use in schools. _________Michael Kimmel stood in front of a classroom in bluejeans and a blazer with a pen to a whiteboard. \u201cWhat does it mean,\u201d the 64-year-old sociology professor asked the group, most of them undergraduates, \u201cto be a good man?\u201dThe students looked puzzled.\u201cLet\u2019s say it was said at your funeral, \u2018He was a good man,\u2019\u201d Dr. Kimmel explained. \u201cWhat does that mean to you?\u201d\u201cCaring,\u201d a male student in the front said.\u201cPutting other\u2019s needs before yours,\u201d another young man said.\u201cHonest,\u201d a third said.Dr. Kimmel listed each term under the heading Good Man, then turned back to the group. \u201cNow,\u201d he said, \u201ctell me what it means to be a real man.\u201dThis time, the students reacted more quickly.\u201cTake charge; be authoritative,\u201d said James, a sophomore.\u201cTake risks,\u201d said Amanda, a sociology graduate student.\u201cIt means suppressing any kind of weakness,\u201d another offered.\u201cI think for me being a real man meant talk like a man,\u201d said a young man who\u2019d grown up in Turkey. \u201cWalk like a man. Never cry.\u201dDr. Kimmel had been taking notes. \u201cNow you\u2019re in the wheelhouse,\u201d he said, excitedly. He pointed to the Good Man list on the left side of the board, then to the Real Man list he\u2019d added to the right. \u201cLook at the disparity. I think American men are confused about what it means to be a man.\u201dTry a similar warm-up activity with your students to get them thinking about the messages they receive from society about what it means to be a man.Then, allow them to take a few minutes to analyze what they see in the two columns and discuss:Next, we recommend you take a moment to have students write anonymously about and then, perhaps, discuss this question:\u2022 Why might this be a challenging issue to talk about in school?Based on what students say, you and the class may set up discussion protocols for this unit.Like Dr. Kimmel\u2019s students, yours will most likely realize that the messages boys get from society about manhood are confusing. They may also begin to see the ways in which this confusion impacts not just the personal lives of boys and men, but also their relationships, their work and the rest of the world. The rest of this unit seeks to help them delve more deeply into the questions this warm-up may raise._________Gender and MasculinityFirst, share a few important definitions with your students:\u201cToxic Masculinity\u201d: Toxic masculinity is a narrow and repressive description of manhood, designating manhood as defined by violence, sex, status and aggression. It\u2019s the cultural ideal of manliness, where strength is everything while emotions are a weakness; where sex and brutality are yardsticks by which men are measured, while supposedly \u201cfeminine\u201d traits \u2014 which can range from emotional vulnerability to simply not being hypersexual \u2014 are the means by which your status as \u201cman\u201d can be taken away.It is crucial, however, that students understand some key ideas:Ask students if they can think of any other characteristics, examples or nonexamples of what it means to be a man according to this model of masculinity \u2014 such as those they came up with during the warm-up \u2014 and add them to the Frayer model.Then, discuss:Then, allow students to do their own personal reflection in a silent writing activity. You might ask:_________Below, we list several categories \u2014 families, school, politics, sports, fraternities, media, relationships and the workplace \u2014 and suggest a few articles and Op-Eds students might read to think about the messages about masculinity that pervade each. These, however, are just a starting point, and we hope you\u2019ll use the comments section to round out our lists with other readings, from within and outside The Times.Your students might go through the following sequence:1. Read and annotate.2. Jigsaw.\u2022 What passages, examples or lines from what you read stood out in light of our study of masculinity? Why?\u2022 How do you think the expressions of masculinity you read about seem to affect the people in the piece? How do you think they affect our society as a whole? Why?\u2022 What personal connections did you make to the piece you read? 3. Collect cultural messages about masculinity from their daily lives. After students have read and discussed these pieces, assign them to collect messages about masculinity \u2014 positive or negative \u2014 that they come across in their daily lives, whether on television or in advertising, the news media, video games, movies, books, music or anywhere else.Students might then mount a gallery of what they find, with their commentary, to prepare for the final phase of this unit in which they do projects that imagine a more expansive view of masculinity for the future.Article ListBoys at HomeA Disadvantaged Start Hurts Boys More Than GirlsWhat Our Sons Are Learning From Donald TrumpTalking to Boys the Way We Talk to GirlsGrowing Up Male: Schools, Bullying and the \u201cPunishing Reach of Racism\u201d for Black Boys in ParticularThe Boys Have Fallen BehindClosing the Math Gap for BoysThe Success of All-Male SchoolsFathers\u2019 Sons and Brothers\u2019 KeepersRoom for Debate: The Assumptions Behind Obama\u2019s Initiative \u201cMy Brother\u2019s Keeper\u201dFraternities, Sports and the MilitaryWhat a Fraternity Hazing Death Revealed About the Painful Search for an Asian-American IdentityThe Boys in the ClubhouseA Wrestling Culture That Helps Keep Boys Away From FightingThe Perils of Mixing Masculinity and MissilesMedia and ArtsSuper Mario Run\u2019s Not-So-Super Gender PoliticsDoes Gay Hollywood Have Room for Queer Kids?In Country Music, Nice Guys Finish First (for Now)Ad Campaigns Tag Along as Men Embrace Different PathsA Poet\u2019s Boyhood at the Burning CrossroadsAs Strongmen Steamroll Their Opponents, U.S. Is SilentWhat Donald Trump Thinks It Takes to Be a ManMen in the WorkplaceMen and Women Say They\u2019re More Different Than SimilarSteinem, Sandberg and Judd on How to End Sex HarassmentThe #MeToo Moment: I\u2019m a Straight Man. Now What?Dear Men: It\u2019s You, TooThis Is a Man Problem_________22 PhotosIn this unit so far, students have mostly been investigating how messages about masculinity manifest in our culture. Now is their opportunity to redefine what it means for them, and for the future generations of boys and men. In this summative activity, students look at alternative views of masculinity and create a project that demonstrates what it means to \u201cbe a man\u201d in today\u2019s world.So, what can a new model of masculinity look like? How can it be more expansive and inclusive of all the different ways there are to be a boy or man?Have your students read this article, as well as one or more of the articles below for inspiration for a new model of masculinity. Allow them to identify, discuss and write about the aspects of a positive masculine identity that resonate with them most:Teaching Men to Be Emotionally HonestHow to Help Kids Disrupt \u2018Bro Culture\u2019The Power of Touch, Especially for MenSome Boys Ask, \u2018What\u2019s a Barber Mom?\u2019Letters| A New Model of MasculinityTalking to Boys the Way We Talk to Girls Americans Might No Longer Prefer Sons Over DaughtersReal Men Get Rejected, TooAllowing Teenage Boys to Love Their FriendsHow would each of your students define manhood now?Finally, let them choose one of the following projects, or come up with their own, to express what they think it means to \u201cbe a man.\u201d Then, you might hold an exhibition for students to showcase their projects and experience all the many ways there are to be a man in today\u2019s world._________Lesson Plans:The Reckoning: Teaching About the #MeToo Moment and Sexual Harassment With Resources From The New York TimesNo Pride in Prejudice: Looking Beyond the Gender Labels to Experience Literature\u2018A Troubling Trend\u2019: Discussing Bullying and Antigay AttitudesText to Text | \u2018Lord of the Flies\u2019 and \u2018A Fight Club for Flies\u2019Reader Idea | Creating an Inclusive Classroom by Offering Pronoun ChoiceWriting Prompts:Do Parents Have Different Hopes and Standards for Their Sons Than for Their Daughters?How Do Male and Female Roles Differ in Your Family?Is School Designed More for Girls Than Boys?Why Do Boys Lag Behind Girls in Reading?Does Separating Boys and Girls Help Students Perform Better in School?What Does It Mean to Be \u2018a Real Man\u2019?Do We Need to Teach Boys and Men to Be More Emotionally Honest?Is It O.K. for Men and Boys to Comment on Women and Girls on the Street?What Is Your Reaction to the #MeToo Movement?Now That Women Can Serve in All Combat Roles in the U.S. Military, Should They Also Be Required to Register for the Draft?Should Sports Be Coed?Should the Boy Scouts Be Coed?Do You Believe in Equal Rights for Women and Men?Do We Need New Ways to Identify Gender and Sexuality?Should There Be More Boy Dolls?Can a Boy Wear a Skirt to School?Do Boys Have Less Intense Friendships Than Girls?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ordering Five Million Deaths Online", "Date": "2018-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDr.\u00a0Friedman is a contributing opinion writer and the director of the psychopharmacology clinic at the Weill Cornell Medical College.Recently, out of curiosity, I typed into Google the terms \u201csynthetic opioid and Chinese pharmacy.\u201d Within minutes, I found a website where I could purchase the synthetic opioid carfentanil. For just $750, I could buy 100 grams of the drug, which would be shipped to me \u201covernight by discreet courier.\u201dCarfentanil is 100 times more potent than fentanyl, another synthetic opioid that has already hit the streets, and 10,000 times more powerful than morphine. This drug is typically used to sedate large animals, like elephants. It is so dangerous that when veterinarians administer it, they wear gloves and face masks to avoid exposure.It will be hard, if not impossible, to shut down the supply, but we have to try.On the demand side, we can do things to try to prevent addiction. But the new Medicare guidelines, which cover disabled individuals and those 65 and older, would only make things worse.They would deny coverage to any patient taking more than 90 milligrams of morphine or the pharmacologic equivalent daily for more than seven days, except for those with cancer or in hospice (an exemption from this guideline is possible but burdensome). The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimate that some 1.6 million Medicare beneficiaries are prescribed opioids that meet or exceed this arbitrary threshold, so the change, if it goes into effect as planned next January, will suddenly put a very large number of people at risk of severe opioid withdrawal and the return of pain and suffering. This could well drive many of them to synthetic opioids.Instead, we need a rational drug policy both to rein in the excessive prescribing of opioids and to help the people who are already dependent on them.First, we need a national prescription database. The state-level databases that we have now are not enough. They allow clinicians to identify patients who \u201cdoctor shop\u201d and are high consumers of opioids, but patients can still fill their prescriptions in nearby states, and no one is the wiser.We also have to deal with doctors who contribute to the epidemic. The Drug Enforcement Administration, using that national prescription database, should identify clinicians, particularly those who aren\u2019t pain specialists, who are outliers in their opioid prescribing patterns, review their treatments and clamp down on inappropriate and excessive prescribing.This is tricky; we do not want to discourage doctors from adequately treating pain out of fear of legal sanction. But those who adhere to current standards of care should have little to fear.Finally, reasonable drug policy has to take account of the fact that opioid-dependent individuals have different levels of tolerance, which means there cannot be a one-size-fits-all guideline, like the Medicare proposal, to limit prescribing.To be sure, there is solid evidence that nonopioid treatments are safer and just as effective as opioids for certain types of chronic pain \u2014 and it\u2019s critical that we improve pain education for all health care professionals so this becomes common knowledge.But for those who are dependent on opioids, doctors must have the ability to adjust treatment to the neurobiological and clinical reality. The fact is that an opioid-dependent brain requires considerable time to adapt to any change in treatment.Any opioid policy that ignores this will not just throw an untold number of people into withdrawal and misery; it could well unleash a synthetic opioid epidemic of staggering lethality.Richard A. Friedman is a professor of clinical psychiatry and the director of the psychopharmacology clinic at the Weill Cornell Medical College, and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

In 2007 and 2009, he was convicted of residential burglary.The government sought to deport him on the theory that he had committed an \u201caggravated felony,\u201d which the immigration law defined to include any offense \u201cthat, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\u201dShe quoted at length from Justice Scalia\u2019s majority opinion in Johnson, which said courts could not tell which crimes Congress had meant to punish.\u201cWe can as well repeat here what we asked in Johnson,\u201d Justice Kagan wrote, paraphrasing Justice Scalia. \u201cHow does one go about divining the conduct entailed in a crime\u2019s ordinary case? Statistical analyses? Surveys? Experts? Google? Gut instinct?\u201dShe added that lower courts had been unable to apply the immigration law consistently.\u201cDoes car burglary qualify as a violent felony?\u201d she asked. \u201cSome courts say yes, another says no. What of statutory rape? Once again, the circuits part ways. How about evading arrest? The decisions point in different directions. Residential trespass? The same is true.\u201dJustices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor joined all of Justice Kagan\u2019s opinion, and Justice Gorsuch most of it.Both laws, the government said then, required courts to identify features of a hypothetical typical offense and then to judge the risk of violence arising from them.But when Mr. Dimaya\u2019s case reached the Supreme Court, the government said there were significant differences between the two laws, focusing on minor variations in their wording. In dissent, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., joined by Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr., made a similar point.Justice Kagan responded that some of Chief Justice Roberts\u2019s analysis was \u201cslicing the baloney mighty thin.\u201dThe government also argued that the two laws should be treated differently because one concerned crimes and the other immigration, which is a civil matter.Justice Kagan disagreed. \u201cThis court\u2019s precedent forecloses that argument,\u201d she wrote, \u201cbecause we long ago held that the most exacting vagueness standard should apply in removal cases.\u201dJustice Kagan said it was time to heed that advice. \u201cWe abandoned that lunatic practice in Johnson,\u201d she wrote, \u201cand see no reason to start it again.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How a Genealogy Site Led to the Front Door of the Golden State Killer Suspect", "Date": "2018-04-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut it was technology that got him. The suspect, Joseph James DeAngelo, 72, was arrested by the police on Tuesday. Investigators accuse him of committing more than 50 rapes and 12 murders over decades.Investigators used DNA from crime scenes that had been stored all these years and plugged the genetic profile of the suspected assailant into an online genealogy database. One such service, GEDmatch, said in a statement on Friday that law enforcement officials had used its database to crack the case. Officers found distant relatives of Mr. DeAngelo\u2019s and, despite his years of eluding the authorities, traced their DNA to his front door.\u201cWe found a person that was the right age and lived in this area \u2014 and that was Mr. DeAngelo,\u201d said Steve Grippi, the assistant chief in the Sacramento district attorney\u2019s office.Investigators then obtained what Anne Marie Schubert, the Sacramento district attorney, called \u201cabandoned\u201d DNA samples from Mr. DeAngelo. \u201cYou leave your DNA in a place that is a public domain,\u201d she said.The test result confirmed the match to more than 10 murders in California. Ms. Schubert\u2019s office then obtained a second sample and came back with the same positive result, matching the full DNA profile.Those who had investigated the case for years in vain were ecstatic by the sudden breakthrough. \u201cHe was totally off the radar till just a week ago, and it was a lead they got, somehow they got information and through checking family or descendants \u2014 it was pretty complicated the way they did it \u2014 they were able to get him on the radar,\u201d said Ray Biondi, 81, who was the lieutenant in charge of the homicide bureau of the Sacramento County Sheriff\u2019s Department during the crime spree.The big players in commercial DNA testing \u2014 including 23andMe and AncestryDNA \u2014 extract genetic profiles from the saliva that customers send to the company in a tube by mail. It would not be easy for law enforcement to upload a profile to one of those sites. Over the past few years, numerous smaller genealogical websites have emerged, however, giving customers more avenues to upload a DNA profile and search for relatives.If law enforcement located the suspect through a genealogy site, it could raise ethical issues, particularly if individuals did not consent to having their genetic profiles searched against crime scene evidence. GEDmatch said in its statement that it had warned those who used its site that the genetic information could be used for other purposes. \u201cIf you are concerned about non-geneatological uses of your DNA, you should not upload your DNA to the database and/or you should remove DNA that has already been uploaded,\u201d the statement said.The Golden State Killer, also known as the East Area Rapist, tormented his victims with sadistic rituals. Some he shot and killed with a firearm. Others were bludgeoned to death with whatever he could find \u2014 in one case a piece of firewood. He had many trademarks: He wore a mask, he bound his victims\u2019 hands. He started by raping single women and then went on to raping married women with their husbands present, before killing them both.Among the numerous serial killers who stalked America in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s \u2014 the Zodiac Killer, the Son of Sam, to name two \u2014 the Golden State Killer was among the most notorious.[Read about how it felt to live through the Golden State Killer.]Ms. Schubert has been central to the efforts to find the killer. Her childhood in the Sacramento suburb of Arden-Arcade, just miles from where the suspect prowled through houses and raped women, was marked by the terror of wondering if she or people she knew might be next.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a matter of if he was coming, it was when,\u201d Ms. Schubert said. Her parents were \u201cnot gun people,\u201d she said, but her father bought a firearm. Her mother kept an ice pick under her pillow when she slept.Monica Miller, who was in charge of the Sacramento F.B.I. field office from 2013 to 2017, said that when she retired, the case of the Golden State Killer was cold. She said that Ms. Schubert, \u201cwas central in leading this, convincing people this was worth pursuing.\u201d For the people of Sacramento, she added, \u201cit was almost an open wound. People would still talk about it. He was a phantom or a ghost in people\u2019s minds.\u201dIn her career as a district attorney, Ms. Schubert championed DNA technology and taught courses about cold cases, creating a unit in the Sacramento district attorney\u2019s office to pursue them. Eighteen years ago she reached out to an investigator from Contra Costa County who specialized in the East Area Rapist, beginning a collaboration to re-energize the case.Two years ago she convened a task force on the 40th anniversary of the attacks in the Sacramento suburbs. It was the work of that group \u2014 a collaboration with counties in Southern California, the San Francisco Bay Area and the F.B.I. \u2014 that helped solve the case, Ms. Schubert said.Many questions remain about the suspect. Did his family or his former colleagues have hints about his grisly past? Why did he appear to stop his spree of rapes and murders in 1986? Did he leverage his job as a police officer to elude detection?All of these questions swirled in conversations among residents of Citrus Heights, Mr. DeAngelo\u2019s neighborhood. They awoke on Wednesday shocked to find that their neighbor, a man who liked to tinker with his motorcycle in front of his neat beige stucco house, had been accused of being one of America\u2019s most notorious serial rapists.\u201cIt\u2019s crazy \u2014 they were looking for this guy for 40 years and he was right here under our noses,\u201d said Ashley Piorun, who lives five houses down from Mr. DeAngelo. \u201cWe were shellshocked to find out.\u201dThis suburban neighborhood of well-kept homes, northeast of Sacramento, is a classic California housing tract of looping cul-de-sacs and towering palm trees. Ms. Piorun calls it a \u201cquiet, sweet, boring neighborhood.\u201dPaul Sanchietti, another neighbor, said he had taken an interest in the case six months ago and combed through the Wikipedia entry that listed all of the grisly and sadistic crimes the Golden State Killer was accused of committing.\u201cHere I was looking up the guy on Wikipedia and he was five doors down,\u201d Mr. Sanchietti said of Mr. DeAngelo.From the outside, the house seemed meticulously maintained. The roof is new, the garden hose is perfectly coiled, the landscaping of sod, wood chips and decorative rocks is neat.Mr. Sanchietti said he had nothing more than polite interactions with Mr. DeAngelo over the past two decades, but like other neighbors, he remembered Mr. DeAngelo as having a temper.\u201cHe would get volatile,\u201d Mr. Sanchietti said. \u201cHe would be out here tending to his car and he would get very angry. There were a lot of four letter words.\u201d\u201cEvery neighborhood has some strange little dude,\u201d Mr. Sanchietti said. \u201cBut for him to be a serial murderer and rapist \u2014 that never crossed my mind.\u201dRichard A.

{"Headline": "What It Was Like to Finally Write My Will", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAll that money, and one of the greatest performers I ever saw onstage didn\u2019t spend a little of it on sorting out his estate? It amazes me.Death is inevitable, but we continue to make long-term bets: My wife, Jeanne, and I might have enough economy-size jugs of Tide and gigantic packages of toilet paper rolls, bought on regular trips to Costco, to survive into the next century.Still, preparing for an eventual demise \u2014 at least by drawing up a will \u2014 is a good idea. A will smooths the way for your heirs to inherit whatever you\u2019re going to give them, saving time and money. Wills can also help you avoid tax pitfalls and feuding heirs. (Remember: The conflict at the heart of Dickens\u2019s \u201cBleak House\u201d is a generations-long lawsuit over an inheritance. No spoilers, but the case did not end well for anyone involved, over several generations, except the lawyers.)Wills provide control over more than money. For people whose children are still minors, the will names guardians. If you haven\u2019t written these decisions down, the government will make money and custodial decisions itself. You\u2019ll be beyond caring by then, but why not do what you can ahead of time to see that the assets get distributed as you\u2019d like?Despite all these very good reasons, I didn\u2019t have a will until just a year and a half ago, when I dedicated myself to taking care of all of the financial matters I\u2019d let slip for, well, decades. We don\u2019t have a Warren Buffett\u2014sized fortune to bestow on the kids, but a house and 401(k) accounts add up to something. Still, we had put it off, like everything else that involved thinking about money and death.So! Let\u2019s talk about writing a will.If your financial life is more complicated \u2014 owning a business, say, or having a child who might need a trust \u2014 hiring a lawyer is the way to go. A lawyer can help explain the benefits of having things like a \u201cdynasty trust,\u201d which sounds like it would only be for rich people but which can help protect an inheritance from being lost in a divorce.Jeanne and I decided to hire an attorney, and after consulting with friends and my chief legal adviser (i.e., Google), we eventually landed on a guy in town called Nathan Arnell. A friend had told me in an email, \u201cI have zero standard of comparison and have no idea if his fee was high, low or average, but he\u2019s a nice guy and seemed fine.\u201dI\u2019m not big on extreme vetting. He\u2019s the one I called.\u201cHow can I help you?\u201d he asked.I told him we needed a will. \u201cThat\u2019s a good thing,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause that\u2019s what I do.\u201dWe got an appointment and Mr. Arnell said he would provide the will and our advance directives (our medical wishes if we\u2019re incapacitated) as part of a package. The process, he said, could cost as much as $3,000 if we had a lot of changes or complications, but would be much less if things were straightforward. He could make the document flexible enough to serve for some time but easy to change if need be \u2014 which would increase costs.\u201cYou can make a new one every single day,\u201d he said. \u201cGood for me, not so good for you.\u201dFor most people, that\u2019s overkill; experts say it\u2019s good to revisit the will every five years to adapt it to changing circumstances, but most people shouldn\u2019t have to change it more often than that.We talked for a bit about the tax implications of our deaths \u2014 that the federal estate tax affects only people with millions of dollars\u2019 worth of assets. We\u2019d have to have combined assets worth millions of dollars to be affected, he said. (Currently, it\u2019s about $22 million for couples.) This affects less than 0.2 percent of people in the United States.Mr. Arnell also laid out the scenarios that cause wills to become complex and fractious, like multiple marriages, blended families with stepchildren from those various marriages, families in conflict, and more.\u201cWe\u2019ve only been married to each other,\u201d Jeanne told him. \u201cAll of our children are our children. And we all get along.\u201dYou could see his shoulders relax. He then asked what our assets might be: house, 401(k), life insurance. He would include clauses giving the surviving spouse lots of flexibility in planning how to get the money and to do tax planning around the inheritance. We told him about setting up a trust for our younger son, who deals with depression. It would be administered by his big sister.\u201cThat\u2019s why I was asking whether they get along,\u201d he said and discussed setting up a system that would allow our son to get 5 percent of his share every year. He told us to make sure to talk to our daughter to ensure she was willing to take on the responsibility. (She was.)For many people, especially dual-income couples with no kids who might have substantial assets to spread around, this is the moment to discuss charitable bequests. Whether it\u2019s gifts to charities, hospitals, political parties, religious organizations, your alma mater or other organizations, the choices you make with a portion of your assets now can make a difference in the world when the time comes.We then moved on to the advance directive and power of attorney, which is the ability of a person designated by us to make decisions for us if we become incapacitated. Our attorney advised us to think hard about giving medical power of attorney to one of the kids. (We also got a living will.)\u201cIf you don\u2019t think she could pull the plug, then she\u2019s not the right person,\u201d he said.He then gave us homework: tracking down our pensions, insurance policies, retirement accounts and anything else that will pass to heirs when we die. We would need to make sure that the beneficiaries named in all those documents lined up with what we were putting into the will. In most cases, the contract terms of the beneficiary statements will control what happens.We left. Jeanne and I walked over to a nearby Starbucks for a break.\u201cThat was really depressing,\u201d she said.\u201cContemplating mortality?\u201d I asked.She looked at me. \u201cDeath! Death! Death!\u201dA few weeks later, Mr. Arnell sent a stack of digital documents: a will for me and for Jeanne; a durable power of attorney for each of us; and a living will/health care directives. The wills were 41 pages apiece; the other documents came to a dozen pages more for each of us. Dry stuff, though he included a readable summary.We went back to his office, briefly discussed the provisions of the wills and signed them. A short time after that, we got the final bill: a little less than $2,000. We left a copy of the documents at his office, so it would be easy to find in case we both died suddenly. The point is to keep the paperwork somewhere the family will be able to find it, such as a safe deposit box or a good fireproof safe, or with a trusted relative \u2014 and make sure that people know where to find it.Now we have wills. One more worry is gone, or maybe it was a source of guilt. Or maybe it was just a nagging thought. I won\u2019t be happy to die, but I won\u2019t be tormented over leaving that particular loose end undone.There\u2019s something to be said for that.An earlier version of this article misstated the asset value of the federal estate tax exemption for couples. It is about $22 million, not $11 million. (Under the new tax law, it doubled.) The article also misstated what percentage of Americans are subject to the federal estate tax. It is less than 0.2 percent, not 4 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "James Comey Opens Up About Ego, Distrust and More", "Date": "2018-04-20", "News": "The former F.B.I. director was interviewed for \u201cThe Daily\u201d podcast. Here are five takeaways from the conversation.Supported byHere are five takeaways from the interview.It seemed like his decision to itemize his own shortcomings before recounting his role in the investigation of Hillary Clinton and Mr. Trump over the past two years might be an acknowledgment that those flaws help explain his conduct. But Mr. Comey quickly rejected the idea that his ego had played a role in how he managed the investigation into Mr. Trump. He conceded, instead, that it might have influenced how he treated the inquiry into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s private email server \u2014 in particular his unusual news conference, in July 2016, condemning how she had handled classified government emails as \u201cextremely careless.\u201d It was his own children, he said, who had told him that the news conference was flawed, because he dwelled for so long on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s misdeeds, before finally \u2014 and suspensefully \u2014 announcing he would not charge her with any crime. They called that delayed delivery of the most important information \u201cSeacresting.\u201d In their mind, he had acted like Ryan Seacrest, as host of \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d seemingly prepared to announce a singer\u2019s elimination or victory, but first taking a long, unwanted commercial break. \u201cI think that criticism is actually valid,\u201d he told me. \u201cThe reason I associate it with ego is I think I thought I knew the right way to do it and in hindsight,\u201d he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think I did.\u201d\u201cI knew I was communicating with someone who might not tell the truth about it if it ever became an issue,\u201d Mr. Comey said. From that point on, Mr. Comey decided to document his one-on-one interactions with the new president in case there was ever any question about what had transpired during such sessions. \u201cNormally I wasn\u2019t even much of a note taker,\u201d he said. \u201cBut here I thought given those factors that I would need a detailed account in the event I need to draw on it in the future.\u201d Which, of course, is exactly what happened. I asked Mr. Comey why, after his firing in May 2017, he had deliberately shared the contents of one of his memos with a reporter, in the hopes of producing news coverage that would alarm the public about Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct and therefore prompt the appointment of a special counsel. In his mind, Mr. Sessions would soon be recused from the Russia investigation, rendering him ineffectual, and Mr. Rosenstein had shown himself to be untrustworthy because of his role in firing Mr. Comey. It was Mr. Rosenstein who had written a memo to the president laying out the reasons Mr. Comey should be fired. \u201cI did not have confidence that it would be done in the right way,\u201d Mr. Comey said. \u201cMy plan was to stay,\u201d Mr. Comey told me, when I asked if he wished he were still the director of the F.B.I. He might have eventually been fired over a different clash with Mr. Trump, he said. But as attacks on the F.B.I. have mounted, including from the president, Mr. Comey said, his desire to protect the agency has grown. These days, he said, he tries to read about 20 pieces of mail a day from current and former F.B.I. agents, who write to him about their experience. \u201cI could only read them about 20 at a time before I got a pain in my chest from their sadness and my sadness of not being with them,\u201d he said. \u201cReading about their grief, which reflects my grief, is the hardest part.\u201dDuring his book tour, Mr. Comey has described Mr. Trump as morally unfit for the office of the presidency \u2014 a profoundly damning judgment from a former director of the F.B.I. I wondered whether Mr. Comey feared that his comments risked further politicizing the bureau at a time when it is the subject of intense scrutiny. \u201cI worry a little bit,\u201d he said. But his goal, he said, is to prompt a conversation that will ultimately benefit the F.B.I. and the country. I asked what, exactly, that conversation is. \u201cMost broadly,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019d like to have a conversation about what are the values at the core of this country and about our expectations that our leaders reflect those values? And encourage people to rise above their partisan passions, their policy passions and realize that without that collection of values and without leaders who are tethered to those values and held accountable by us to those values, we\u2019re lost.\u201d If you don\u2019t see an audio player on this page or to subscribe to The Daily for free, follow the instructions below.From your mobile device:From a desktop or laptop:Click the \u201cplay\u201d button above to start the show.

{"Headline": "Can Facebook Develop a Conscience?", "Date": "2018-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMr. Cohen is the author of \u201cThe Know-It-Alls: The Rise of Silicon Valley as a Political Powerhouse and Social Wrecking Ball.\u201dThat the questioning of Mark Zuckerberg on Tuesday by two full Senate committees was considered a triumph for Mr. Zuckerberg \u2014 he made $3 billion personally as Facebook stock shot up during his testimony \u2014 shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. This was an unfair fight between a man who knew intimately the project being debated and a lot of people who didn\u2019t.The occasion for his Senate hearing, and his appearance in the House on Wednesday, was a data breach that allowed a British political consulting firm working for the Trump campaign to gain access to 87 million Facebook profiles, but as the questioning unfolded Mr. Zuckerberg behaved as if he were the only competent one in the room.When Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, asked, \u201cWould you agree that users should be able to access all of their information?\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg seemed confused: \u201cSenator, we have already a \u2018download your information\u2019 tool that allows people to see and to take out all of the information that Facebook \u2014 that they\u2019ve put into Facebook or that Facebook knows about them. So, yes, I agree with that. We already have that.\u201dSimilarly, when Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, asked, \u201cAre you going to go back to work on giving me a greater right to erase my data?\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg again appeared perplexed, saying, \u201cSenator, you can already delete all the data that\u2019s there.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg has been winning these unfair fights going on 15 years now. The idea that he\u2019s the Computer Guy and we are the helpless office workers in his way exemplifies the attitude of Facebook and Silicon Valley more broadly.The allegation that Mr. Zuckerberg stole the idea was fought in court and ended in a settlement that netted the Winklevosses and Mr. Narenda cash and company stock worth tens of millions of dollars. Mr. Zuckerberg plowed ahead under a new paradigm, later defined by Matt Welsh, Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s computer science professor at Harvard, as \u201cNerds win.\u201dIn the past, Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s talents could only be a tool for richer and better-connected peers like the Winklevosses, who would provide the money and define the purpose of the project. By the mid-2000s, however, Mr. Zuckerberg could turn the tables.At the time of the talk, Mr. Zuckerberg estimated that Google had 250 million page views a day, with thousands of machines and 5,000 employees, while Facebook had significantly more page views (400 million), hundreds of machines and just barely 50 employees.By then, Larry Page and Sergey Brin had already given up control of Google as the price for venture capital to keep the project running, agreeing to an outside chief executive, as investors had insisted. To this day, Mr. Zuckerberg retains majority control over Facebook and remains its chief executive \u2014 his decisions about regulation, privacy and transparency can mean happiness or misery for the more than two billion citizens of Facebook nation \u2014 majestic powers that are enshrined when you check the right box on the terms of service agreement.Peter Thiel, the first outside investor in Facebook and a longtime adviser to Mr. Zuckerberg, sees a founder-led tech start-up as something like an independent cell that can help drive social change. \u201cA start-up,\u201d he writes in his book, \u201cZero to One,\u201d \u201cis the largest endeavor over which you can have definite mastery. You can have agency not just over your own life, but over a small and important part of the world.\u201dIn these extraordinary times, we are learning how society changes when it is in the hands of power-drunk engineers. Products and services are delivered much more reliably and efficiently. We are able to communicate quickly, directly, widely. But there are serious problems, too, and they are far more serious than even critics realized at first.To start, these Silicon Valley titans are in denial about history. They pride themselves on not bending to what has come before. Is there racism and sexism in the United States? Didn\u2019t happen on my watch! Computers don\u2019t see sex or color. When pressed by the few senators of color about Facebook\u2019s complicity in running real estate ads aimed exclusively at white people, which would violate the Fair Housing Act, Mr. Zuckerberg defined this as a particularly compelling challenge for artificial intelligence software.Ads can no longer be explicitly targeted to racial groups, he said, though, of course, the rub is that there are plenty of surrogates for race that advertisers can presumably still use. This led to the absurd observation from Mr. Zuckerberg, in response to a question from Senator Mazie Hirono, Democrat of Hawaii, that \u201cmost of the enforcement today is still that our community flags issues for us when that comes up.\u201d How the community can identify when a real estate ad is appearing only to white people remains a mystery.Notably, there was no declaration from Mr. Zuckerberg about the pain of racial inequality, nor an apology for Facebook\u2019s role in perpetuating it. To Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, he simply said, \u201cI\u2019m not happy with where we are.\u201d There is an unhealthy detachment \u2014 a virtualness \u2014 to the destruction caused by Silicon Valley innovations. One can\u2019t help thinking that the ability to reset or reboot a computer has infiltrated companies\u2019 calculations about the cost of disruption and destruction.Despite the length of Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s Senate appearance, there was no serious reckoning with what happened in the 2016 election. Instead, there was an insistent focus on the future, which for Mr. Zuckerberg was synonymous with one phrase, \u201cA.I.\u201d In five to 10 years, he promised, artificial intelligence will clean up the mess that is Facebook in 2018.The problems with Facebook emerge from its lack of a human touch, but Mr. Zuckerberg doubles down on software. On Wednesday, Representative David McKinley, a West Virginia Republican, displayed recent Facebook ads offering opioids for sale without a prescription and addressed Mr. Zuckerberg directly. \u201cFacebook is actually enabling an illegal activity, and in so doing you are hurting people,\u201d he said. \u201cWould you agree with that statement?\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s response was to concede things were bad but to hold out the promise of the future. \u201cWe need to build more A.I. tools that can proactively find that content,\u201d he said.As long as the discussion was about software \u2014 how it works, how it can be improved, how users interact with it \u2014 Mr. Zuckerberg holds the upper hand. When the discussion is about values, he is as confused as the rest of us, and takes refuge in the belief that society is nothing more than a series of market-based online interactions, as captured, absorbed and understood by engineers.Government regulation, in this scheme, is a product of a corrupt, inefficient political system; self-regulation, on the other hand, is a product of people voting with their actions and brilliant engineers devising solutions to meet their needs. A smug interpretation that Mr. Zuckerberg outwitted dopey legislators only plays into the Silicon Valley view that being called before Congress to answer questions is a bug of our democracy, instead of a vital feature.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where to Find Bangkok\u2019s Best Street Food While You Can", "Date": "2018-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPursuitsWill the city ban its famed street food offerings? It\u2019s unclear. In the meantime, a quest to find the best fishball noodle stands and much more. It was a few minutes after 6 p.m., and Lim Lao Sa, a fishball noodle stand tucked into an alleyway near the Chao Phraya River in Bangkok, had just opened. Rain was falling, hard. A series of deftly arranged tarps sheltered patrons sitting on red plastic stools at a handful of tables. Water drizzled off the tarp edges, down the concrete walls and past exposed wiring. Fluorescent bulbs cast harsh shadows. Lim Lao Sa\u2019s owners \u2014 a brother and sister who\u2019d inherited the 60-year-old business from their father \u2014 bickered vigorously. In fact, given all of this \u2014 the setting, the food, the feeling that Lim Lao Sa could be washed away in an instant, by a bad mood or even worse weather \u2014 I decided that Lim Lao Sa was the platonic ideal of street food. And it was precisely why I\u2019d come to Bangkok. I wasn\u2019t going to take a chance. If Bangkok\u2019s ad hoc restaurants were threatened \u2014 not only by clean-sidewalk-loving governments but, just as seriously, by gentrification and changing tastes \u2014 I had to go before it was too late. In July, I flew to Bangkok for a week of eating nothing but street food.Pretty much immediately, I learned that street food was a term with many definitions. Now, Ms. Songvisava said, profit margins rule. \u201cThey just buy everything from the factory, use industrial processed food,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of seasoning and MSG involved to produce the food because people doesn\u2019t complain.\u201d \u201cThis is like a good five to 10 kilometers from where the original was,\u201d said Ms. Nualkhair. \u201cSo the people who used to eat these guys\u2019 food wouldn\u2019t come here on a regular basis with this special trip.\u201d Only a few vendors in all of Bangkok, she estimated, cooked well enough that people would follow them to new locations. That picture grew more complex over the next few days. In the mornings, I\u2019d leave Vincent\u2019s apartment in search of coffee \u2014 and more often than not would return with a baggie of sticky rice and skewers of sweet, fatty grilled pork from the moo-ping cart stationed outside his front door. (Vincent lives near a university, so there\u2019s a steady flow of hungry, frugal students. Some things never change.) For Mr. Turner, street food was not necessarily defined by mobility. \u201cThe necessity,\u201d he said, \u201cis that it\u2019s convenient, at a price that people are willing to pay.\u201dHis definition \u2014 which will no doubt enrage certain corners of the internet \u2014 opened up what I could consider street food to include Bangkok\u2019s shophouse restaurants: boxy, frill-free dining rooms where the cooking is done up front, in a kitchen that\u2019s often little more than an elaborate, sedentary cart. Such was the case at Sai Kaew, the duck noodle shop Mr. Turner brought me to.\u201cIn the beginning, I worked full-time in an office like most Thais,\u201d said Sai Kaew\u2019s owner, Ruengchai Chartmongkoljaroen. Thirty years ago, however, he quit his job to push a cart. He set up 10 tables on sidewalk space he\u2019d rented in front of a building, walked his cart in circles to attract attention, and of course worked on his recipes, developing the condiment that became his calling card: light, crunchy, slippery boiled duck intestines, or sai kaew. (Excellent with a slather of his vibrant green hot sauce, and a worthy foil for the sweetly rich duck.) The price for a bowl in 1987: 10 baht, or about 40 cents at the time.\u201cDay 1, we opened from 12 p.m. to 2 a.m.,\u201d he said. \u201cWe sold half a duck.\u201dBusiness improved, but even so, he pushed the cart for 16 years before parking it at this shophouse, where on a good day he and his two daughters, who\u2019ve learned the business from childhood will go through \u201c50 big ducks.\u201d Though his duck noodles are now well known, the price remains right: Lunch for two was 160 baht, or less than $5.Even Pritipal Singh Sirikumar, whose stand selling crisp, yummy samosas was founded by his father some 50 years ago, dreamed of moving from his open-air nook \u2014 about the size of a couch \u2014 at the corner of a Chinatown soi. He said it would be to have his own shophouse. \u201cThen we can put in tables and chairs. We can serve more customers. I will serve lassi.\u201dMr. Sirikumar\u2019s sentiments were echoed by people like Pongsuang Kunprasop, known as Note, a friend I hadn\u2019t seen in a decade but who refused to eat street food with me. \u201cBeen sharing sidewalks with rats and cockroach at night for all my life,\u201d he wrote in an email.Over the course of a week, I did not see much vermin, nor did I fall ill. (I did carry charcoal pills, a gift from Ms. Songvisava and Mr. Jones, said to counteract food poisoning.) But I also came to appreciate the appeal of air-conditioning, and to understand that the romance attached to the cart, by Thais as well as Westerners, does not always mesh with reality. \u201cPrecariousness is the new status quo,\u201d Ms. Nualkhair of Bangkok Glutton wrote via Facebook. \u201cThe uncertainty alone is enough to move ppl out of town.\u201dAt the same time, street food is a long way from its demise. For every tale I heard of police clearing vendors away, I found a bamee moodaeng stall making its own noodles or heard the late-morning call of a wandering vendor selling curries and fermented rice noodles. However endangered street food is, pursuing it remains an eye-opening way to discover a city like Bangkok. One morning, Rattama Pongponrat, known as Pom, an ebullient culinary consultant and former curator at Museum Siam, led me on a daylong binge, from a breakfast of toast with coconut jam to a sidewalk stand selling noodles with atypically thick slices of offal. There was fried chicken piled atop metal tables. There was glorious mango ice cream from a dinky corner shop. And there was Ms. Pongponrat, overjoyed at it all. When the sun was high, we strode through the shaded alleyways of Chinatown, past tropical fruits pickled in chilies, batter-fried squid roe with a spicy-sweet sauce \u2014 until, finally, we burst out onto a bridge where Ms. Pongponrat had hoped to find one particular vendor. Instead, the bridge had been entirely cleared.\u201cOh, my God, it\u2019s all gone!\u201d Ms. Pongponrat shouted. \u201cI never knew it was a bridge. I\u2019ve never seen this before in my life.\u201d She began swearing, then looked up at a well-tended four-story building, yellow with green shutters, the crisp style at once Chinese and Neo-Classical. \u201cWhat a beautiful building,\u201d she said in wonder. Then we plunged back into the fray to find another snack.Chinatown is an excellent place to begin, for its density of talented vendors and for the official protection they enjoy (at least for the moment). Yaowarat Road is the heart of its street-food zone \u2014 think rolled rice noodles with crispy pork belly, or sweet boiled lotus root on crushed ice \u2014 but if you wander a little farther afield, you\u2019ll encounter the fishball-noodle stand Lim Lao Sa (on Song Wat Road near Trok Saphan Yuan), Natthapon Coconut Ice Cream (on Phraeng Phuthon Road), and the high-end drinking-food restaurant Err (394/35 Maha Rat Road; errbkk.com). For a stroll through not-yet-gentrified Bangkok, take the Sky Train to Udom Suk station and head down Sukhumvit Road soi 103, through numerous vendors crowding the sidewalk. (Try them!) To the left, in the marketplace, is a bamee moodaeng stall that makes its own excellent noodles, and a few blocks northeast is Sai Kaew, the duck noodle soup shop.To see another way street food is evolving, check out Talad Ruam Sab, known as the Lunch Market, across Asok Road (Sukhumvit soi 21) from Srinakharinwirot University. There you\u2019ll find dozens of tiny stalls serving everything from sweet braised pig\u2019s leg to fiery crab curry with fermented rice noodles. Bring friends, stake out space at a communal table, and order promiscuously.Finally, there is the Michelin guide, whose Bangkok edition includes 28 street-food vendors (all in shophouses, technically). Find it online at guide.michelin.com/th/en/bangkok.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the organization that announced it would ban street food vendors. It is the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration, not Authority.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Europe Lead on Privacy?", "Date": "2018-04-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMr. Wheeler is a former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission.\u201cWe have a responsibility to protect your information,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, declared recently in a full-page newspaper advertisement. \u201cIf we can\u2019t, we don\u2019t deserve it.\u201dIt is nice to see Facebook taking some responsibility for the exploitation of the personal information of 50 million of its users in the service of a political campaign. But Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s comments suggest he still doesn\u2019t get it: What matters is not whether internet companies \u201cdeserve\u201d our private information but why we as consumers do not have meaningful ways to protect that data from being siphoned for sale in the first place.The American government has done little to help us in this regard. The Federal Trade Commission merely requires internet companies to have a privacy policy available for consumers to see. A company can change that policy whenever it wants as long as it says it is doing so. As a result, internet companies have been taking our personal property \u2014 our private information \u2014 while hiding this fact behind lengthy and coercive legalese and cumbersome \u201copt out\u201d processes.The European Union, however, is handling the problem differently. Starting in May, its General Data Protection Regulation will go into effect in its 28 member nations. The regulation is powerful in its simplicity: It ensures that consumers own their private information and thus have the right to control its usage and that internet companies have an obligation to give consumers the tools to exercise that control.The European rules, for instance, require companies to provide a plain-language description of their information-gathering practices, including how the data is used, as well as have users explicitly \u201copt in\u201d to having their information collected. The rules also give consumers the right to see what information about them is being held, and the ability to have that information erased.Why don\u2019t we have similar protections in the United States? We almost did. In 2016, the Federal Communications Commission imposed similar requirements on the companies that provide internet service, forcing them to offer an explicit \u201copt in\u201d for having personal data collected, and to protect the information that was collected.This didn\u2019t last. Internet service providers like Comcast and AT&T and companies that use their connections, like Facebook and Google, lobbied members of Congress. Congress passed a law this year, signed by President Trump, that not only repealed the protections but also prohibited the F.C.C. from ever again imposing such safeguards. The same coalition of corporate interests succeeded in discouraging California from passing a state privacy law similar to the 2016 F.C.C. requirements.Fortunately, the European Union\u2019s law should indirectly help Americans somewhat. In only a few weeks, Facebook, Google and all the other internet companies that collect our private information will have to allow European customers the protections these companies have fought to deny Americans. In an interconnected world where digital code doesn\u2019t respect the geographical or national borders, this will surely have a positive global impact.Internet companies are preparing for a future in which regardless of where a website is based, if it is visited by even a single European Union citizen and if it seeks to collect that person\u2019s data, it must provide that person the protections of the General Data Protection Regulation. Hopefully, this experience will show these companies that protecting privacy is simply the responsible thing to do, not the end of their business.The United States government has a lot of explaining to do. Why is it that American internet companies such as Facebook and Google are required to provide privacy protections when doing business with European consumers but are free to not provide such protections for Americans? Why is it that Americans\u2019 best privacy hope is the secondary effect of interconnected networks rather than privacy protections designed for Americans? Why shouldn\u2019t Americans also be given meaningful tools to protect their privacy?Congress is now considering bipartisan legislation that responds to the problem of Russian targeted political advertising on social media by adding the requirement, long applied to broadcast advertising, that those websites disclose who is paying for their advertisements. But as well intentioned as that step may be, it addresses only a symptom of the problem of the extensive surveillance of Americans, not the root of the problem.The New World must learn from the Old World. The internet economy has made our personal data a corporate commodity. The United States government must return control of that information to its owners.Tom Wheeler, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission from 2013 to 2017, is a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution and a fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Unicorns of the Intellectual Right", "Date": "2018-04-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistThe hiring-then-firing of Kevin Williamson followed a familiar script. A mainstream media organization hires a conservative in the name of intellectual diversity, then is shocked, shocked to discover that he\u2019s dishonest and/or holds truly reprehensible views \u2013 something that the organization could have discovered with a few minutes on Google. But when the bad hire is let go, the right treats him as a martyr, proof of liberal refusal to let alternative viewpoints be heard. Why does this keep happening?The appointment of Larry Kudlow to head the National Economic Council epitomizes the phenomenon. The NEC director doesn\u2019t have to be an academically prestigious economist; Larry Summers was an exception. But under Obama the director was always someone who was interested in real policy research, listened to what experts had to say, and was willing to change views in the face of evidence.Obviously none of this is true in Kudlow\u2019s case. He\u2019s basically a TV personality, whose shtick is preaching the magic of tax cuts, and nothing \u2013 not the Kansas debacle, not the Clinton boom, not the strong job creation that followed Obama\u2019s 2013 tax hike \u2013 will change his mind. And it\u2019s not just that he\u2019s incurious and inflexible: selling snake oil is his business model, and he can\u2019t change without losing everything. And that\u2019s the kind of guy Republicans want.All this means that if you get a conservative economist who isn\u2019t a charlatan and crank, you are more or less by definition getting someone with no influence on policymakers. But that\u2019s not the only problem.The second problem with conservative economic thought is that even aside from its complete lack of policy influence, it\u2019s in an advanced state of both intellectual and moral decadence \u2013 something that has been obvious for a while, but became utterly clear after the 2008 crisis.What accounts for this moral decline? I suspect that it\u2019s about a desperate attempt to retain some influence on a party that prefers the likes of Kudlow or Stephen Moore. People like John Taylor just keep hoping that if they toe the party line enough, they can still get on the inside. But so far this keeps not happening \u2013 and for sure it won\u2019t get better under Trump.And no, you don\u2019t see the same thing on the other side. Liberal economists have made plenty of bad predictions \u2013 if you never get it wrong, you\u2019re not taking enough risks \u2013 but have generally been willing to admit to and learn from mistakes, and have rarely been sycophants to people in power. In this, as in so much else, we\u2019re looking at asymmetric polarization.Am I saying that there are no conservative economists who have maintained their principles? Not at all. But they have no influence, zero, on GOP thinking. So in economics, a news organization trying to represent conservative thought either has to publish people with no constituency or go with the charlatans who actually matter.And I think that\u2019s true across the board. The left has genuine public intellectuals with actual ideas and at least some real influence; the right does not. News organizations don\u2019t seem to have figured out how to deal with this reality, except by pretending that it doesn\u2019t exist. And that\u2019s why we keep having these Williamson-like debacles.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Trade War Will Test Corporate America\u2019s Openness: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Friday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Investors should get ready to feel \u201ca little pain.\u201d\u2022 Is the inflation scare over?\u2022 Hiring slowed in March.\u2022 The U.S.-China trade fight is getting hotter.\u2022 The Treasury Department sanctioned Russian mogul Oleg Deripaska.President Trump has supported combative trade policies for years, and in recent months, his administration has begun to pursue them. The actions have weighed on the stock prices of large international corporations, and if implemented, could hurt their bottom lines.But global companies mostly have not detailed the potential impact of Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policies. Will that now change? With first-quarter earnings imminent, and tensions with China escalating, shareholders may want companies to make specific disclosures. The companies may be tempted to say little. After all, Mr. Trump\u2019s trade restrictions have merely been threatened, and may not occur if deals are struck. But in the past, companies have refreshed their outlooks in the face of circumstantial economic and geopolitical events, like the Gulf War. And investors will likely press firms to estimate the impact of a trade war and describe the measures they will take to protect their businesses.Still, the prospect of a trade war raises questions about the adequacy of corporate disclosure. Those of G.M., contained in its latest annual report, seem quite detailed. They offer quite specific warnings about the risks of doing business in China, and the company even mentions the possibility of trade agreements falling apart. But financial reports from Boeing and Apple arguably have less on potential problems in China and trade disputes.Boeing\u2019s annual report did mention tariffs and embargoes as threats. But the report, released in February, also sounded a bullish note on the global economy that now almost sounds like it was from a different era:\u201cThe long-term outlook for the industry continues to remain positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel growth: economic growth and the increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization, and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries.\u201dWill such language remain in Boeing\u2019s reports?- Peter EavisFor years, investors had a singular focus on the Federal Reserve and its plans to raise rates.Any indication that the Fed could move more aggressively than expected to tighten monetary policies and stocks would pull back.Now the Fed has company in sending jitters through the market: Trade.A one-two punch from the White House and the Fed pushed stocks on Wall Street down Friday. The S.&P. 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average both finished off more than 2 percent.Markets began to slide at the start of trading after President Trump\u2019s threat on Thursday to heap fresh tariffs on China. Investors took little comfort in statements from the administration\u2019s top economic policymakers, Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary. Both men sought to tamp down the contentious back-and-forth between the two economic giants.Comments from Mr. Powell in the early Friday afternoon added to the unease. In a speech in Chicago, Mr. Powell highlighted the strength of the United States economic recovery and gave little indication that the Fed planned to deviate from its gradual path of lifting interest rates.On WABC Radio\u2019s \u201cBernie & Sid in the Morning\u201d show, Mr. Trump said:\u201cNow we could\u2014the easiest thing for me to do would be just to close my eyes and forget it.\u201d\u201cIf I did that, I\u2019m not doing my job. So, I\u2019m not saying there won\u2019t be a little pain but the market\u2019s gone up 40 percent, 42 percent \u2014 so we might lose a little bit of it\u2014 but we\u2019re going to have a much stronger country when we\u2019re finished. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m all about. We have to do things that other people wouldn\u2019t do.\u201dThe president also took to Twitter to defend his approach to trade policy. Mr. Trump, in a tweet, criticized both China and the World Trade Organization, saying that the Chinese \u201cget tremendous perks and advantages, especially over the U.S. Does anybody think this is fair. We were badly represented. The WTO is unfair to U.S.\u201dThat followed another early morning tweet, in which Mr. Trump boasted that the new metals tariffs he has put into effect on China and other nations had not hurt American consumers as his critics predicted.More from what a representative for China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce said:\u201cWe feel America is very arrogant. They have taken a wrong action. The result is that they will hurt themselves.\u201dThe Chinese official said that the two sides can\u2019t negotiate under the current conditions. And in an interview with Bloomberg on Friday, Larry Kudlow \u2014 who has been national economic adviser for just under a week \u2014 said he could not predict when talks would begin. He added:Earlier this year, stocks sold off after the jobs report for January showed a 2.9 percent annual increase in wages, a relatively strong rise. Investors feared that a sustained increase in earnings could prompt consumers to buy more goods and services, pushing up prices in the process. Concerns receded after February\u2019s report showed a 2.6 percent jump in wages, and March\u2019s rise of 2.7 percent is not likely to stir up more worries.The March report contained data that could do even more to quell investors\u2019 nerves over inflation. While the report revised February\u2019s gain higher to 326,000 jobs from 313,000, it sharply reduced the January figure to 176,000 from 239,000. The January revision prompted Jim Vogel, of FTN Financial, to write:\u201cThat collapsed what had been an upward slope to the last two years of payroll growth and implicitly reduced the upward pressure on wages that so many are still certain will arrive this year.\u201d\u2014 Peter EavisThe headline numbers The takeaways\u2022 \u201cThat\u2019s something I get no credit for, by the way,\u201d he says. \u201cI have been for equal opportunity in gay marriage for the last 12 or 13 years.\u201d\u2022 \u201cSee this?\u201d he says. \u201cThese are front-stabbing knives.

{"Headline": "Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s I\u2019m Sorry Suit", "Date": "2018-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by12 PhotosWell, he donned, if not a penitent\u2019s robes, then what seems like his equivalent: a suit and tie.It began on Monday, when Mr. Zuckerberg made the rounds of congressional leaders in a dark suit, white shirt and ink blue tie. On Tuesday, when he took his seat on the committee room floor, the suit was navy, and the tie was Facebook blue. It was somber. It was on brand.Cosmetic, perhaps. Superficial, sure. Presumably once he is back on the West Coast he\u2019ll go right back to hoodies and tees. But it was strategic and optically effective nonetheless.\u201cAs a symbolic gesture it was absolutely the right message,\u201d said Alan Flusser, a tailor in New York and the author of \u201cClothes and the Man.\u201dIt said to suspicious, establishment lawmakers: I am in your house, I will accept your rules. It said, O.K., maybe we in Silicon Valley really don\u2019t know best. It said: I acknowledge the responsibility I bear and take this seriously. It acceded to the general interpretation that this was a growing-up moment, because in the iconography of clothing, the suit is the costume of the grown-up, while the T-shirt is the costume of the teenager, the off-duty, the breaker of rules.It took away one of the signifiers of difference between the old guard and the new, and replaced it with an olive branch of similarity. (Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s suit and tie almost matched the suit and tie worn by John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee.)(At the time Mr. Kudlow was wearing a blue pinstripe suit, white pocket handkerchief, and had a blue scarf knotted like an ascot around his neck.)Mr. Zuckerberg \u201cknew people would be on the lookout\u201d for the answer, said Joseph Rosenfeld, a personal style adviser who specializes in the tech world in Silicon Valley and New York, and whose clients work at companies such as Apple, Intuit and Google.This was not, of course the first time Mr. Zuckerberg has worn a suit. It\u2019s just that it is seemingly possible to count on two hands the times he has done so: always on public occasions and (not counting his wedding) always when heads of state or other dignitaries are involved. He wore a suit, for example, to address the G8 summit in France in 2011; to the state dinner for Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2015; to interview Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Facebook the same year; and to testify in a Dallas courtroom during the Oculus intellectual property trial in 2017.Much was written about his wife\u2019s wedding dress after their wedding, but there was little about his dark suit. A Facebook spokeswoman declined to comment on his choice of suit for Congress. Mr. Rosenfeld said he had no idea of the maker or whether Mr. Zuckerberg was getting outside advice. A quick survey of my colleagues who work in Silicon Valley elicited only puzzlement. But over the years Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s suits have gotten skinnier, the ties narrower, the aesthetic less uncomfortable-kid-in-Dad\u2019s-borrowed-suit.Certainly Mr. Zuckerberg has publicly acknowledged, a few times, the very conscious way he uses clothes. Just because he is known for wearing the same thing every day doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t think about fashion or how what he wears gets interpreted. In fact, it is exactly the opposite.Which is to say, he wears the same thing because that way he thought about it once and never had to think about it again.Though the current situation does somewhat demonstrate the limits of that approach.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "YouTube Shooting: Woman Wounds 3 Before Killing Herself, Police Say", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u2022 Three people were injured by gunfire, one of them critically, in a shooting at YouTube\u2019s headquarters in San Bruno, Calif., on Tuesday afternoon.\u2022 The San Bruno Police Department identified the attacker, who died of an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound, as Nasim Najafi Aghdam, who was in her late 30s.\u2022 President Trump has been briefed and tweeted \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d to the victims.Here is the latest information on the attack.Chief Ed Barberini of the San Bruno Police Department said at a news conference that three victims had been transported away with gunshot wounds. He had previously indicated that there were four shooting victims; the discrepancy stemmed from the fact that at least one person was injured while fleeing the building but not shot.The gunshot victims were taken to Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, the only Level 1 trauma center in San Francisco. Brent Andrew, a spokesman for the hospital, said at a news conference that a 36-year-old man was in critical condition, a 32-year-old woman in serious condition and a 27-year-old woman in fair condition.Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google, which owns YouTube, said in a statement late Tuesday afternoon that Google was \u201cdoing everything we can to support them and their families at this time.\u201dThe police found a woman, believed to be the attacker and later identified as Ms. Aghdam, dead in the building from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Social media postings associated with her included a video in which she criticized YouTube.Chief Barberini said that the suspect had used a handgun, and that there was no evidence of a second attacker.When the police arrived, two minutes after receiving 911 calls, they had to wade through YouTube employees fleeing the building.Many employees interviewed outside said they had initially thought the episode was a fire drill. Others said they ran when people started shouting that there was a shooter.Zach Vorhies, 37, a senior software engineer at YouTube, said in an interview that he had been sitting at his desk when the fire alarm went off, and that he grabbed his electric skateboard and headed for the back exit. As he rode down a gravel hill, he said, he heard someone shouting and saw a man lying motionless in one of the office\u2019s outdoor dining areas.\u201cHe had a red spot on his stomach, and he was lying on his back, not moving,\u201d Mr. Vorhies said. \u201cI saw the blood soak through the shirt.\u201dAbout 25 feet away from the victim, he said, a heavyset man wearing gray was shouting, \u201cCome at me!\u201d Mr. Vorhies thought the man was the attacker, but he did not see a gun, and said it was possible the man had actually \u201cbeen taunting the shooter.\u201dThe dining area can be reached from an adjacent parking structure without an employee badge, Mr. Vorhies said.In a nearby parking lot to which 200 or so employees had evacuated, armed police officers waded into the crowd. The police asked for employees who had witnessed something firsthand to come forward, and about two dozen people, some visibly distraught, walked over to the officers.Vadim Lavrusik, a YouTube employee who formerly worked for The New York Times, tweeted just before 1 p.m. that there was an \u201cactive shooter at YouTube HQ\u201d and that he had \u201cheard shots and saw people running while at my desk.\u201d He said that he was barricaded in a room with co-workers, but moments later tweeted that he had been safely evacuated.\u201cWe\u2019re also aware of the misinformation being spread on Twitter,\u201d Jack Dorsey, the chief executive of Twitter, tweeted. \u201cWe\u2019re tracking, learning, and taking action.\u201dNellie Bowles, Jack Nicas, Matt Stevens, Liam Stack, Daniel Victor and Dai Wakabayashi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Big Brother\u2019 in India Requires Fingerprint Scans for Food, Phones and Finances", "Date": "2018-04-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW DELHI \u2014 Seeking to build an identification system of unprecedented scope, India is scanning the fingerprints, eyes and faces of its 1.3 billion residents and connecting the data to everything from welfare benefits to mobile phones.Civil libertarians are horrified, viewing the program, called Aadhaar, as Orwell\u2019s Big Brother brought to life. To the government, it\u2019s more like \u201cbig brother,\u201d a term of endearment used by many Indians to address a stranger when asking for help.For other countries, the technology could provide a model for how to track their residents. And for India\u2019s top court, the ID system presents unique legal issues that will define what the constitutional right to privacy means in the digital age.To Adita Jha, Aadhaar was simply a hassle. The 30-year-old environmental consultant in Delhi waited in line three times to sit in front of a computer that photographed her face, captured her fingerprints and snapped images of her irises. Three times, the data failed to upload. The fourth attempt finally worked, and she has now been added to the 1.1 billion Indians already included in the program.Ms. Jha had little choice but to keep at it. The government has made registration mandatory for hundreds of public services and many private ones, from taking school exams to opening bank accounts.\u201cYou almost feel like life is going to stop without an Aadhaar,\u201d Ms. Jha said.But India\u2019s program is in a league of its own, both in the mass collection of biometric data and in the attempt to link it to everything \u2014 traffic tickets, bank accounts, pensions, even meals for undernourished schoolchildren.\u201cNo one has approached that scale and that ambition,\u201d said Jacqueline Bhabha, a professor and research director of Harvard\u2019s FXB Center for Health and Human Rights, who has studied biometric ID systems around the world. \u201cIt has been hailed, and justifiably so, as an extraordinary triumph to get everyone registered.\u201dCritics fear that the government will gain unprecedented insight into the lives of all Indians.In response, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other champions of the program say that Aadhaar is India\u2019s ticket to the future, a universal, easy-to-use ID that will reduce this country\u2019s endemic corruption and help bring even the most illiterate into the digital age.The potential uses \u2014 from surveillance to managing government benefit programs \u2014 have drawn interest elsewhere. Sri Lanka is planning a similar system, and Britain, Russia and the Philippines are studying it, according to the Indian government.Aadhaar, which means \u201cfoundation\u201d in English, was initially intended as a difficult-to-forge ID to reduce fraud and improve the delivery of government welfare programs.But Mr. Modi, who has promoted a \u201cdigital India\u201d vision since his party took power in 2014, has vastly expanded its ambitions.The poor must scan their fingerprints at the ration shop to get their government allocations of rice. Retirees must do the same to get their pensions. Middle-school students cannot enter the water department\u2019s annual painting contest until they submit their identification.The Modi government has also ordered Indians to link their IDs to their cellphone and bank accounts. States have added their own twists, like using the data to map where people live. Some employers use the ID for background checks on job applicants.\u201cAadhaar has added great strength to India\u2019s development,\u201d Mr. Modi said in a January speech to military cadets. Officials estimate that taxpayers have saved at least $9.4 billion from Aadhaar by weeding out \u201cghosts\u201d and other improper beneficiaries of government services.Opponents have filed at least 30 cases against the program in India\u2019s Supreme Court. They argue that Aadhaar violates India\u2019s Constitution \u2014 and, in particular, a unanimous court decision last year that declared for the first time that Indians had a fundamental right to privacy.Rahul Narayan, one of the lawyers challenging the system, said the government was essentially building one giant database on its citizens. \u201cThere has been a sort of mission creep to it all along,\u201d he said.The court has been holding extensive hearings and is expected to make a ruling in the spring.The government argues that the universal ID is vital in a country where hundreds of millions of people do not have widely accepted identification documents.Businesses are also using the technology to streamline transactions.Banks once sent employees to the homes of account applicants to verify their addresses. Now, accounts can be opened online and finished with a fingerprint scan at a branch or other authorized outlet. Reliance Jio, a telecom provider, relies on an Aadhaar fingerprint scan to conduct the government-mandated ID check for purchases of cellphone SIM cards. That allows clerks to activate service immediately instead of forcing buyers to wait a day or two.But the Aadhar system has also raised practical and legal issues.\u201cThis is the population that is being passed off as ghosts and bogus by the government,\u201d said Reetika Khera, an associate professor of economics at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, who co-wrote the study.Dr. Pandey said that some problems were inevitable but that his agency was trying to fix them. The government is patching security holes and recently added face recognition as an alternative to fingerprint or iris scans to make it easier to verify identities.Fears that the Indian government could use Aadhaar to turn the country into a surveillance state, he said, are overblown. \u201cThere is no central authority that has all the information,\u201d he said.Before Aadhaar, he said, hundreds of millions of Indians could not easily prove who they were.\u201cIf you are not able to prove your identity, you are disenfranchised,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have no existence.\u201dA picture caption with an earlier version of this article misidentified which of the people shown was undergoing a security check. It was the man in the foreground, not the woman. The caption also misstated what was being scanned. It was the man\u2019s irises, not his retinas.Suhasini Raj contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Liberty University Built a Billion-Dollar Empire Online", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "FeatureWith a hard sell to prospective students and huge amounts in taxpayer funding, Jerry Falwell Jr. transformed the evangelical institution into a behemoth.Supported byThis article is a collaboration between The Times and ProPublica, the independent nonprofit investigative-journalism organization.Penny Nance, a newly named Liberty trustee who is the head of the socially conservative group Concerned Women for America, took the stage to say that with Donald Trump in the White House, the country was much closer to overturning Roe v. Wade and putting \u201ctrue limits on the abortionist\u2019s hand.\u201d Tim Lee, a Texas preacher and evangelist who lost his legs in the Vietnam War, gave a sermon bemoaning \u201chomosexuals and pornographers,\u201d declaring that one problem with \u201cpulpits today is that they\u2019ve got a lot of girlie men in them.\u201d A young man in front of me in a Nautica T-shirt clapped and shouted, \u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201dJerry Falwell Jr., who has led the university since 2007, lacks the charisma and high profile of his father, who helped lead the rise of the religious right within the Republican Party. Yet what the soft-spoken Falwell, 55, lacks in personal aura, he has more than made up for in institutional ambition. As Liberty has expanded over the past two decades, it has become a powerful force in the conservative movement. The Liberty campus is now a requisite stop for Republican candidates for president \u2014 with George W. Bush, John McCain and Mitt Romney all making the pilgrimage \u2014 and many of Liberty graduates end up working in Republican congressional offices and conservative think tanks.Liberty has also played a significant role in the rise of Donald Trump. Falwell was an early supporter of the reality-TV-star candidate, staying loyal through the release of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape and giving Trump a crucial imprimatur with white evangelical voters, who widely supported him at the polls. \u201cThe evangelicals were so great to me,\u201d Trump said in an interview last year. The first commencement speech he gave as president, last spring, was at Liberty. And in August, Falwell stood by Trump following his much-criticized remarks on the violent rally by white supremacists in Charlottesville, declaring on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d that \u201cPresident Donald Trump does not have a racist bone in his body.\u201dSuch steadfast allyship has prompted ridicule even from some fellow evangelical Republicans. But it makes more sense in light of an overlooked aspect of Liberty: its extraordinary success as a moneymaking venture. Like Trump, Falwell recognized the money to be made in selling success \u2014 in this case, through the booming and lightly regulated realm of online higher education. Falwell\u2019s university has achieved the scale and stature it has because he identified a market opportunity and exploited it.By 2017, Liberty students were receiving more than $772 million in total aid from the U.S. Department of Education \u2014 nearly $100 million of it in the form of Pell grants and the rest in federal student loans. Among universities nationwide, it ranked sixth in federal aid. Liberty students also received Department of Veterans Affairs benefits, some $42 million in 2016, the most recent year for which figures are available. Although some of that money went to textbooks and nontuition expenses, a vast majority of Liberty\u2019s total revenue that year, which was just above $1 billion, came from taxpayer-funded sources.And it was no secret which part of the university was generating most of that revenue, said Chris Gaumer, a Liberty graduate and former professor of English there. \u201cWhen I was there, at faculty meetings the commentary was that online was funding the school, while they were trying to just break even on the residential side,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was understood that on the online side, they were making a killing.\u201dHe founded Thomas Road Baptist Church in the former offices of a bottling company in 1956 and soon began broadcasting recordings of his sermons on regional radio and television. In 1971, the same year his \u201cOld Time Gospel Hour\u201d went national, he founded Lynchburg Baptist College, subsidizing it with revenues from the show. \u201cI believe there are thousands of young students who will catch the vision and who will carry what God is doing in Lynchburg to cities all over the continent and around the world,\u201d he declared at the time, according to his 1996 autobiography. At first the college was scattered in rented spaces around town \u2014 a vacant high school, a Ramada Inn \u2014 but by 1977 it had been renamed Liberty Baptist College and moved up to an initial 2,000-acre swath of land on the mountain.By 1984, nearly 400 local broadcasters around the nation were carrying \u201cThe Old Time Gospel Hour.\u201d The toll-free number flashing on the screen reportedly helped bring in more than $72 million per year in donations. Some $10 million of those funds flowed to the college, which at that point numbered about 4,500 students. Another of Falwell\u2019s enterprises pulled in about $12 million a year \u2014 the Moral Majority, an attempt to build a cross-denominational political coalition against the common foes of abortion rights and, as he later put it, \u201cmoral permissiveness, family breakdown and general capitulation to evil and to foreign policies such as Marxism-Leninism.\u201dBut another element of the business model \u2014 evangelical broadcasting\u2019s aura of rectitude \u2014 was about to take a hit. That March, Jim Bakker resigned as head of the televangelist PTL ministry amid revelations of a sexual encounter with a former church secretary, Jessica Hahn, who received a payoff to keep quiet about it; Bakker later served just under five years in prison on a federal fraud conviction related to PTL\u2019s fund-raising. In 1988, the televangelist Jimmy Swaggart declared, \u201cI have sinned,\u201d following reports of his consorting with a prostitute in New Orleans; three years later, the police pulled him over with another prostitute in Southern California.No such scandals attached to Falwell, who succeeded Bakker as host of \u201cThe PTL Club.\u201d But the bubble had burst. Amid what Falwell later referred to as the \u201ccredibility crunch\u201d caused by the televangelist scandals, the college\u2019s finances deteriorated. Within a few years, annual contributions dropped by $25 million; the college\u2019s debt swelled to more than $100 million.In 1996, the accrediting body overseeing Liberty presented a list of more than 100 \u201crecommendations\u201d for staying accredited, including a demand that it reduce its debt. Falwell went on a 40-day liquids-only fast, praying for deliverance. \u201cI am certain that we will become a world-class university training champions for Christ in every important field of study,\u201d Falwell vowed in his autobiography. \u201cAnd I am asking God to give me more time to guide and fund that dream.\u201dOne educational novelty that Falwell dabbled in, starting in the mid-\u201970s, was an early form of distance learning. Liberty would mail lecture videotapes and course packets to paying customers around the country \u2014 at first just certificate courses in Bible studies, and by the mid-\u201980s, accredited courses in other subjects as well. By the time of Liberty\u2019s financial embattlement, other education innovators had taken the idea much further \u2014 none more so than a man named John Sperling.Sperling was an unlikely capitalist entrepreneur. The son of a failed farmer in the Missouri Ozarks, he joined the Merchant Marine, embraced socialism and ended up receiving a Ph.D. in history from the University of Cambridge. He got a job teaching at San Jose State University, where he took over the faculty union and led a big strike in 1968. His humble origins and early socialist leanings had given him a jaundiced view of elite schools, and his experience teaching a course to police officers and teachers as part of a federally funded effort to reduce juvenile delinquency furthered his belief that traditional colleges were leaving out a whole swath of Americans eager for higher education. He decided to start a university of his own \u2014 not a nonprofit but a for-profit, and not in California, where he had clashed with skeptical accreditors, but in the laxer regulatory climate of Arizona.In 1976, Sperling rented space in a boilermakers\u2019 union hall in Phoenix and started offering weekly classes there to eight students \u2014 all adults who\u2019d had some college education and were looking to complete their degrees. A decade later, University of Phoenix had 6,000 students. But things really took off three years later, in 1989, when Sperling started offering M.B.A.s online through Prodigy, the early electronic communications service. Sperling took the university\u2019s parent company public in 1994; by 2000, enrollment had reached 100,000.By the early 2000s, for-profit colleges were booming: Access to the internet was spreading, and the Bush administration was employing a notably light regulatory touch, even as the programs were devouring an ever-greater share of federal student aid. Among the adopters of Sperling\u2019s model was Falwell, who in 2004 began expanding the family\u2019s primitive distance-learning programs into what would become known as Liberty University Online.In his autobiography, Falwell praised Jerry Jr.\u2019s business instincts, crediting him with saving Liberty from ruin through his management of its debt. \u201cGod sent him to me just in time,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHe is more responsible, humanly speaking, for the miraculous financial survival of this ministry than any other single person.\u201d When Falwell died in 2007 at age 73, his younger son, Jonathan, took over the pulpit at Thomas Road Baptist, and Jerry Jr. took over the university \u2014 an indication of where the heart of the ministry now was.As the Great Recession hit, laid-off Americans turned to online education to seek a new economic foothold. After years of trying to save Liberty by cutting costs, Falwell Jr. said, he adopted his father\u2019s vision of saving it through increasing revenues. In a recent telephone interview, Falwell described the surge in online enrollment as a kind of revelation. \u201cIt took us about 20 years to perfect\u201d the distance-learning model, he said, \u201cbut when we did, that was about when everyone started getting high-speed internet in their homes, and we were the only nonprofit poised to serve that huge adult market of people who had not finished college or needed a master\u2019s degree to get a promotion.\u201dLiberty had another advantage over online competitors, he said: its status as a religious-based institution, \u201cthat long history of Liberty being a leader among Christian universities,\u201d the \u201cfaith-based mission\u201d that \u201cmakes us so unique and puts us in a class by ourselves.\u201dAt the front lines are the \u201cadmissions representatives,\u201d some 300 phone recruiters working two shifts from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., deploying call lists that Liberty gets from websites where people register and search for information about online higher education, like BestCollegesOnline.com. There is such a race to get to customers before University of Phoenix and other rivals that the prospective students sometimes marvel at how little time has elapsed \u2014 just a handful of minutes \u2014 between their providing their information on a website and the call coming from Liberty. Liberty\u2019s tax filings show that in 2016, the university paid Google $16.8 million for \u201cadmissions leads generation.\u201d In other words, advertising Liberty to those searching online for degree options.The recruiters work under intense pressure, according to several former L.U.O. employees I spoke with. They get no more than 45 seconds between calls, and sometimes managers override even that short break. There are no formal quotas \u2014 a federal regulation that went into effect in 2011 forbids them. But as one former employee put it, the \u201chighly motivated goal\u201d is for each recruiter to sign up eight new students a day. Multiplied across 300 cubicles, that is 2,400 per day. Of those, only a small fraction end up paying and starting courses, but that is still an extraordinary haul for any kind of education business.Every day, according to the former employee, managers send out a report showing the previous day\u2019s tallies. Recruiters who signed up four or fewer new students get their names in red, visible for all to see, and are sometimes subject to a disciplinary conversation. Monthly tallies are also scored as green, yellow or red. Top performers are in the running for a small raise from the base salary, which is about $30,000. \u201cIt was that carrot and stick,\u201d the former employee told me.A separate division of about 60 people focuses on courting members of the military, who have access to even greater federal tuition assistance, and then advising them on campus. A former employee in that division said that given the smaller crew, the work there was if anything even more intense than in the main branch: More than 30,000 L.U.O. students are from the military or military families.Two recruiters told me they were instructed to quote L.U.O.\u2019s cost on a per-credit basis, rather than per-course, which makes it sound more affordable. Undergraduate courses for part-time students are $455 per credit, or $1,365 for a typical course; master\u2019s courses are typically about $600 per credit. They are instructed not to press prospective applicants too hard on their academic qualifications. Applicants have to submit past transcripts, but any grade point average above 0.5 \u2014 equivalent to a D-minus \u2014 would suffice, said the former employee in the nonmilitary division. Recruiters, he told me, \u201cwould say, \u2018Congratulations, you\u2019ve been accepted.\u2019 They\u2019d make it seem competitive.\u201dThe two recruiters also said they were told not to mention Liberty\u2019s Christian orientation until people agree to apply, when this fact is made clear in the user agreement they sign online. It also becomes clear at the moment that the recruiters sign up students for their first classes, typically an orientation class and three required Bible-studies classes. Students often can\u2019t transfer credits for these courses to other colleges, which deters many from dropping out: Leaving L.U.O. without signing up for more courses would mean wasting the money spent on the first four.Falwell and other top Liberty officials pushed back on some of these points in my interview with them, insisting, for instance, that the minimum G.P.A. for applicants is 2.0 and that recruiters are assessed according to \u201cthe same H.R. evaluation form that\u2019s standard across the university.\u201d But Ron Kennedy, the executive vice president for online enrollment management, acknowledged that the recruiters working under pressure to meet their targets might say otherwise. \u201cIt\u2019s a call center,\u201d he said.Liberty, too, was hugely reliant on federal money, in the form of Pell grants, Department of Veterans Affairs benefits and federally subsidized loans. By 2010, it had more than 50,000 students enrolled and was pulling in more than $420 million annually. But because Liberty was technically not for-profit, it was spared many of the administration\u2019s new regulations, including its requirement that a certain threshold of graduates be able to attain \u201cgainful employment,\u201d which was designed to hit for-profit colleges much harder. It was also spared from the pre-existing rule that for-profit colleges could get no more than 90 percent of their revenue from federal sources.If anything, Liberty benefited from the crackdown. The Obama administration\u2019s actions helped put out of business large for-profit chains like Corinthian and ITT Technical Institute, clearing formidable competition from the field. Though there were other nonprofit institutions with online offerings \u2014 Arizona State, Southern New Hampshire and Western Governors, as well as premium players like Stanford and Duke \u2014 none were operating at Liberty\u2019s scale. The university now touts itself on its website as \u201cthe largest private nonprofit university in the nation.\u201d In a sense, said Ben Miller, who served as a senior policy adviser in Obama\u2019s Department of Education, the crackdown on for-profits offered Liberty a \u201cmarketing advantage.\u201dFalwell was candid about the benefits of the nonprofit status. \u201cIt insulated us from the attack on the for-profits,\u201d he told me. And it put him on the same footing with other, more established universities. \u201cThere\u2019s no way that an Obama federal government that probably doesn\u2019t care much for schools like Liberty can treat us different than Harvard or Yale or Indiana Wesleyan or the University of Maryland.\u201dLiberty\u2019s ability to distance itself from for-profit colleges was especially notable given that, by several key metrics, it resembled them more closely than the private nonprofits it was grouped with. The rate of Liberty graduates who default on their loans within three years of graduating is 9.9 percent, several points higher than the average for nonprofit colleges, though still below that for for-profit colleges. Most striking, though, is how little the university spends on actual instruction. It does not report separate figures for spending on the online school and the traditional college. But according to its most recent figures, from 2016, the university reports spending only $2,609 on instruction per full-time equivalent student across both categories. That is a fraction of what traditional private universities spend (Notre Dame\u2019s equivalent figure is $27,391) but also well behind even University of Phoenix, which spends more than $4,000 per student in many states. It is also behind other hybrid online-traditional nonprofit religious colleges like Ohio Christian University, which spends about $4,500. In 2013, according to an audited financial statement I obtained, Liberty received $749 million in tuition and fees but spent only $260 million on instruction, academic support and student services.By 2016, Liberty\u2019s net assets had crossed the $1.6 billion mark, up more than tenfold from a decade earlier. Thanks to its low spending on instruction, its net income was an astonishing $215 million on nearly $1 billion in revenue, according to its tax filing \u2014 making it one of the most lucrative nonprofits in the country, based simply on the difference between its operating revenue and expenses, in a league with some of the largest nonprofit hospital systems.Falwell, whose Liberty salary is nearly $1 million, does not apologize for those margins. Liberty, he said, is simply being shrewd about keeping costs down, while plowing revenue back into the university. He noted proudly that Liberty\u2019s net assets are now $2.5 billion, up from just $150 million in 2007, when he took over. He said he was surprised more universities weren\u2019t following Liberty\u2019s example of increasing online enrollment by keeping instructional spending and tuition low. And he freely acknowledged that the online revenues were going to buttress the residential campus. From Falwell\u2019s perspective, there was nothing wrong with the university\u2019s benefiting so much from the online program. \u201cAs long as we\u2019re keeping the quality up, we don\u2019t think it\u2019s a disservice to anyone,\u201d he said. \u201cAll that is, is ensuring the future of the university.\u201dIn his autobiography, Falwell made virtually no distinction between these students on the Lynchburg campus and those receiving their instruction remotely. All of them, in his telling, were being prepared for the same goal, to be \u201cChampions for Christ,\u201d as the Liberty motto had it. But many students on campus, at least, are openly dismissive of the online experience. They take some classes online, for the convenience of not having to drag themselves to class \u2014 and, they readily admit, for the ease of not having to study much. \u201cPeople know it\u2019s kind of a joke and don\u2019t learn that much from it,\u201d Dustin Wahl, a senior from South Dakota, told me. \u201cYou use Google when you take your quiz and don\u2019t have to work as hard. It\u2019s pretty obvious.\u201d (Liberty says using Google during quizzes or exams is cheating.)Chris Gaumer taught English courses both on campus and online at Liberty after getting his bachelor\u2019s degree on campus in 2006. The difference between the two forms of teaching was startling, he told me. As an online instructor, he said, he was not expected to engage in the delivery of any actual educational content. That was all prepared separately by L.U.O.\u2019s team of course designers and editors, who assemble curriculums and videotaped lectures by other Liberty professors. This leaves little for the instructor to do in the courses, which typically run eight weeks. \u201cAs professor, you show up and your job is to handle emails and grade,\u201d Gaumer said. This helps explain why the instructors \u2014 the roughly 2,400 adjuncts scattered around the country, plus the Liberty professors who agree to teach online courses on the side \u2014 are willing to take on the task for what\u2019s long been the going rate for the job: $2,100 per course. (Falwell Jr. said it will soon go up to $2,700.)Until recently, the course designers and editors, a team of about 30 people, worked out of the old Thomas Road Baptist Church \u2014 the congregation moved out of the former bottling plant years earlier \u2014 in a concrete room that got so cold in winter that they sometimes kept scarves and hats on. For editors, starting pay is now around $11 per hour. As L.U.O. boomed in size, they became so overwhelmed by the challenge of shaping hundreds of courses that L.U.O. decided in 2015 to focus designers and editors on the hundred or so highest-enrollment courses per term, leaving the maintenance of the remaining hundreds of courses up to the instructors themselves. One former editor recalled having a professor send a syllabus along with, essentially, an apology for throwing something together at the last minute.Gaumer, who now works at Randolph College in Lynchburg, said the steep drop-off in quality from the traditional college to the online courses was both openly acknowledged among Liberty faculty and not fully reckoned with. The reason was plain, he said: Everyone knew that L.U.O. was subsidizing the physical university. \u201cThe motivation behind the growth seems to be almost entirely economic, because it\u2019s not as if the education is getting any better,\u201d he said.Falwell acknowledged that Liberty\u2019s faculty initially resisted the rise of the online program, fearing the degradation of academic standards. \u201cThe big victory was finding a way to tame the faculty,\u201d he said. But he disputed that there was any great difference in quality. For one thing, he said, the university made sure that all of its online instructors \u201cadhere to the fundamentals of the Christian faith, our doctrinal statement.\u201d Physical distance was a challenge, he said, but online instructors overcame it by making an extra effort to reach out. \u201cThey spend a lot more time taking a personal interest in the students,\u201d he said.Her first marriage, to the father of her daughter, ended in divorce. In January 2012, her second husband suddenly vanished. Hart and her daughter, then 9 years old, lost their home shortly afterward, and she filed for bankruptcy. She and her daughter moved into her parents\u2019 basement and got by with donations from her local Assemblies of God church, where she was active. In 2013, she signed up to take three courses at L.U.O. that would provide her with a certificate in communications, allowing her to become a full-time instructor at the community college, which would reimburse her L.U.O. tuition.Hart, who had a master\u2019s in communications and leadership through Pat Robertson\u2019s Regent University, chose L.U.O. because of its affordability and Christian cachet. But in her years of teaching and taking courses, she said, she had never seen anything as flimsy as what L.U.O. passed off in its supposedly graduate-level courses. She had little interaction with the instructor, and the questions for the midterm and final exams were so arbitrary that it seemed to Hart as if they had been randomly generated by a computer program. She spent the open-book exams wildly flipping back and forth through the textbook and course materials trying to find the relevant passages. It was, she wrote to L.U.O. officials later, like \u201clooking for Waldo.\u201dWhen she wrote the instructor for the second class to ask about the test, he responded: \u201cAs to exam question, I have no clue how the final is run.\u201d He said he\u2019d get back to her. He ended his note, \u201cDo remember that God is in control and he works all things for our good.\u201dWhen Hart emailed the instructor for her third course, which had a closed-book exam, she confirmed Hart\u2019s suspicions: \u201cThe exam questions are random.\u201d Hart got good grades in the first two courses but was increasingly convinced she was paying for a meaningless experience. She sent an email outlining her concerns to the instructor and an L.U.O. academic mentor, adding that she might quit the third course. \u201cWe will certainly take your input very seriously,\u201d the mentor responded. \u201cMay the Lord bless you richly in your studies and future endeavors.\u201dFinally, Hart told the officials that she was withdrawing from the third course, even though she had been informed that she would still have to pay 25 percent of the cost. \u201cMy spirit has been so sick over what I have experienced,\u201d she wrote. In late 2013, she filed a complaint with a little-known government agency called the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia, which oversees the state\u2019s colleges.Between 2009 and summer 2017, L.U.O. students filed 49 complaints with the council, more than for any other institution in the state. For some, the problem was administrative bungling \u2014 L.U.O. registered them for the wrong class, or required a class it turned out they didn\u2019t need, and so on. For some, it was endless technical or logistical troubles that kept them from being able to submit their assignments or get textbooks. For others, it was disputes about tuition and financial aid that left them feeling as if L.U.O. was demanding more money than was fair, and withholding their transcripts until they paid up.Several complainants said they were particularly taken aback by their L.U.O. experiences because of Liberty\u2019s religious underpinnings. \u201cI just expected that Liberty University being a Christian university,\u201d they\u2019d be more helpful, wrote a complainant who went to prison and then became homeless after a stint enrolled in L.U.O. He had been seeking to have his transcript released despite his still having a balance at L.U.O., so that he could resume his education elsewhere; Liberty responded by recommending homeless shelters. \u201cLiberty\u2019s motto is they are a Christian school that is training champions for Christ and they are the light of the world,\u201d another student wrote six years ago. \u201cThat motto needs to be revised.\u201dThe anodyne responses the students received from L.U.O. were frequently glossed with Christian bromides. To a student whose financial aid was suspended in 2015 after the student failed a course because the textbook didn\u2019t arrive in time, an instructor sent \u201cquiz tips that may help\u201d that included \u201cEat a healthy meal before taking your quiz\u201d and \u201cPray before beginning each quiz!\u201d Other L.U.O. responses included language errors so extreme that they bordered on confusing: One administrator wrote in 2014 about a complainant\u2019s having submitted work that \u201cappeared to have been copied from an unsighted source,\u201d while a professor responded to a student in 2012 that \u201cno other acceptions will be made.\u201dOther students were left simply to flounder, contrary to Falwell\u2019s claims of close attention from distant instructors. Lydia Terry-Dominelli, who lives in a suburb of Albany, N.Y., signed up with Liberty in 2013, when it looked as if she and her husband were headed for divorce and she was worrying about how she could support herself and her 9-year-old daughter. She decided to get her teacher\u2019s certification and chose Liberty partly because she was an observant Anglican. \u201cI was ready for something that had some kind of value system,\u201d she told me.In 2015, Terry-Dominelli failed a graduate-level education course when, she said, one of the assignments she submitted vanished from Blackboard, the online system used by Liberty. After twice failing a writing course and puzzling over what she was doing wrong, she asked the course instructor for an explanation. He wrote back to suggest that she might do better if she found a \u201cnew work space\u201d like the local library. After she assured him that her apartment sufficed and the conversation continued, he wrote: \u201cI wonder if you can\u2019t find a great prayer group through L.U.O.?\u201dTerry-Dominelli struggled further with confusing assignments in another graduate-level education course. She was starting to feel helpless over the lack of guidance. \u201cI have prayed very hard, and what I keep being told is I am in the wrong place,\u201d she wrote to the education instructor in late October of 2015.\u201cBless your heart. I am so sorry,\u201d the instructor responded. \u201cI will join you in prayer for you to have wisdom and discernment.\u201dIn early 2016, Terry-Dominelli was unable to access online the spring-semester courses she had registered for. She took it as a final sign and left Liberty, just a few courses short of the master\u2019s degree she had borrowed more than $20,000 to pay for. In August 2016, having failed to establish a decent income, she moved back in with her husband. Lacking certification, she took a part-time job as an aide at a local elementary school. Unable to afford the loans she\u2019d taken out, she filed for help under the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Borrower Defense program, which is intended for students who have incurred student debt after being misled by higher-education programs. (Her application is still pending.)She also filed a complaint with the Virginia agency: \u201cI feel that I was being pushed out of the program and I need to know why,\u201d she had written to one of her professors. The agency declined to take action, finding no clear violations by Liberty. \u201cWhat\u2019s killing me is that I went into this program to try to change my situation,\u201d she told me, \u201cand I\u2019m worse off than I was at the beginning.\u201dThe Trump connection is not without risk for Falwell. Some people who worked for L.U.O. in late 2016 and early 2017 blamed it for a dip in applications at the time and said the decline led to an April 2017 leadership overhaul and the departure of many employees. Falwell told me that Liberty has deliberately brought online enrollment down to around 85,000, explaining that \u201cwe wanted to make sure we kept the student quality at a certain standard.\u201d And he said that his alliance with Trump has only helped the university: \u201cFor every student we lost because of political concerns, we picked up two or three inquiries who support us because of that political stand.\u201dA relationship with Trump could benefit Falwell Jr. and Liberty in other ways too. One of the top orders of business for Trump\u2019s education secretary, Betsy DeVos, has been to roll back Obama-era regulations on online-degree providers. She named a former official from for-profit DeVry University to lead the D.O.E. unit that polices fraud in higher education. Claims for student-debt relief under the Borrower Defense program are being considered at a far slower rate under DeVos, who is delaying by two years an Obama rule that would make it easier to file debt-relief claims. And DeVos is expected shortly to roll back several key regulations geared toward online providers: ones giving states regulatory powers over distance-learning programs, establishing clear standards for a credit-hour and requiring \u201cregular and substantive\u201d interactions between online instructors and students. Falwell told me that Liberty officials have had a major hand in some of DeVos\u2019s actions: \u201cA lot of what we sent them is actually what got implemented,\u201d he said.Falwell rejects such prosperity-gospel talk. \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you that we\u2019ve done better because we\u2019re better people,\u201d he told me. \u201cWhat I will say is that we\u2019ve always operated from a business perspective. We\u2019ve treated it like a business.\u201d And that\u2019s what first drew him to Trump, he said: the kinship of one businessman to another. \u201cI thought to myself, if there\u2019s one thing this country needs, it\u2019s exactly the methods we employed at Liberty to save the school and make it prosper, and that\u2019s just basic business principles.\u201dWhen we spoke before my visit, Wahl raved about the campus: \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d he said. Then he added: \u201cAnd it\u2019s funded by the online program that\u2019s sold to people who can\u2019t really afford college.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Investigating AT&T and Verizon Over Wireless Collusion Claim", "Date": "2018-04-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Justice Department has opened an antitrust investigation into potential coordination by AT&T, Verizon and a telecommunications standards organization to hinder consumers from easily switching wireless carriers, according to six people with knowledge of the inquiry.In February, the Justice Department issued demands to AT&T, Verizon and the G.S.M.A., a mobile industry standards-setting group, for information on potential collusion to thwart a technology known as eSIM, said two of the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details are confidential.The technology lets people remotely switch wireless providers without having to insert a new SIM card into a device. AT&T and Verizon face accusations that they colluded with the G.S.M.A. to try to establish standards that would allow them to lock a device to their network even if it had eSIM technology.The investigation was opened about five months ago after at least one device maker and one wireless carrier filed formal complaints with the Justice Department, two of the people said. The device maker was Apple, one of them said.Representatives for the Justice Department, and Apple declined to comment.In a statement, a Verizon spokesman confirmed that the carrier had been working with the Justice Department for several months on the inquiry because of \u201ca difference of opinion with a couple of phone equipment manufacturers regarding the development of eSIM standards.\u201d He said the issue was \u201cmuch ado about nothing.\u201dAn AT&T spokesman said the company was \u201caware of the investigation,\u201d had provided information to the government and was working \u201cto move this issue forward.\u201dG.S.M.A. confirmed that it had developed an eSIM standard that would allow a carrier to lock a device to its network but put the standard on hold pending the Justice Department\u2019s investigation. Under the pending standard, the G.S.M.A. said, a wireless carrier would need permission from a consumer to lock a device.\u201cThe G.S.M.A. is cooperating fully with the Department of Justice in this matter,\u201d the organization said in a statement.At the heart of the investigation is whether the nation\u2019s biggest wireless carriers, working with the G.S.M.A., secretly tried to influence mobile technology to unfairly maintain their dominance, in a way that hurt competition and consumers and hindered innovation in the wider mobile industry.AT&T and Verizon together control about 70 percent of all wireless subscriptions in the United States. A technology that made it easy to switch carriers could lead to more turnover and fewer subscribers for them.The investigation highlights a push by the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, to crack down on the opaque world of intellectual property, or I.P., standards. He has said the Justice Department will scrutinize potential coordination in standards-setting organizations that can hurt competition.Currently, most mobile phones use SIM cards, which contain unique identifying information about a user and are inserted into the devices so the phones can function. People typically have to buy a new SIM card when changing carriers.The eSIM technology, which was introduced in early 2016, is embedded in mobile phones and other devices so that people do not need SIM cards anymore.The push by the major carriers to restrict the flexibility of eSIM runs counter to a movement in which consumers were gaining more flexibility to move from carrier to carrier. In late 2013, under pressure by the Federal Communications Commission, the wireless industry agreed to let people take devices off any particular network without penalty once the devices were fully paid for.After the formal complaints against AT&T and Verizon were filed, several device makers and other wireless companies voiced similar concerns to the agency about the carriers\u2019 actions around eSIM, four people familiar with the investigation said. The investigation may also include other major American carriers, another person said.\u201cThe actions would limit choice for consumers and harm competition,\u201d said Ferras Vinh, a policy expert at the Center for Democracy and Technology.In a private meeting of a task force called G.S.M.A. North America this year, AT&T and Verizon pushed for the ability to lock phones to their networks, bypassing the purpose of eSIM technology, said Harold Feld, a senior vice president of Public Knowledge, a nonprofit consumer group, who was briefed on the meeting. Verizon has said it needed to be able to lock down phones to prevent theft and fraud.\u201cThere is a constant problem with industry standards-setting organizations that on the one hand allow the industry to come together for the purpose of efficiency but can be very anticompetitive and operate in secrecy,\u201d Mr. Feld said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Make Facebook More Accountable", "Date": "2018-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMr. Penn served as chief strategy officer for Microsoft from 2014 to 2016.Facebook is in a pickle. Its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, who is scheduled to testify before Congress this week regarding the privacy of users\u2019 personal data, is on a mea culpa tour. In media interviews, he has said that he is even open to some regulation. Here, then, is one idea that could fix a lot of the emerging problems with Facebook and other internet mega-platforms as they find themselves in congressional cross hairs.Dating back to 1912, America has had legislation regulating media ownership. At first the primary concerns were about public safety, but they evolved into concerns about the diversity of media ownership and the character of media operators. As late as 2013, the Federal Communications Commission did not allow broadcast stations to have more than 25 percent foreign ownership. The airwaves were considered a public good, with restrictions on its use and operations considered appropriate.But despite its government roots and public funding, the internet has been treated like a private commercial network. Now is the time to reconsider that approach, especially in light of the central role tech platforms play in hosting public debate, providing news and disseminating political ads.Facebook and other major platforms are driven by algorithms designed to increase clicks. If you don\u2019t like President Trump, you will be served more and more anti-Trump articles as the algorithm tries to maximize your engagement, which in turn increases potential ad dollars. Revenue tied to sensational but phony news articles proved good for the bottom line. Until, that is, people started to complain, prompting fact-checking schemes, which in turn generated complaints about the political biases of those fact-checkers. In our ideologically diverse world, it\u2019s impossible for any single news distributor to fact-check and rank the news with complete objectivity.Historically, editors and not algorithms made news judgments at TV networks, radio stations, newspapers and magazines. The biases of different editors were balanced by rules that limited the power, reach and ownership of any single outlet, thus ensuring diversity of content.Now, suppose we looked at the internet not as the private preserve of a few huge corporations, but as a public good to be treated no differently from how we treated the licensing of radio and TV stations. We could create new rules intended to force the major internet companies like Facebook and Google to choose one of two paths. They could be fully responsible for all the content on their networks, subject to libel laws (which they are not now). Or they could operate more like broadband providers that license \u201cchannels\u201d to media companies that are responsible for their own content, in the way that cable TV companies agree to carry selected channels. My guess is that they would choose the latter.To stay in news distribution and yet avoid greater liability, they could step back from the editorial ranking business and adopt a system similar to what the government helped create with TV and radio. Following this approach, Facebook and Google, because of their unique market power in social and search, would each create a limited number of promoted but ideologically diverse news channels that could be auctioned off to responsible publishers, who would in turn agree to stringent fact-checking and content-responsibility rules. Violations of the rules would cost them their status as a certified channel.Users then would select which channels they wanted in their feeds or allow the internet platforms to pick a selection of those channels on the basis of expressed ideology or interests \u2014 political, sports or celebrity news, liberal versus conservative. Search results from the certified channels would be listed first, and posting of items from these sources would carry special status and priority over nonlicensed sources. The revenue model would also be shifted from individual articles that draw clicks to channels that would have to meet standards and could pay annual licensing fees to the platforms. The channels would make money by selling ads or charging for premium content.Some things wouldn\u2019t need to change. Unlicensed publishers and websites would still operate the way they do now but would not have the same priority and visibility. Facebook and the other big platforms would also continue to monitor individual users\u2019 posts for offensive or violent content. They could, however, focus more on identifying masked and fraudulent accounts. Much fake news comes from fake accounts, after all. As a prod, Congress should consider increasing fines against platforms that fail to verify the identities of social media accounts.These measures would treat the internet like the public good it is and should remain. They would also return much of the editorial job of curating and ranking content to editors and media organizations. The big internet companies could voluntarily adopt the new system without facing significant new regulation.But if the major platforms continue to try to serve as full-blown news distributors without accepting the full responsibilities of publishers, Congress should intervene to preserve information diversity and accountability in our marketplace of ideas.Mark Penn is the author, with Meredith Fineman, of \u201cMicrotrends Squared.\u201d He served as chief strategy officer for Microsoft from 2014 to 2016, and was a pollster and strategist for Bill and Hillary Clinton from 1995 to 2008.Advertisement"}

Along the way, he made time for Eric Garcetti, the mayor of Los Angeles; Leon Panetta, the former defense secretary; and Oprah Winfrey.The breadth and scope of the trip, which analysts described as extravagantly ambitious with few parallels in history, was on full display during the California leg of his journey. In Hollywood, the Saudis announced a deal with AMC to open the first movie theaters in the kingdom in decades, and reached pacts to open a Six Flags park and to host a Cirque du Soleil performance. In Silicon Valley, the prince discussed cloud computing services at Google headquarters and visited Apple, where he met with Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive.The tour came after a period in which the crown prince, who rose to next in line for the throne under his father King Salman last year, consolidated his power at home by jailing \u2014 in the Ritz Carlton hotel in Riyadh \u2014 some of the country\u2019s wealthiest businessmen, including members of the royal family. He has also been dogged by criticism from human rights activists for waging a war in Yemen that has killed thousands of civilians.But Prince Mohammed has been fully embraced by the Trump administration, which sees him as a reliable partner to push back on Iran, Saudi Arabia\u2019s chief rival in the Middle East, and for the most part his trip was not overshadowed by human rights concerns. In California, though, he met some dissenting voices and drew gatherings of protesters.Mayor Garcetti was one of the few luminaries who met with the prince and then spoke out in public about Yemen and other human rights issues.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)They\u2019ve overrun the streets of San Francisco, to the bemusement \u2014 and annoyance \u2014 of residents.Shared electric scooters are available to reserve and rent by app for as little as $1 a ride.

{"Headline": "When the Downstairs Neighbors Become Best Friends", "Date": "2018-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRentersWhen Zach Tan Strein, Corey Eisenberg and Alex Faoro signed the lease on a three-bedroom apartment on the border of Bedford-Stuyvesant and Bushwick, Brooklyn, last June, they didn\u2019t give much thought to who their downstairs neighbors would be.But within a few months, the residents of the five-bedroom duplex below became the defining element of their living experience \u2014 in a good way.\u201cWe have an open-door policy and basically share our spaces. We\u2019re all like roommates,\u201d Mr. Strein said. The setup is all the more serendipitous as the downstairs apartment was largely an agglomeration of subletters who found rooms on the Facebook group Gypsy Housing. They could hardly have been expected to become fast friends with each other, let alone the people upstairs.But become fast friends they did, after Mr. Eisenberg learned that the downstairs apartment had a washer and dryer. He decided to offer his services as a handyman in exchange for laundry rights.\u201cAnd then me and Vanessa started talking,\u201d Mr. Eisenberg said, referring to Vanessa Lopez, who shares the downstairs apartment with Tomas Virgadula, Christine Barringer, Helena Deda and a fifth roommate, who asked that his name not be used. Niko, Ms. Lopez\u2019s Bichon mix also lives with them. \u201cI think we have the same personality trait, where we\u2019ll talk to anyone who will talk to us.\u201dThe alliance was cemented by Mr. Faoro\u2019s Jura Impressa coffee maker, which was soon drawing the downstairs crew upstairs on a regular basis. And as they are the only two apartments in the building, it quickly seemed unnecessary to lock \u2014 or often even to shut \u2014 their doors.On a recent evening, Mr. Strein had prepared a dinner of spaghetti with tomato sauce and roasted broccoli, carrots, green beans and sweet potato wedges for his roommates in the open kitchen upstairs \u2014 one of the few requirements he and his roommates had when looking for a place.\u201cI also liked that it was unrenovated,\u201d Mr. Eisenberg said. \u201cIf I\u2019m looking at a place, I don\u2019t care if the paint is chipped or floors scratched because I\u2019ll fix it.\u201dMr. Virgadula, who moved to Brooklyn in 2011 to pursue an acting career, said that the apartment downstairs, which rents for $4,100 a month, was the first he had seen with a foyer.\u201cWhen I walked in for the first time, I was like, \u2018What is this space called?\u2019 Every other place I\u2019ve lived, you just walk straight into the kitchen,\u201d he said.The expansiveness of their shared living space \u2014 and the big backyard \u2014 has allowed the housemates to hold large gatherings: at a Chinese New Year party, for example, friends helped them make, and consume, 800 dumplings.It has also proved an ideal space for letting loose creative energies. Ms. Barringer, a seamstress and freelance costume technician, has ample space to work, as does Mr. Eisenberg, who does commercial design and fabrication, in addition to his own papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 projects.A few Saturdays ago, Mr. Strein, who interned at Dickson\u2019s, a butcher in Chelsea Market, used leftover beef tallow to make candles in the backyard. The following Saturday, he invited roommates to dye garments in a vat of natural black walnut dye he had prepared.Things have not been entirely rosy. On Christmas morning, Mr. Eisenberg discovered a bedbug in the apartment. He ran downstairs to tell Ms. Lopez, the only other person home. They decided to wait until the next day to tell the others, but immediately ran to Home Depot and started a massive cleaning.\u201cI was not about to live with bedbugs,\u201d Mr. Eisenberg said.With the help of an exterminator, they managed to wipe out the infestation in six weeks.\u201cIt brought us closer together,\u201d Mr. Faoro said.It also had the unintended consequence of flushing out the one roommate, an unpleasant downstairs tenant, whom none of them liked. (He opted to leave because he didn\u2019t want to deal with the bedbugs or the extermination.)Ms. Deda, who had become friends with Ms. Lopez while working at a nearby kava bar, had heard so many positive things about the house and its friendly, communal vibe that she moved in during the infestation.\u201cI was very tired of the situations I\u2019d been living in. The apartments I\u2019d had before, it felt like people are always trying to take advantage of you,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I went on Google and looked up \u2018bedbugs.\u2019 Of course, it gave me the worst situations, but I trusted Vanessa that it was not that bad.\u201dBefore moving into the house last June, Ms. Lopez said she had started to despair of ever finding a shared living situation where she could be happy. But she had lived in a studio when she first moved to New York and hated living alone.\u201cI\u2019d rather live with roommates, but it turned into a toxic situation so much of the time,\u201d she said. \u201cThis was the first house I moved into with strangers, and it\u2019s the best house I\u2019ve ever lived in.\u201dRelations are so good in the building, in fact, that there is even a cross-floor romance: Mr. Faoro and Ms. Deda recently started dating.\u201cI called that from day one,\u201d Mr. Eisenberg said, recalling how the first time Mr. Faoro saw Ms. Deda, he asked, \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201dKnow a renter with an interesting story?

{"Headline": "\u2018They Want to Block Our Future\u2019: Thousands Protest Russia\u2019s Internet Censorship", "Date": "2018-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 A demonstration in Moscow against the Russian government\u2019s effort to block the messaging app Telegram quickly morphed on Monday into a protest against President Vladimir V. Putin, with thousands of participants chanting against the Kremlin\u2019s increasingly restrictive bent.The key demand of the rally, with the hashtag #DigitalResistance, was that the Russian internet remain free from government censorship.The crowd responded with a resounding \u201cYes!\u201d to both questions.\u201cTelegram is just the first step,\u201d Mr. Smirnov continued. \u201cIf they block Telegram, it will be worse later. They will block everything. They want to block our future and the future of our children.\u201dThe rally comes two weeks after Roskomnadzor, the official internet watchdog, began its bumbling effort to shut down Telegram by blocking what the regulator said was some 18 million I.P. addresses.The F.S.B., the K.G.B.\u2019s successor agency, went to court to obtain the order to block the app after Pavel V. Durov, Telegram\u2019s inventor, a Russian who lives in exile, declined to provide the security agency with the means to decrypt messages. The F.S.B. said it needed to be able to read the messages to thwart terrorist attacks.\u201cWe do not consider this situation to be acceptable,\u201d Yandex said in a statement. \u201cThe Russian market can develop only in conditions of open competition.\u201dThe effort has provoked anger and frustration far beyond the habitual supporters of the political opposition, especially in the business sector, where the collateral damage continues to hurt the bottom line. There has been a flood of complaints on Twitter and elsewhere that the government \u201cbroke the internet.\u201d\u201cA large number of people are aware of the situation and they are not O.K. with it,\u201d said Nikita Likhachev, editor in chief of TJournal, an online publication covering internet culture, technology and politics.With no public accountability, nobody has any real sense of the scope of the shutdown, he said. \u201cThe whole point about the internet being broken in Russia is that we don\u2019t know what is happening and whether it can be fixed at all,\u201d Mr. Likhachev said.Countless people who play online games or use specialized services and tend to be apolitical, Mr. Likhachev said, have suddenly realized how much the government can affect their daily lives. \u201cThey have started asking questions about what is happening,\u201d he said.At the rally, which was peaceful, one hand-painted sign reflected that mood: \u201cThings are so bad that even introverts are here.\u201dNo arrests were reported.Various speakers and demonstrators said they had never been to any public demonstration before.Alexander Gornik, 34, a software entrepreneur, said many of the tools that his employees use for work, like Slack, Pipedrive and Tralier, were now inaccessible. To make high-quality software that can compete globally, Russia needs to be connected to the world, he said.\u201cThis is not just about Telegram, it is an attempt to isolate the Russian segment of the internet,\u201d Mr. Gornik said.Despite all the attention paid to Russian hacking and other expertise on the internet, the programmers at the government regulatory agency have not been capable of handling the complicated process of shutting down an app with international reach.\u201cRussia is at a crossroads \u2014 full-scale censorship has not yet been introduced,\u201d he wrote in one post. \u201cIf action is not taken, Russia will lose Telegram and other popular services.\u201dUnder sunny skies in the early afternoon, he posted again, writing: \u201cThousands of young and progressive people are at this moment speaking out in Moscow in defense of the internet. This is unprecedented.\u201dIn recent months, the Putin administration, particularly the Foreign Ministry, has repeatedly accused the West of \u201cRussophobia\u201d for sanctions and the general sour mood toward Russia.One rally organizer turned that accusation on its head, telling the demonstrators that it was various politicians and bureaucrats who were shutting down the internet who were really afraid of the Russian people. He began shouting the names of some of them followed by \u201cRussophobe,\u201d and the entire crowd chanted with him.There was no immediate government reaction to the protest.Many of the demonstrators carried paper airplanes, the symbol of Telegram, which whipped around above the heads of the crowd.The turnout of many thousands was particularly notable in that Monday was the start of a weeklong holiday, when Muscovites depart the city in droves for the country or abroad. A second rally is planned for Tuesday in St. Petersburg.Polina Oleinik, 17, and Polina Bulakh, 16, both students, said it was the first demonstration that they had ever attended.\u201cYoung people between the ages of 15 and 30 are very upset about this,\u201d Ms. Oleinik said. \u201cRussia must be a democratic country free of censorship. That is why we came.\u201dSophia Kishkovsky contributed reportingAdvertisement"}

Here\u2019s a selection, and her responses.Oh Allyson, just answering this question is giving me anxiety shivers! Time management is not my friend.I have some help with travel arrangements from The Times (and data scientists from Kayak, the travel aggregation site, who crafted an initial itinerary for me), so that\u2019s taken a burden off. I try to make sure I have three days of activities in a place, and a full day of writing, plus two mornings for editing and fact-checking. That isn\u2019t always possible so I\u2019m often squeezing writing and social media into whatever spare moment I have.I have two sacred times for myself: a weekly therapy call (this job is stressful!) and dinner. I\u2019m willing to pull an all-nighter as long as I can have an hour of eating good food and sipping wine very slowly.Most important, if I\u2019m somewhere incredibly beautiful, I pause to take a mental image and be grateful. Who knows when I\u2019ll be back to any of these places. That\u2019s precious time, too, and I don\u2019t want to waste it.Glad you asked, because I think about packing constantly! I\u2019ll go over more of this in a separate packing article to come, but I\u2019ve sent back maybe four shipments of stuff and the majority has been clothes. Cute dresses, cute shoes, cute jacket \u2014 all of it is gone.What I\u2019ve needed are items (mostly black) that can act as a uniform, layers to keep me warm, fast-drying underwear and a bra that won\u2019t dig into me on the plane. Toiletries, I\u2019m still carting around too many. I also joke that half the weight of my bag is tampons, but those aren\u2019t going anywhere.(For future breakfasts, I\u2019m looking forward to France and Italy, always, and China. Love egg and tomato and any breakfast foods with a kick of soy sauce.)So I was pretty stressed out when I got there. But the first thing I encountered was a bunch of women dancing around and singing by baggage claim. And through that encounter, I met everyone I hung out with on that trip. People were dealing with so much trauma and loss and yet I was welcomed into homes, onto farms, at parties.I hope everyone gets a chance to experience the warmth of Puerto Rico as I did.The healthy part, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m succeeding at. So. Many. Carbs! So. Little. Exercise.My mind, I have a better handle on. I\u2019ve cried a few times, and felt quite overwhelmed, but that\u2019s what phone calls to my therapist in New York City are for.I definitely encountered tons of uncomfortable sexualized situations when I was in my late teens and 20s and traveling solo. Either I\u2019m getting too old to get hit on or sadly, I\u2019ve gotten used to it. So far, nothing overt has happened, other than some construction workers in Chile relentlessly asking about my marital status. I let it slide because it just didn\u2019t seem worth the energy expenditure.When you say \u201cyoung,\u201d I\u2019m assuming you mean young enough to handle slightly rugged lodging. I\u2019d stay in hostels. They have a community around them, and you can form a buddy system with other solo female travelers. Hotels make it harder to have those kinds of interactions.When you\u2019re out, keep yourself on a two-drink regimen, for your sake and your buddy\u2019s, be mindful of being slipped drugs, and always have the club or restaurant call you a taxi home, unless you\u2019re ride-sharing and feel O.K. with that.About off-the-path destinations, I think the safest thing you can do is always make sure someone knows where you are: the innkeeper, plus a parent or a close friend who will know to sound the alarm if you go off the grid for too long.Safety is a huge concern for women (and often people of color and other minority groups), and I\u2019m not sure everyone gets that. Trust your gut and be as cautious as you feel like you need to be, even if people make fun of you.The worst trouble I\u2019ve gotten into while traveling has been when I\u2019ve tried to act like a local. Hang out with locals, but remember you\u2019re always a potential target.And try to have fun. It\u2019s possible, I promise!Hardest: Definitely safety concerns. There\u2019s a patina of anxiety that coats me every time I go out in an urban environment \u2014 especially since I\u2019m doing so much work with a phone and a camera that are ripe for getting snatched. It\u2019s infinitely better to walk around with someone else, not just for the warmth of companionship, but also to have the chance to relax into my environment a bit.Easiest: Not having to compromise and be on anyone else\u2019s schedule (except for my editor\u2019s). That probably says something about why I\u2019m still single!Hi Alyn, if you are the older woman in question, I say mazel! Happy to have a fellow adventuress on the road.Tour groups and activities like cooking classes are great ways to make friends while maintaining the independence of traveling alone. Europe by bicycle is my favorite way to see the countryside, and all the trips I\u2019ve taken have included active seniors.This time around, I\u2019ve hired private guides for wilderness hikes, both for the company and a fail-safe should anything go wrong.Also, say hi to the 30- and 40-somethings you meet. Chances are we think you\u2019re very cool.As an Asian woman who blends in easily in many eastern and Southeast Asian countries and has traveled to many of them, I always worry about how I\u2019m perceived and treated by locals. - Emily LHi Emily! I\u2019m half Chinese, but I don\u2019t read as \u201cAsian\u201d in China, so I can\u2019t speak to your experience of being able to blend. Chinese people can spot the pale, not-so-skinny American in me right away. I have, however, seen my dad encounter confusion and surprise that he doesn\u2019t speak the language. He\u2019s a scientist and is antisocial (sorry, Dad, it\u2019s true!), so he mostly runs off, which seems like a fine enough policy to me.The phenomenon of young white women writing about travel being easy doesn\u2019t seem as noticeable to me as young white men doing it. As you\u2019ve seen, a good deal of the questions here are women asking about safety while traveling solo. It\u2019s a pervasive concern and every time I don\u2019t see it mentioned in another writer\u2019s article, I feel a bit of a disconnect \u2014 as I\u2019m sure some people from other backgrounds feel while reading my work.I, for one, would love to experience what it\u2019s like to pass as an Asian local, to not be immediately marked as a tourist, to fly under the radar and observe subcultures unnoticed. Think of it as a blessing. Maybe you\u2019ll get some weird looks when people figure things out, but by that time, you\u2019ll be at an underground karaoke party.The bigger issue here seems to be that you aren\u2019t finding writing out there that jibes with your experience. It sounds like you want to change that. I\u2019d definitely be a reader.Well, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re not asking about the dating scene, because I\u2019ve sadly had no time for that!The easiest time I\u2019ve had making friends was on the adventure travel circuit of Chile, or any time I\u2019ve taken a tour. Activities are bonding; you\u2019ll likely find other single folks with similar interests. And the line, \u201cHey, so I\u2019m traveling the world by myself, where are you from?\u201d seems to work wonders at starting conversations.So far I\u2019ve been lucky in that the only language I\u2019ve been required to speak, other than English, has been Spanish. I\u2019m pretty rusty, but it\u2019s a language I started studying in first grade, as a requirement of New Mexico public schools \u2014 and I improved a lot over the course of my travels in Latin America. I\u2019ll be O.K. in places with French and Italian, too.Most places, I\u2019ve befriended native speakers who know English and have been happy to volunteer as interpreters.In my first instance of trying to talk to someone who spoke zero English, we spoke into Google Translate on my phone.Not that I know of, but political situations around the world change all the time, and quickly. I was vacationing in Delhi when the 2008 Mumbai attacks happened, and I was visiting a friend during several bombings in Kabul over Thanksgiving in 2012. Danger is real, but I\u2019ve got a pretty great support network at The Times to help me keep an eye on it.Definitely not. But the word \u201cessence\u201d is interesting here. If we think of it as the diffuse aroma of a perfume, perhaps a scent you remember deep in your brain, then it may be possible.So if I can give you, the reader, a detail to hang onto or tell a story that compels you travel to that place, or travel anywhere, then I\u2019ve done my job.A note to readers who are not subscribers: This article from the Reader Center does not count toward your monthly free article limit.Advertisement"}

If your lifestyle allows for that sort of a lack of planning, but you\u2019d rather ease into such a spontaneous adventure, there are several phone apps that can make unplanned travel feel less risky and more affordable.You have the option to search for airfare of a specific destination, or you can tap on the box that asks \u201cFlexible?\u201d From there, simply choose your time frame (either \u201canytime\u201d or any range up to 10 months in advance) and a length range (somewhere between a weekend and two weeks). You then set your home city; your destination can be either a specific city or \u201cAnywhere.\u201dI also tried the \u201cFlexible?\u201d option to see what it could offer me from my home base of New York. It provided a range of trips of varying length available over the next several months, from nine days in Denver for a round-trip price of $145 to seven days in Reykjavik for $205. These are great deals if you\u2019re free to go on the specified dates that accompany the airfare.Once you settle on a trip, you have the option to book directly on the app (note that the cheapest fares are often nonrefundable, as my Chicago one was).

Failure, being extolled, even celebrated? In a high school?Yes, in part because this is not a typical school. The center at suburban Mayfield City Schools, a district of 4,300 K-12 students 15 miles east of Cleveland, is a striking example of an approach to education that could eventually make traditional methods as outdated as chalk and blackboards.Mayfield\u2019s model is described as project-based, team-centered, career and industry-aligned learning.\u201cWe believe all students \u2014 beginning at a young age \u2014 need access to real-world, applied learning experiences that empower them to gain the skills they need to thrive in college, career and beyond.\u201dAt programs like Mayfield\u2019s \u2014 where 11 teachers have completed Project Lead the Way\u2019s certification since 2014 \u2014 that means not only access to state-of-the-art technology, but also partnerships with local organizations to provide those experiences. These include the Cleveland Clinic, which collaborated with the high school this semester in a six-week project in cardiopulmonary education.Eighty-seven students in grades 9 through 12 were assigned cases that required learning about the anatomy of the heart, as well as advanced medical technologies addressing heart disease. Working in teams of five or six, the students used materials like balsa wood and foam board to create three-dimensional models showing specific problems in the heart, and they became immersed in sophisticated virtual reality simulations that allowed them to see a stent being inserted into an occluded artery.\u201cIt\u2019s almost futuristic,\u201d Ms. Held said. \u201cEspecially compared to when I was in school.\u201dKeith Kelly, superintendent of the Mayfield City School District, said the center was \u201cabout getting kids involved in inquiry, in solving problems, in partnerships, in authentic projects that may be of interest to them.\u201dAnd it is not just the schools that are driving this.

These are learning environments that closely simulate various industries and professional settings, and include an app development lab, a credit union, a digital film studio and even a courtroom.All are supervised by teachers working with advisory boards and mentors from local industry, including such organizations as McDonnell Douglas, Caltech, Kaiser Permanente and Saatchi.Superintendent Brian McDonald calls it a \u201clinked learning\u201d approach \u2014 linking core academic content with a strong set of career technical education course and work-based learning opportunities. \u201cI really think this is the future of education,\u201d he said.Toyota has a number of initiatives aimed at funneling students into careers with the automaker, via partnerships with 256 high schools, summer internships for high school students, specialized degree tracks, and part-time employment at the college level and eventually, for those who finish the pathway, jobs.The company\u2019s $10.3 million commitment is intended to address what the program developer, Dennis Dio Parker, calls \u201cthe crisis level\u201d shortage of advanced manufacturing technicians facing his industry.\u201cThis is self-motivated change,\u201d said Mr. Parker, who is based at the automaker\u2019s Georgetown, Ky., production support center. \u201cInstead of complaining and griping and pontificating about the educational system, we realized that we had to do something about it.\u201dToyota, some say, is a model for other industries. \u201cThey send a clear signal to all employers that schools can\u2019t do this alone,\u201d said Vince Bertram, president and chief executive of Project Lead the Way. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to solve the skills gap, we have to work together.\u201dWhile many of these innovative programs are STEM-oriented, one partnership between higher and secondary education in Massachusetts seeks to address a different problem: a shortage of nonwhite teachers in the classroom.\u201cAs the number of students continues to diversify in terms of race, language and ethnicity, the teachers are still about 90 to 92 percent white,\u201d said Claudia Rinaldi, the director of the education department at Lasell College in Newton, Mass. (Nationwide, the number is about 85 percent.)Lasell\u2019s \u201cPathways to Teacher Diversity\u201d \u2014 part of a statewide effort supported by a Gates Foundation grant \u2014 is a partnership with four school districts in the state intended to encourage more high school students of color to pursue careers in education. \u201cResearch suggests that when these students have a teacher of color, they do better,\u201d Ms. Rinaldi said.An orientation meeting for the Pathways program a year ago attracted 160 students from the four districts. The first group of 12 is getting college credit for an introductory teaching course; an additional 26 are being mentored by Ms. Rinaldi\u2019s Lasell students.The long-term goal, she said, is to get these students to return, as certified teachers, to K-12 schools like the ones they attended. \u201cThe districts are hungry to diversify their teaching force.\u201dToday, most of the 600 students who attend City-as-School spend about two days per week in traditional classes at its Greenwich Village campus. The other three days, they are involved in internships with one of about 300 organizations \u2014 from the Metropolitan Museum of Art to Marvel Comics. There, the students are supervised by employees of the organization (who themselves go through special training), and also by City-as-School teachers who help their students work through the new and daily challenges of work life.\u201cWe have a very real world context for what they\u2019re learning,\u201d said the principal, Alan Cheng.And that was what the founders of City-as-School hoped to foster. The practicality and applicability of education are still the goal, as innovative school programs and their partners seek to reimagine the educational system in the 21st century. Or as another sign at the Mayfield Innovation Center reads (this one just outside the drafting and design lab, and attributed to Thomas Edison):Advertisement"}

Judge Richard J. Leon of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, who is presiding over the case, is expected to make a decision on the suit as early as the end of May.In cross-examination of Mr. Stephenson, the Justice Department\u2019s lead litigator, Craig Conrath, picked apart the portrayal of AT&T as under siege by Silicon Valley. Mr. Conrath said the key difference between AT&T and tech companies is that AT&T is in a powerful position as the company that provides broadband access to the internet \u2014 a service that Netflix and Amazon don\u2019t offer.Mr. Conrath also presented a friendly email from June 2017 between Mr. Stephenson and Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, in which Mr. Zuckerberg offered to help build AT&T\u2019s ad platform.

Mr. Zuckerberg was following up on a casual meeting the executives had during an annual media industry gathering of executives in Sun Valley, Idaho, he said.The key disadvantage that AT&T and Time Warner face is their slow start in behavioral advertising and marketing, Mr. Stephenson said. Both companies do not collect or analyze the habits of television and web users in the same way that Comcast does with cable subscribers and that Google and Facebook do on their platforms.Mr. Stephenson said Netflix, Amazon, Google and Facebook are all investing in premium video content to collect increasing amounts of data on users who would spend longer times on their sites and visit more often.The AT&T chief spent much of his time talking about the history of the company. He spoke directly to Judge Leon to explain the company\u2019s evolution from a phone company to one that seeks to make money from advertising and subscriptions for consumers who will watch much of their videos on mobile devices.Mr. Stephenson attacked the Justice Department\u2019s underlying theory that the company would threaten to withhold Time Warner content to raise prices on other cable and satellite distributors.

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 What might happen to Amazon\u2019s bottom line if it paid its workers more?\u2022 Sears shares jumped after ESL called on the Sears to sell the Kenmore brand.\u2022 Walmart is said to be close to gaining a majority stake in Flipkart.\u2022 Mike Bloomberg opened his wallet for climate change.\u2022 Learn more about \u201ctransshipping,\u201d one of President Trump\u2019s big trade bugbears.What might happen to Amazon\u2019s bottom line if it paid its workers more? This question may become more pressing if labor shortages start to force companies to up their pay to attract and retain employees.Amazon does not disclose its total compensation expense, so it\u2019s not possible for outsiders to accurately compute what would happen to profits if it raised pay.But the disclosure of median pay provides a little insight. Under S.E.C. rules, public companies must now disclose the median pay figure for all their employees. In annual filings, that number is then compared with the pay of the chief executive. In Amazon\u2019s case, the $1,681,840 that Jeff Bezos earned in 2017 was 59 times that of the median employee, a lower ratio than exists at other large public companies.One way to get a rough proxy for a company\u2019s overall compensation expense is to multiply its median pay number by its total number of employees. For Amazon, that would produce a purely hypothetical compensation expense of $16.1 billion (566,000 employees times $28,466.)Increasing Amazon\u2019s median pay number by 10 percent would bump the $28,466 up to $31,313, and the putative compensation expense would rise to $17.7 billion. Such an increase would have cut Amazon\u2019s $3.8 billion of pretax income in 2017 by 42 percent to $2.2 billion. A 20 percent raise would have slashed those earnings by 85 percent.How does Amazon stack up against Walmart? The C.E.O. of Walmart, Doug McMillion, made $22.8 million in the company\u2019s latest fiscal year. That sum was 1,188 times as large as the median employee\u2019s pay of $19,177 (a number that excludes some foreign employees.)At Walmart, increasing the hypothetical compensation expense would have less of an impact on earnings. A 10 percent increase would reduce Walmart\u2019s latest annual pretax profits by 28 percent, while a 20 percent pay increase would lower profits by 56 percent.There are two ways to view such numbers. One is that retail is a cutthroat business and wages cannot rise by much if a company is going to be healthily profitable. The other is that large retailers have used their heft to lower as many of their costs as possible, including wages.\u2014 Peter Eavis\u2022 Net profit jumped 73% to $9.4 billion in the first quarter, up from $5.4 billion a year ago.\u2022 Earnings per share came in at $13.33 per share, beating analyst estimates of $9.28 per share.\u2022 The company reported a $3 billion, or about $3.40 a share, gain on equity securities in the first quarter.\u2022 Sales rose to $31.1 billion, beating the consensus estimate of $30.3 billion.Shares of Alphabet bounced around after hours. The stock rose as much as 2.2 percent but is now down slightly.Critics\u2019 cornerRobert Cryan of Breakingviews writes:\u201cThe tech group\u2019s $9.4 billion of earnings in the first quarter came with new noise after it adjusted the way it accounts for investments like ride-hailing app Uber, moved some smart-home appliances into Google and started stressing \u201cimpressions\u201d over clicks. Investors wanting concrete measurements are getting squishy ones instead.\u201dShares of Sears Holding are up about 4 percent in recent trading on Mr. Lampert\u2019s latest attempt to save the troubled retailer.In a letter to the Sears board, Mr. Lampert, whose ESL Investments hedge fund owns a controlling stake in the company, said ESL would also be willing to buy the retailer\u2019s home-services and its appliance-parts units.Mr. Lampert offered to pay Sears $500 million for the home-services and appliance-parts units, but did not mention a price for the Kenmore brand or the real estate. He noted that the company had been trying to sell the assets for nearly two years, but had failed to find other buyers.Mr. Lampert is Sears\u2019s chief executive. Any deal involving Sears and Mr. Lampert is complicated by his dual roles running both the retailer and the hedge fund, which is also a major Sears lender.Mr. Lampert said in his letter that he would recuse himself from any board discussions about his proposal. Any deal would need to be approved by a majority of Sears shareholders not affiliated with ESL, the letter said.\u2014 Michael CorkeryMargrethe Vestager, the European Union\u2019s competition commissioner, said in a statement:\u201cThe way people listen to music has changed significantly in recent years, with more and more Europeans using music streaming services. Our investigation aims to ensure that music fans will continue to enjoy attractive music streaming offers and won\u2019t face less choice as a result of this proposed merger.\u201dThe European Commission is concerned that Shazam\u2019s strong position in music recognition would enable Apple to \u201cobtain access to commercially sensitive data about customers of its competitors.\u201d\u201cAccess to such data could allow Apple to directly target its competitors\u2019 customers and encourage them to switch to Apple Music. As a result, competing music streaming services could be put at a competitive disadvantage.\u201dThe European Commission has until Sept. 4 to finish its investigation.Apple reached a deal to buy Shazam for roughly $400 million in December.Why it\u2019s important: Both Walmart and Amazon have hungrily watched India, where the e-commerce market trails only the U.S. and China in terms of size but where foreign retailers have struggled. But don\u2019t expect Amazon, Flipkart\u2019s biggest rival, to give up.What the parties said about the deal\u2022 Michael Polk, Newell\u2019s C.E.O.: \u201cThis agreement will enable the Company to now focus exclusively on the execution of our transformation plans and our efforts to strengthen our financial and operational performance.\u201d\u2022 Mr. Icahn: \u201cI am pleased that we were able to facilitate peace between the company and Starboard.

And he\u2019s willing to put his own money to work as well.Mike Schroepfer, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, will appear on Thursday before the British government committee investigating fake news and social media following the Cambridge Analytica scandal. (No Mark Zuckerberg this time.)The issue: Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks appear rooted in personal animus, clouding what others feel are legitimate criticisms. Matt Stoller of the Open Markets Institute told the NYT, \u201cWhat he\u2019s doing is a threat to democracy, but so is Amazon.\u201dThe problem: Customers often aren\u2019t notified when money is transferred; customers are subjected to phishing attacks that drain money from their accounts; buyers have no protections if sellers don\u2019t provide paid-for goods.Why it matters: Banks want their share of digital payments, and 18 so far have signed up with Zelle.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Workers of Silicon Valley, It\u2019s Time to Organize", "Date": "2018-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftDear tech workers,Long year, huh?I get it. Your industry is under siege. Whether you work at an established giant like Facebook or Google, a private company like Uber or Palantir, or a lesser-known start-up, it feels like you\u2019re being attacked from a thousand directions. People are comparing your companies to Big Tobacco, and Congress is accusing your executives of undermining democracy, poisoning users\u2019 brains and censoring content.All of a sudden, Silicon Valley \u2014 once the golden child of American industry \u2014 has become a villain.Some of the backlash probably feels excessive. After all, the tech industry still creates useful things and employs lots of decent and ethical people. But I\u2019ve talked to a number of tech workers recently, and I\u2019ve seen you wrestling with your consciences. Some of you have stopped wearing your company T-shirts around town, fearing dirty looks from strangers. Others have taken extended vacations after a particularly shameful scandal, or asked for a transfer within a company. More than a few of you have had awkward conversations with your parents.Here\u2019s the thing, though. You don\u2019t have to keep your concerns bottled up.You are your employers\u2019 most valuable assets, and your bosses are desperate to keep you happy. As tech companies take on increasingly vital roles in global commerce and culture, you have the power to shape the way they operate and the ethical standards they uphold.If you want change, all you have to do is organize and speak up.In most industries, rank-and-file workers don\u2019t have much say. The power of organized labor in America has been shrinking since the 1980s, and other than a few notable teachers\u2019 strikes this year, large-scale collective action is rare these days.\u201cTech workers are the only point of leverage on these big companies,\u201d said Maciej Ceg\u0142owski, the founder of the social bookmarking service Pinboard.Mr. Ceg\u0142owski, who has started an advocacy organization called Tech Solidarity, said that the typical instruments used to rein in corporate misbehavior \u2014 customer boycotts, shareholder activism and outside regulation \u2014 aren\u2019t likely to work on the largest Silicon Valley companies.Instead, change at these companies will need to come from the inside.\u201cEven a couple hundred employees working in concert could bring a site like Google to its knees,\u201d Mr. Ceg\u0142owski said.But these are just warm-up skirmishes. For maximum impact, tech workers will need to scrutinize not just their employers\u2019 government ties, but their products, business models, and basic standards. And they\u2019ll need to do it in public.Without Ms. Fowler\u2019s brave disclosure \u2014 and her colleagues\u2019 willingness to back her up after she went public \u2014 it\u2019s entirely possible that Mr. Kalanick would still be Uber\u2019s chief executive and the company would still be run by boorish bros.Typically, when workers speak out or organize, it\u2019s because they want higher wages, better working conditions or stronger job security. Those aren\u2019t your problems. You probably work manageable hours in tastefully decorated buildings with free food, ergonomic desk furniture and plentiful amenities. Your compensation is generous. And you\u2019re in little danger of being fired or retaliated against, especially if you\u2019re part of a large group.And that\u2019s before we even get to the thorny ethical debates surrounding technologies like artificial intelligence, in which companies\u2019 goals \u2014 amass huge amounts of data to help train increasingly sophisticated machine learning models \u2014 may be at odds with what\u2019s good for society.That leaves an opening for you.\u201cIt\u2019s not clear where the pressure\u2019s going to come from otherwise,\u201d said Leslie Berlin, a Stanford historian who has studied Silicon Valley\u2019s labor culture.These groups are still small, and none has produced concrete results yet. But they are early signs that greater political consciousness is stirring in the industry.In a tech-dominated world, when the decisions made by a handful of Silicon Valley executives have the ability to reshape nations and transform billions of lives, there\u2019s no better time to stand up. Together, you can encourage your employers to behave in ethical and humane ways, and blow the whistle publicly when they fall short.Organizing yourselves to push for change isn\u2019t just a viable option \u2014 it might be the only way out of this mess.Godspeed,KevinAn earlier version of this column misstated when Tech Action began meeting in New York. It was last year, not this year.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Zuckerberg Faces Hostile Congress as Calls for Regulation Mount", "Date": "2018-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 After two days and more than 10 hours of questioning of Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook chief executive, there was widespread consensus among lawmakers that social media technology \u2014 and its potential for abuse \u2014 had far outpaced Washington and that Congress should step in to close the gap.But the agreement largely ended there. For lawmakers, the calculus is tricky: They do not want to infringe on First Amendment rights or hurt Silicon Valley innovation but are also unsure how to regulate this new breed of company, which wields enormous power by collecting vast amounts of private data from billions of consumers.\u201cWhile Facebook has certainly grown, I worry it has not matured,\u201d said Representative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon and the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. \u201cI think it is time to ask whether Facebook may have moved too fast and broken too many things.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg, composed but noncommittal about making any sweeping privacy changes, conceded that it was \u201cinevitable that there will need to be some regulation.\u201d\u201cThe American people are concerned about how Facebook protects and profits from its users\u2019 data,\u201d Mr. Walden said. \u201cDoes Congress need to clarify whether or not consumers own or have any real power over their online data?\u201dWhether Congress can actually mobilize to put new controls into place is an open question. This week, two privacy bills were introduced to coincide with the hearings. One would make it harder to collect data on students who use classroom technology like tablets and laptops. Another would require companies to obtain clear permission from users before collecting and sharing their data.At least three lawmakers have said privately that they are drafting new privacy laws for internet companies. Representative Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, for instance, is pushing a bill she introduced last year that would require broadband providers and internet companies like Facebook to get permission before sharing user data. And late Wednesday, Facebook said it would no longer back the opposition to the California Consumer Privacy Act, a state ballot measure meant to offer consumer protections for personal information.On Wednesday, Ms. Blackburn pressed Mr. Zuckerberg about whether he would support her legislation, asking: \u201cWho do you think owns an individual\u2019s presence online? Who owns their virtual you? Is it you or is it them?\u201dWith more contrition and promises to work harder to protect consumers, Mr. Zuckerberg stayed close to the prepared talking points he has used since the breach came to light. \u201cIt will take some time to work through all of the changes we need to make, but I\u2019m committed to getting it right,\u201d he said.Mr. Zuckerberg also revealed that his own personal data had been compromised by third-party actors, though he did not identify which company was responsible. He said Facebook was considering legal action against Cambridge Analytica.His testimony did little to mollify lawmakers, who called for new regulations that would limit Facebook\u2019s ability to collect data on users without permission and to make privacy policies clear to better empower consumers.\u201cThis incident demonstrates yet again that our laws are not working,\u201d said Representative Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the House committee.Despite the consensus that legislation is needed, there is no clear path forward on any of the proposals. The regulation most likely to pass after the hearings is a Senate bill that would require social media companies to disclose funding of political ads on their sites.Facebook and Twitter have recently announced their support of the bill, called the Honest Ads Act, which is modeled after disclosure rules for broadcasters. Several internet companies, including Facebook, had lobbied aggressively to defeat any new rules for online political ads, but have since changed their positions.For many lawmakers, even defining what Facebook is and how to place it within the regulatory ecosystem was a challenge.\u201cWhat exactly is Facebook?\u201d Mr. Walden asked, listing industries like advertising, publishing and even telecommunications, asking whether the company was a \u201ccommon carrier in the information age.\u201dThe definitions matter. If Facebook is viewed as a telecommunications service that is more like a utility, it may be regulated by the Federal Communications Commission. If lawmakers define Facebook as a publisher, it could also fall under regulations at that agency.Mr. Zuckerberg was careful not to put his company in a clear regulatory category.\u201cI consider us to be a technology company,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg replied. Facebook should be responsible for what it publishes, he said, but it was not a news media company. \u201cThe primary thing we do is have engineers that write code and build services for other people.\u201dBut the hearings helped create a foundation for new rules in the future, experts said. Congress showed an increasing ease \u2014 particularly from important Republicans in both chambers \u2014 to regulate Silicon Valley.\u201cLonger term, we saw growing comfort on both sides of the aisle for privacy legislation,\u201d said Alan Davidson, a former internet policy official in the Obama administration and a former executive at Google. \u201cSo this is not the last we\u2019ve heard from Washington.\u201dFor Mr. Zuckerberg, who has been warmly welcomed by world leaders in China and India, it was clear that Facebook had few friends in Washington, particularly in the House. The company has invested heavily in its lobbying of Congress and the administration. Lobbying expenditures in 2017 increased 32 percent to $11.5 million from the previous year. But it has struggled to shake impressions among some Republicans that the site and its employees have a liberal bias. Democrats who were once close to Silicon Valley have become vocal critics of social media platforms for allowing fake political news and foreign interference in the 2016 presidential election.On Wednesday, House lawmakers from both parties took an aggressive stance toward Mr. Zuckerberg, pointing fingers, interrupting and chastising him for repeated failures \u2014 and apologies \u2014 over privacy.Representative Jan Schakowsky, Democrat of Illinois, used a sizable chunk of her limited speaking time to list Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s past apologies.Representative Bobby L. Rush, Democrat of Illinois, repeatedly pointed a finger at Mr. Zuckerberg when asking, in a raised voice, \u201cWhy is the onus on the user to opt in to privacy and security settings?\u201dThe second day of marathon hearings came after more subdued questioning from the Senate. But some key Republican senators also signaled a desire for regulations on Silicon Valley.Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said after the hearing on Tuesday that Facebook was a \u201cvirtual monopoly\u201d and that \u201ccontinued self-regulation is not the right answer when it comes to dealing with the abuses we have seen on Facebook.\u201dThe hearings also revealed lingering suspicion of Facebook among Republicans. Out in the hall during a break in the hearing, Representative Billy Long, Republican of Missouri, expanded on his remarks about Facebook\u2019s treatment of Diamond and Silk, two pro-Trump video personalities who have complained about being censored by the platform. The online personalities were brought up numerous times on Wednesday.\u201cIt seems like they take down a lot more conservative content than they do liberal,\u201d Mr. Long said.Mr. Long said that he needed more answers about the particular situation, and that he hoped Mr. Zuckerberg could ensure that the company\u2019s thousands of moderators were not biased against conservatives.\u201cHe better hope he does it, not us,\u201d Mr. Long added. \u201cOr Congress is going to get involved, and regulate a private industry.\u201dNicholas Fandos contributed reporting from Washington, and Tiffany Hsu from New York.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Breaking Into the Boom in Escape Rooms: What Entrepreneurs Need to Know", "Date": "2018-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEntrepreneurshipHijacked airplanes, derailed subway cars and trapped submarines are usually the stuff of nightmares. A growing number of entrepreneurs, though, are catering to customers willing to pay to escape these types of situations for fun.Escape rooms are adventure games in which teams of friends, family or colleagues work together to find clues and solve puzzles to escape a simulated danger before time runs out.\u201cWe spend so much time in solitary screen-based worlds, so it is magical when people from a wide range of ages come together and solve a challenge,\u201d said Scott Nicholson, a professor at Wilfrid Laurier University in Ontario who teaches a course in creating escape rooms.The vast majority of escape rooms in the United States are mom-and-pop operations with one or two sites, Ms. Spira said. From chains to smaller outfits, the format is similar. A group of about four to eight people play an hourlong game that could include escaping a prison, evading a serial killer or finding a cure to a deadly disease. Once one puzzle in the escape room is solved, a clue unlocks the next challenge. Hidden doors often reveal new spaces such as secret passageways as the game proceeds.The outcome is not guaranteed. If players get stuck, escape room staff, often in character, provide hints. The success rate varies, but only about 30 percent to 50 percent of participants escape a given room in the time allotted, Ms. Spira said.Admission usually ranges from $20 to $45 per person, with escape rooms in bigger cities usually charging more. Some business owners earn close to a half-million dollars a year, Mr. Spira said, although getting accurate data is difficult because the companies are private and do not release financial figures.Well-designed games draw on many types of knowledge, so all players have a chance for a \u201chero moment,\u201d said Summer Herrick, a co-founder of Locurio, an escape room in Seattle.\u201cEveryone likes to feel smart, and there is an adrenaline rush of solving a puzzle without the risk of, say, sky diving or spelunking,\u201d Ms. Herrick said.Escape rooms evolved from video games, like the Crimson Room and the Rusty Lake series, that involve puzzles and group adventures. The first real-life escape room was created by a company called Scrap in Kyoto, Japan, in 2007. Scrap opened an escape room in San Francisco in 2012 and now has three in the United States, which the company said about 50,000 people visited in 2017.Pioneering American companies like the Escape Game and Escape the Room can now be found in cities like Houston, Nashville and Orlando, Fla. In the early days, several developed a niche, such as the Basement in Los Angeles and Las Vegas, which became quickly known for its actor-driven horror games.Now, many who played an escape room are creating their own. \u201cBut having $10,000, a dream and some moxie isn\u2019t necessarily enough to make a business,\u201d Mr. Spira said.Successful entrepreneurs have relevant backgrounds like engineering and psychology and the ability to learn a variety of new skills, like accounting, game design and set building.Andrew Preble, who founded Escape My Room in New Orleans, drew on his past working at a technology start-up and operating a restaurant in Berlin. Mr. Preble opened his first escape room in 2015 and now has four games that revolve around mysterious events that happen to a fictional old New Orleans family called the DeLaportes, inspired by Marguerite Delaporte, one of the conspirators accused of poisoning Louis XIV in the 1600s.Mr. Preble said he knew starting a new business would be hard, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t expect it to be as popular as quickly as it was.\u201dDemand was high enough that six months after opening a room called the Jazz Parlor in 2016, Mr. Preble built a nearly identical room for corporate groups and birthday parties. The average number of monthly visitors increased 29 percent from 2016 to 2017, Mr. Preble said, and his team now includes eight full-time and eight part-time employees.Despite the rising popularity, getting a bank loan to finance the business can be a challenge, Mr. Preble said. \u201cLenders still don\u2019t exactly understand what escape rooms are, so it\u2019s difficult to assign value to this as an asset,\u201d he said.Innovation is crucial to hooking repeat customers, especially as more escape room companies enter the market. Some are adding new rooms, switching games more frequently or using more actors and more elaborate props to increase the immersive quality of the experience.And entrepreneurs find they have to be handy. When Derek Tam started Mission Escape Games with a longtime friend, he built the sets himself. Now, he hires employees with experience building immersive attractions at amusement parks to do the work. His company\u2019s five outposts include one in Anaheim, Calif., not far from Disneyland.Escape rooms are also sprucing up related amenities like conference rooms for corporate groups or those celebrating special events.\u201cPart of the fun is having dinner or drinks with your friends or colleagues afterward and reliving your experience after the fact,\u201d Mr. Spira said, who played 250 rooms in 2017 with his wife for their blog.Stuart Bogaty, who started Trap\u2019t in Stamford, Conn., with his wife and three daughters, opened his business in 2016 with two \u201cclean and light\u201d conference rooms, in addition to four escape rooms. \u201cI had seen escape rooms that were a bit dark and kind of dumpy,\u201d he said, adding that his attention to detail has helped draw groups from corporations like Indeed, Mastercard and Vineyard Vines.Mr. Bogaty has not done any direct marketing to corporate groups, focusing instead on Google and Facebook advertisements and on customer service.Word-of-mouth advertising and online reviews have been critical, he said. Strong Google reviews have had the most impact because they affect where a company shows up in searches.\u201cHow you respond to reviews makes a big difference,\u201d Mr. Bogaty said. \u201cEven a bad review \u2014 if you respond to it appropriately \u2014 can help your business.\u201dEntrepreneurs in cities with large numbers of tourists, like Mr. Preble in New Orleans, also draw players by leaving fliers in hotels.The newest wave of entrepreneurs is bringing escape rooms into players\u2019 homes.Juliana Patel and Ariel Rubin of Los Angeles loved escape rooms but found it trickier to get out and play once they had children. They set out in 2016 to raise $19,500 on Kickstarter for their home version, Escape Room in a Box. They surged past $135,000.One of their Kickstarter supporters was a Mattel game designer, who brought the toymaker on board to license their game.\u201cWe know that all consumers are gravitating toward social play,\u201d said Ray Adler, a senior director of global marketing at Mattel. \u201cPeople love to test themselves and do things together.\u201dMs. Patel and Ms. Rubin are busy working on their next boxed game, but they also design escape rooms for various customers, including companies marketing a new product or film or charities looking for an unusual activity at fund-raisers.Few escape room entrepreneurs can rest on their laurels, however.\u201cWhat\u2019s good now won\u2019t be that great in a year,\u201d Mr. Spira said. \u201cCompanies that figure out that it\u2019s not just about making an excellent game but creating an experience that makes customers feel good even if they didn\u2019t escape, that\u2019s the key.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Twitter Stays on an Upswing, With Its Second Straight Quarter of Profit", "Date": "2018-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe social media company answered on Wednesday with its latest quarterly earnings that showed it was still on an upswing.The results surpassed the expectations of financial analysts, and show that even as regulators worldwide turn a more skeptical eye toward social media companies like Twitter and Facebook over privacy concerns and for not doing enough to prevent the spread of misinformation and hate speech, their core advertising-driven businesses are in good shape.Twitter\u2019s stock has more than doubled in value in the last 12 months as the company has undergone a perception shift on Wall Street. While Twitter once struggled to keep up with lofty expectations for user growth, investors now no longer expect the company to be a growth rocket and instead see it as one that may cut its spending to become more profitable.\u201cThey\u2019re not going to become the bright shiny object that they were,\u201d said Brian Wieser, a senior analyst at Pivotal Research who specializes in the technology sector. \u201cBut they\u2019re good enough.\u201dYoussef Squali, a managing director and senior analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, said of Twitter, \u201c2018 is going to be the year they put their house in order, improve their performance for advertisers and see their revenues grow.\u201dThe service provided by Twitter is mostly unchanged from last quarter; analysts said the company had just become more efficient at filling the niche it had found.In the social media industry, where user numbers spike in a moment and collapse just as quickly, and where Twitter has to compete against the behemoths of Facebook and Google, stability is almost the strangest thing to see.\u201cThey\u2019re kind of at the point of normalcy,\u201d Mr. Wieser said.Advertisement"}

He used an iPhone.As the reach and influence of Silicon Valley\u2019s tech giants have increased, so have the calls to boycott their products and services. The problem is that pulling off a boycott is not exactly easy: The tech companies\u2019 products are so pervasive that they are difficult to avoid.\u201cIt\u2019s exactly the same company. I realize it\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d said Sachi Cunningham, a documentary filmmaker in San Francisco who deactivated her Facebook last week and shifted her attention to Instagram, where, she said, the conversation is less toxic.Ms. Cunningham, who has freelanced for The New York Times, added that she had immediately begun missing Facebook as a research tool for her documentaries. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can get out of the ecosystem,\u201d she said.People looking to punish major tech companies by abstaining from their products have been bedeviled time and again by the difficulty in escaping them. After Google fired an engineer, James Damore, for criticizing the company\u2019s diversity efforts last year, hundreds of people on social media called for a boycott of the company. But an analysis of nearly 7,000 tweets using the hashtag #BoycottGoogle since August showed that 26 percent of the tweets came from devices using Google\u2019s Android software, according to Keyhole, a social-media research firm.One Twitter account named Milton Prescott tweeted on Aug. 8: \u201cGoogle\u2019s firing of James Damore proves his point completely. I will no longer be using Google for any services. #BoycottGoogle.\u201d The tweet came from an Android device. A message to the account went unreturned.Marisa Richardson, a program manager at a life-sciences company, said she began boycotting Amazon recently after learning that it offered the NRA channel on its streaming-video service. So when she needed laundry detergent, she avoided the e-commerce site and instead braved the crowds and traffic \u2014 and spent a few dollars more \u2014 at a nearby Target.But a few days later she shopped at the Whole Foods near her home in Oakland, Calif. \u201cI completely forgot that they\u2019re owned by Amazon,\u201d she said.After the shooting in Parkland in February, gun-control activists called for a boycott of certain Apple and Amazon services because they hosted the NRA channel.\u201cHad I sent the same tweets from an Android phone, the same issue would apply. There is an NRATV app for Android phones,\u201d Ms. Milano said through a spokeswoman. \u201cWe are only just beginning to understand how these companies have infiltrated not only our ideologies, but also our lives in the most in-depth way imaginable.\u201dNearly a third of the 4,700 tweets using the #BoycottApple hashtag since August came from iPhones, according to Keyhole.\u201cI do have an iPhone, but as a customer of Apple\u2019s, am I not allowed to hold them accountable?\u201d Mr. Knight, the activist who used an iPhone to call for an Apple boycott, said in an interview.Many of those who recently abandoned their Facebook accounts are still in the company\u2019s orbit, not only with Instagram but also with the company\u2019s popular messaging apps WhatsApp and Messenger.When Cher recently deleted her Facebook page, she said on Twitter, \u201c2day I did something VERY HARD 4 me.\u201d But her Instagram account, with 768,000 followers, was still active.Stephen Cox, 39, a woodworker in Los Angeles, recently posted on Facebook that he was deactivating his account in favor of Instagram.

{"Headline": "Kevin\u2019s Week in Tech: Let\u2019s Check In on the Other Social Networks, Shall We?", "Date": "2018-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHello again! I write to you this week from my underground bunker, deep below The New York Times\u2019s headquarters, where I\u2019ve gone to avoid all news about Kanye West\u2019s political views.Facebook\u2019s continued dominance shouldn\u2019t be a shock. The company\u2019s customers are advertisers, not users. And as long as Facebook is still working for advertisers \u2014 in other words, as long as the company is able to deliver targeted ads with a better return on investment than any other platform except, possibly, Google \u2014 there\u2019s no reason for them to go elsewhere.Despite my unhealthy obsession with Facebook, this week I\u2019m actually more interested in what happened with the other big social networks (Twitter, Snapchat and YouTube).That profit was minuscule by Facebook standards: just $61 million in the quarter, compared with the $3 billion Facebook pulled in. But the fact that Twitter is in the black at all is enough to stave off the doomsday narrative that once swirled around it.Interestingly, one of the factors driving Twitter\u2019s growth this time around is strong performance in its data licensing business, which has grown 20 percent year over year.So why is it trying again?Zoom out a bit, and you can see the bigger shift at work here. After an attempt to distinguish itself from platforms like Instagram and Facebook \u2014 both of which feature algorithmically sorted feeds that intermingle content from your friends and content from celebrities and publishers \u2014 Snap may be finding that users liked Snapchat better when it was more like every other social feed.YouTube, which has long insisted that it\u2019s not a social network, is yet another example of a social platform\u2019s prospering financially despite deepening mistrust among users.More broadly, despite not thinking of itself as a social network, YouTube is perhaps the network that is most similar to Facebook right now, in terms of the challenges it faces and the disconnect between what many of its users want (more active moderation, less objectionable content) and what investors want (more of the same, please!).I\u2019m predisposed to disagree with that kind of generalized argument. Despite everything we\u2019ve learned this year, I still believe that social networks, when designed and managed properly, can be a positive force. Moreover, I\u2019m skeptical that getting users to boycott these services is possible, given how addictive they are.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "YouTube Is Improperly Collecting Children\u2019s Data, Consumer Groups Say", "Date": "2018-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA coalition of more than 20 consumer advocacy groups is expected to file a complaint with federal officials on Monday claiming that YouTube has been violating a children\u2019s privacy law.The complaint contends that YouTube, a subsidiary of Google, has been collecting and profiting from the personal information of young children on its main site, although the company says the platform is meant only for users 13 and older.The coalition of consumer groups said YouTube failed to comply with the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act, a federal law that requires companies to obtain consent from parents before collecting data on children younger than 13. The groups are asking for an investigation and penalties from the Federal Trade Commission, which enforces the law.\u201cGoogle has been continually growing its child-directed service in the United States and all over the world without any kind of acknowledgment of this law and its responsibilities,\u201d said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, one of the groups leading the coalition. \u201cIt\u2019s living in a world of online fiction and denied that it\u2019s serving children.\u201dYouTube defines its main site and app as destinations for viewers 13 and older. It directs younger children to the stand-alone YouTube Kids app, which contains a filtered set of videos from the main site.YouTube\u2019s distinction between its main product and YouTube Kids is significant because of the rules on disclosure and parental consent that kick in for sites with \u201cactual knowledge\u201d that they are trafficking in the personal information of children under 13.In the complaint that will be filed on Monday with the commission, the advocacy groups say YouTube is able to collect data on children under 13 through its main site, where cartoons, nursery-rhyme videos and those ever-popular toy-unboxing clips garner millions of views.The groups say this kind of tracking requires parental notification and consent first. While companies can collect some of that information from children to deliver relevant ads, they are supposed to obtain parental consent to use it for more tailored purposes, like behavioral advertising or profiles of individuals. The YouTube Kids app, for example, specifies in its privacy policy that it \u201cdoes not allow interest-based advertising or re-marketing.\u201d\u201cWe haven\u2019t received the letter yet but look forward to reviewing it,\u201d a spokeswoman for the Federal Trade Commission said in an email. She added that the commission took enforcement of Coppa \u201cvery seriously\u201d and had brought more than two dozen cases tied to the rule.YouTube provided an emailed statement that said the platform had not yet received the complaint but that \u201cprotecting kids and families has always been a top priority for us.\u201dJosh Golin, executive director of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood who is also leading the coalition, said YouTube had been \u201cactively packaging under-13 content for advertisers.\u201dMr. Golin said he believed that YouTube was aware it was collecting and monetizing the data of children with such videos, and that the company should simply shift all the videos aimed at children to the YouTube Kids app.\u201cWe know kids are primarily consuming this through iPads and mobile phones, which are not particularly conducive to group watching,\u201d Mr. Golin said.Dylan Collins, chief executive of SuperAwesome, a privacy technology firm used by companies that market to children, said questions around data collection would only grow as children continued to flood huge tech platforms that were built for adults.\u201cSilicon Valley now has a responsibility to figure out how to move from building adult tech into building kid tech,\u201d Mr. Collins said. \u201cI don\u2019t think any company, whether it\u2019s Facebook or YouTube or Snapchat, can hide from the fact that there are about 10 times more kids online today than there were six or seven years ago when their products were being designed or built.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Project Audio: Teaching Students How to Produce Their Own Podcasts", "Date": "2018-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGiven the recent rise in podcast popularity, it\u2019s no surprise that audio narratives are making their way into the classroom. They offer an engaging way for teachers to merge project-based learning with digital media analysis and production skills.In anticipation of that contest, the mini-unit below walks students through the process of analyzing the techniques that make for good storytelling, interviewing and podcasting. The activities culminate in students producing their own original podcasts.Note: For those teachers who may be technophobes, please don\u2019t be intimidated by this technology-dependent lesson. Programs for audio editing are intuitive and easy-to-use, especially for many students. If you are a novice to audio recording, you may want to attempt to create your own one-minute podcast as a way to experience firsthand what students will encounter during the process._________In this section, students analyze the elements and techniques of both podcasting and storytelling, because stories are often at the heart of podcasts. Then, students practice telling a story aloud before moving on to interviewing in Part II.Warm Up: Elements of PodcastsPoll the class to see how many students are familiar with podcasts. If any students are, ask them to share their favorites. What did they enjoy about the podcasts they mentioned? What were the subjects? What elements of the podcasts do they remember: the interviews, conversations, music, sound effects or anything else?After you listen to all three excerpts, share as a class. What did students notice about the subject matter? What did they notice about the formatting and techniques used within the podcast? How were the three podcast excerpts similar? How were they different?Mini-Lesson: Podcast ProjectSo students understand how these activities are building toward a larger goal, explain that the class will be creating original podcasts for this mini-unit. Students can work individually or in small groups. The podcasts must be five minutes or less \u2014 and while that might sound like a short amount of time, if students want to produce quality audio it really isn\u2019t.Finally, as the Warm Up activity demonstrated, there are many different types of podcasts. Some consist largely of conversations between the hosts; others are based on interviews; still others involve mostly storytelling, nonfiction or fiction. Podcasts serve different purposes too: some try to make you laugh; others aim to keep you in suspense; some want to educate or inform. Students should keep all of these possibilities in mind as they consider what they want their original podcast to be like.Activity: Elements of StorytellingThink about stories your parents, family or friends have told you \u2014 or that you heard on the radio or somewhere else. What are the elements and techniques of great storytelling? How can stories we hear, but can\u2019t see, be sometimes even more powerful than stories dramatized or documented on TV or in film? Then they should listen to one or more of these short audio stories in their groups (and follow along with the transcript, if available). As they listen, students should continue taking notes on the same handout on what elements and techniques of storytelling are being used.Activity: Telling a StoryFor example, here are a few topics students might select:From their list, students should choose one question to tell a story about, as a way to practice storytelling. To prepare, they should first write down their ideas as a rough draft or outline.Wrap UpHave the class share how the storytelling activity went. Did students incorporate the elements and techniques of effective storytelling discussed in class? If there\u2019s time, invite a few students to present their stories to the rest of the class._________Students should now be at least a little familiar with the elements that make for good podcasts and storytelling. What\u2019s next? Analyzing and practicing effective interviewing techniques, another ingredient central to many podcasts.Warm Up: One-Minute InterviewsFrom the list they already highlighted, ask students to choose a prompt they could pose as a podcast interview question. Tell students they are going to practice taking on the role of interviewer and interviewee, and they will have one minute to conduct an interview. Interviews should take up the entire minute, so if there is extra time, interviewers should be ready to ask follow-up questions.Set the timer to one minute and have students interview a partner. When time is up, have partners switch roles for the next minute.Mini-LessonActivity: Elements of an InterviewVox pops are just one kind of interview. Often interviews are prepared, meaning the interviewee has time to think about the questions in advance (as opposed to the vox pop) and the interview includes multiple questions and takes place in a more formal, or at least quiet, setting.In their small groups, students should listen to the three brief audio clips below and take notes on the same handout.For \u201cThe Daily\u201d episode, students might notice that the interview questions are sometimes edited out \u2014 so the listener just hears the interviewee\u2019s responses. Students might even guess what the missing questions were.Then regroup as a class. What interviewing techniques did you hear? Which ones do you think are the most essential to good interviewing? Which techniques might be most helpful to you in making your podcasts? Make sure you discuss the difference between open-ended questions (which require more thought) and closed-ended questions (which elicit a simple one-word answer), and how the first kind makes for better interviews.Mini-Lesson: Using a Smartphone to RecordUntil now, we\u2018ve focused on the nontechnical aspects of podcasting, but to move forward we\u2019ll need to make sure the class knows how to use recording devices. If you have fancy microphones or microcassette recorders, you can skip this next part. But if your students will be using their smartphones as personal recording devices, then make sure everyone is familiar with these basics:Activity: Recording an InterviewStudents are now ready to make their first recording. Working with their previous partners, students should record an interview, trying to get at least three minutes of recording. They can use the same questions they used during the one-minute interviews, or they can choose new questions from the prompt list. Remind them to use the best practices for interviewing and recording discussed earlier, including asking open-ended follow-up questions.After they finish recording their interviews, they should make sure their sound files are good quality and saved.As an alternative activity or homework assignment, students can conduct a series of vox pop interviews in an unstructured setting within the school, such as during recess, at lunchtime or in the hallways.Wrap UpDebrief the interview activity with students. How did the interviews go? Did they create quality sound recordings? Did they learn any useful strategies before they begin making their podcasts?_________Students can tell stories, they can interview and be interviewed, and they can record sound. Now it\u2019s time to learn how to edit audio. By the end of this part of the mini-unit, students produce a practice one-minute podcast.Warm UpStudents will use these sound recordings to practice using editing software.Mini Lesson: Editing SoftwareEditing software is the tool that will help students turn their sound files into professional-sounding podcasts. With it, they can delete sections of audio, move audio segments around and stitch them together, and add additional sounds. They\u2019ll need to practice using this software before moving forward with the podcast project. Depending on how many computers you have, students might work alone or in pairs.Activity: One-Minute PodcastsThe best way for students to get practice using these tools is for them to play with them in a low-stakes way \u2014 thus, we suggest the one-minute podcast assignment. Students should take their three-minute recorded interviews and turn them into one-minute audio stories. They may want to cut out the actual interview questions; they may splice out parts of answers or move around sections; they may add additional narration or sound effects.We recommend this assignment as a timed activity \u2014 perhaps only one class period. Since it\u2019s not the final project, the goal isn\u2019t to produce a stellar podcast. Instead, it\u2019s to make sure students become comfortable with the editing software.Wrap UpSave time to debrief with students about using the editing software. How did it go? Where did they stumble? What did they learn? If there\u2019s time, you can play a few of the one-minute podcasts for the class.For homework, you can instruct students to look over the prompt list one more time to select their final podcast topic._________We\u2019ve reached the final chapter of this mini-unit. Students are ready to come up with a topic, create a plan and produce their very own original podcasts.Warm Up: Topic BrainstormIf students already selected their podcast topics for homework, have them share during the Warm Up. If not, have them return to the prompt list to choose the one question they want to address in their podcast. If students will be working with partners, they should do this brainstorm as a team. If they don\u2019t see a topic that interests them, they can come up with an original idea.Mini-Lesson: Planning a PodcastJust like writers do before starting an essay, podcast producers typically make an outline or plan before they start recording and editing. They brainstorm how they want to turn their topic into an audio story. What components will they need: spoken stories, interviews, narration?After listening, discuss: What is the question this episode focuses on? What components do the producers use during this segment? How can a rough outline like this one help them plan their podcasts?Project Workshop Step 1: Planning a Podcast Project Workshop Step 2: Gathering Audio Source MaterialOnce they have a plan, students need to go out and record their narration, stories and interviews. Some of this may take place during class time. Some of it may not.Project Workshop Step 3: Editing and PublishingOnce they have all their needed sound files, the last step is to use audio editing software to pull the pieces together into a final podcast, five minutes long or less. Please be forewarned: Editing can be a time-consuming process.Podcast CelebrationAfter all this hard work, we hope students can celebrate what they\u2019ve accomplished. Perhaps you want to have a podcast listening party, where you spend a class period listening to all the projects. You can even invite parents or guests. Or, if time is short, you can let groups of students listen to each other\u2019s podcasts using headphones.

{"Headline": "Prince\u2019s Friends Fiercely Guarded His Privacy, Complicating Overdose Investigation", "Date": "2018-04-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe paramedics who had met the jet on the tarmac in Moline Ill., recalled a surreal scene: At first, they believed the near-lifeless body being carried down the steps was that of an old woman, given the glittery gold clothing and shoes.Up close, it was unmistakably Prince, who was barely breathing. Recognizing the symptoms, a paramedic later told investigators, he administered a shot of Narcan, a medication used to reverse an opioid overdose.Nothing happened.But a second shot of Narcan caused Prince to take a large gasp and come to. When asked how he felt, Prince did not respond, but Kirk Johnson, his trusted bodyman, spoke up: \u201cPrince feels fine.\u201dBut the hundreds of pages of investigative documents released by the Carver County Sheriff\u2019s Office did pull back the curtain on Prince\u2019s intense reliance on his intimate circle of friends and employees, as well as their desire to protect him, as demonstrated by Mr. Johnson\u2019s behavior in Moline. In their limited statements to investigators, those closest to Prince in his final years said that the depths of his opioid addiction had been largely concealed from them until his final weeks when they rushed to save him.\u201cHow did he hide this so well?\u201d Mr. Johnson said to investigators, repeatedly mentioning Prince\u2019s obsession with privacy.This seeming contradiction \u2014 with some of Prince\u2019s associates saying they were aware of his long struggle with pain medication, but others saying they had no idea until the very end \u2014 ultimately frustrated investigators.\u201cThere is no doubt that the actions of individuals closely associated with Prince will be questioned, criticized and judged in the days and weeks to come,\u201d the Carver County attorney, Mark Metz, said in his announcement that there would be no charges. Mr. Metz noted that \u201cbecause Prince was an intensely private person, he was certainly assisted and enabled by others to obtain\u201d the pills he came to rely on.But the investigators could not make a case against anyone for supplying the fatal drugs. \u201cSuspicions and innuendo are categorically insufficient to support any criminal charges,\u201d Mr. Metz said.Despite an often blurry picture of the singer\u2019s relationship to drugs, Prince\u2019s associates appeared to agree that his pain stemmed from what he loved most: performing. After decades of onstage acrobatics, often in heels, Prince was known to suffer from hip pain and was said to have undergone surgery. The musician also complained sometimes of numbness in his arms and hands, possibly from banging relentlessly on the piano.In an interview with police about a year after Prince\u2019s death, Theo London, his tour manager and chief of staff between 2011 and 2015, recalled the singer once asking for a painkiller and becoming angry when Mr. London brought him a Tylenol, explaining that he needed something stronger.Manuela Testolini, Prince\u2019s wife from 2001 to 2007, told police that Prince often used narcotic pain pills during that period to manage his bodily aches. Sheila E. said that Prince had always wanted to hide how much pain he was in. Years ago, she told police, people working for the singer would obtain prescriptions for him in their own names to protect his privacy.Investigators found that Mr. Johnson had done just that before Prince\u2019s April 14 concert in Atlanta. Dr. Michael Schulenberg told police that he had prescribed Percocet to Prince in Mr. Johnson\u2019s name that day, after a last-minute request to treat the singer. It is illegal to write a prescription to someone knowing the medication is intended for someone else, and on Thursday, Dr. Schulenberg agreed to pay a $30,000 civil settlement with the federal government, in which he admitted no liability.The Carver County sheriff's office released documents on the investigation surrounding Prince's overdose death.Text messages obtained by police show Mr. Johnson scheduling appointments for Prince with the doctor, including a day before he died, when he appeared to be going through opiate withdrawal. Dr. Schulenberg prescribed drugs in Prince\u2019s name for those symptoms, and he and Prince\u2019s close associates began seeking help.Mr. Johnson\u2019s lawyer, F. Clayton Tyler, said on Friday: \u201cHe tried to take care of his friend as best as he could. The bottom line is, if they had thought he\u2019d done something wrong, they\u2019d have charged him.\u201dAddiction specialists were waiting at the Paisley Park studio and residence on the morning of April 21 when Prince was discovered dead in his elevator.Those present \u2014 including Mr. Johnson and Meron Bekure, Prince\u2019s personal assistant of a year and a half \u2014 indicated that Prince\u2019s addiction to painkillers had largely been a mystery to them. The refrain that would be repeated throughout the investigation began right away: Prince was a very private person, his confidantes told authorities.Ms. Bekure, in a brief interview with police that afternoon, explained she was uncertain of what she could discuss, having signed a confidentiality agreement. She said the only medication she had procured for Prince was for constipation. (Investigators noted that various bathrooms in Paisley Park contained enemas and other constipation medication: \u201cThis was of interest only because one of the common side effects of narcotics usage is constipation,\u201d documents said.)On Friday, Ryan Garry, a lawyer for Ms. Bekure, said that Ms. Bekure \u201ccontinues to mourn Prince\u2019s passing.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a tough couple of years emotionally and she\u2019s thankful the matter has come to a close,\u201d he said.Mr. Johnson told investigators that he was only beginning to understand the depths of Prince\u2019s addiction. Again citing Prince\u2019s privacy \u2014 the singer had no cellphone and had even disabled the security cameras on his property because he feared being watched, he said \u2014 Mr. Johnson also cautioned the authorities that \u201cno one would talk about\u201d Prince\u2019s drug use, perhaps out of fear.Others further removed had fewer reservations about telling investigators what they knew or believed. Crystal Zehetner, a chef for Prince who also worked as his business manager between 2010 and 2015, told Detective Chris Wagner of the Carver County Sheriff\u2019s Office that Prince would frequently complain of hip pain and that she \u201cknew he had a substance abuse problem,\u201d according to a report from Detective Wagner.Ms. Zehetner, who declined to comment on Friday, told the detective that \u201cof course\u201d those around him knew about Prince\u2019s addiction and that if anyone who worked with Prince said they did not know, \u201cthat those people were lying.\u201dIt can be difficult to assess whether someone is addicted to painkillers, according to Dr. John Kelly, director of the Recovery Research Institute at Massachusetts General Hospital. But some telltale signs, he said, were lethargy, irritability, nodding off and perhaps most important, tolerance to medication that leads abusers to seek ever higher doses.Carver County investigators indicated that they had run into various hurdles while looking into Prince\u2019s death. For instance, a Gmail account belonging to Prince was opened from his MacBook on April 23, 2016, the day of his memorial service, before law enforcement officials obtained a search warrant. \u201cAfter obtaining a search warrant on Prince\u2019s Google accounts, there was no information prior to 4-19-16,\u201d according to a police report, \u201csuggesting the content had been deleted.\u201dOn Friday, one of Prince\u2019s sisters, Sharon L. Nelson, posted on Twitter about her disappointment with the investigation: \u201cHe died, no collecting his computer, securing building, files, records, etc?\u201d she wrote.Carver County investigators said that until they knew Prince had died from a fentanyl overdose, they had no lawful basis to take his computer and that they did not believe the email deletions to be intentional acts of obfuscation.\u201cThe fact that criminal charges are not brought does not mean that some person or persons associated with Prince did not assist or enable Prince in obtaining the counterfeit Vicodin,\u201d the Carver County attorney\u2019s office, said in its announcement. \u201cAfter all, Prince somehow came into possession of the pills \u2014 and the pills had to come from some source.\u201dSopan Deb contributed reporting from New York and Sheila M.

{"Headline": "Meghan Markle: The Biggest Influencer of All?", "Date": "2018-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the former actress steps onto the global stage, she has the potential to change the perception of fashion brands, the royal family and much more.On Wednesday night Meghan Markle finally walked down the wedding aisle, resplendent in a lacy, sparkling white dress. It was, of course, the \u201cSuits\u201d season finale, and she was marrying her on-show fianc\u00e9. But it was also a mere three weeks or so before Ms. Markle herself \u2014 biracial American, now former actress, divorc\u00e9e, United Nations women\u2019s advocate \u2014 will walk down the aisle in Windsor Castle to to marry her real fianc\u00e9, Prince Harry (beloved royal soldier and hell raiser turned mental health activist). That made for a digital frenzy about what may be coming, which is only going to grow as the days wind down. After all, the drip-drip-drip of details has already sped up. The betting is closed. On what? The still outstanding question: What will she wear? There are economic and cultural repercussions riding on the answer. And you thought it was just a dress. Pshaw.The answer won\u2019t be certain until the bride appears on May 19, but what is increasingly clear is that whoever the designer is, he or she will be vaulted into the global conversation. In today\u2019s influencer culture, when an individual\u2019s ability to ignite far-reaching trends simply by dint of her own appeal is more effective than any advertising campaign, and a photo can carry a message round the world more powerfully than any words, it is beginning to seem as if Ms. Markle could be the most influential of all.Even though she has deleted all of her social media accounts.The numbers began to roll in almost as soon as Ms. Markle appeared with Prince Harry at the Invictus Games in Toronto last September wearing ripped jeans from the California brand Mother and carrying an Everlane tote. At Everlane, there are more than 20,000 people on a wait list for the tote she carried, according to the company. When Michael Preysman, the Everlane founder and chief executive, was asked to come up with an equivalent celebrity, he said: \u201cAngelina Jolie.\u201d The white wrap coat by the Canadian company Line the Label that Ms. Markle wore for the engagement announcement sold out almost immediately, the brand said, and the website crashed. Traffic to the website of Birks, the Canadian jeweler responsible for the opal and gold stud earrings she was wearing in the same appearance, spiked 500 percent, according to Birks, and does so each time she wears a Birks piece.\u201cWe have had celebrities wear our pieces \u2014 Claire Foy, Serena Williams \u2014 but no has ever matched the magnitude of the global response,\u201d said Eva Hartling, the vice president of Birks. \u201cWe\u2019ve always had coverage in Canada,\u201d Ms. Hartling said, \u201cbut now we are in Vogue Japan, in Russia\u201d and more.When Ms. Markle carried a Strathberry bag for her first official appearance after the engagement, it sold out in 11 minutes, and traffic to the Scottish company\u2019s website rose 5,000 percent. In January, she wore a pair of black jeans from Hiut Denim, a small Welsh brand, and in March the company moved to a bigger factory to fulfill demand.But as soon as the report was issued, said David Haigh, the chief executive, \u201cpeople went bananas. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a press release get more coverage.\u201d Mr. Haigh began to revise his projections upward. Now, he believes, the wedding itself will have economic repercussions \u201ccloser to GBP one billion \u2014 and to be honest, it could be more than that.\u201d And that\u2019s just in Britain. In Canada, where Ms. Markle lived for much of the seven years she spent filming the television show \u201cSuits,\u201d the fashion industry is also banking on her patronage \u2014 not just to raise the profile of local brands including Birks, Line the Label, Sentaler and Mackage, but of the local industry itself. \u201cWhen you have a figure like that, it changes everything for designers and the country when it comes to fashion,\u201d Ms. Milner said, noting that there had been a stereotype of Canadian fashion as significantly less creative or trendsetting than Paris or Milan, but that Ms. Markle\u2019s patronage could change all that. \u201cFor people to be able to see Canadian brands in a new light is huge.\u201d The French-American designer Joseph Altuzarra, who started working with Ms. Markle when she was in \u201cSuits,\u201d said her ability to alter perception of a brand is \u201cless quantifiable, but arguably has a bigger impact\u201d than her effect on sales. She wore his pinstriped day dress to her first major event as a representative of the royal family, at the Commonwealth Youth Forum last week (website visits up 400 percent, Instagrams up 300 percent in the hours following, according to a spokeswoman for the brand). \u201cWe are not a millennial street style brand,\u201d Mr. Altuzarra said. \u201cWe are a niche brand in a niche area. She changes how people think of us.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve seen that Meghan Markle is very considered in her choice of what she wears, and understands the soft power fashion can have in terms of connecting to a community, shining a light on local companies and using what you wear to challenge conventions,\u201d said Caroline Rush, the chief executive of the British Fashion Council.A random assortment of the brands Ms. Markle has worn include some major British labels (Burberry, Alexander McQueen, Stella McCartney), but as a whole they range in price, profile and place of origin, and the majority come from smaller contemporary brands from across the Commonwealth (and the former colonies). It is a description oddly reminiscent of Mrs. Obama\u2019s fashion history, though in its particulars it reflects both Ms. Markle\u2019s own story and the anticipation that she and Prince Harry will be tasked with acting as \u201cinternational ambassadors,\u201d according to Mr. Haigh; that in the shadow of Brexit, these royals cross borders, literally and symbolically. Also, perhaps, that Ms. Markle stands for something more than simply aspiration \u2014 she stands for change. That may be expressed in clothes but goes far beyond it.\u201cShe\u2019s less conventional than any of her potential royal peers,\u201d Mr. B\u00e9dos said. She has been criticized because of it \u2014 there were complaints about the ripped jeans, the sheer dress, her messy bun, her penchant for wearing thumb rings \u2014 but also cheered. It has the effect of appealing to a different constituency. Think of it this way: Catherine wears the requisite sheer stockings when she appears in public. Ms. Markle doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s a detail, but it\u2019s telling. \u201cIt all seems genuine,\u201d Mr. Altuzarra said \u2014 which is, on the surface, an odd thing to say, but also important. As the hype and hope and gossip continues to build, and the collective breath is held for whatever the big dress (or maybe it won\u2019t be so big?) on the big day will be, that\u2019s a lesson worth remembering.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "This Start-Up Says It Wants to Fight Poverty. A Food Stamp Giant Is Blocking It.", "Date": "2018-04-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFour years ago, Jimmy Chen left a lucrative perch as a product manager at Facebook to found Propel, what he calls an \u201canti-poverty software company.\u201dThe Propel-Conduent conflict offers a textbook case of a digital newcomer running into resistance from the old order. The twist is that the newcomer said it did not want to destroy the incumbent but instead build atop it to do good for underserved populations, as well as build a business for itself.The animating idea behind Propel, Mr. Chen said, was to \u201capply the Silicon Valley playbook to poverty in some way.\u201d He added that \u201cwe have to build on top of the old world to be successful.\u201dPropel has had no problems with the other major government contractor that manages state food stamp networks, FIS, Mr. Chen said. Nor did Propel have trouble with the Conduent system until recently. Propel has complained to Conduent managers repeatedly, but, Mr. Chen said, \u201cthey\u2019ve never offered us a direct explanation as to why now.\u201dIn written replies to questions, Conduent, which spun out from Xerox in January 2017, portrayed Propel less as an innovator than as a freeloader. Propel\u2019s smartphone app, Conduent said, was introduced \u201cwithout the knowledge, input or consent from Conduent.\u201d It accused Propel of overloading its networks with data requests, causing \u201ca capacity ambush.\u201dConduent took actions to block the app, and described them as prudent \u201csteps to prevent unauthorized access to data \u2014 from Propel or any other unauthorized user.\u201dThe fight over the app is now affecting people like Brianna LaBelle, 25, of Augusta, Me., who has two young sons. She has used Propel\u2019s app to create shopping lists, track food purchases and budget. \u201cI love it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very handy.\u201dBut in February, when Ms. LaBelle tried to check her food stamps balance, she got a message that access to her information was \u201ccurrently unavailable to the residents of Maine.\u201d That interruption, she said, lasted for nearly a month, in which she also lost the timesaving and meal-planning convenience of the app.Propel, Mr. Chen insisted, has tried to explain its business to state governments and to food stamp contractors. The Propel app is a digital \u201cskin\u201d that works on top of the websites of food stamp contractors, like Conduent. A user taps the app, which is known as FreshEBT, to look up the amount left in the account. On average, users check their balances seven times a month.Conduent, in another twist, has begun competing with the start-up. The business services outsourcer, which has $6 billion in yearly revenue, introduced its own smartphone app last year. Conduent\u2019s entry, ConnectEBT, has significantly fewer reviews and lower ratings on the Google and Apple app stores than Propel\u2019s FreshEBT.Conduent\u2019s app is available in Utah, South Carolina and Oklahoma, and offers only basic information on account balances and purchases. But the company said it was beginning a broader rollout this year, and would provide \u201cmore features and functions\u201d as it gets states\u2019 approval as a regulated contractor, unlike Propel.Propel\u2019s predicament is magnified because the food-stamp system\u2019s technology, like many government tech services, is outsourced to a relatively small number of companies.\u201cIt\u2019s an oligopoly game, so there\u2019s often not much choice, competition or innovation,\u201d said Josh Miller, who oversaw the development of digital products in the Obama White House. He added that the volume of data requests from Propel is \u201ctiny\u201d in internet terms.Propel\u2019s early success suggests there is opportunity for innovation in the low-income market, no matter how the start-up\u2019s wrangling with Conduent turns out.Propel is a fledgling company, with only 11 employees, two of them former food-stamp recipients. Mr. Chen, 30, is not one of them. His family emigrated from China when he was 4, and he attended Stanford University on a full scholarship, based on need. Propel has raised $5.2 million from investors like Andreessen Horowitz, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm, and Omidyar Network, which funds start-ups focused on social goals.Paper food stamps are long gone, replaced beginning nearly two decades ago by debit-style cards, called Electronic Benefit Transfer cards. The program is federally funded and administered by the states, which typically rely on private contractors to provide the service.The account look-up feature in FreshEBT has been its way into the low-income market, but was only a first step. Other features that were added over time, including food coupons, job opportunities and recipes for inexpensive meals, have also become popular.So far this year, FreshEBT users have downloaded coupons advertised on the app worth more than $2 million. In the past six months, they have applied for jobs more than 10,000 times from the app, the company said. Propel typically gets referral fees from its coupon, job-listing and other advertiser partners. It does not store or sell users\u2019 personal information, the company said.Keyana Workman, 25, who has two young children and lives in Brooklyn, has been off and on food stamps for the last three years, as jobs and income fluctuate. She calls FreshEBT\u2019s balance look-up \u201ca real improvement\u201d from making 800-number calls.Lately, Ms. Workman has also tapped into the recipes and health and exercise tips. \u201cI\u2019ve been working out a lot,\u201d she said.Propel estimates that 80 percent of its users in the Conduent states have now had problems accessing their information from its app at some point in the past few months.What Propel is doing in the low-income market is broadly similar to what other companies like Mint and Yodlee have done by offering digital services that let people organize and manage their personal finances. The major banks initially opposed allowing those online services to pull account information, but the Dodd-Frank financial reform law in 2010 included a mandate to allow consumers \u2014 and third-party apps on their behalf \u2014 to access their data.\u201cIt should be up to the participants in the program to decide how to organize and use their information,\u201d Ms. Dean said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Let the Sunshine In\u2019 Shows the Complex Radiance of Juliette Binoche", "Date": "2018-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the first scene of \u201cLet the Sunshine In,\u201d Isabelle, a Parisian artist, is in bed with one of her lovers, a portly, ginger-bearded banker named Vincent. He is quite impressed with his amatory skills, which makes one of them. The scene \u2014 tender, awkward, comical \u2014 is candid but not graphic, the vibe less voyeuristic than analytical. What people say and do while they\u2019re having sex is revealing, not only of their bodies but also of their feelings, egos and motivations. So if we want to know who Isabelle is and what she\u2019s like \u2014 the principal concern of Claire Denis\u2019s shrewd and uncompromising new film \u2014 then the bedroom might be as good a place as any to start.As played by Juliette Binoche, Isabelle is defiantly immune to both of those, and even, at times, to the audience\u2019s sympathy. Ms. Binoche, effortlessly charismatic and ruthlessly unvain, has no investment in the character\u2019s likability. She and Ms. Denis could not care less what you think of her. \u201cLet the Sunshine In\u201d commits itself to taking Isabelle on her own terms. The challenge, for her and for the audience, is to figure out what those terms are.This has a lot to do with her relations with men, sexual and otherwise. The film is partly an impressionistic chronicle, by turns comical and melodramatic, of her affairs \u2014 the French word is histoires \u2014 with various unsatisfactory men. In addition to Vincent (Xavier Beauvois), who is married and intends to stay that way, there is a moody unnamed actor (Nicolas Duvauchelle) who uses ambivalence as a kind of foreplay, and Fran\u00e7ois (Laurent Gr\u00e9vill), Isabelle\u2019s ex-husband and the father of her briefly glimpsed 10-year-old daughter. Later, on a trip to a provincial art festival, Isabelle meets Sylvain (Paul Blain), whose working-class background dismays one of her snooty art-world guy friends, who no doubt thinks Isabelle would be happier with him. But Isabelle suspects she might be happiest with Marc (Alex Descas), who gently defers (but doesn\u2019t entirely decline) her advances.Happiness is elusive, and to some degree irrelevant. Isabelle is fascinating \u2014 puzzling, charming, irritating, worth caring about \u2014 because she\u2019s intelligent and free. The shape of the film, which ambles through her days and nights in a way that feels more causal than it is, reflects the elusive pattern of her experience. She is impulsive rather than systematic, but nonetheless serious in her desire to figure out what she wants.Even though Isabelle is counseled to remain \u201copen\u201d (her adviser uses the English word), Ms. Denis makes it clear that external sources of illumination are as untrustworthy as men. Ms. Binoche is the film\u2019s primary and sufficient source of light. The radiance is all hers. The clouds, too.Movie data powered by IMDb.comvideoAdvertisement"}

He said that the kingdom was reverting to its original name, before the advent of British colonization in 1906.But several former British colonies in Africa \u2014 like Uganda, Kenya and Gambia \u2014 did not change their names upon gaining independence.A mountainous country slightly smaller than New Jersey, Swaziland is economically reliant on South Africa. For decades, Swazi men have worked in South African coal and gold mines.The king has parried calls for democratic reforms over his three-decade reign. Under a Constitution that was adopted in 2006, Swaziland is officially an absolute monarchy, though the king can no longer rule by decree. The Constitution provides for an independent judiciary and for human rights, but the status of political parties, which were formally banned in 1973, remains unclear. Parliamentary elections were held in 2008 and 2013 and are expected again in September.Advertisement"}

There\u2019s hand-painted, scratch-and-sniff wallpaper (think Warhol\u2019s patterned cows but with cherries \u2014 cherry-scented, naturally), as well as a device that projects ultrasonic sound waves to simulate the touch and feel of virtual objects. I felt what I think were meant to be champagne bubbles.Sure, bring the kids. They will bliss out stroking a wavy, fur-lined installation that makes music as you rub it.But fun and games aside, there\u2019s a serious, timely and big idea here.Since cave-dwelling days, humans have relied on sight more than any other sense. We apparently have the same number of genes for detecting smell as other primates, but half of them stopped functioning millions of years ago.At what cost?Vision is the most external and remote of the senses. We look at things that are apart from us, at some remove. By contrast, sounds vibrate inside us; smells inhabit us. We may not always be able to recall what some place looks like. But a smell can retrieve the memory for us.Touch, the anthropologist Ashley Montagu once wrote, is \u201cthe parent of our eyes, ears, nose and mouth,\u201d tethering us to the world. You don\u2019t have to read Proust to know that taste also speaks volumes.And our senses obviously commingle. Food has texture. That\u2019s what those macadamia nuts and brown-butter wafers are doing in your mascarpone sundae. Subliminally, the tongue can even react to the sight of a polished stone. Sounds can register in your consciousness as colors, colors as tastes. (Picture the color of sour. It\u2019s probably greenish.)That said, what the writer Italo Calvino described years ago as an \u201cunending rainfall of images\u201d has swelled into a deluge. Social media, smartphones and virtual reality have made us ever more \u201cocularcentric,\u201d a term the Finnish designer Juhani Pallasmaa employed a generation ago to lament how dependent architects had become on digital animation.\u201cComputer imaging tends to flatten our magnificent, multi-sensory, simultaneous and synchronic capacities of imagination by turning the design process into a passive visual manipulation, a retinal journal,\u201d Mr. Pallasmaa argued.Numb to other senses, ocularcentric architecture cultivates alienation.What does designing more sensitively for nonvisual experience mean?The huge new Bloomberg LP headquarters in London, designed by Foster + Partners, in collaboration with Sandy Brown, the acoustic consultants, may not be thrilling to look at from the outside. But inside, it exploits new technologies by Meyer Sound Laboratories, the Berkeley, Calif., firm.Sound engineering turns open offices into private spaces, an auditorium into a confessional. These state-of-the-art acoustics weave a kind of invisible architecture into the fabric of the building.Needless to say, one building can\u2019t stack up against the wider universe of drones, pixels and earbuds. In general, we have taken leave of our nonvisual senses \u2014 and need to get back in touch, literally.\u201cA room is not just a cube punctured with windows and doors,\u201d Andrea Lipps and Ellen Lupton, the show\u2019s co-curators, write in the exhibition catalog. \u201cA rug inhales noise; floorboards sigh with grief. Sensory design tweaks our skin, bones and muscles. It tickles, pinches and pops. It plays rough. It touches us, and we touch back.\u201dThat\u2019s where \u201cSenses\u201d comes in. Ms. Lipps and Ms. Lupton stress how touch, sound, smell and taste activate the natural \u201cwisdom of the body.\u201d Ms. Lipps also describes a collective \u201creality hunger,\u201d which products like Cyrano, frivolous though they may seem, attempt to assuage.The show brings together some 65 designers and teams. It presents commissions, videos, products and prototypes. Some address sensory disabilities like blindness and deafness. A device like Vibeat, for example, by a young Israeli designer, Liron Gino, is worn as a bracelet, brooch or necklace and translates music into vibrations that can be perceived by anyone, including the deaf.Cheerfully colored tableware, devised for visually impaired customers, works for everyone else, too, including people with dementia, for whom distinguishing food from plates or liquids from containers can become a difficult and unappetizing chore.There are art installations. \u201cSeated Catalogue of Feelings\u201d by Eric Gunther mixes chairs that vibrate with descriptive texts whispered through headphones and projected onto the floor (\u201cDriving over a dead body\u201d; \u201cSex on a washing machine\u201d).It doesn\u2019t turn out to be as riveting as that scene from \u201cMad Men,\u201d but it did inspire me to Google the name Morton Heilig, sometimes called the father of virtual reality, who, half a century ago, concocted a contraption called Sensorama. The size of a vending machine, it involved a 3-D video headset, a chair that moved, fans and a device that pumped out aromas.Like the Rocket Belt, it failed to take off, commercially. But its promise of a fully immersive, multisensory experience today doesn\u2019t seem far-fetched.Ultrahaptics, a British-based company, invented that device that made the virtual champagne bubbles I mentioned earlier. Just as sounds can be felt through vibrations, those audio vibrations can simulate the feeling of objects in midair. Those objects can then be remotely manipulated.I know what you\u2019re imagining. But think beyond the pornographic angle.In the not-too-distant future, ultrasound devices may create invisible sliders for adjusting the volume on your television or the flame on your stove. Bosch, the German electronics giant, has already introduced a concept car with haptic controls. Picture Wii without the hardware. Or \u201cMinority Report.\u201d Or that VR Lexus in \u201cBlack Panther.\u201dIt\u2019s all very exciting \u2014 even if sensory technology will always have its limits.Hands-free driving is one outcome. But of course nothing will ever substitute for the feeling of holding your own child\u2019s hand or the crunch of those brown-butter wafers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Huawei, Failing to Crack U.S. Market, Signals a Change in Tactics", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHENZHEN, China \u2014 In a grand hotel ballroom on Tuesday, Huawei executives laid out a soaring vision for the future. The Chinese electronics giant, already the world\u2019s biggest supplier of the equipment that powers the wireless age, now wants to provide the digital backbone for artificial intelligence, the internet of things and other transformative technologies.But that future is increasingly looking as if it will not include the United States.Last week, the company laid off five American employees, including William B. Plummer, the executive who was the face of its Sisyphean efforts to win over Washington, according to people familiar with the matter. Huawei has also been dialing back its political outreach in the United States, these people said \u2014 which could end a decade of mostly fruitless efforts to dispel Washington\u2019s accusations that the company has ties to the Chinese government.Huawei\u2019s tactics are changing as its business prospects in the United States have darkened considerably. On Tuesday, the Federal Communications Commission voted to proceed with a new rule that could effectively kill off what little business the company has in the United States. Although the proposed rule does not mention Huawei by name, it would block federally subsidized telecommunications carriers from using suppliers deemed to pose a risk to American national security.Huawei\u2019s latest moves suggest that it has accepted that its political battles in the United States are not ones it is likely to win.\u201cSome things cannot change their course according to our wishes,\u201d Eric Xu, Huawei\u2019s deputy chairman, said at the company\u2019s annual meeting with analysts on Tuesday. \u201cWith some things, when you let them go, you actually feel more at ease.\u201dYet Huawei\u2019s experience also illustrates how little Washington can do to curb Chinese influence in cutting-edge industries throughout the rest of the world.At Tuesday\u2019s meeting with analysts, executives at the company, which says it is owned by its employees and not by the Chinese state, emphasized growth opportunities in Europe and Asia. They also described ambitions to further diversify Huawei\u2019s business into helping organizations of all kinds \u2014 not merely wireless carriers, but factories, governments and the police \u2014 transform themselves through cloud computing and artificial intelligence.\u201cFor Huawei, the major challenge is not how we can serve operators better,\u201d said David Wang, a company president. Instead, he said, \u201cwe have to work harder to cope with wider challenges in all industries.\u201dThe company has said repeatedly that its products pose no security risk and that it complies with the law everywhere it operates. Still, the layoffs last week appear to be an acknowledgment by Huawei that it has failed to clear the political cloud around it.Mr. Plummer, Huawei\u2019s vice president of external affairs, had been with the company for almost eight years. He was the most senior member of Huawei\u2019s American policy team who was not a Chinese citizen.It is not clear whether he will be replaced. The company\u2019s policy operations in the United States are led by a relatively recent arrival, Zhang Ruijun, who took the post nine months ago after working for the company in Mexico and Russia.A Huawei spokesman said in a statement that any layoffs simply reflected an effort to better align resources with \u201cbusiness strategy and objectives.\u201d\u201cAny changes to staffing size or structure are simply a reflection of standard business organization,\u201d he said.Founded three decades ago, Huawei made $93 billion in revenue last year \u2014 not much less than Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, and more than its two main rivals in telecom gear, Nokia of Finland and Ericsson of Sweden, combined.Chinese carriers are likely to deploy such networks more quickly than their American counterparts are, at least in the beginning. But as 5G comes up in the United States, Japan, South Korea and Europe, Nokia and Ericsson will catch up, said Pierre Ferragu, an analyst in New York with New Street Research.In the United States, Huawei customers that would be affected by the F.C.C.\u2019s proposed rule \u2014 small carriers in rural areas \u2014 may soon need to find new equipment suppliers.These carriers love Huawei gear, said Carri Bennet, general counsel for the Rural Wireless Association, an industry group for American telecom companies with fewer than 100,000 subscribers.\u201cThey just love it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt works like a charm, the customer service support is awesome,\u201d and the price is attractive, she added.Ms. Bennet said that rather than blacklisting specific manufacturers, Washington should be creating a system for testing telecom gear for security vulnerabilities.\u201cThese companies who are reliant on this support, they don\u2019t have the funds to overhaul their whole network,\u201d she said. \u201cPublic safety, getting 911 services, broadband \u2014 it all just starts falling apart.\u201dRaymond Zhong reported from Shenzhen, China, and Paul Mozur from Shanghai.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Would AT&T\u2019s Time Warner Deal Help or Hurt Consumers? Judge Will Now Decide", "Date": "2018-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Lawyers faced off over the future of AT&T\u2019s $85.4 billion blockbuster merger with Time Warner for a final time in a courtroom on Monday, sparring over what the deal would mean to consumers.The Justice Department, which sued to block the deal, argued that the merger would cost people millions of dollars a year by limiting competition. If the judge does approve the deal, the government said, the court should force the companies to sell off certain business lines to protect consumers.But the companies countered that the government had failed to make its case. They said consumers would benefit from the merger because it would allow Time Warner and AT&T to compete more effectively against Silicon Valley companies like Google and Netflix.\u201cThe only lessening of competition that would occur is if this merger is blocked,\u201d said Daniel Petrocelli, the lead lawyer for AT&T and Time Warner.The judge, Richard J. Leon of United States District Court for the District of Columbia, is expected to rule on the case on June 12. He has given little indication of his thinking throughout the trial, and he gave no sign of his leanings on Monday, either.The six-week courtroom battle, featuring top executives and glimpses of trade secrets, has been one of the most closely watched antitrust cases in years. It has the potential to reshape the fast-changing telecom and entertainment landscape, which is facing new competition from tech companies.The judge\u2019s opinion could also help set the course for antitrust regulation in the years ahead. A victory for the companies could embolden executives to pursue new deals. A government win could slow future deal-making. On Sunday, T-Mobile and Sprint announced a merger to better compete against AT&T, in a deal that is also expected to face close antitrust scrutiny.The case has centered on the question of harm to consumers and whether the merger would lead to price increases. The Justice Department presented several theories for why prices could go up hundreds of millions of dollars a year over all for cable subscribers. The core idea is that AT&T could threaten to withhold Time Warner content, like N.B.A. games and CNN, to extract more money from rival cable and satellite operators that wanted to run that \u201cmust-have\u201d programming.The call for selling off business lines showed how little the two sides have changed their strategy throughout the trial. The Justice Department, which had made the same demand before it sued in November, says only the divestitures would solve antitrust concerns because restrictions on business practices are rarely well enforced.The government called witnesses from Dish\u2019s Sling TV and from Cox, Charter and RCN, which provide cable and broadband service, to discuss their fears that AT&T, one of the nation\u2019s largest satellite television providers, would use Time Warner\u2019s programming as its weapon to hurt them. The Justice Department also relied heavily on an economic analysis by Carl Shapiro, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, that estimated monthly cable bills could go up at least 27 cents.\u201cThese witnesses came across the country to share their concerns,\u201d said Craig Conrath, the Justice Department\u2019s lead lawyer. He said the potential antitrust violations from the deal were not \u201ctheoretical.\u201d\u201cThere are hundreds of millions of dollars in harms to consumers,\u201d Mr. Conrath said.AT&T and Time Warner fiercely attacked those economic arguments during the trial and in the closing argument on Monday. Rivals are always motivated to argue against the activities of competitors, Mr. Petrocelli said.The companies assailed the economic analysis of Mr. Shapiro, saying the data sets used were not complete and cherry-picked points.\u201cIt is the centerpiece of this case,\u201d Mr. Petrocelli said. But he said Mr. Shapiro\u2019s arguments were \u201ca complete failure of proof.\u201dThe companies\u2019 ability to raise doubts about the Justice Department\u2019s case put the government in a challenging position, analysts said.\u201cThe burden of proof is on the government, and the consensus view is that it would be an uphill battle for the government,\u201d said Paul Glenchur, a senior telecommunications and cable analyst for Hedgeye Potomac Research.For a merger focused on the future of technology, the trial felt stuck in time. A clock on the wall was frozen at 5:05. Cellphones and other device were forced off. Lawyers relied on boxes of files and binders wheeled in on library carts. Judge Leon, with bow ties and cuff links, was a stickler for order and schedules. He took careful notes by pencil.Political questions have hovered over the trial, but have not been allowed in the courtroom. President Trump, a vocal critic of Time Warner\u2019s CNN, said during the election campaign that the merger should be blocked. Makan Delrahim, the Justice Department\u2019s head of antitrust, told the court in filings that the White House had not influenced his decision. Judge Leon, however, said he wanted to keep the trial focused on the merits of the deal.The outcome of the trial may not be a simple yes or no on the merger. Judge Leon may push the parties to work out a settlement that would let the merger proceed with the promise of assigning a third-party arbitrator to resolve business disputes over Time Warner content. He could also, as the government suggested, demand that some parts of the merged company be sold before the deal is approved.Whichever side loses is expected to appeal.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Will Italy Leave the E.U.? Not So Fast", "Date": "2018-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Severgnini is\u00a0the author of \u201cLa Bella Figura: A Field Guide to the Italian Mind.\u201dMILAN \u2014 Eight weeks after Italy\u2019s election, it\u2019s still possible that a government will be formed by the Five Star Movement and the League, two parties that have campaigned passionately against Brussels and the European Union in the past. In the last few days they have quarreled, but it seems sure that one of them, maybe both, will be the force driving Italy\u2019s next government, with the question before it being whether to continue on that anti-European path.Speaking in the European Parliament in February, the League\u2019s leader, Matteo Salvini, likened the European Union to \u201cthe Titanic about to sink.\u201d The views of Five Star are less clear cut. Its leaders have changed their minds several times about the euro, and at the moment, it seems that they\u2019d like to stay in the union. But they might well change their minds again. After all, Beppe Grillo, the movement\u2019s founder and ultimate authority, once shouted, \u201cItaly should leave the euro as soon as possible!\u201d Others are on the record as saying that \u201cthe euro has destroyed us\u201d and that \u201cit will eventually make southern Italy a wasteland.\u201dOn March 4, Election Day, Five Star attracted 32 percent of the vote. The League got 17 percent, and a third, even more Euroskeptic party \u2014 the right-wing Brothers of Italy \u2014 polled 4 percent. That means that more than half of Italian voters turned against Europe.Does it follow that the European Union is now at risk? Well, not yet. Do not expect Italy to drop the euro or leave the union anytime soon. The price would be way too high. Nevertheless, it\u2019s a fact: The continent\u2019s most Europhile country has lost faith in Europe\u2019s ability to solve Italy\u2019s problems.A Euroskeptic Italy is almost an oxymoron. Italy is one of the six founding nations of the European Union, having signed the Treaty of Rome in 1957 with France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. For 60 years it has been a loyal member and has regularly led the polls that measure trust and good will toward the bloc.What\u2019s changed?Three things, mainly. One relates to European policies. Another involves Italian politicians. The third, a consequence of the first two that looks as if it would be the most difficult to fix, concerns Italian voters.No. 1: The European Union has disappointed Italy on immigration, a deeply sensitive issue. The Dublin Regulation, in force since 1997, states that the country where an asylum-seeker first enters the union is responsible for registering his or her asylum application. With the current decade\u2019s flood of migrants coming mostly from the Middle East and Africa, the two most exposed countries have been Greece and Italy. A look at a map is enough to tell you why.Making things worse for Italy, a costly agreement with Turkey to act as a sort of bouncer for Europe has almost totally shut down the eastern route through Greece. But in Libya, which lies just south of Sicily, there has been no government to deal with, so migrants from Africa kept coming. When Italy asked its European partners to share the burden, they first said no, then maybe, then yes to opening their borders to some migrants. But only a few hundred were accepted, and Italy felt betrayed.European insensitivity has shown up elsewhere. In a supposedly \u201ccommon\u201d market, Ireland, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Cyprus and Britain all offer tax havens to encourage international companies to set up their headquarters within them. Mr. Salvini, speaking in the European Parliament in February, described the European Commission\u2019s president, Jean-Claude Juncker, a former prime minister of Luxembourg, as \u201cthe head of government of a tax haven for 20 years.\u201d And a few weeks before the election, Embraco, a company in the Whirlpool group, announced that it would close its compressor plants near Turin, fire 500 people and move to Slovakia, where wages and employee benefits are much lower. Very bad timing for Europhiles.No. 2: Every country in the union has at least one political party that built its fortunes on bashing Europe. But in Italy, lately, this attitude has been adopted by even the historically pro-European parties, which couldn\u2019t resist blaming Brussels for their own failures. Matteo Renzi, first as a prime minister (2014 to 2016) and then as the leader of the center-left Democratic Party (2017), could hardly open his mouth without saying something unpleasant about the union. Did he think he could outsmart his opponents that way? Well, he failed. \u201cBlame it on Brussels!\u201d didn\u2019t pay off for him or his government. It compares with what happened in Britain before the Brexit referendum. David Cameron, while leading the campaign to remain in the bloc, chose to acknowledge the union\u2019s shortcomings; he did it so well that he persuaded his fellow citizens to leave it.No. 3: Italy, where feelings run high on these issues, senses an emotional disconnection between Europe and its citizens. For almost 60 years, Italian voters had seen the European Union as a dull but reliable babysitter who would ultimately take care of those rowdy Italian politicians. A former prime minister told me, \u201cIf not for Brussels, I could never resist pressure to expand public spending.\u201d All that is gone now. And a majority of Italians think the sitter is at least partly to blame.But what about the union\u2019s very substantial achievements? It\u2019s created common standards in areas from home safety to cellphone roaming; it\u2019s allowed people to trade, work and live where they please; it protects agriculture and fishing; it\u2019s helped millions of students spend time abroad. And it\u2019s enabled 28 countries to speak with one voice and be respected \u2014 as Microsoft, Google and Facebook know well.All forgotten? No. But most Italians, yearning for the supposed security of a lost age, find Brussels too distant. National, local and ethnic identities are more familiar, thus more reassuring.That remoteness is important. The European Union looks soulless. Its greatest flaw may be that it cannot communicate its achievements. Take Europe Day. Only a small fraction of the 510 million citizens of the union even know about the day, let alone celebrate it, and almost no one has any idea why it\u2019s May 9. In fact, it was on May 9, 1950, that Robert Schuman, then France\u2019s foreign minister, officially proposed placing French and German coal and steel production under one authority; can you see why those 510 million don\u2019t deck the halls?So here\u2019s an idea: Let\u2019s declare May 9 \u201cNo Europe Day\u201d and suspend all of the union\u2019s achievements for 24 hours. Border crossings will be reintroduced and trade barriers re-erected. People will exchange their currency for every trip, and soccer teams will field only players from their own countries.Oh, and war will be once again a very real threat. Not far away. Right at home.One day would be enough to remind its citizens what Europe is about. And in Italy, if they do form a government, Five Star and the League might understand the importance of our common European home.Sure, it\u2019s not perfect. So let\u2019s not demolish it. Let\u2019s fix it.Beppe Severgnini is the editor in chief of Corriere della Sera\u2019s magazine 7 and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "5 Black Women Were Told to Golf Faster. Then the Club Called the Police.", "Date": "2018-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat started out as a relaxing day at a Pennsylvania golf course turned into an ugly confrontation between the white men who run the club and five black women who were playing there.\u201cMany of us were having great drive days. We were slamming that ball,\u201d she said on Tuesday. \u201cSo when they were trying to say \u2018too slow of a pace,\u2019 that was just false.\u201dTheir day started out with a hiccup: Frost on the course delayed their tee time by an hour, Ms. Thompson said, so they weren\u2019t able to start playing until 11 a.m. Though a foursome is the norm, the club permitted a group of five, she said.Later, after the group finished playing nine holes, three of the women left. The remaining two, Myneca Ojo, 56, and Ms. Thompson, had just finished a break and were going to start the second nine holes, when they were approached by one of the club\u2019s owners and other employees, who said that their break took too long and that they had called the police.Officers arrived and \u201cquickly determined that this was not a police issue,\u201d Mark L. Bentzel, chief of the Northern York County Regional Police Department, said. After speaking with both of the parties involved, he said, \u201cthere was no need for us to be there and we left.\u201dNo charges were filed, Chief Bentzel added.\u201cThe police were respectful, so it is not about the police,\u201d Ms. Thompson said in her Facebook post.That contrasted with other episodes involving black customers that have fueled fury online this month. At the Starbucks in Philadelphia and the Waffle House in Alabama, the police made arrests.The former county commissioner, Steve Chronister, and the club\u2019s co-owner, his son, Jordan Chronister, could not be reached for comment. Calls to the Grandview Golf Club went to voice mail, and the recorder was too full to accept messages.They all belong to a golfing club, Sisters in the Fairway, and have played at courses \u201call over the world,\u201d Ms. Ojo said, so they knew how to keep pace. Even so, the women said, they skipped the third hole after Steve Chronister approached them.\u201cThe only other difference between us and the other players was our race and our gender,\u201d Ms. Thompson said.York, a county of small towns, suburbs and farmland in southern Pennsylvania about 50 miles north of Baltimore, is predominantly white, said Ms. Ojo, who lives there. Black and Latino people are concentrated in the largest municipality, the city of York.\u201cThis ain\u2019t Baltimore,\u201d she added. Throughout the episode, Ms. Ojo said, she and her fellow golfers \u201cwere treated less than human beings.\u201dIn Ms. Thompson\u2019s video, Jordan Chronister can be seen saying, \u201cCongratulations, you\u2019re a real winner,\u201d adding, \u201cRemove yourself from our premises within the next five minutes, please.\u201d\u201cThe authorities have been called,\u201d another man said.\u201cBack off,\u201d Steve Chronister told his son on camera. \u201cThis is what she wants. This is what she does for a living.\u201dMs. Thompson said that the group had completed nine holes in two hours. Not only were they playing on pace, the sole group playing behind them had also not been impeded, she said. That group can be seen on the video, taking a break before teeing off.\u201cThey were not rushing,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were out, just like we were, out having a good day. They were leisurely.\u201dBoth Ms. Thompson and Ms. Ojo said that the group behind them had not complained. In fact, Ms. Thompson added, one of the men from that group \u201ccame to us and told us how outraged he was at our treatment.\u201dMs. Thompson said that after her Facebook post, J.J. Chronister, who identified herself as Jordan Chronister\u2019s wife, called and apologized. But, Ms. Thompson said, none of the women have heard directly from the two men.\u201cWe\u2019re going to pursue all remedies that are available\u201d to change how the golf club treats women of color, Ms. Thompson said, though no formal complaint has been filed. \u201cWhatever needs to be done for them to take this seriously,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

On his nose, cheeks and chin, he wore silicone prosthetics for the ways he did not resemble Picasso: to thin out his featherbed lips, to make his nose fleshier and his jowls jowlier, to mask his beautiful face. It didn\u2019t work. The minute you looked at him, his chocolate pudding swimming pool eyeballs gave him away.He was a beloved fixture in American cinema \u2014 a masked avenger, a Latin lover, a mariachi, a matador, an assassin posing as, oh yes, a mariachi. He bided his time in masks, with guns, with swords, and as he grew older, he was rewarded with the chance to play (or almost play, in projects that got killed) historical figures: Dal\u00ed, Mussolini, Pancho Villa, and Picasso \u2014 and Picasso.And now it was finally happening. He was going to play his boyhood hero and bring pride to M\u00e1laga, Spain \u2014 both his and Picasso\u2019s hometown. When Mr. Banderas was growing up, his mother would stop in front of the house the artist was born in every time they passed it and say, \u201cLook, Antonio.\u201d Now, in the home he owns in M\u00e1laga, he can see that house from his terrace.He was dressed for the day\u2019s scenes in a tank top under a silk button down shirt and trousers hiked up to around his fourth rib, a particular kind of European old-man fashion. He wore over his bald head a sparse, netted, gray wig, since Picasso had Dr. Phil-pattern baldness and Mr. Banderas still has a full head of hair. He could have worn one of those rubber caps, but if you think he would, you don\u2019t know Mr. Banderas. He would never do that. He would never not take the opportunity to become even closer to the character.Picasso, on the other hand, said that \u201cWomen are machines for suffering\u201d and that to him, they were either \u201cgoddesses or doormats.\u201d \u201cGenius: Picasso\u201d addresses Picasso\u2019s misogyny as much as his art. In the first episode a woman is home with his offspring while he makes out with another lover on the beach, and both women get in a fistfight in front of him while he is painting \u201cGuernica.\u201dHonestly, I told him, the lionization of a man who treated women this way is gross to me.Mr. Banderas beseeched me to be more generous. \u201cThe problem with Picasso from my point of view, I don\u2019t think he abused women, as we understand that now,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem is that he wanted everything, everything, all the time.\u201dHe enters a project with maximum dedication, maximum research. The more you know about a character, the more you can fill the white spaces with something rich. He asks: Do you know that Picasso\u2019s grandson Pablito apparently stood on a street near his home in France with a sandwich board when his grandfather wouldn\u2019t allow him to visit him in the final days? Go ahead, ask him anything.If you know your subject down to his soul, then the subject is there when you need him. \u201cI\u2019ve been with him now for months every day and I can just actually say, \u2018O.K., come over here.\u2019 The ghost comes and just gets in your body and you\u2019re \u2018boom.\u2019\u201dOn the days it doesn\u2019t come so easily, you can fill the white space with you. Who is to say where Picasso ends and Mr. Banderas begins? Who can give that information now that he\u2019s prepared for this role three separate times?\u201cGenius: Picasso,\u201d which takes place over 10 episodes, is shot during two eras: Picasso\u2019s youth, and his old age. In his younger days, he is played by Alex Rich, who does a Picasso impression that is actually an Antonio Banderas impression. The camera follows Mr. Rich to show the freneticism of youth. But during the old age scenes, the camera stays still, like a portrait with Mr. Banderas entering and leaving it. In those scenes, it\u2019s Mr. Banderas who supplies the energy.He grew up going to the theater with his parents: plays by Lope de Vega, Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca. He marveled at theater as an act of civilization. \u201cIt was so beautiful,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are all here and we have an agreement. We\u2019re going to sit down here and you\u2019re going to tell me a story and you have to make me believe it. And I thought, \u2018This is [expletive] magical.\u2019\u201d He wanted to be on the other side of the theater. He wanted to be onstage.But his parents had seen how artists were treated under the dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco. Many were exiled. His mother was distraught. \u201cDon\u2019t be an actor,\u201d she pleaded. \u201cBe something dignified.\u201d He thought maybe he\u2019d be a soccer player instead.Then in 1976, the year after Franco died, an American theater company came through M\u00e1laga with \u201cHair\u201d and it was just over for Mr. Banderas. \u201cOh, my God. What is this? What is this beard and this long hair and this freedom?,\u201d he remembered thinking. He told his parents, \u201cI have to do this. I have to do this type of theater. This is theater that is revolutionary.\u201dIn 1981, while sitting at Caf\u00e9 Gij\u00f3n in Madrid, a man with a red briefcase held court telling funny stories. Mr. Banderas had long hair and a mustache for a role in a play. The man looked at him and said: \u201cYou should do film cinema. You are very romantic and you have a romantic face.\u201d Mr. Banderas said, \u201cO.K. Cool.\u201d Afterward, he asked other patrons if anyone knew who the man was. \u201cThey said to me: \u2018He\u2019s called Pedro Almod\u00f3var. He made one movie\u2019\u201d \u2014 he had, in fact, already made two feature films and several shorts \u2014 \u201c\u2018but he\u2019s not going to make any more.\u2019\u201dTwo days later, Mr. Almod\u00f3var came to see Mr. Banderas in the play. In the dressing room afterward, he asked Mr. Banderas if he wanted to do a movie with him. \u201cSure,\u201d Mr. Banderas said. Their first movie was the 1982 comedy \u201cLabyrinth of Passion,\u201d in which he plays a terrorist.They made six more movies together. He played complex, brooding men \u2014 people with souls. In Spain, for Mr. Almod\u00f3var, the soul was inherent in the character. Later, in the United States, working for American directors, Mr. Banderas had to create his characters\u2019 souls.He had a choice. He could go back to Spain and work with great directors \u2014 the star system there revolves around auteurs, not actors \u2014 and there was no shortage of deep, complex roles for him.His fellow Hispanic actors asked him, \u201cSo, are you going to stay in America?\u201d He told them, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know. Maybe. Yeah.\u201d They told him, \u201cWell, if you stay here you\u2019re going to be the bad guy, number one.\u201d They told him he would only ever get cast as a member of a cartel or a gang.But it was too late. By 1996, he was married to Melanie Griffith. They had a daughter, Stella. He had grown attached to his stepchildren. The question became one not of artistic fulfillment but of practicality. \u201cHow can I keep my career here? I\u2019m married here. I live here. I have to play here.\u201dAnd he loved America. \u201cThe culture here.\u201d He shimmered with delight. \u201cThere is something very beautiful about America, very innocent. Oh, yes. It\u2019s still new. It\u2019s innocent.\u201dI expressed some surprise. Over the course of my time in Hungary with him, we\u2019d gotten word of the mass school shooting in Parkland, Fla. America had become horrifying to me. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you guys believe. You believe everything \u2014 even in this moment you believe.\u201d In Europe, he said, people are skeptical. There\u2019s the weight of history. But America, man. \u201cI love NASA. I love those institutions. And I remember visiting Houston and going there and me doing my eyes like this.\u201d He made his eyes big and full of disbelief.And the innovation! \u201cThese people that invent Googles and Apples and all these companies, they put heart in the skies. Elon Musk doing this thing is unbelievable to me.\u201dSo he played what he called the \u201cexotic guy.\u201d His agent told him he\u2019d become more powerful the more he said no. \u201cBut,\u201d he would say. \u201cI have a problem here because I have to build a career almost handicapped.\u201d He knew he was offered jobs that weren\u2019t quite the best, jobs that had been offered to five or 10 actors before him.\u201cI cannot play in the same league as certain American actors because my accent didn\u2019t allow me just to play a banker from New York or an astronaut,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I have to be balancing. And it\u2019s almost like the guy in the circus that tried to keep all the plates going. And if he stops they fall. And so I did have to do in my career things that I wouldn\u2019t have done, yes.\u201d What could he do? \u201cIt was a desert for Spanish actors.\u201dBut lately, a strange thing started happening. He\u2019s not being asked to wear matador outfits anymore. At the ripe (but still extremely handsome) age of 57, the roles got better. \u201cThey have more weight, they are more complex, they are more profound and I enjoy more to play them because you can just actually find many different ways to play,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a pot and you can\u2019t stop putting things in. Before it was a uniform almost. They wanted the heroic, the epic, the guy.\u201dMaybe it\u2019s the Hispanic population coming of age, he wondered. Great numbers with advanced degrees and a real presence in cinema. \u201cNow it\u2019s normal to see at the Academy Awards Mexican directors taking Oscars, Spanish actors, actors from Puerto Rico.\u201dMr. Banderas lives in England now, in Surrey, about an hour southwest of London. He lives there with his girlfriend, Nicole Kimpel, an investment adviser he met at Cannes a few years ago.The truth is, he doesn\u2019t need to be in America anymore. So many movie shoots are done in Europe now for tax reasons. And Ms. Kimpel has an identical twin sister who lives in Switzerland whom she can\u2019t bear to be too far away from.What did he need to stay in the United States for anyway? His days of co-parenting are over. Stella is off at the University of Southern California, studying cinema. Of his divorce from Ms. Griffith in 2015 he says: \u201cMelanie is a very generous woman and an excellent mother and a great lover for many years. But there is a moment that things were not working and before we started damaging each other we just decided to take that option.\u201dHere\u2019s the truth about why Antonio Banderas stayed in the States for so long. Yes, he got married. Yes, he loved NASA and the Googles. Yes, he loved our innocence. But you know what else? He won\u2019t say it, almost out of fealty to the country he was born in, but Ms. Hayek and Mr. Rodriguez will. In Spain, Ms. Hayek said, \u201cHe could not do some of the action movies. He\u2019d never been on Broadway.\u201dThat\u2019s who Antonio Banderas is. \u201cHe\u2019s someone who wants to eat the world,\u201d Mr. Rodriguez told me.You can\u2019t just eat the world from Europe, though. That\u2019s the thing about being an actor in America. When you\u2019re famous here, you\u2019re famous everywhere. Mr. Banderas stayed here because Spain simply wasn\u2019t big enough for him.In Hungary, sitting in his makeup chair in the set of \u201cPicasso,\u201d Mr. Banderas said, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to look into the mirror and see a doddering old man.\u201d He didn\u2019t take his eyes off himself when he spoke. \u201cPicasso is 67 here. I\u2019m two-and-a-half years away from 60. It\u2019s not so far away.\u201d He tilted his head, evaluating his cheek. \u201cIt\u2019s scary to visit an age before you get there. But it\u2019s somehow even scarier when it\u2019s not that far away.\u201dAbout a year ago, Mr. Banderas was preparing breakfast in his home when his arm began to hurt. He\u2019d had an arrhythmia issue for years, and one of his doctors in Los Angeles had told him he had a blockage in one of his arteries. He\u2019d been under a lot of stress recently \u2014 the divorce, the move. He filmed seven movies that year. He was smoking. The pain in his arm was faint, but suddenly he felt it in his jaw. That\u2019s when he knew: He was having a heart attack.He was in the hospital for just a day. As the nurse, who was a fan, said goodbye to him, she said: \u201cAntonio, you\u2019re going to be very sad. For like a month or two months you\u2019ll be very sad because the hearts hold feelings. And you\u2019re going to feel like the world is crumbling around you. Don\u2019t worry because you can put it back where it was and be the happy person that you are and continue doing your work.\u201dHe didn\u2019t think much of it, but as he recuperated, he found that he couldn\u2019t shake his sadness. It engulfed him. It was like nothing he\u2019d ever felt before. \u201cSuddenly, you discover at your root level that it can be like in a second you can say goodbye.\u201dBut he\u2019s Antonio Banderas, so eventually the sadness made way for a different feeling: inspiration. He was still here. He was still here and he had so much left to do.During filming, he was different than usual. \u201cI was not so anxious about what is going to be the result of this, what is going to be their opinions. No, it was about me. It was \u2014 well, it\u2019s very genuine because actually I love this profession. What about that? I love this profession.\u201dAfter that, \u201cthings magically start happening. Picasso came walking into my life.\u201dThe silicone was now gone from his face. The hair was, too. He looked like a beautiful egg. Every day when the makeup came off, he was relieved to see that he was still there underneath. It\u2019s scary to get old. Maybe it\u2019s even scarier because you still have all the energy in the world, I suggested, and you feel like you haven\u2019t done the thing you\u2019ll be remembered for yet.He smiled. I took him too literally, he said. It\u2019s not that he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll be remembered for what he\u2019s already done. It\u2019s just that \u2026 Did he tell me the story yet about what Dal\u00ed supposedly used to say? \u201cHe used to say, \u2018I am a very mediocre painter for the reason that I don\u2019t want to die. In fact, I am the best painter in the world but I don\u2019t paint a good painting because if I paint a good painting I will die the next day. So I prefer to be mediocre.\u2019\u201dHe gave me a combination [laughing with mouth open emoji] and [eyerolling emoji]. Ay, was Dal\u00ed crazy. Didn\u2019t he know? Dignity comes when it\u2019s required. Didn\u2019t he know? Greatness only gets greater the more it\u2019s practiced. Oh yes. That\u2019s how greatness works.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Finding Peace of Mind for Your Home Away From Home", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGeneva Simms and Nathan Lavertue were driving to their country house in Dutchess County one recent weekend when there was yet another spring snowstorm. But when they arrived late that night, their home, which was built around 1780 and was once a Quaker meetinghouse and a stop on the Underground Railroad, wasn\u2019t bitterly cold. That is because during his lunch break in Brooklyn, Mr. Lavertue had turned on the heat remotely, using his smartphone.\u201cWe have three cameras \u2014 two exterior and one interior \u2014 four Nest thermostats, two Echo Dots, one Echo Show, one traditional Echo and 10 smart lights. And also the Nest smoke detector,\u201d said Mr. Lavertue, a global experience design director for IBM, who installed the equipment himself. \u201cThe cameras are for security, but they provide plenty of entertainment. I have really funny footage of Geneva running after a U.P.S. truck.\u201dBut while smart home systems can offer second-home owners peace of mind while they are away, they cannot step in if a pipe bursts or a driveway is buried beneath a pile of snow. For that reason, many homeowners, even those with extensive smart home systems, supplement the technology with old-fashioned human help.\u201cUsually, I suggest a two-pronged approach,\u201d said Jessica Chutka-Pelletier, a broker with Douglas Elliman in Chappaqua, who sold Mr. Lavertue and Ms. Simms their home. \u201cFor ease of use, I suggest apps and a lot of DIY things, then I give my buyers a list of local people to call.\u201dAmong the professionals she recommends is her husband, who happens to be a general contractor. Mr. Lavertue and Ms. Simms hired him to do renovation work and a lawn care company to plow their driveway.\u201cI started out doing some landscaping, and word spread from there,\u201d said Mr. Brent, who checks on his customers\u2019 homes once a week, conducting a 21-point inspection, from the mailbox to the basement, for a fee of $55 an hour. The company also provides ancillary services, or will find third parties to do so, from power-washing furniture to changing light bulbs and fixing HVAC and plumbing systems.\u201cThese are weekenders, so if they come up on a Friday night and the heat is broken,\u201d he said, \u201cit is an emergency and they have to call the heating company to come.\u201dMr. Brent said he addresses any problems that arise during the week, \u201cso that when they come up, they only have to turn the key in the door and turn on the lights and enjoy themselves.\u201dMary Trier has a similar company on the North Fork of Long Island. Her job, particularly during the fall and winter months, centers on coastal erosion and protecting homes from storm damage. \u201cI thrive on the bad weather,\u201d she said. \u201cI am fixated with the weather report.\u201dMs. Trier provides a range of services, from securing beachside steps to critter control, and charges a monthly retainer of $120 to $125, which includes weekly property checks. For anything more, she charges an hourly fee of $25 to $30.\u201cI started out with just a few houses and that stayed constant for a while,\u201d she said. \u201cBut recently business has exploded.\u201dFor those who want to supplement services like Mr. Brent\u2019s or Ms. Trier\u2019s with smart home systems, there are a number of options, from traditional firms like ADT to relative newcomers like Nest.\u201cThe system provides peace of mind,\u201d said Maxime Veron, director of product strategy at Nest, adding that the majority of the company\u2019s customers install the systems themselves.Of course, some homeowners can\u2019t be bothered to deal with installing smart home security systems, or face having to work with management companies.

{"Headline": "Huawei and ZTE Hit Hard as U.S. Moves Against Chinese Tech Firms", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe United States undercut China\u2019s technology ambitions on Tuesday, advancing a new rule that would limit the ability of Chinese telecommunications companies to sell their products in this country.The Federal Communications Commission voted unanimously to move forward with a plan that would prevent federally subsidized telecommunications carriers from using suppliers deemed to pose a risk to American national security. The decision takes direct aim at Huawei, which makes telecommunications network equipment and smartphones, and its main Chinese rival, ZTE, sending a message that the government doesn\u2019t trust them.The moves intensify an already testy fight between China and the United States for high-tech supremacy. Although tensions have simmered for years, the two economic powerhouses are threatening a global trade war as they look to protect their most advanced industries.Long bedeviled by political concerns about its ties to the Chinese government, Huawei (pronounced \u201cHWA-way\u201d) has spent the better part of the last decade trying to sell its equipment and phones in the United States.Since then, Huawei has signaled that its political battles in Washington may be all but lost. The company has been dialing back on government outreach in the United States, including lobbying, and last week it cut key staff there, according to people familiar with the matter. The new F.C.C. rule, which would become final with a second vote, could kill off what little equipment business Huawei has in the United States.These are uncertain times for tech companies, whether American or Chinese, that are trying to do business across the Pacific. The two nations are playing an aggressive game of one-upsmanship, both to support their own companies and guard against threats to national security. Last month, the Trump administration accused Beijing of stealing American know-how as part of its ambitions to transform the Chinese economy, prompting tit-for-tat tariffs.The latest moves against Huawei and ZTE mean that American companies like Apple and Qualcomm could soon be caught in the crossfire \u2014 and they have a lot to lose. Apple, for example, sold $46.5 billion worth of iPhones and other products in mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong last year. That was about 20 percent of its total sales.Wealthy Chinese consumers have gravitated toward Apple, and President Xi Jinping and the Communist Party still aim to keep the public happy. But there are limits to Apple\u2019s leverage in the country.\u201cBeijing will not sit idly by,\u201d said Paul Triolo, who leads global technology policy analysis at Eurasia Group, a geopolitical risk consultancy. \u201cChinese officials will likely pause to digest this move, and the series of other trade and investment moves coming at them in waves, before deciding how best to respond. It is likely to get ugly before it gets better.\u201dBeijing could use its broad cybersecurity laws to steal the core computer code of American companies operating in China, said Dean Garfield, head of the Information Technology Industry Council, a trade group that represents the largest American tech companies. The Chinese government also could walk back recent commitments to allow more financial and electronic payments services from Mastercard, Visa and JPMorgan Chase. Or it could simply restrict American companies\u2019 ability to do business in China, he said.For ZTE, this week\u2019s sanctions are a nightmare come true. The company\u2019s smartphones and network gear rely on American microchips and software, which means it could need to redesign as much as 90 percent of its product line.ZTE and Google, which supplies the Android operating system in the Chinese company\u2019s phones, are concerned that the ban may prevent ZTE from licensing the software, according to a person familiar with the discussions but not permitted to speak publicly on the matter. No conclusion has been reached yet, the person said.Huawei is a global telecommunications equipment powerhouse, with $93 billion in revenue last year. It has spent millions trying to pry its way into the United States but found few takers \u2014 save for smaller, rural telecom companies that receive federal subsidies and would likely be barred from working with it by the F.C.C. rule.Huawei\u2019s troubles in the United States have been mounting since 2012, when a congressional report warned that its gear could be used to spy on Americans or to destabilize American telecom networks. The company spent $1.2 million on lobbying that year. Last year, it spent $60,000.Major American carriers such as Verizon and AT&T have since shunned Huawei. The Commerce and Treasury Departments have subpoenaed it over possible violations of American sanctions on Iran and North Korea. And bills are before Congress to stop government agencies and contractors from buying Huawei products.In January, researchers discovered security flaws in the microprocessors inside nearly all of the world\u2019s computers. A Senate committee wrote to Huawei\u2019s founder to ask what the company knew about the vulnerabilities, and how it had been affected by them. Huawei decided not to respond.Then, last week, Huawei laid off five American employees, including William B. Plummer, the executive who was the face of its Sisyphean efforts to win over Washington.The company has said repeatedly that its products pose no security risk and that it complies with the law everywhere it operates. Still, the layoffs appear to be an acknowledgment by Huawei that it has failed to clear the political cloud around it.\u201cSome things cannot change their course according to our wishes,\u201d Eric Xu, Huawei\u2019s deputy chairman, said at the company\u2019s annual meeting with analysts on Tuesday in its home city, Shenzhen. \u201cWith some things, when you let them go, you actually feel more at ease.\u201dMr. Plummer, who was Huawei\u2019s vice president of external affairs, had been with the company for almost eight years. He was the most senior member of Huawei\u2019s American policy team who was not a Chinese citizen.It is not clear whether he will be replaced. The company\u2019s policy operations in the United States are led by a relatively recent arrival, Zhang Ruijun, who took the post nine months ago after working for the company in Mexico and Russia.A Huawei spokesman said in a statement that any layoffs simply reflected an effort to better align resources with \u201cbusiness strategy and objectives.\u201d\u201cAny changes to staffing size or structure are simply a reflection of standard business organization,\u201d he said.In the United States, Huawei customers that would be affected by the F.C.C.\u2019s proposed rule \u2014 small cellular carriers, largely in rural areas \u2014 may soon need to find new equipment suppliers.These carriers love Huawei gear, said Carri Bennet, general counsel for the Rural Wireless Association, an industry group for American telecom companies with fewer than 100,000 subscribers.The association\u2019s members have even elected a Huawei executive, William Levy, to their board.Ms. Bennet said that rather than blacklisting specific manufacturers, Washington should be creating a system for testing telecom gear for security vulnerabilities.\u201cThese companies who are reliant on this support, they don\u2019t have the funds to overhaul their whole network,\u201d she said. \u201cPublic safety, getting 911 services, broadband \u2014 it all just starts falling apart.\u201dDaisuke Wakabayashi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Privacy Changes Leave Developers Steaming", "Date": "2018-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For years, Cubeyou made a business out of personal data on Facebook. The company had unfettered access to Facebook users\u2019 information, which it gathered up through quizzes and later sold as reports to clients.Federico Treu, Cubeyou\u2019s chief executive, told The New York Times that his company had done nothing wrong, and that it had followed Facebook\u2019s rules in disclosing that it was using profile data for both academic and business purposes. He said Cubeyou was just collateral damage as Facebook has overzealously scrambled to show that it cares about data privacy.\u201cFacebook threw us under the bus,\u201d said Mr. Treu, who added that he intended to boycott a Facebook event for developers this week. \u201cFacebook became what it was because of us developers. Now they want to blame us for everything that has happened to them.\u201dSome, like Cubeyou, said they have been unfairly blocked from accessing Facebook users. Tinder, the dating app, discovered that its users were no longer able to log into the app using their Facebook accounts. Pod, a calendar syncing app, found that its users could no longer see Facebook events within their calendars. And Job Fusion, a jobs app that allowed users to see where their Facebook friends worked, announced that it was not longer able to offer its services within Facebook.Facebook said it expected roughly 5,000 people \u2014 a record high \u2014 to be at the developer conference, which is known as F8. But the company also said it has tweaked the event with an eye toward data privacy. For example, the social network canceled the announcement of a Facebook smart home speaker to challenge Amazon\u2019s Echo and Google\u2019s Home amid worries that the device would raise more questions about the amount of data the company collects.Ime Archibong, Facebook\u2019s vice president of product partnerships, said developers are \u201cincredible partners\u201d for the company, but also added that it must \u201cstrike the right balance between creating compelling social experiences, protecting people\u2019s data, and supporting an innovative developer ecosystem.\"Bhaskar Chakravorti, senior associate dean at The Fletcher School at Tufts University, said Facebook had to walk a fine line. \u201cThey have taken a blunt instrument approach, which is the right thing to do from a public relations standpoint,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now they need to reach out to developers and smooth things over.\u201dFacebook announced a series of privacy changes in early April. Under the new measures, developers can only see a Facebook user\u2019s name, profile photo and email address; previously, the could see more information, like users\u2019 Facebook posts. Facebook is also cutting off developers\u2019 access to user accounts if someone has not used their apps for three months or longer. That policy is intended to prevent developers from collecting information in the background for months or years after people stop using their apps.Facebook also announced that it was investigating apps that had gained access to large amounts of its data in the past, and said it was conducting an audit of any company that it believed has shown suspicious activity.Cubeyou got caught up in the dragnet in early April. At the time, CNBC reported that the company, which is based in Redwood City, Calif., had collected users\u2019 Facebook information for academic purposes and then sold the data to commercial firms without informing users. Facebook said it was conducting an audit of Cubeyou to determine if there was any wrongdoing.Mr. Treu said Cubeyou fully complies with Facebook\u2019s requirements of disclosing the data it collects and what that data is used for. He added that Cubeyou strips out any personally identifiable information that it gets from Facebook. Cubeyou is simply being singled out as part of \u201ca witch hunt\u201d by Facebook, he said.\u201cWe did everything by the rules, and we are ready to prove that,\u201d said Mr. Treu, who said his company has repeatedly reached out to Facebook to talk. \u201cThere is no way to talk to them, to find out anything.\u201dAn earlier version of this story misstated the given name of CubeYou\u2019s chief executive. He is Federico Treu, not Frederico.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Mark Zuckerberg is back on Capitol Hill.\u2022 Why would a trade war with China be good for the United States economy?\u2022 Has Facebook opened itself up to regulation?\u2022 Bank of America\u2019s move on gun sales.\u2022 Why did the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of N.Y. recuse himself from the Michael Cohen raid?Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s second day of Congressional grilling lifted its shares again.The stock rose 0.8 percent, even as the broader market dropped 0.6 percent.While it remains to be seen whether Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s performance will keep regulations at bay, his testimony was certainly a tonic for investors. Facebook\u2019s two-day rise of more than 5 percent added over $24 billion to its market capitalization, according to Bloomberg data.\u201cZuckerberg appears willing to work with lawmakers on possible regulations, which may create a barrier to entry in the social network space and help Facebook maintain its market leadership.\u201d\u2014 Matt PhillipsMark Zuckerberg is back on Capitol Hill for a second day of congressional testimony.Here are some highlights :\u2022 Representative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon and chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee, kicked off the hearing by declaring that \u201cwhile Facebook has certainly grown, I worry it has not matured.\u201d Mr. Walden floated the prospect of regulation, saying that \u201cI think it is time to ask whether Facebook may have moved too fast and broken too many things.\u201d\u2022 Mr. Walden also asked: \u201cWhat exactly is Facebook?\u201d The definitions matter. If Facebook is viewed as a telecommunications service that is more like a utility, it may be regulated by the Federal Communications Commission. If lawmakers define Facebook as a publisher, it could also fall under regulations at that agency. \u201cI consider us to be a technology company,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg answered. \u201cThe primary thing we do is have engineers that write code and build services for other people.\u201d\u2022 Representative Frank Pallone, a New Jersey Democrat, pressed Mr. Zuckerberg on whether Facebook would agree or refuse to change Facebook\u2019s default settings to minimize collection and use of users\u2019 data. \u201cThis is a complex issue that deserves more than a one-word answer,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg answered. \u201cThat\u2019s disappointing to me,\u201d Mr. Pallone responded.\u2022 California Democrat Anna Eshoo put it more bluntly, asking Mr. Zuckerberg: \u201cAre you willing to change your business model to protect users\u2019 privacy?\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg was noncommittal, saying: \u201cCongresswoman, I\u2019m not sure what that means.\u201d\u2022 Representative Joe Barton, Republican of Texas, pressed Mr. Zuckerberg on why Facebook has been allegedly censoring content from conservative organizations and Trump supporters such as Diamond and Silk. Mr. Barton also asked Mr. Zuckerberg if he would agree that Facebook would work to ensure it is \u201ca neutral public platform.\u201d \u201cI do agree that we should give people a voice,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.\u2022 Rep. Gene Green, a Texas Democrat, and Jan Schakowsky, an Illinois Democrat, pressed Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s promise to give users worldwide the same privacy controls required by a tough new data protection law which will go into effect in the European Union next month. Mr. Green also asked Mr. Zuckerberg if Facebook planned to comply with the provision in the European law that allows individuals to obtain a copy of the data companies hold about them.\u2022 A number of lawmakers have tried to draw a comparison between the Obama campaign\u2019s use of a Facebook app to scrape data from users and their friends in 2012 and Cambridge Analytica. Those lawmakers have failed to mention one very important distinction between the Obama campaign\u2019s app and Cambridge Analytica\u2019s app: The Obama app was actually on Facebook itself, and it was very clear about who and what the data would be used for. The app used to scrape data for Cambridge Analytica was accessed through a personality questionnaire hosted on a site outside of Facebook, and it appeared to users to be for academic research, not for a political data company owned by a wealthy Republican donor and dedicated to reshaping the American electorate.Mr. Musk told co-host Gayle King:\u201cI think whenever something is \u2013 whenever there\u2019s something that affects the public good then there does need to be some form of public oversight. \u2026 I do think there should be some regulations on AI. I think there should be regulations on social media to the degree that it negatively affects the public good. We can\u2019t have like willy-nilly proliferation of fake news, that\u2019s crazy. You can\u2019t have more types of fake news than real news. That\u2019s allowing public deception to go unchecked. That\u2019s crazy.\u201dAndrew writes: These were the most important words from Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s five-hour testimony: \u201cI agree we are responsible for the content.\u201d They may come back to haunt him, given his previous rejection of calling Facebook a publisher. He later backtracked and called his business a tech company, but his acknowledgment may fundamentally shift the conversation \u2014 and how the company operates. (All in all, Mr. Zuckerberg did better than anyone had expected.)Lawmakers now seem much more aware of how much power large technology companies have. This was encapsulated in questions posed by Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina. He framed Facebook as a monopoly and brought up the possibility of regulating Facebook, asking Mr. Zuckerberg: \u201cBut you as a company welcome regulation?\u201dAnd Facebook may now only be one big scandal away from a more stringent government response.Critics\u2019 corner\u201cUnder a symbiotic U.S.-China relationship, America became a preeminent technology leader, and its brands are today the envy of the world. China improved the standard of living of its citizens with a tenfold increase in per capita gross domestic product over the past 20 years.\u201dBut that relationship will change over the next two decades, Mr. Ma said:\u201cChina is shifting its economy from the world\u2019s largest exporter to the world\u2019s largest consumer. Chinese citizens now have the wealth and income to pursue discretionary spending. They want to buy high-quality imported food, cosmetics, fashions and health and wellness products for themselves and their children.\u201dMr. Ma goes on to write:\u201cIt is therefore ironic that the U.S. administration is waging a trade war at a time when the largest potential consumer market in the world is open for business. Is America going to forfeit this opportunity?Instigating a trade war is the wrong solution because it will only provoke retaliation. The Chinese government responded to U.S. tariff threats with its own tariffs on American agricultural products, such as soybeans. China is the largest export market for American soybeans, worth $14 billion annually and accounting for 65 percent of all U.S. soybean exports.The U.S. has been a consistent defender of free and open markets, but this time it is resorting to protectionism that will not improve American competitiveness. Any country seeking to increase exports would do better to focus on developing good products and channels to access foreign markets rather than putting up trade barriers.\u201dShari Redstone, whose National Amusements controls CBS and Viacom, is seeking to combine the two media companies.From Reuters:\u201cHer longtime friend and business ally, powerful CBS Chief Executive Les Moonves, has emerged as one of the biggest obstacles to a potential CBS-Viacom tie-up, according to people familiar with the matter. Concerns are that his objections could either doom the transaction or that he might not lead the new entity, the people said.\u201cMoonves is chafing at Redstone\u2019s insistence on installing Viacom\u2019s CEO as his second-in-command and likely successor of a merged company, the people say.\u201dBank of America works with \u201cjust a handful\u201d of such manufacturers, according to its vice chairwoman Anne Finucane. Their reactions? \u201cMixed,\u201d she said.It\u2019s not exactly a surprise. SoftBank\u2019s Masa Son bought control of Sprint planning to merge it with T-Mobile, the better to fight Verizon and AT&T. And most analysts agree that both companies need to become bigger to survive.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is Facebook\u2019s Campbell Brown a Force to Be Reckoned With? Or Is She Fake News?", "Date": "2018-04-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was another terrible day for Facebook and the company had dispatched Campbell Brown, its head of news partnerships, to do some damage control.\u201cIf it were me, I would have probably not threatened to sue The Guardian,\u201d Ms. Brown said, with a Southern lilt in her voice and the easy charm of a onetime broadcast anchor. \u201cProbably not our wisest move.\u201d\u201cIs she on her way out?\u201d Emily Bell, a professor at Columbia Journalism School who had been on stage with Ms. Brown, wondered later. \u201cShe is one of the few people from Facebook who will voice what sounds like disappointment.\u201dMs. Brown, 49, wasn\u2019t out at Facebook. Yet she has long had to grapple with questions about whether she really has influence at the social network.Since joining the Silicon Valley company in 2017 to repair its frayed relationship with the news media, many have considered the former CNN and NBC anchor as little more than window dressing. Others see her as a more insidious figure \u2014 a telegenic personality with close ties to conservative figures who can offer Facebook\u2019s outreach the veneer of journalistic credibility. To them, she is an ambassador from a dictatorship, willing to deliver bad news with a smile and some canap\u00e9s. No matter their view of her, almost all question what influence she has at a company where the chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has viewed news \u2014 both making it and displaying it \u2014 as a headache.Facebook \u2014 with its reach of more than 2.2 billion users \u2014 already holds enormous power over the news that people consume. But now it is making its first venture into licensed news content. Facebook has set aside a $90 million budget to have partners develop original news programming, and Ms. Brown is pitching publishers on making Facebook-specific news shows featuring mainstream anchors, according to two people involved in or briefed on the matter, who asked not to be identified because the details were confidential.Ms. Brown is also pushing paywalls for publishers on the social network, another first for a company that has long avoided circulating any content that users would have to pay for.Ms. Brown declined to speak on the record but some Facebook colleagues spoke about how she has navigated the relationships with the news media and inside the company, even as the social network\u2019s own rapport with journalism remains uneasy.\u201cCampbell leads a critical piece of our business,\u201d said Dan Rose, Facebook\u2019s vice president for partnerships. \u201cShe\u2019s been incredibly effective, and she\u2019s just getting started.\u201dMs. Brown was born into a tight-knit Catholic family in 1968 in Ferriday, La., population about 5,000. Her father, a local politician and state insurance commissioner, once served a prison stint for lying to the F.B.I. during an investigation related to an insurance company.In her youth, Ms. Brown was kicked out of an all-girls boarding school for sneaking off campus to a party. She spent two years at Louisiana State University before attending Regis University, a small Jesuit school in Denver. Afterward, she moved to then-Czechoslovakia for two years to teach English before returning to the United States and beginning a television news career, going from a local station in Topeka, Kan., to Richmond, Va., then Baltimore.Her approach on camera was confrontational, yet likable. In 1996, she got a call from NBC News.Some said her behavior now, seemingly throwing Facebook\u2019s strategy of silence under the bus, mirrors that letter.But after leaving CNN, Ms. Brown did shed her journalistic skin, and turned herself into a political animal.\u201cShe was a celebrity in ed reform,\u201d said Eva Moskowitz, the founder and chief executive of the Success Academy Charter Schools, where Ms. Brown is a board member. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t have people of her prominence before.\u201dBy then, Facebook was in crisis mode over how it handled news.Many in the news business were immediately skeptical about what Ms. Brown might do.\u201cIf you wanted to deeply understand American journalists, having a TV personality is not really the first place you would go,\u201d said Tom Rosenstiel, executive director of the American Press Institute, a nonprofit that supports news media with research and training.At Facebook, Ms. Brown became part of an informal cadre on the company\u2019s business side known as the FOSSes, or \u201cFriends of Sheryl Sandberg.\u201d But close association with a powerful figure within the company does not assure her of success.When it comes to decisions related to publishers, the power at Facebook has traditionally been more with the product staff, who tend to be aligned more with Mr. Zuckerberg and cloistered from meetings with partners, according to several media executives. Google, in contrast, has a similar power dynamic but, publishers said, a more robust partnership structure and easier contact with product teams.\u201cShe\u2019s smart, but we\u2019re different beasts,\u201d Richard Gingras, the vice president for news at Google, said of Ms. Brown. \u201cI\u2019m in a fortunate position where I\u2019m involved with the product. I can make change. I feel for her, I really do.\u201dWhile Ms. Brown has helped Facebook mount its charm offensives at industry events, her efforts to remake Facebook\u2019s relationships with publishers has meant cutting back her visibility to the broader public.\u201cThere was a time you couldn\u2019t turn on a T.V. and not see Campbell Brown,\u201d said Ben Winkler, chief investment officer for OMD, a global media agency. \u201cSince she went to Facebook, Campbell Brown is where?\u201dThe answer, it turns out, was close to home. Editors talk about Facebook as an authoritarian regime or perhaps an ideological cult, and they call Ms. Brown its emissary to the city.At these events, attendees are met with wine and hors d\u2019oeuvres (seared tuna, and a cheese and cracker buffet). Guests describe Ms. Brown as \u201ca hoot\u201d with a sharp humor. When she calls the party to order, the group sits around her living room on leather cowhide seats and polished wooden stumps.Ms. Brown typically has a guest of honor from Facebook, such as the chief product officer Chris Cox, and allows questions. If she deems a question too challenging for the guest, she pushes back against the inquisitor \u2014 her go-to is some form of the retort, \u201cReally?\u201dThe gatherings are frequently a who\u2019s who of the news media, mixing long-established outlets with digitally focused newcomers. The guest lists have included Ben Smith, the BuzzFeed editor in chief; David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker; Nick Thompson, the editor of Wired; and the Vox publisher Melissa Bell. One editor, who asked not to be identified because these gatherings are off the record, said he felt \u201chumiliated\u201d afterward, having been reminded that the power of traditional publishers is waning.The gatherings are the first outreach Facebook has made to the New York media world \u2014 a world that is increasingly beholden to the company\u2019s power.\u201cI know a lot of publishers there, they have to manage good relationships in order to survive, let alone thrive,\u201d said Jason Kint, chief executive of Digital Content Next, a trade association serving digital content companies. \u201cIt\u2019s not getting better.\u201dSome said Ms. Brown has had more influence on Facebook than they expected, citing the introduction of paywalls and the prospect of the company paying for content.\u201cI think she\u2019s been a stronger figure in that role than any platform has ever had,\u201d Mr. Smith said.As much as those soirees may include needling from her, Ms. Brown\u2019s daytime summits with publishers tend to be more overtly contentious. At one recent meeting, two publishers complained about having lost a lot of online traffic after changes to Facebook\u2019s News Feed. According to one publisher who was present, Ms. Brown told them the company would give them more traffic if they stopped doing clickbait.Still, the media industry has been so beaten down by Facebook that some said they were happy to just have someone in the company who talks to them.\u201cWe see some small movement in the right direction in terms of at least improving transparency,\u201d said Jim Bankoff, chief executive of Vox Media. There had not been \u201creal movement in terms of providing better business opportunity,\u201d he added. \u201cBut at least we\u2019re being listened to.\u201dMs. Brown recently helped arrange a meeting between Mr. Zuckerberg and several members of The Washington Post management team: Martin Baron, the editor; Fred Ryan, the chief executive; and Shailesh Prakash, the chief product officer. The group discussed whether a Facebook user should hit a paywall on Post content after clicking on three, five or 10 articles. Mr. Zuckerberg said 10, but The Post executives wanted a paywall to start after 3 articles, according to a person who was in the meeting.Ms. Brown went for the middle ground, pushing Mr. Zuckerberg to give The Post a test run of paywalls that kick in after three and five Post articles are read. She won. Since March 1, The Post has been doing just that, according to Mr. Prakash.\u201cShe\u2019s helped us,\u201d Mr. Prakash said.But Ms. Brown\u2019s biggest project is developing a news apparatus within Facebook\u2019s premium video section, called Watch.She is negotiating with BuzzFeed, Vox, CNN, Fox News and others to partner on creating about a half-dozen Facebook-exclusive shows, which will launch in May and June.Building off these shows, Ms. Brown is pushing to create a curated breaking news destination and envisions a cohesive daily Facebook newscast using partner content highlights \u2014 paid for by Facebook, made by media partners, and edited by a growing editorial team, according to a person familiar with her thinking.Discussing Facebook\u2019s reticence to put paywalls in and engage with publishers transparently, Ms. Brown said at the February media and tech conference that it had taken too long for the social network to come around to a workable news strategy.\u201cI\u2019m having a hard time with patience right now,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I know publishers are too.\u201dAn earlier version of this article erroneously included a reference to Palestinian actions as an example of the sort of far-right conspiracy stories that have plagued Facebook. In fact, Palestinian officials have acknowledged providing payments to the families of Palestinians killed while carrying out attacks on Israelis or convicted of terrorist acts and imprisoned in Israel; that is not a conspiracy theory.Advertisement"}

News Beyond Facebook!", "Date": "2018-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsIt\u2019s hard to imagine now, but at one point, long ago, Facebook did not monopolize the entire tech news cycle \u2014 a heady and innocent era when you could read an entire day\u2019s news without encountering the words \u201cCambridge Analytica\u201d or \u201cthird-party developers.\u201dI confess that, like many of you, I have been obsessed with the fallout from Facebook\u2019s latest privacy scandal, to the point that I had a stress dream that I overslept and missed covering Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony on Capitol Hill next week. (Related: I need to get out more, and possibly take up yoga.)But despite the wall-to-wall news of the past few weeks, lots of important things are happening in the tech world that don\u2019t involve Facebook. So let\u2019s run down a few of them?Second, the Google-Pentagon incident is a revealing story about the leverage that Silicon Valley engineers have over their companies. Because the labor market for engineers in the Bay Area is so tight, and because companies live and die on their ability to attract and retain talent, these employees have much more say in how a company like Google governs itself than, say, regulators or outside activists. If an antiwar group protests outside Google\u2019s headquarters, it\u2019s an annoyance. But if 3,000 engineers walk out, it\u2019s a crisis. And as the tech industry goes through its moral reckoning, executives of these companies should bear in mind that their biggest risk isn\u2019t regulation, it\u2019s rebellion from within.It\u2019s a tragic reminder that social platforms aren\u2019t just websites anymore. They\u2019re powerful economies unto themselves, and even seemingly minor policy decisions can alter the lives of millions of people, a few of whom might be disturbed enough to act on their darkest impulses.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Online or in Politics, \u2018Backlash\u2019 Is as Predictable as Weather", "Date": "2018-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFirst WordsIs it possible that anger qualifies, at this point, as a national pastime? It roils our cultural dialogue, poisons social media and \u2014 as is frequently, and somewhat helplessly, observed \u2014 it curdles much of our politics into a zero-sum game of tribal loathing. It is the predictable response to almost any new development, significant or otherwise: Whatever happens, someone\u2019s fury will most likely rise to meet it, and in the right conditions, it will gather quickly into an entire campaign of \u201cbacklash.\u201dLast July, a Google engineer named James Damore wrote an internal memo criticizing what he saw as \u201cauthoritarian\u201d diversity practices at the tech giant, suggesting along the way that women and men might be biologically suited to different professional roles. He was swiftly fired, but the furor the episode created in Silicon Valley spilled rapidly outward. While Google executives rushed to condemn the memo and reaffirm their commitment to an inclusive workplace, alt-right provocateurs were embracing Damore as a political martyr, harassed out of his job by an oppressive and hypocritical liberal machine. What began as a question of corporate values quickly transformed into a larger skirmish between competing perceptions of who actually wields power in America.Damore would go on to file a class-action suit claiming that conservative white men were systematically discriminated against at Google, including as evidence colleagues\u2019 aggressive responses to his memo \u2014 a reaction The Guardian characterized as an \u201cinternal backlash.\u201d Many of Damore\u2019s co-workers, of course, had credibly argued that the only systematic discrimination here was found in Damore\u2019s memo itself: \u201cYou have just created a textbook hostile workplace environment,\u201d wrote one former colleague upon reading it. The Financial Times saw \u201cbacklash\u201d in a whole separate layer of reaction: the flurry of vitriol and threats directed at Google from conservative activists, which compelled management to cancel a town-hall meeting on diversity issues.There are obvious differences in the types of power each side of this conflict could credibly suggest the other possessed. But the dynamics involved are typical, and you can spot them in any number of contentious issues. One faction positions itself as a beleaguered voice of dissent, bravely pushing back against some draconian orthodoxy. The other sees itself as battling a society already suffused in this supposedly \u201cdissenting\u201d viewpoint. Each side looks at the world around it and sees, for the most part, the flourishing of the other. It\u2019s less a culture war than a war over who\u2019s already winning.\u201cIt is a pop-culture law that everything generates a backlash,\u201d The Ringer observed earlier this year, before pointing out that the ensuing cycles of opinion \u2014 from initial hype to stubborn critiques to indignant defenses \u2014 were now so familiar they could be predicted with almost scientific precision. It went on to do exactly that for \u201cThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,\u201d a film about which you could eventually find some people arguing \u201ceveryone loves this movie, but I hate it\u201d and others declaring that \u201ceveryone is criticizing this movie, but they\u2019re wrong\u201d \u2014 viewpoints that only grew more heated and high-stakes as they dived into the film\u2019s racial politics.You didn\u2019t even need to be a pop-culture figure to get chewed up by these wild swerves of prevailing opinion. For reasons that remain hard to discern, a sweater-wearing man named Ken Bone became an internet hero after asking a question during a 2016 presidential debate \u2014 but after hearing of his past Reddit posts about pornography and the \u201cjustified\u201d shooting of Trayvon Martin, millions of people turned instantly from applauding this total stranger to mocking and denouncing him. In an age of hyperpublic living, every person, company and brand is one tripwire away from a precipitous fall and a furious backlash.No matter how familiar the internet becomes with how all this works, even seemingly manageable events will send the usual cycles repeating, each more exaggerated than the last. It\u2019s predictable that, after the death of a political figure, solemn eulogies will give way to vigorous criticism, which will in turn occasion righteous defenses. But you still might not have guessed that, within 36 hours after the death of Barbara Bush, the Women\u2019s March would be facing backlash for having tweeted \u201cRest in peace and power,\u201d and a college professor would be facing nationwide calls for her firing over tweets that called Bush racist and expressed pleasure in her death \u2014 each impulse, it seems, working hard to counter the prevalence of the other.At the root of this analysis, of course, is the assumption that liberalism has been on a steady, triumphant march \u2014 that a progressive ascendance sparks a conservative reaction. (\u201cIt cannot be stressed too strongly,\u201d Lipset wrote, that backlash politics were \u201ca consequence of the fact that the United States is becoming more liberal.\u201d) But in 2016, it was the avatar of white conservative resentment who was elected president \u2014 a result the CNN commentator Van Jones described, on election night, as a \u201cwhitelash.\u201d And in the aftermath of this stark shift in government, it\u2019s clearly difficult for Americans to reach even a vague consensus on which ideological impulses are dominant and which are lashing out in response. Many conservatives appear to have scarcely registered their political victories, preferring instead to complain of a sinister \u201cdeep state\u201d beyond executive control and resume their retaliatory campaigns against Hillary Clinton. At the same time, the backlash strategy has been handed off like a baton, cropping up with greater frequency in descriptions of liberals energized by their opposition to Trump.This is the landscape of our broader political wars. What\u2019s fascinating is that it\u2019s also the landscape of our innocuous pop-culture battles, over which films are underrated and which celebrities overappreciated. Social media, in particular, is almost perfectly designed to turn mundane exchanges into ferocious moral dust-ups. Questions of taste and aesthetics have always been intimately bound up with questions of status and character and overarching cultural values. Even the most humdrum disagreement resolves itself, through one wave of backlash after another, into the same central question: Why does \u201ceveryone\u201d believe the wrong thing?Cameron Tung is a freelance journalist from New York.

These lights are supposed to be Smart, with a capital S, responding to my whim as all Smart things do.Of course, there\u2019s a chance she might feel lonely, and randomly decide to talk about the weather, as she does in the middle of the night with Sarah Coffey, an editor for Dow Jones Newswires, who lives in Maplewood, N.J. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why Alexa is speaking to me at 3 in the morning,\u201d Ms. Coffey, 44, said.

Even as we are in the midst of a collective freakout about the data that Facebook has been gathering and sharing without our permission, many of us are busily installing equipment that potentially bugs our homes and tracks our movements, conversations and routines.But anxiety alone hasn\u2019t been a deterrent, since we keep buying the stuff. We rationalize this uncomfortable truth because smart technology does have the potential to make life easier and, perhaps, safer.Affix a smart sensor to your water heater and you could be alerted to an impending flood. Install a smart lock on your door and you could remotely let a neighbor in to feed the cat, or get an alert at the office when your teenager gets home from school.As for me, I live in an old house with few overhead light fixtures. It seems like a banal problem, but filling my bedroom with lamps that turn on with an iPhone means I don\u2019t have to call an electrician to drill holes in my ceiling and walls to install permanent lighting. I certainly enjoy the convenience, and savings, even if it means I have yet another reason to stare at my phone.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At the Masters, Low-Tech Data Still Rules", "Date": "2018-04-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAUGUSTA, Ga. \u2014 The caddie William Lanier was standing behind Augusta National\u2019s 13th hole on Monday, scribbling in a notebook roughly the size of a king-size candy bar, when he overheard a patron ask her husband, \u201cWhat\u2019s inside those books?\u201dLanier walked over to the couple and flashed an open page of his standard-issue Masters yardage book, which contained notes about the hole that he would use to advise his player, Wesley Bryan, during the tournament. The pair were less than impressed. \u201cWhat good does a book do?\u201d the woman asked.It is a great question, one that golf\u2019s governing bodies have been hotly debating since the emergence in the past decade of books crammed with dizzyingly intricate high-tech data for each hole on a course. The information, gathered by advanced GPS and land-surveying equipment, is so comprehensive that some people consider the books mass-produced cheat sheets.\u201cI see these guys bringing out a book when they get on the green to look where to putt. I find this really hard to believe,\u201d the three-time Masters champion Gary Player said, adding: \u201cYou put me on any course in the world, I can read the putt as well as if I played there 10 times. I\u2019m a professional golfer. It\u2019s something I have to be able to do.\u201dGolf officials worry that the easy availability of so much detail has contributed to slow play and nullified the advantages of those who are more proficient at reading greens and who put more effort into learning courses.Perhaps it should come as no surprise that at the Masters, home of the manually operated scoreboard and $1.50 pimento cheese sandwiches, the hole-by-hole yardage book provided by the hosts is primitive compared with what is available at other tournaments.Away from Augusta, competitors typically use two books, one with tee-to-green details for each hole and the other, which often has a price tag, focused solely on the greens. The Masters provides a single one, at no cost, that covers both elements, offering rudimentary information. It is left to the caddies and the players to do their own legwork and fill in the blanks. In that respect, the Augusta National book is like the course itself, designed to reward those with the most creativity, imagination and discipline.The value of the books was driven home recently when Jeff Ghim, who is caddying here for his 21-year-old son, Doug, lost the yardage book he had painstakingly padded with notes over three months of research.The book fell from a pocket of his long-sleeved overalls on Monday. His heart dropped, he said.\u201cFifteen years my son\u2019s dreamed of playing here,\u201d Jeff Ghim said, \u201cand I lose the directions.\u201d How could he replicate three months\u2019 worth of notes in two days?Thankfully, he got the book back. Someone turned it into the caddie headquarters the next day, and Ghim, with book in pocket, guided his son, a Masters rookie, to low-amateur honors.Yardage books have been around since at least the 1950s, when the future P.G.A. commissioner Deane Beman, then a junior golfer, sketched crude models for his own use. In the 1970s, the books proliferated as professional players and caddies, in search of a legal edge, turned to the course field guides compiled by pioneers like Mark Long, who has followed the high-tech path. He supplies his greens books to caddies for $150 apiece.Carl Jackson is widely considered a priceless alternative. Known as the greens whisperer of Augusta National, Jackson worked 54 Masters, including 39 as the bag man for the two-time champion Ben Crenshaw. When Greller was about to caddie in his first Masters, in 2014, he sought out Jackson to try to absorb some of his knowledge about Augusta\u2019s bedeviling breaks and slopes.Every tournament week since, Greller has checked in several times with Jackson, who first caddied at the Masters as a 14-year-old in 1961. The two do not go over notes because Jackson stores all his knowledge on the pages of his mind.Since Crenshaw regards Spieth as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of sorts, Greller is never shy about using Jackson as a resource.\u201cCarl probably wants to throw his phone any time he gets a phone call from Michael, he\u2019s probably talked to him so many times,\u201d said Justin Thomas, Spieth\u2019s competitor and close friend.Greller said the best advice he had received from Jackson had nothing to with a fall line or a pin placement. It was simply: \u201cThere will be multiple times you\u2019ll be confused. Then you trust your instincts.\u201dTo remind himself, Greller writes a note on some pages amid all the technical jargon: \u201cTRUST YOUR INSTINCTS.\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t seen it,\u201d said Spieth, who, like most golfers, keeps books of his own.John Wood, a veteran caddie who works for Matt Kuchar, spent Monday morning walking the course by himself, stopping often to take notes. By the time he was through, the pages of his yardage book resembled geometry assignments. He described the outing as a chance to \u201crecheck stuff I\u2019ve seen over the years.\u201dJack Nicklaus, who counts six Masters titles among his 18 major victories, wonders why any touring pro would not want to be the master of his own game.\u201cTo me, the game of golf is learning how to play the game and be responsible for everything you do,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the fun of it. It\u2019s fun to learn how to putt greens and how to play clubs.\u201dHe added: \u201cNow everything is given to the guys. That said, if it were all given to me back when I started in 1962 on the tour, I probably would have done exactly the same thing.\u201dLanier was playing on golf\u2019s minor league circuits when he started a side business making yardage books for his competitors. The side business outlasted his playing career. He uses every resource at his disposal, including Google Earth, to make his hand drawings as detailed as possible. Lanier can sketch Augusta National as if it were the back of his hand because it is practically his backyard. He grew up a couple of miles away and now lives close enough to walk to the course.His drawings, while highly respected among golfers, are often lost on outsiders. Lanier recalled a visit he once paid to a Staples store in Florida to make copies of a book. A woman was using the copier next to him. Peering at his drawings, she asked, \u201cSir, excuse me, are you a medical illustrator?\u201dLanier told her that, no, the illustrations she had mistaken for amoebas were greens and bunkers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cambridge Analytica and the Coming Data Bust", "Date": "2018-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn TechnologyThe queasy truth at the heart of Facebook\u2019s Cambridge Analytica scandal, which is so far the company\u2019s defining disgrace of 2018, is that its genesis became scandalous only in retrospect. The series of events that now implicate Facebook began in 2014, in plain view, with a listing on Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk service, where users can complete small tasks for commensurately modest sums of cash. In exchange for installing a Facebook app and completing a survey \u2014 in the process granting the app access to parts of your Facebook profile \u2014 you would get around a dollar. Maybe two.This was a great deal, at least by the standards of the time. Facebook users were then accustomed to granting apps permission to see their personal data in exchange for much less. It was the tail end of a Facebook era defined by connected apps: games like FarmVille, Candy Crush and Words With Friends; apps that broadcast your extra-Facebook activities, like Spotify and Pinterest; and apps that were almost explicitly about gathering as much useful data as possible from users, like TripAdvisor\u2019s Cities I\u2019ve Visited app, which let you share a digital pushpin map with your friends.Most of these apps, when installed, demanded permission to access \u201cyour profile info,\u201d which could include things like your activity, birthday, relationship status, interests, religious and political views, likes, education and work history. They could also collect information about users\u2019 friends, multiplying their reach. In providing a marketplace for such apps, Facebook made it easy for users to extend their extraordinarily intimate relationship with the site to thousands of third-party developers. One of them turned out to be connected to Cambridge Analytica, which was using the data for right-wing political campaigns \u2014 a fact that was lucidly and widely reported as early as 2015 but promptly lost in the roiling insanity of primary season. (As of Facebook\u2019s most recent admission, data was collected on as many as 87 million users.)Not that more exposure in the news cycle would have mattered much back then. It was self-evidently absurd to grant a virtual-farming game access to your religious views, but that\u2019s just how the platform worked at the time, and so we got used to it, much in the same way we got used to conducting our private lives on any other corporate platform. (When Gmail first started in 2004, the fact that it placed ads based on the contents of users\u2019 emails was considered invasive. That feeling passed; Google continued scanning consumer email until 2017, and Gmail now has more than a billion users.) Still, these individually trivial decisions never gave us cause to confront just how much we had come to trust Facebook.Whenever you sign up for any free service, you\u2019re aware, in the loosest terms, that you\u2019re giving up something. It usually includes a license to use the content you create \u2014 be it capital-C Content, like public posts, or things you would intuitively understand as more private, like your direct messages and which profiles you look at \u2014 however the service pleases. You could imagine the problem with all this, if asked: You\u2019re giving up your privacy to a company that owes you nothing and could end up doing basically anything. But a user concerned about how ad-supported web services would infringe on his privacy is trapped in a sort of predictive hell: always right, but always feeling wrong; never quite able to say what will happen, but always expecting it; both constantly vindicated and yet feeling he\u2019s crying wolf.And its users unwittingly took part in a social-data boom and are only now starting to feel the consequences. The ease and speed with which internet users trust tech companies with the data they crave are wildly out of proportion with the risks they\u2019re assuming in doing so, in no small part because, out of negligence or institutional blindness, the companies couldn\u2019t anticipate the risks themselves. After all, Facebook spent years fortifying itself against hackers and spammers only to be rolled by political actors posing as app developers.This pattern \u2014 a boom based on credible-seeming promises that are a little too good to be true, followed years later by a bust confirming that they indeed were \u2014 is familiar from a different world: finance. The financial crisis was materially devastating in a way that a privacy crisis couldn\u2019t be; poor stewardship of user data isn\u2019t going to evict people from their homes. But among the lingering and underrated consequences of the collapse of the global financial system was a total loss in trust in the institutions that were supposed to prevent it. The disorienting and thoroughly unsatisfying Cambridge Analytica saga is a preview of what trailing indicators of the collapse of the data boom might look like: revealing signs, evident years later, that something was rotten with these arrangements, arriving too late to be actionable but soon enough to foster resentment against companies and services on which we\u2019ve come to depend.Experiences that test our trust of the free-services-for-personal-data internet are accumulating and threaten to become more personal: the failure of Twitter to ban someone who harassed or threatened you; a small but embarrassing email hack resulting in a scammer asking old friends for money and concluding with an admonishment from your provider that you just needed a better password; an identity theft, a suffering credit score and then news of a hack at Equifax, a service to which you never even chose to provide data. Or it could be nothing more than an eerily well-targeted ad, one that suggests that a certain service \u2014 maybe one you never even meant to interact with \u2014 knows things about you that you don\u2019t remember telling it.The wider consequences of these arrangements are harder to quantify and sometimes even to see. They are: a social-media ecosystem that has annexed the news and the public sphere; nascent but increasingly assertive systems of identity and social currency that seek to transcend borders while answering only to investors; billions of lives\u2019 worth of trustingly volunteered data in the hands of companies that might want to make money from it, or that might have no need for it anymore, or that might go out of business, change ownership or simply forget what they had in the first place. Perhaps someone \u2014 a new partner, an enterprising researcher, a repressive government \u2014 might, one day, discover new uses for the data.A loss of faith in tech companies as semipublic infrastructure would also arrive simultaneously with an understanding that that\u2019s what they had been all along: services that we depended on, ones we gave ourselves to, and that revealed themselves to be \u2014 or merely became \u2014 the sorts of services we\u2019d rather not. They\u2019re not too big to fail in the banking sense. But they\u2019re similarly hard to budge, having constructed entire modes of interaction, consumption and identity verification that are now intimately interwoven with our lives, so all-encompassing that they\u2019ve practically become invisible. To stop using these products is to leave the internet, and these companies made it their mission to make sure there isn\u2019t anywhere else to go.In a recent conference call with reporters, Mark Zuckerberg, the company\u2019s chief executive, confessed that Facebook ought to do a better job of putting privacy tools in front of users, but in the same breath he encouraged people to use the tools and to \u201cmake sure that they\u2019re comfortable with how their information is used on our services and others.\u201d It was a gesture at dusty old user agreements \u2014 an emphasis on the fact that we technically consented to this, and that if he was expected to hold up his end of the deal, we should be too. It called to mind a line of the financial industry\u2019s post-crisis defense: Borrowers should have read the fine print. But for the tech industry, this posture is even more of a stretch: It\u2019s an argument for honoring the status quo, coming from the people who have made it their mission to destroy it.John Herrman is a technology reporter for The Times.Advertisement"}

His first book, \u201cThe Sporting Club\u201d \u2014 a novel set in his native Michigan \u2014 concerned a contentious boyhood friendship reprised after the men had grown. (\u201cThis standoff was a long time coming, a childhood friendship that had hardened,\u201d as McGuane would write some 40 years later about a different set of frenemies in a story called \u201cRiver Camp,\u201d the cannibalism of masculinity having never lost its pride of place among his writerly concerns.) \u201cThe Sporting Club\u201d was published in 1969, followed by \u201cThe Bushwhacked Piano\u201d (1971) and \u201cNinety-Two in the Shade\u201d (1973), an explosive picaresque that was nominated for the National Book Award.McGuane\u2019s second collection, \u201cGallatin Canyon,\u201d was published in 2006 and his third, \u201cCrow Fair,\u201d in 2015; of the eight new stories in \u201cCloudbursts,\u201d six are of newer vintage yet. It is a curious fact, then, that of the 45 stories in this career-spanning collection, fully 35 of them date from the last decade and change. This might make the very existence of a \u201ccollected\u201d seem redundant or at least premature, but given that McGuane is on the verge of turning 80 \u2014 and that the stories are uniformly brilliant \u2014 any objections should be summarily withdrawn. \u201cGallatin Canyon,\u201d \u201cWeight Watchers,\u201d \u201cThe Refugee\u201d (and its bizarrely charming afterthought, \u201cPapaya\u201d), \u201cHubcaps,\u201d \u201cIce,\u201d \u201cStars\u201d: Would it be ludicrous to list, say, 20 of them as favorites? I don\u2019t know what happened during that long break between the first and second collections, but McGuane has emerged a master of the short story. However close together the bulk of these pieces were written, \u201cCloudbursts\u201d is clearly the product of a life\u2019s worth of thought and feeling and experience; it ought to be savored. That said, if you find yourself tearing through the book like a flash flood washing out a dirt road, I say go for it. You can always reread later, and you probably will.Some of the most potent stories (\u201cNorth Country,\u201d \u201cThe Casserole\u201d) are cloudbursts in the truest sense. Topping out around five pages, they would be heavily reminiscent of Raymond Carver if they weren\u2019t so vivid in their images and layered in their meanings. (Carver, of course, could mean as deeply as anyone, but he tended to mean one thing at a time.) Here\u2019s the opening of \u201cAn Old Man Who Liked to Fish\u201d:\u201cThe Smiths were a very old couple, whose lifelong habits of exercise and outdoor living and careful diet had resulted in their seeming tiny \u2014 tiny, pale and almost totemic \u2014 as they spread a picnic tablecloth on my front lawn and arranged their luncheon. Since I live with reckless inattention to what I eat, I watched with fascination as they set out apples, cheese, red wine and the kind of artisanal bread that looks like something found in the road. The Smiths were the last friends of my parents still alive. And to the degree we spend our lives trying to understand our parents, I always looked to Edward and Diana\u2019s visits as a pleasant forensic exercise.\u201dThere\u2019s so much to praise and parse here that I hardly know where to begin. How about the way that the light visual comedy of the bread is juxtaposed with the cerebral, astringent humor of the phrase \u201cpleasant forensic exercise\u201d? How about the shift, over four sinuous sentences, from detachment to intimacy, as the narrator reveals his relationship to the Smiths? Some of this supple, understated style is an inheritance from the Southern writer Peter Taylor. (A line of Taylor\u2019s supplies \u201cCloudbursts\u201d with its epigraph.) McGuane has salvaged and refurbished the old master\u2019s authoritative and graceful tone, while leaving his creaky gentility and sentimental streak (the Achilles\u2019 heel of Southern literature) curbside where it belongs. What remains is a cleareyed frontier courtliness, though not without its edge. McGuane\u2019s small-time lawyers and bank managers, his car dealers and crooks and confirmed bachelors, are more worldly-wise \u2014 and consequently more world-weary \u2014 than Taylor\u2019s Memphis society boys. The Westerners tend to live a bit closer to both nature and the poverty line, and a whole lot farther from town.I am reminded that the West was, among other things, the South\u2019s attempt at a second act in American life, with all of the continuity and disjunction, the striving and scheming, the reinvention and self-deception that that implies. Montana is a place to go when you want to be far from everyone and everything. McGuane lives in an unincorporated township about an hour outside of Livingston; the nowhere of nowhere, at least as near as I can tell from Google Maps. As many of his characters come to realize in these wise and moving stories, the blessing and the curse of a vast landscape is to have yourself for company. That\u2019s no less true on the range than on the sea. A man can outrun all kinds of things, at least for a while, but never himself.Justin Taylor is the author of a novel, \u201cThe Gospel of Anarchy,\u201d and two story collections, most recently \u201cFlings.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bob Dylan\u2019s Latest Gig: Making Whiskey", "Date": "2018-04-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn late 2015, an unexpected name popped up in the liquor industry press: Bob Dylan.A trademark application for the term \u201cbootleg whiskey\u201d had been filed under Mr. Dylan\u2019s name. Among those who noticed the news was Marc Bushala, 52, a lifelong fan and a liquor entrepreneur whose bourbon brand, Angel\u2019s Envy, had just been sold for $150 million. Mr. Bushala said he immediately spent weeks \u201cobsessing over this concept of what a Dylan whiskey could be.\u201d\u201cIt was a little bit daunting,\u201d Mr. Bushala said of his pitch.But it worked. Next month, he and Mr. Dylan will introduce Heaven\u2019s Door, a collection of three whiskeys \u2014 a straight rye, a straight bourbon and a \u201cdouble-barreled\u201d whiskey. They are Mr. Dylan\u2019s entry into the booming celebrity-branded spirits market, the latest career twist for an artist who has spent five decades confounding expectations.Mr. Dylan is not simply licensing his name. He is a full partner in the business, Heaven\u2019s Door Spirits, which Mr. Bushala said had raised $35 million from investors.\u201cWe both wanted to create a collection of American whiskeys that, in their own way, tell a story,\u201d Mr. Dylan said in a statement to The New York Times. \u201cI\u2019ve been traveling for decades, and I\u2019ve been able to try some of the best spirits that the world of whiskey has to offer. This is great whiskey.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about fairy dust,\u201d said Michael Stone, the chairman of the brand licensing agency Beanstalk, who is not involved with Heaven\u2019s Door. \u201cPeople are looking for some of the fairy dust to be sprinkled on them from that celebrity\u2019s lifestyle.\u201dLike his recent albums of standards, they portray Mr. Dylan as an urbane but still gritty crooner \u2014 one who might well wind down his day with a glass of bourbon.\u201cDylan has these qualities that actually work well for a whiskey,\u201d Mr. Bushala said. \u201cHe has great authenticity. He is a quintessential American. He does things the way he wants to do them. I think these are good attributes for a super-premium whiskey as well.\u201dMr. Dylan is entering the craft whiskey market as the business is exploding. Helped by a craze for classic cocktails, sales of American whiskey grew 52 percent over the last five years, to $3.4 billion in 2017, according to data from the Distilled Spirits Council.But for those who have been listening closely, whiskey has been a decades-long thread throughout Mr. Dylan\u2019s music, going back to the early outtake \u201cMoonshiner\u201d in 1963 and to Mr. Dylan\u2019s version of the song \u201cCopper Kettle (The Pale Moonlight),\u201d on the 1970 album \u201cSelf Portrait,\u201d which describes the distilling process in detail. (\u201cGet you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil/Fill it with new made corn mash and never more you\u2019ll toil.\u201d)Mr. Bushala said that over four or five meetings \u2014 always at Mr. Dylan\u2019s metalworking studio in Los Angeles \u2014 and a number of phone calls, he had learned that his partner has a sophisticated whiskey palate.Yet communication was still a challenge. Mr. Bushala and Ryan Perry, the chief operating officer, struggled to interpret Mr. Dylan\u2019s wishes. Often they came in the form of enigmatic comments or simply glances.\u201cSometimes you just get a long look,\u201d Mr. Bushala said with a laugh, \u201cand you\u2019re not sure if that\u2019s disgust or approval.\u201dHe and Mr. Perry recalled Mr. Dylan\u2019s tasting a sample of the double-barreled whiskey and saying that something was missing. \u201cIt should feel like being in a wood structure,\u201d he said.They struggled to decode the remark. What kind of wooden structure? A church? A railroad car? A barn? That led Mr. Bushala and Mr. Perry first to probing discussions about the nose \u2014 the liquor\u2019s aroma in the glass \u2014 and then to experiments in how they toasted the barrels in which the whiskey is aged.Months later, the men returned with a sample that they felt embodied \u201cthat sweet, musty smell of a barn,\u201d Mr. Bushala said, and presented it to Mr. Dylan, who commented approvingly.His oblique feedback, Mr. Perry said, \u201creally helped us think about barrel finishing in a different way.\u201dThe first batches of Heaven\u2019s Door were developed with Jordan Via, formerly of the Breckenridge Distillery in Colorado. Together, the team tried various novel finishes. The rye, for example, was aged in cigar-shaped oak barrels made from wood harvested in the Vosges region of France.To preserve Mr. Dylan\u2019s original name for the whiskey, the company will issue an annual Bootleg Series in limited editions, in ceramic bottles decorated with his oil and watercolor paintings. The first, a 25-year-old whiskey, will be released next year and cost about $300. (Heaven\u2019s Door\u2019s standard line goes for $50 to $80 a bottle.)Bill Flanagan, a veteran music journalist who has interviewed Mr. Dylan, likens him to Hank Williams and Johnny Cash \u2014 self-made entertainers who saw no conflict in joining the marketplace.And then there is simply Mr. Dylan\u2019s talent for provocation.\u201cDylan has always resisted any attempt to fence him in,\u201d Mr. Flanagan said. \u201cAs soon as people start calling him king of the folkies, or patron saint of the counterculture, or beloved anticommercial leftist icon \u2014 he almost always does something to thwart that.\u201dWhether Heaven\u2019s Door can compete is another question. Mr. Bushala was one of the founders of Angel\u2019s Envy, which was introduced in 2011 and sold to Bacardi four years later after developing a reputation for quality and innovation. Yet the whiskey aisle keeps getting more crowded. According to Nielsen, more than 20,000 kinds of spirits are sold in the United States, and last year there were 27 percent more whiskeys on sale than in 2013.Mr. Bushala said that in their first conversation, he had told Mr. Dylan that \u201cwhiskey drinkers are a very cynical crowd\u201d and that the success of their enterprise would depend on the quality of the product, not Mr. Dylan\u2019s image.\u201cFor people who are surprised that he did a whiskey,\u201d Mr. Bushala said, \u201cI guess they don\u2019t really know Dylan. People who know him expect him to do things they would never expect.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Russia Tried to Shut Down Telegram. Websites Were Collateral Damage.", "Date": "2018-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Russia\u2019s communications watchdog was locked in an intensive game of whack-a-mole on Wednesday with Telegram, the popular and highly secure messaging app, as its stuttering attempts to block the service inadvertently knocked out the websites of scores of small businesses.Alexander Zharov, the head of the watchdog agency, Roskomnadzor, acknowledged that it had obstructed millions of IP addresses in an attempt to shutter Telegram. Roskomnadzor took that step after the company declined to provide encryption information, which would enable the agency to identify users and see the content of messages.The watchdog agency was granted authority to block the app on Friday by a Moscow court. But the clumsy, unprecedented effort to follow through, which started Monday, caused a widespread outcry after the unintended consequences became apparent.A member of the band Pussy Riot organized a small public protest. Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor who leaked American surveillance documents and now lives in Russia, expressed support for the company. Even some usually staunch Kremlin supporters called the ban misguided.Internet experts in Russia saw a greater menace in the effort beyond Telegram, speculating that if the government succeeded in silencing the app with some 13 million Russian users, it might pursue bigger fish next.\u201cIf you have a government agency being so brutal attacking Telegram, taking down millions of IP addresses, after that you can do what you want,\u201d said Andrei Soldatov, one of the authors of \u201cThe Red Web,\u201d a history of the Russian internet. \u201cAfter they have faced this much heat, they can go after Facebook and Google.\u201dTelegram tried to thwart the blockage by shifting its service to two giant American web hosts, Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services, while at the same time repeatedly changing its IP address to skip ahead of Roskomnadzor.In response, rather than chasing individual IP addresses \u2014 a unique set of numbers that identifies a computer, smartphone or other device connected to the internet \u2014 the watchdog agency elected to shut down enormous blocks of addresses, called subnets.The collateral damage hit a variety of other sites, like Viber, another messaging app, as well as small businesses including a language school and a courier service, all of which suffered financial losses.Volvo dealerships could not access their service records, according to press reports, and Kremlin museums had to suspend ticket sales. Roskomnadzor said it unblocked individual sites as soon as the agency became aware of a problem.The Agora group of human rights lawyers, which represents Telegram in Russian courts, said in a statement that it had received 73 complaints about blocked websites. The organization planned to file a formal complaint with the prosecutor general\u2019s office.Telegram has been sending messages to users encouraging them to use alternative means, including Virtual Private Networks, which effectively connect to the internet outside Russia, to evade the ban.The app\u2019s founder, Pavel Durov, who fled Russia after losing control in 2014 of VKontakte, the Russian version of Facebook that he created, sent a message to Telegram users saying that he would continue to engage in \u201cdigital resistance.\u201dHis supporters included Mr. Snowden, who wrote on Twitter that resistance to the \u201ctotalitarian demand\u201d for backdoor access to private communications \u201cis the only moral response, and shows real leadership.\u201dMaria V. Alyokhina, a political activist and member of the Pussy Riot collective who has been jailed for previous demonstrations, helped to organize a protest that consisted of tossing paper airplanes outside the Moscow headquarters of the F.S.B., the secret police. She was sentenced to 100 hours of compulsory community service, according to Mediazona, a courtroom news agency.The paper airplane is the corporate symbol of the Telegram app. The F.S.B. has been leading the effort in Russia to gain backdoor access to all private communications in Russia, saying it was necessary to combat terrorism.Telegram was widely used within the Russian government, including by President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s press office, to communicate with the public and the media. Some government agencies and press offices continued to use Telegram despite the ban.Igor Lebedev, the deputy chairman of the Russian Parliament and the son of nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky, accused the government watchdog agency of \u201cincompetence.\u201d\u201cIt targeted Telegram but hit Russian business,\u201d he wrote on Twitter, saying it should be illegal to limit access to such popular sites. \u201cWe must defend Russian citizens from pointless bans!\u201dThe Kremlin has also come in for criticism on several other fronts: It has suggested using older, slower apps as an alternative, especially one owned by a Putin crony; it shut down LinkedIn and managed to limit some access to Zello, a voice messaging app used to organize truck driver protests; and it finds itself accused of paying lip service to the idea that Russia should develop cutting edge technology while busily undermining Telegram, one of the few Russian I.T. brands to achieve global success.The office of the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, an active Telegram user, said he had shut down his account to set the example. The decision was \u201cin line with safeguarding national interests and removing the monopoly of the Telegram messaging app,\u201d the ayatollah\u2019s last Telegram stated, according to Iran\u2019s government-run Press TV news website.Internet experts suggest that what the Kremlin really wants is leverage to order the internet platforms to remove things that it does not like.\u201cThey want a hotline that they can pick up to call someone to do something,\u201d said Mr. Soldatov. \u201cIt is a very Soviet approach.\u201dFollow Neil MacFarquhar on Twitter: @NeilMacFarquhar.Oleg Matsnev and Sophia Kishkovsky contributed reporting in Moscow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon Has Lots of Company as Trump Slams \u2018Stupid\u2019 Businesses", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Amazon, you\u2019re not alone.Lately, Mr. Trump\u2019s antibusiness rants have become particularly menacing and caused the stocks of some companies to plunge. His Twitter posts have carried with them the threat, sometimes explicit, that he is prepared to use the power of the presidency to undermine the companies that anger him.The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, long a booster of Republican presidents, is not happy. \u201cIt\u2019s inappropriate for government officials to use their position to attack an American company,\u201d said Neil Bradley, the executive vice president and chief policy officer of the chamber. Mr. Bradley, who did not specifically name Mr. Trump, added that criticism of companies from politicians \u201cundermines economic growth and job creation.\u201dMost presidents have clashed with business interests and industries, sometimes in ways that generated headlines. But Mr. Trump is unique in singling out individual companies for ridicule with regularity. And rarely have presidents done so because of a personal pique or grudge, as happens with Mr. Trump.\u201cThis is an unprecedented situation for companies. The president\u2019s tweets can cause significant reputational harm,\u201d said Dean C. Garfield, the president of the Information Technology Industry Council, which represents big technology companies like Amazon, Dell, Facebook, Google and IBM. \u201cWe are now at a place where about 90 percent of the companies we represent now have a presidential Twitter strategy in place.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s no laughing matter,\u201d he said.For many companies, that strategy comes down to waiting out the storm. In recent days, Amazon has all but ignored the president\u2019s taunts, which he issued in a flurry of tweets.\u201cThere\u2019s no real advantage going toe-to-toe with him,\u201d said Joe Lockhart, a press secretary for President Bill Clinton who was a spokesman for the National Football League, another favorite target of Mr. Trump. \u201cAnd his attention span is so short, he will move on. He\u2019ll find another target.\u201dLikewise, the president\u2019s interest in the AT&T merger with Time Warner largely stems from his repeated clashes with CNN, a subsidiary of Time Warner, which he regards as biased against him.As a private citizen, Mr. Trump has attacked companies, including calling several times for boycotts. The remarks served to raise his profile and fed the image of a no-holds-barred businessman who was unafraid to rebuke his rivals or his critics. But in those days, such comments had little ability to move stock prices or affect sales.As a candidate and as the president, Mr. Trump also uses his verbal assaults on companies to bolster his populist message that he is on the side of workers, not big business. (Still, Mr. Trump secured a large tax cut last year for corporate America.)Mr. Trump\u2019s most ardent supporters say they appreciate his willingness to criticize the corporate establishment.\u201cHe continues to go directly after the companies and not care about political correctness,\u201d said Terry Bowman, a former Trump campaign organizer who works at a Ford Motor parts factory in Ypsilanti, Mich. \u201cHe says things that a polished politician would never say. He says things that come directly from the American worker.\u201d\u201cThat is the height of irresponsibility,\u201d Mr. Obama said in 2009 without identifying specific companies. \u201cIt is shameful.\u201dMr. Clinton\u2019s Justice Department aggressively pushed to break up Microsoft on the grounds that it was abusing its monopoly position in personal computing to dominate the internet.President John F. Kennedy avoided naming individuals during a fight with the steel industry in 1962. He criticized \u201ca tiny handful of steel executives whose pursuit of private power and profit exceeds their sense of public responsibility.\u201dPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt on occasion assailed business executives as \u201cmalefactors of great wealth,\u201d attributing the memorable phrase to his cousin, Theodore Roosevelt. Neither president made a practice of identifying specific companies or executives.Mr. Trump has had no such reticence.\u201cA report just came out. They said $1.47, I believe, or about that for every time they deliver a package, the United States government \u2014 meaning the post office \u2014 loses $1.47,\u201d the president said.He added, ominously: \u201cSo Amazon is going to have to pay much more money to the post office. There\u2019s no doubt about that.\u201dWhen Merck\u2019s chief executive, Kenneth C. Frazier, quit a presidential business council last year in protest of some of the White House\u2019s policy positions, other members were initially reluctant to come to his defense for fear of a verbal attack by Mr. Trump. The council eventually disbanded but only after much internal negotiation among members to quit in force.The multiday decline of Amazon\u2019s stock price after Mr. Trump\u2019s repeated jabs at the company has exacerbated such fears, said Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management and president of the Chief Executive Leadership Institute.\u201cOther business leaders don\u2019t want to catch the contagion,\u201d he said.But he added that refusing to engage could also be risky. He said that Mr. Bezos\u2019s silence had hurt the company, leaving it exposed to Mr. Trump\u2019s accusations that it received subsidies from the Postal Service and was not paying its fair share of taxes.\u201cThe right answer for C.E.O.s is not to engage in a mud fight but to come with facts,\u201d Mr. Sonnenfeld said. \u201cU.P.S. and FedEx have their facts, but we haven\u2019t heard from Amazon.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Report for America Supports Journalism Where Cutbacks Hit Hard", "Date": "2018-04-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA group of journalists have decided to do something about the diminution of newsrooms at the local level. They\u2019re making reporting part of a national service program.Report for America, a nonprofit organization modeled after AmeriCorps, aims to install 1,000 journalists in understaffed newsrooms by 2022. Now in its pilot stage, the initiative has placed three reporters in Appalachia. It has chosen nine more, from 740 applicants, to be deployed across the country in June.\u201cI felt like I needed to give something back to a place that has given a lot to me,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd journalism is the way for me to do that.\u201dMs. Born now lives in Williamson, a town of roughly 3,000 along the Tug Fork River, and covers the state\u2019s southern coal fields for West Virginia Public Broadcasting.\u201cIt\u2019s important to have reporters based in parts of America where some people feel misunderstood,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just helps us get a greater understanding of who we are and who our neighbors are.\u201dReport for America fellowships last one to two years, and the pay is about $40,000, with half covered by the program and the rest split between participating news organizations and donations. Two media veterans, Steven Waldman and Charles Sennott, started the project with funding from sponsors.\u201cPeople are applying for the same reason people want to go into the Peace Corps: There\u2019s an idealistic desire to help communities, and there\u2019s a sense of adventure,\u201d Mr. Waldman, 55, said. \u201cThey want to try and save democracy. People keep saying that.\u201dHistorically, reporters would start their careers at small publications and move on to progressively larger ones. These days, young journalists tend to find work right out of college \u2014 but the jobs they end up with often don\u2019t require them to spend time talking to story subjects face to face or learning about different communities.\u201cMaybe they have done that Brooklyn thing, where you spend a year or two in a cubicle working for a blog,\u201d Mr. Sennott, 55, said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not the same as being on the ground doing the real work, knocking on a door and walking into someone\u2019s kitchen.\u201dIn 1990, daily and weekly newspaper publishers employed about 455,000 people, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By January 2016, that number had fallen to 173,000.Before the creation of Report for America, Mr. Waldman ran Beliefnet, a site dedicated to faith and spirituality, and worked for the Federal Communications Commission as a senior adviser. In 2015, he wrote a paper funded by the Ford Foundation arguing for the creation of a national service program for journalists.\u201cI was focused on reporting on divided societies and struggling democracies,\u201d Mr. Sennott said. \u201cThen I realized we live in one.\u201dBecause they had seen how Facebook and Google contributed to the destruction of the advertising-based business model that had long kept local newspapers afloat, they asked them to kick in to their project. While Google has committed money and training, Facebook has yet to sign on.\u201cMark Zuckerberg could solve the local news problem with the money that\u2019s falling between his couch cushions,\u201d Mr. Waldman said. \u201cFolks like Facebook and Google and the other winners have the money to solve this problem, and it is a solvable problem.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need a 20-year veteran investigative reporter to have this impact,\u201d Mr. Waldman said. \u201cIt\u2019s so barren out there that just being on the ground can have a really big impact.\u201d\u201cHe showed up,\u201d Mr. Sennott said. \u201cHe was just there.\u201dFor the nine reporter slots, 85 newsrooms applied asking for corps members, describing a crucial beat that needed filling. Reporters who make the cut start with eight days of training before joining their host newsrooms. They must also fulfill a service requirement, such as working as mentors to student journalists, during their stints.The founders refer to those who take part in the program as \u201ccorps members,\u201d rather than fellows, an attempt to signal that Report for America is not meant to be simply a chance to burnish a r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\u201cIt\u2019s not a reward for bright young graduate students,\u201d Mr. Sennott said. \u201cIt\u2019s a call to get in there.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the surname of a co-founder of Report for America.

Tech has transformed advertising \u2014 there are so many more ways to target and reach people now than when the industry was dominated by TV, print, radio and event sponsorships.There\u2019s also so much more data being collected about our habits by an array of companies, from big tech platforms to agencies to the advertisers themselves. Huge portions of advertising dollars in the last few years have gone to the big tech giants that we read about all the time \u2014 specifically Google and Facebook and, to a lesser extent, companies like Snap. Lately, advertisers have said they\u2019re spending more money on Amazon. So there are still more major changes afoot.Advertisers are also grappling with how to measure their ads in this new world. That\u2019s a challenge throughout the industry. Think of all the ways that people watch TV shows now. I recently watched \u2014 or, more accurately, binged \u2014 NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Good Place.\u201d I watched the first season on Netflix, where there were no ads, then saw the first eight episodes of the second season through NBC\u2019s Apple TV app, where there were lots of commercials. I watched the final few on Hulu, which might have had different ads. That type of behavior \u2014 especially since I was using my parents\u2019 cable login for the NBC app \u2014 is a new kind of challenge for the people buying, selling and measuring ads.What do you think of Google\u2019s and Facebook\u2019s power in the online ad industry?It\u2019s an enormous topic within the advertising industry, which generally refers to Google and Facebook as the \u201cduopoly.\u201d It\u2019s pretty remarkable that two of the world\u2019s most valuable companies make virtually all of their money from selling online ads and dominate more than half of the American digital ad market.Their size and influence make it essential for people to really understand how the companies\u2019 business models work and the types of information they\u2019re sharing with them every day \u2014 and what makes them such powerful advertising machines.Outside work, what tech product do you love using? And I love the Bose wireless speaker that my boyfriend gave me for Diwali. I use it to listen to podcasts and talk on the phone while cooking or cleaning. I love that the speaker gets me away from my phone, which can charge in the meantime, and that I can use it throughout my apartment. It would be nice if it just did the cooking for me, though.What\u2019s your advice for those who want to prevent their data from being tracked by advertisers?It\u2019s hard to prevent, but you can take some steps to limit it. Explore the privacy settings on your smartphone, including which apps have access to your location and microphone and whether you allow ad tracking.

{"Headline": "Think Biking or Walking to Work Would Take Too Long? Think Again", "Date": "2018-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWell Barely 3 percent of the American work force bikes or walks to work with any frequency, despite the obvious virtues: decreased risks for obesity and diabetes, environmental benefits and lower transportation costs. Ask people why they eschew what\u2019s known as active commuting, as many surveys have, and the primary reason cited is time. Those things take too long, most say.For the study, researchers at Penn State solicited the school\u2019s faculty, staff and students to complete an extensive series of online questionnaires about their fitness, health, commuting and parking habits, comfort and ability on a bike or as pedestrians, distance from home to their main workplace on campus and how long they thought it would take them to either bike or walk that distance. Only a few of the 505 respondents went by foot or bike; most of them were students. Estimates of commuting times were then compared with the corresponding route times calculated by Google Maps. The researchers independently timed some of the routes by walking or riding them.The survey participants \u2014 faculty and staff members above all \u2014 proved to be generally poor at guessing active-commuting times. About 90 percent of their estimates were too long by at least 10 minutes. The few assessments close to Google\u2019s were almost always made by riders or walkers. Parking availability and distances affected the estimates. Those with parking permits, a fiercely sought-after campus amenity, tended to overestimate active-commuting times significantly; the closer someone lived to the workplace, the better the guesses. Confidence had an outsize effect, too. The people surveyed, especially women, who had little bicycling experience or who did not feel physically fit thought that active commuting would require considerably more time than the Google calculations.The study is limited, of course, because it relies on an insular, self-selected group of respondents to provide information about themselves, a topic on which people can be surprisingly unreliable. The published results also did not delve into such pressing active-commuting concerns as hygiene, showers or the logistics of carrying changes of clothes. But the study\u2019s results do indicate that time may be less of a barrier to active commuting than many might anticipate, says Melissa Bopp, an associate professor of kinesiology at Penn State and the study\u2019s senior author.\u201cI\u2019d urge anyone who is considering biking or walking to work to do a test run,\u201d she says, perhaps on a weekend (although the traffic patterns will be different from those during the week). Ask colleagues for route suggestions. \u201cGoogle is good at finding bike paths,\u201d she says, but it emphasizes brevity and directness over scenery for walkers.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Building a Connected City From the Ground Up", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetWEYMOUTH, Mass. \u2014 Kyle Corkum imagines a \u201csmart city\u201d with futuristic amenities like driverless shuttle services, heated sidewalks and a super-resilient energy grid that keeps humming through the harshest of storms.As chief executive of LStar Ventures, a developer of planned communities, he has a chance to build the neighborhood of his dreams from the ground up on the site of a long-shuttered naval air station in this town just 12 miles south of Boston\u2019s booming technology hub.LStar, based in Raleigh, N.C., has enlisted General Electric as its partner. Because they are starting from scratch, Mr. Corkum said, the companies can embed smart technology into the energy, water, lighting and transportation systems that will serve the community.Still, LStar is pushing ahead with the smart city, called Union Point. Plans include thousands of housing units and millions of square feet of high-tech commercial space on about 1,500 acres that extend into the neighboring towns of Rockland and Abington. The community\u2019s glass towers, public plazas, clustered housing, scattered parks and retail zones will be contained within 500 acres, leaving the rest as dedicated open space.So far, the community consists of about 1,200 occupied single-family homes, townhouses and apartments, as well as a nearly completed $28 million sports complex with a miniature replica of Fenway Park. A cavernous aircraft hangar will be renovated for use as the centerpiece for a downtown district with shops, restaurants and open spaces with public programming.General Electric will use Union Point as a laboratory for testing new products and as a showroom for working systems. Eric Gebhardt, the strategic technology officer at GE Power, said the community\u2019s energy plan will include micro grid technology, renewable generation and power storage. The company will also install \u201cintelligent\u201d lighting \u2014 streetlights with sensors that can track sound, light and other conditions. The data can be used to monitor traffic, help drivers find parking spaces and alert law enforcement if a gun is fired.G.E. has piloted some of its smart products in existing cities, but Union Point is an unusual opportunity because most of the infrastructure does not exist yet and the developer is open to experimentation, Mr. Gebhardt said.LStar wants \u201cthe center to be a showcase for what the city could be, a place to monitor what it is becoming, and a place to ask existential questions like, \u2018Could it be more inclusive, say, or energy efficient?\u2019\u201d Mr. Rose said.LStar also has an agreement with Optimus Ride, an autonomous vehicle start-up in Boston, to set up a self-driving vehicle service at Union Point. The company is already testing its electric vehicles at the property.Union Point\u2019s first commercial tenant is expected this spring, when Prodrive Technologies, a Dutch company that develops and manufactures products for the automotive, medical and other industries, will break ground on its 60,000-square-foot United States headquarters. The site\u2019s proximity to Boston, access to commuter rail service and ample room for expansion were crucial to the firm\u2019s location decision, said Roy Willems, the company\u2019s general manager of United States operations. He said Prodrive expected to build a second 200,000-square-foot building within three years, and increase its work force to roughly 300 people.LStar had to persuade the three host communities to approve critical zoning changes before it could move forward with the project. They also granted the developer considerable latitude over the design and layout of the community, which will take shape over 15 to 20 years.\u201cThe three towns recognized an opportunity to do something quite extraordinary\u201d on a site where previous development plans stalled, said David P. Manfredi, a founding principal at Elkus Manfredi Architects, which helped create the master plan for Union Point. \u201cThis is an alternative to what could have been suburban sprawl.\u201dUnion Point promises to bring badly needed tax revenue to Weymouth, said the town\u2019s mayor, Robert L. Hedlund. \u201cIt\u2019s the commercial build-out that we\u2019re lusting after,\u201d he said.\u201cWhat they got wrong was any sort of sense of streetscape,\u201d said Mr. Rose, who has visited Songdo. \u201cThere\u2019s no sense of patina, no authentic street life. It\u2019s super sterile. It was built as this fantasy of the future, but it\u2019s a place that humans don\u2019t want to occupy.\u201d\u201cVery few local governments have thought through the long list of public- and private-sector values and concerns that should be deployed to constrain\u201d the use of autonomous cars, as well as the technologies being used to monitor city streets, said Susan Crawford, a Harvard Law School professor. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve given a developer license to deploy total surveillance, with no public limitations, you\u2019re done.\u201dLStar has considerable leeway to test technologies at Union Point. The developer is purposely holding on to its roads, rather than asking for them to be made public ways, to maintain flexibility in testing autonomous vehicles, lighting and other technologies, said Robert Luongo, Weymouth\u2019s director of planning and community development.\u201cIf these were public ways, we might not be able to give them that flexibility,\u201d he said.Mr. Corkum said retaining ownership of the roads would enable them to play with designs for amenities like drop-off areas for driverless shuttles and heated sidewalks. \u201cIt\u2019s better for us to stay in this testing phase until we have good workable solutions,\u201d he said.As for privacy concerns, Mr. Corkum said that he believed in setting boundaries on data collection and use. There is value in using technology to improve quality of life by, for instance, alleviating traffic jams, but he said he was wary of falling prey to a \u201cpreoccupation with optimization.\u201dThe company is working with law firms and consultants on operating guidelines for gathering and anonymizing data and ensuring it cannot be hacked or used to invade privacy, he said.\u201cI don\u2019t like the Big Brother notion that we know everything about you,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will use data for the benefit of the group, not in a way to leverage the group.\u201dAn earlier version of this article described incorrectly M.I.T.\u2019s involvement in the Union Point project. M.I.T. has discussed participating in the project but there is no formal agreement in place.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Made My Puzzle?: Sam Trabucco", "Date": "2018-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWordplaySPECIAL POST \u2014 In this month\u2019s \u201cWho Made My Puzzle?\u201d the spotlight shines on Sam Trabucco, who has made his mark after publishing only 10 crossword puzzles in The New York Times.Where do you currently reside? San Francisco, California.Where and when was your first puzzle published?When was your first New York Times crossword published?How did you get into puzzling? What is your first memory of solving?I\u2019ve always enjoyed puzzles of various sorts \u2014 I was the kid who would rather figure out the Towers of Hanoi than \u2026 uh \u2026 play tag? Is that what normal kids did? That\u2019s what I\u2019ve read. I also really enjoyed playing Scrabble growing up, as well as more general word games. During my junior year of high school I went to my first M.I.T. Mystery Hunt which is where \u201cpaper puzzling\u201d started morphing into a passion for me, and I soon started solving crosswords regularly.What made you decide to try your hand at making a crossword puzzle?The summer before senior year of high school I got it into my head that making a crossword must be something I can do \u2014 it\u2019s basically the same as playing Scrabble! Little did I realize how difficult it really is. I decided I wanted to try making one for my high school\u2019s newspaper, and it\u2019s an abomination that we printed it. Among its funnier flaws was the presence of the entry IS IT TEN? clued as \u201cAre we eating brunch?\u201dI put crosswords on the back burner during college, never making another serious attempt until spring of my senior year \u2014 I\u2019m not sure what spurred this on exactly, but it was probably the free time I had while also embracing the \u201csenior spring\u201d attitude. But that attempt turned into two, which turned into 10, which has now turned into \u2026 many.Why do you do this to yourself?Seriously, I love making crosswords because I find grid construction to be a fun and satisfying problem to solve, and theme development/clever cluing to be nice creative outlets. I also really enjoy sharing my puzzles with friends and watching them solve/hearing their feedback. I\u2019m not sure what it is, but making something which provides people I care about a fun experience is really gratifying to me, and crosswords are the medium that\u2019s best allowed me to do that (unless you count karaoke, which my drunken self absolutely does).Do you use a computer software constructing program and, if so, which one? What do you like about it?How many hours a week, on average, do you spend on refining your tools, like your word list?This is sort of difficult to count. Whenever I hear either a \u201cfun phrase\u201d or a new, crossword-friendly name or word (e.g. OMI, NIETO), I put it into my Notes app and add it to my list later. I also sometimes discover a new corpus of idioms or movies or something that I add programmatically to my word list. These tasks vary in time investment, but I\u2019d say it averages to about one hour of active management per month, plus whatever time I spend manually adjusting scores while constructing.What entry or entries would you NEVER put in a puzzle, and why? And with what entry would you deliberately fail the \u201cbreakfast test,\u201d and why?Besides the standard crossword crutches which I do my best to avoid (my personal absolute no-noes are random Roman numerals and massive obscurities which happen to have nice letters), there are some problematic words which, despite their prevalence in spoken or written English, I\u2019d never include. An example of such an entry is GYP, whose etymology I learned the hard way \u2014 by including it in a crossword (thinking it was benign) and hearing that it had ruined some solvers\u2019 experiences. [The word GYP is thought to be a slur against the Roma people. \u2014 D.A.] Any entry which has the power to do that \u2014 or which perpetuates the oppression of some oppressed group, or otherwise causes pain \u2014 is one I will not knowingly include in a crossword.What are you working on these days?Thank you for spending time with us, Mr. Trabucco.Your thoughts?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Article Days\u2019 and \u2018Aha Moments\u2019 Transform Science and Art Classes", "Date": "2018-04-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byReader IdeaWhat would be the consequences if polar bears went extinct? Why did scientists once believe the sun was getting hotter? What does art have to do with history? How can photographers use technology to manipulate perspective?These are all questions generated by the students of Christopher Roth and Katie Resch in response to the New York Times articles and images they studied in their science and art classes \u2014 where, Mr. Roth writes, working with The Times has \u201cfundamentally changed\u201d the classroom experience.Below, the two share how they have used the news to reanimate teaching and learning in ways that any teacher could try._________In my 17 years of educational experience, I have never been one to do the same thing the same way twice. What a great profession teaching is! Teachers have the honor of exchanging ideas and knowledge with young minds and are able to create new lessons or methods every year to keep the day fresh and exciting!Indeed, these ideas and activities can be used in any subject, by any teacher, with any day\u2019s Times to make each class feel fresh._________We have the privilege of teaching in a small, pre-K through 8th grade, one-building district in a rural area of southern New Jersey with phenomenal teachers, who we also consider friends. We\u2019d like to share some stories of how reading The New York Times has fundamentally changed our students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 classroom experiences.Generating discussion and debate in science class, by Christopher RothBuilding homemade thermometers to measure the classroom temperature; using forensic chromatography to determine which teacher wrote a \u201cransom letter\u201d; constructing miniature roller coasters to study the physics of speed, velocity, mass and friction. These activities are all solid, immersive, highly tactile science lessons which, in the voluntary absence of a classroom text book, have been the heart and soul of our science curriculum for the past eight years.But we still found ourselves striving for something more. Then, this year, we were granted a slightly different schedule which allowed us to have three 70-minute classes per week with our science students!My co-teacher, Sue Edmondson, and I dedicate our first two blocks to investigative laboratory activities. Our shiny new third block begged to be filled with something wholesome, rich and relevant. We immediately decided to fill it with something we called Article Day. This seemingly unsubstantial moniker would definitely not be the dry, thin, lifeless current events discussion I remembered from middle school. No, this would be different \u2014 much different.Article Day would be deep, informative, perhaps controversial and, most importantly, based in real, measurable, reportable facts. It would be a classroom discussion that would sometimes be boisterous and other times reflective and quiet. We would use our brand-spanking-new-out-of-the-box New York Times all-digital-access subscription as the main content source for this portion of our courses.Almost a full school year into it, Article Day boasts all of these traits \u2014 it\u2019s the day that teachers and students look forward to most!\u201cArticle Day\u201d\u201cWhy didn\u2019t Paul Nicklen (the videographer) save the bear?\u201d\u201cWhy was there a garbage can in the middle of the Baffin Islands?\u201d\u201cWhat was the polar bear eating?\u201d\u201cWhat does climate change have to do with this starving bear?\u201d\u201cWhat would be the consequences if polar bears went extinct?\u201d\u201cIs a warmer Earth a bad thing?\u201dWe have discovered that not only have these discussions allowed us to dive deep into a subject, but they have also taught us much more about who our students truly are than any lab activity alone ever could. The relationship and trust between teacher and student has strengthened significantly after these many candid exchanges.\u201cAha\u201d moments, from the lab to The Times and back:The culture that we\u2019ve created in our class is one of true inquiry. One of the requirements of our laboratory activities is a written report at the conclusion of student\u2019s data collection, interpretation and presentation. Many of these labs require that our students create their own experimental design after being given a scope of what needs to be proven. They must provide a justification of why their design included the type of data that was collected. This justification should often include reliable outside sources. After being trained in multiple classes to identify authentic reporting, our students are able to sift through the \u201cfluff\u201d and pick out the scientifically sound content.We stopped the lab investigation for a quick and valuable minute for an impromptu conversation about this, which resulted in several students citing this article in their lab reports as evidence of the decrease of a solvent\u2019s temperature (ice water) by the addition of a solute (salt), which causes it to melt \u2014 and an \u201caha\u201d moment in class as the concept almost audibly \u201cclicked\u201d!_________Contextualizing art in culture, history and contemporary life, by Katie ReschIn the last year I have started to incorporate more art discussions with my students to get them engaged in the arts outside of our classroom. Because my background is in museum and gallery professions with a focus on art history, I feel strongly that our students need to understand the cultural and historical context of art.Every class I present an article or image for discussion. The New York Times headline gets their attention right away \u2014 we are a small town nestled in the blueberry fields of southern New Jersey, so New York City is an impressive ideal for them.These articles not only provide me a way to present art concepts to the students but I also find that we share them professionally. The music, science and art rooms are beside each other in our school and so we often collaborate. I will sometimes print an article and run it over to one of the other teachers so that they can also discuss it with their content area, reinforcing the connections between subjects._________Analyzing outstanding digital photography composition and technique, by Christopher Roth and Katie ReschTogether, we co-teach a digital photography class. All of our students use a fully manual digital SLR camera with interchangeable lenses for all of their assignments. In this class, students learn to manipulate light, space and color to create compositions \u2014 some basic and some intricate. Here, they also learn about perspective, an extremely important part of any work of art.Together, we learned of the techniques that Brunetti used to photograph thousands of small sections of the cathedrals over many weeks and then digitally stitch them together to create a single image to achieve what editing software could not. This was an incredible opportunity for students to see a real-life example of change of perspective in photography.The New York Times content has provided our classes with the opportunity to bring our subjects to a level that enlivens and enriches our students\u2019 experiences and outlook on education. We truly appreciate the content and creativity that the reporters, editors and photographers bring to the newspaper, and the immensely positive impact it has had on our classroom._________Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Michael Cohen, \u2018Ultimate Trump Loyalist,\u2019 Now in the Sights of the F.B.I.", "Date": "2018-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor most American politicians, that article in December 2015 would hardly have been welcome news. But Mr. Cohen, whose role as personal lawyer and fixer for President Trump has been firmly rooted in the transactional world of his boss, saw opportunity. He emailed an old friend who had been talking about seeking Kremlin support to build a Trump Tower in Moscow, and sent him the article.\u201cNow is the time,\u201d Mr. Cohen wrote. \u201cCall me.\u201dMr. Cohen\u2019s efforts put him under scrutiny in the Trump-Russia inquiries and hinted at the somewhat murky space he occupied in the Trump Organization, where his precise duties were unclear. Since then, a series of disclosures have revealed the unusual range of Mr. Cohen\u2019s portfolio.\u201cMichael Cohen would lay his life down for Donald Trump,\u201d said Hank Sheinkopf, a veteran New York political strategist who knows both men. \u201cHe is the ultimate Trump loyalist.\u201dMr. Trump values few things more than loyalty, but secrecy is one of them. For years, to keep the circle of people involved as small as possible, he chose to have Mr. Cohen serve as his legal attack dog from a perch inside Trump Tower in Manhattan instead of having outside counsel deal with his problems, according to two people familiar with their relationship.In private, Mr. Cohen has compared himself to Tom Hagen, the smooth consigliere to the mafia family in the movie \u201cThe Godfather.\u201d His detractors have used other descriptions, with one longtime Trump associate saying that the words \u201cfinesse\u201d and Mr. Cohen have rarely been yoked together in a sentence.If nothing else, the federal investigation, which has also drawn in a tabloid company friendly to Mr. Trump, has cast a harsh light on a partnership that, until recently, at least, worked out well for both Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen, who met Mr. Trump nearly two decades ago when he bought units in several Trump buildings in New York, later played the role of point man and adviser on some of Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to expand his brand internationally.Mr. Cohen also became his boss\u2019s go-to guy for cleaning up messes, from local zoning disputes to negative stories. The lawyer seemed to relish his reputation as Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cpit bull\u201d and embraced an aggressive \u2014 some say bullying \u2014 approach to solving problems.One such attempt at protection was his effort in July 2015 to quash a Daily Beast article about an old complaint that Mr. Trump\u2019s first wife, Ivana, had made during their divorce, in which she claimed marital rape. She later withdrew the allegation. Mr. Cohen told a reporter for the website that marital rape was not legally possible, and threatened the reporter if the story went forward.After that, he mostly kept out of the public eye, helping the campaign build African-American and religious coalitions and raising money.In recent months, Mr. Cohen\u2019s efforts to protect Mr. Trump from claims by two women of extramarital affairs have emerged as a major distraction \u2014 and possibly worse \u2014 for the White House.Mr. Cohen has repeatedly denied any impropriety around the efforts to restrain Ms. Clifford from speaking out. And he has maintained that he was simply trying to deal with a potentially damaging story even though, he said, it was false.What is more, Mr. Cohen has also insisted that he made the payment to Ms. Clifford without consulting Mr. Trump. Asked recently whether he knew about the payment, Mr. Trump told reporters he did not, and referred questions to Mr. Cohen.Still, Mr. Cohen\u2019s claim that he struck a nondisclosure agreement with Ms. Clifford by himself, coupled with his effort to force her to comply with it, has exposed Mr. Trump to possibly having to testify about his knowledge of what his lawyer was up to. Ms. Clifford sued Mr. Trump last month, and her lawyer, Michael Avenatti, has filed court papers seeking to depose the president.\u201cAs we predicted and as the F.B.I. raid shows,\u201d Mr. Avenatti tweeted on Tuesday, \u201cMr. Cohen and Mr. Trump are in a lot of trouble.\u201dIn a text message on Tuesday, Mr. Cohen said the investigation had been difficult.\u201cThis has not been easy and has taken a terrible toll on me, my wife and children,\u201d Mr. Cohen said.Another payment that the F.B.I. is said to be investigating, for $150,000, was made by American Media Inc., the parent company of The National Enquirer. The tabloid business bought the rights to the former Playboy model Karen McDougal\u2019s story alleging an affair with Mr. Trump and never published it. David J. Pecker, now the chairman of A.M.I., was the chief executive of Hachette in the 1990s and for a time published Mr. Trump\u2019s in-house hotel magazine.Several people close to A.M.I. and Mr. Cohen have said that the lawyer was in regular contact with company executives during the presidential campaign, when The Enquirer regularly heralded Mr. Trump and attacked his rivals. The Times reported in February that A.M.I. had shared Ms. McDougal\u2019s allegations with Mr. Cohen, though the company said it did so only as part of efforts to corroborate her story, which it said it could not do. Ms. McDougal\u2019s lawyer at the time, Keith Davidson, and Mr. Cohen communicated around the time as she and A.M.I. were finalizing their deal.The agreements for Ms. McDougal\u2019s and Ms. Clifford\u2019s silence formed the basis of complaints by the public interest group Common Cause to the Justice Department and the Federal Election Commission. The group claims the payments amounted to improper campaign contributions.And Trump-Russia investigators have also examined the 2015 Moscow deal that Mr. Cohen pushed at a time when his boss was campaigning for the Republican nomination for president.Mr. Trump\u2019s long-held desire to build a Trump property in Russia found new life when Felix Sater, a friend of Mr. Cohen\u2019s and a longtime associate of Mr. Trump\u2019s, surfaced with a fresh proposal. He exchanged emails and phone calls with Mr. Cohen in late 2015 saying that he had a prospective developer lined up, and that he could use his contacts in Russia to garner Kremlin support for the project.Mr. Cohen wasted no time, arranging for Mr. Trump to sign a letter of intent for the Moscow tower deal. But the project seemed to stall in the coming months.Rather than let it go, Mr. Cohen reached out directly to Mr. Putin\u2019s press secretary in January 2016, asking for assistance. Later, he asserted that his effort was unsuccessful.\u201cI decided to abandon the proposal less than two weeks later for business reasons,\u201d he said, \u201cand do not recall any response to my email.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Takes the Punches While Rest of Silicon Valley Ducks", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Two pages of notes sitting in a binder in front of Mark Zuckerberg during his congressional testimony this week hinted at a message the Facebook chief executive rarely got a chance to deliver: We\u2019re not the only ones.Mr. Zuckerberg was prepared to say that his company accounts for just a slice of the $650 billion advertising market and that it has plenty of competitors. Google, for example, has an online advertising business more than twice the size of Facebook\u2019s. And Google also collects vast amounts of information about the people who use its online services.But as Facebook has taken it on the chin over the way it has handled the personal information of its users, the leaders of other tech companies have demonstrated that even in publicity-hungry Silicon Valley, it is entirely possible for billionaire executives and their sprawling empires to keep a low profile.What set Mr. Zuckerberg apart? The personal information of up to 87 million Facebook users ended up in the hands of the voter-profiling firm Cambridge Analytica, which worked with the Trump campaign in the 2016 presidential election. Google and the biggest tech companies \u2014 as far as anyone knows \u2014 have never made such a giant mistake.Mr. Zuckerberg was the only executive to testify in two days of hearings this week. Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, and Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, were also asked to testify by the Senate Judiciary Committee.But when that hearing combined with one from another committee, which had not asked for Google or Twitter\u2019s participation, Mr. Pichai and Mr. Dorsey were let off the hook, said company officials and congressional aides.For now, at least.The companies have until April 25 to respond. When asked whether they were concerned about congressional or regulatory scrutiny, Google and Twitter, through company representatives, declined to comment.\u201cOutside of Facebook, there is probably no company paying more attention\u201d than Google, said Jason Kint, a frequent critic of Google and Facebook and chief executive of Digital Content Next, a trade group that represents entertainment and news organizations, including The New York Times. \u201cThey\u2019re absolutely ducking for cover while the heat is on Facebook. They don\u2019t want to try to trip any alarms.\u201dLike Facebook, Google collects vast amount of data on users \u2014 including their YouTube choices, internet searches and location history \u2014 to target advertisements. Facebook has more than two billion users globally, but Google has seven products, including YouTube, Gmail and its Android software, with more than a billion users each.On Wednesday, when Representative John Shimkus, Republican of Illinois, questioned Facebook\u2019s tracking of logged-off users, Mr. Zuckerberg was quick to point out that Google and \u201cthe rest of the industry\u201d employed similar tactics. It was one of the few times Google\u2019s data practices were mentioned in the two days of hearings.Mr. Zuckerberg did not get a chance to say much more about Facebook\u2019s industry peers this week. Over two days of hearings, Google was referenced 11 times by lawmakers. Twitter was mentioned 10 times and Amazon once. Apple was mentioned three times, mostly in passing.Google employees said they had not received explicit orders from management to keep a low profile because most already understood the risk. One employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because workers were not allowed to speak publicly on the issue, said there was an understanding inside Google that the company was the obvious next target.In a statement, Aaron Stein, a Google spokesman, said the company was \u201ccompletely focused on protecting our users\u2019 data\u201d and \u201cwill take action\u201d if it found evidence of \u201cdeceptive behavior or misuse of personal data.\u201dGoogle is staying on the sidelines in other ways. Four days before Mr. Zuckerberg was set to testify, Facebook surprised many in Washington when it endorsed the Honest Ads Act, a Senate bill that would require more transparency and stricter rules for political ads on the internet. Facebook\u2019s endorsement was a reversal from its previous opposition, said a spokeswoman for one of the bill\u2019s co-sponsors, Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia.Mr. Warner and another co-sponsor, Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, called on Twitter and Google to also back the bill. Twitter quickly responded with an endorsement. Google has not taken a public position.Similarly, Facebook and Google had donated $200,000 each to a group opposing a California ballot initiative that proposes enabling Californians to sue companies for data breaches, among other things. Facebook this week dropped its opposition to the initiative, which organizers said was on track to appear on the November ballot in California.Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s notes, which were photographed during the testimony, also contained a prepared response if lawmakers echoed criticism from Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, who has chided Facebook and other companies for collecting gobs of personal information about their users.\u201cLots of stories about apps misusing Apple data, never seen Apple notify people,\u201d said the document. \u201cImportant you hold everyone to the same standard.\u201dRepresentatives for Facebook and Apple declined to comment on Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s notes.Apple has long campaigned to draw a distinction between the way it operates and the way Facebook and Google do.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to traffic in your personal life. I think it\u2019s an invasion of privacy,\u201d Mr. Cook told MSNBC. \u201cI think everybody needs to understand Silicon Valley is not monolithic.\u201dWhen asked if it was worried about regulations for the industry stemming from new scrutiny of Facebook, Apple referred to recent comments Mr. Cook made to MSNBC. He said he typically believed \u201cthe best regulation is no regulation\u201d but \u201cI think we\u2019re beyond that here.\u201dAmazon uses shoppers\u2019 purchase history to target ads, though Forrester Research estimated its advertising revenue last year was $2.5 billion. Facebook makes $39.9 billion on ads and Google makes $95.4 billion.Amazon\u2019s top competitors for that business? Google and Apple.Many tech companies understand that Washington\u2019s renewed focus on privacy is likely to reach them soon, said Dean Garfield, head of the Information Technology Industry Council, a trade group representing the largest tech companies.\u201cThe tide has shifted,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is passing us by.\u201dNick Wingfield contributed reporting from Seattle.videoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook Should Consider a \u2018Why Me?\u2019 Button", "Date": "2018-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBook\u201cOne of our biggest responsibilities is to protect data.\u201dOver the past year, the downside of social media companies \u2014 Facebook foremost among them \u2014 has become glaringly apparent. They have been platforms for information campaigns that influenced elections and endangered lives. They have failed to keep users\u2019 personal information private. And the carefully targeted ads that appear on them can be, well, creepy.It is not clear that Facebook will be able to stave off regulators, but Mr. Zuckerberg and his colleagues might want to consider this: a \u201cWhy Me?\u201d button. (Google, Amazon and others might want to take note, too.)Facebook suffers from a lack of trust because of the asymmetrical nature of the relationship users have with it. We provide it all sorts of information. But we have no idea how the information is being used, how our data is being harvested, how that data is being commingled and cross-referenced with other data sets and ultimately sold to advertisers. (Facebook already has a button, relatively buried in a list of other items, that it calls \u201cWhy Am I Seeing This Ad?\u201d It is, to some degree, a crippled version of what I\u2019m suggesting should be introduced on all of Facebook\u2019s properties.)To his credit, Mr. Zuckerberg does appear to recognize the problem that his company faces over privacy concerns. After acknowledging that protecting users\u2019 data is one of the company\u2019s biggest responsibilities, he went on to say, \u201cIf you think about what our services are, at their most basic level, you put some content into a service, whether it\u2019s a photo or a video or a text message \u2014 whether it\u2019s Facebook or WhatsApp or Instagram \u2014 and you\u2019re trusting that that content is going to be shared with the people you want to share it with.\u201dThat\u2019s where the \u201cWhy Me?\u201d button could help. This button would sit next to every advertisement and piece of content that appears before you on all of Facebook\u2019s properties, including Instagram and WhatsApp.If you saw an ad or an article pop up on your screen, you could click the \u201cWhy Me?\u201d button. Then you would see a full explanation of why that item was pushed to you.The \u201cWhy Me?\u201d explanation would not just include the name of the advertiser, but what keywords, demographics or other information the advertiser specifically targeted. It would also offer a full rundown of how your information fit into the parameters of the advertiser\u2019s request and where that information came from.Maybe Facebook saw that you had clicked on a pair of sneakers on a different service that shares information with Facebook. The \u201cWhy Me?\u201d section would show you when and where that information was collected. Did Facebook notice you searched for a new cellphone plan? Facebook would tell how it knew that, too.Did Facebook use artificial intelligence to find your face in an image without you or anyone else labeling it? The \u201cWhy Me?\u201d section would show you the images that the artificial intelligence system cross-referenced to identify you. Did Facebook scrape another site or buy information about you that it commingled with the data that you had provided? It would tell you that, too.Most important, at every point in the \u201cexplanation tree,\u201d the user would have the option to turn off or disable that specific piece of data. Facebook, of course, could \u2014 and probably should \u2014 explain the trade-offs of such decisions.The \u201cWhy Me?\u201d button could also be extended to content. When a friend or company shares a post, Facebook doesn\u2019t just display it to everyone listed as the poster\u2019s friend or follower. Facebook\u2019s algorithms choose which friends and followers see it based on all sorts of parameters, usually related to the kind of content or how you\u2019ve interacted with the friend in the past.The \u201cWhy Me?\u201d button should explain all the data points that are used in the calculation and how they are weighted.The current \u201cWhy Am I Seeing This Ad?\u201d often says something like: \u201cCompany A wants to reach people ages 18 and older who live or were recently in the United States. This is information based on your Facebook profile and where you\u2019ve connected to the internet.\u201dBut it hardly tells you the whole story. Facebook doesn\u2019t say so explicitly, but it allows companies to upload their own databases, cross-reference them with Facebook\u2019s data and use that information to serve ads to users. It also doesn\u2019t say how that other site originally got that information about who you are.In fairness, the \u201cWhy Me?\u201d button might create all sorts of problems for Facebook, and its advertisers, too. It would allow users \u2014 and rivals \u2014 to reverse engineer much of the way the system works. And advertisers would probably object to the idea of making their targeting plans public. But that would be the cost of using such large public platforms with such exact targeting.It has become something of a clich\u00e9, but in 1913, before he became a Supreme Court justice, Louis D. Brandeis said, \u201cSunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.\u201dIt could well be applied today at Facebook \u2014 and its peer companies \u2014 if it wants to avoid a governmental crackdown.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "MSNBC Host Joy Reid Blames Hackers for Anti-Gay Blog Posts, but Questions Mount", "Date": "2018-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBack in December, after a series of homophobic posts on her defunct, decade-old blog resurfaced on social media, the MSNBC host Joy Reid apologized for them. But this week, when Ms. Reid was confronted with a new batch of homophobic writings from that same period, she said she had been the victim of hackers.That claim was called into question on Tuesday, when the Internet Archive, the meticulous online record-keeping nonprofit that hosted the archived version of her site, said it had found no evidence to support her claim.Late Tuesday night, MSNBC provided documents that show Ms. Reid\u2019s lawyers alerted Google and the Internet Archive to the alleged hacking in December, shortly after her public apology but long before the latest batch of posts appeared on social media.Ms. Reid did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday, but MSNBC provided a statement from Jonathan Nichols, a cybersecurity consultant working on her case.He said her blog was \u201cbreached\u201d in December and that \u201cfraudulent entries\u201d were posted \u201cwith suspicious formatting and time stamps,\u201d including \u201ctext and visual styling\u201d that was not consistent with the rest of the blog.He said Ms. Reid\u2019s team also had \u201csignificant evidence\u201d that some of the posts circulating online \u2014 he did not say which ones \u2014 had never appeared on the blog and were instead doctored screenshots meant \u201cto tarnish Ms. Reid\u2019s character.\u201dMSNBC also provided two letters sent by Ms. Reid\u2019s lawyer, John H. Reichman, to Alphabet \u2014 Google\u2019s parent company \u2014 and the Internet Archive in December alerting them to alleged hacking and requesting their assistance, which was not forthcoming.\u201cIn December I learned that an unknown, external party accessed and manipulated material from my now-defunct blog, The Reid Report, to include offensive and hateful references that are fabricated and run counter to my personal beliefs and ideology,\u201d the statement said. It added, \u201cNow that the site has been compromised I can state unequivocally that it does not represent the original entries.\u201dThe Internet Archive also said Ms. Reid\u2019s lawyers asked the group to take down the archived version of her site in December because they said either the archive or the original site had been hacked.The archive said it was warned by Ms. Reid\u2019s lawyers that \u201c\u2018fraudulent\u2019 posts were \u2018inserted into legitimate content\u2019 in our archives of the blog.\u201d But an investigation found that claim to be untrue, according to the archive.\u201cWhen we reviewed the archives, we found nothing to indicate tampering or hacking of the Wayback Machine versions,\u201d the statement said, adding, \u201cWe let Reid\u2019s lawyers know that the information provided was not sufficient for us to verify claims of manipulation.\u201dThe Internet Archive said it declined the request to remove Ms. Reid\u2019s blog from the archive \u201cdue to Reid\u2019s being a journalist (a very high-profile one, at that) and the journalistic nature of the blog archives.\u201dMs. Reid appeared eager to blunt the statement by the Internet Archive. Her security consultant, Mr. Nichols, said on Tuesday that \u201cat no time has Ms. Reid claimed that the Wayback Machine was hacked\u201d with an intention to alter her blog.Instead, he said Ms. Reid\u2019s team detected a \u201cbreach\u201d of the site that it thought may have been related to the posts on her blog but that it determined was unrelated.But it appears Ms. Reid may have taken matters into her own hands. The Internet Archive said that at some point during its correspondence with Ms. Reid\u2019s lawyers, a robots exclusion protocol specific to the Wayback Machine was activated on her old blog.That protocol sends a signal to the archive, which the archive chooses to abide by, that can be used to get around the Wayback Machine\u2019s policies and remove pages from the archive of the internet.Justin Bank contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Flying Close to Temptation", "Date": "2018-04-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMODERN LOVEA newly married woman fears that her impulse to drink and keep it a secret will become a wall of deceit between her and her wife.I always said I would drink again only if Sarah got cancer, which was my way of saying I would never drink again. The possibility of anything bad happening to her seemed remote and decades away. The din of midday Midtown swallowed her words. A routine exam a week earlier had found a lump, and the results from her mammogram had been concerning enough that the doctor immediately picked up the phone and called her. I left my office to meet her, unsure what to expect. Some people exude resilience and fortitude in the midst of adversity. I am not one of them. My first thought is of certain and immediate death, followed by a maudlin song orchestrating a montage of good moments. I don\u2019t call my smartest doctor friend and ask him what to do. I start writing the eulogy. Sarah and I met outside a church on Fifth Avenue, her eyes already steeled with resolve.\u201cI\u2019ve emailed my boss and will go to Germany tomorrow as planned,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll still meet me in Italy.\u201dOur honeymoon in Venice was two days away. We had planned it to coincide with one of her business trips; she would fly over first, and I would take the red-eye two days later. Even before we had the confirmation that it was cancer, we knew it was, and I immediately started thinking about a drink. It was a benchmark I had never wanted to hit, and here it was, staring me down.Sarah and I were set up on a blind date. I was in New York for work, and at one of my meetings, a man I barely knew asked me if I was seeing anyone. He was about to get married, and I was petrified this would turn into one of those exchanges in which the happy person assures the single person: \u201cThere\u2019s hope for you yet.\u201dHe had little interest in my explanation (\u201cSingle, yes, but fulfilled!\u201d) and much more interest in the truth: Yes, I was as single as single could be.\u201cI want you to meet a friend of mine,\u201d he said. \u201cI think you\u2019d get along.\u201d He swiftly arranged for us to meet that day.Later I walked into a bar off Central Park and was shocked to find a gorgeous woman, complete with perfectly styled hair and makeup, waiting at the bar. This couldn\u2019t possibly be my date. Half of my head was buzzed, and I was hanging on to my baby fat not in a baby-cute way.She ordered a club soda with a splash of cranberry. I ordered wine. Twice. The first question she asked was why I had moved from New York, and for some reason the answer that came out was: \u201cLove, but not great love, because less than a year later I was dumped naked.\u201dShe sat there politely, and I realized with growing horror that we were both picturing me getting dumped naked.\u201cI live in a sublet in Long Island City,\u201d she finally said. \u201cAnd sometimes I go grocery shopping at the Mobile Mart.\u201dShe was as kind as she was pretty. I may have been dumped naked, but at least I could get myself to a proper grocery store.We left after an hour and I went uptown, embarking on the exact kind of New York night that made me miss the city so badly. I assumed we didn\u2019t have much of a future: We were 10 years apart, shared no hobbies and I drank. What fun could possibly come from sobriety?A few weeks into our courtship \u2014 started mainly because we kept responding to each other\u2019s emails \u2014 we were walking through Chelsea Market. Our hands grazed, and as I glimpsed up at the back of her head, I had this feeling deep in my gut that I would love her. Not in that moment, not yet, but I knew in the way seasons change that I would love her before this one ended. I asked her early on why she had stopped drinking, and she described feeling as if everyone around her had known to get on a train moving forward, but she was watching from the road as these people slowly passed her by.I took stock of my life: a new relationship, wonderful friends, a rewarding job. Drinking had not kept me off the train. My heart exhaled; maybe I was safe. A few months later I was out late, propelled by a thirst to belong, and I walked unsteadily into the bathroom. The mirror caught my reflection, and suddenly I was squinting into my eyes, trying to figure out how I could be madly in love with someone but know in my core that if the person I was drinking with at this bar made a move, I would go along with it.The next morning I called Sarah. \u201cI don\u2019t have a healthy relationship with alcohol,\u201d I said, cursing myself for saying it out loud because I knew she could never unhear it. But I knew: If I drank, I would cheat, and she would leave. She had the tools and presence to move on, and I didn\u2019t. She would be the one who got away. So I stopped drinking, and my life jolted forward at an unbelievable clip: a cross-country move, a career change, cohabitation, another career change, an engagement, homeownership, marriage. Also: death, professional challenges, family politics gone awry, financial anxiety, actual anxiety and, now, cancer. Two days later I sat in the United lounge, looking at fellow travelers, the clock, my phone and my club soda. A man with a fedora sipped something brown on the rocks; a woman left smudged lipstick on what looked like a wine spritzer. A little boy watched his parents drink, his eyes moving from her red wine to his beer, his head moving slightly between the two. I saw a young couple \u2014 honeymooners, too? \u2014 toast with champagne flutes. I looked down at my club soda. The ice was mostly melted. If I drank now, could I pause my life again? Could Sarah and I go back to that first summer, when everything was still a possibility? I imagined the coldness of the chardonnay leaving an imprint on every cell as it traveled down my throat. My back would loosen, my thoughts would get fuzzy in the best way.I could call an old friend, chat about mindless gossip as I waited to board. The bartender wouldn\u2019t think twice about giving me a pour for the road. The flight attendant wouldn\u2019t cock her head when I asked if I could have both red and white with dinner. Sarah would never have to know. No one would.Except, I would know. The thing I prized most about our relationship was that Sarah knew everything about me \u2014 and loved me anyway. If I were to drink, that secret would be the first brick in a wall between us.I thought about that night in the bathroom and how scared I was that Sarah might be really sick. For me to escape into drinking now would be to leave her alone.I watched the wall grow, brick by brick. My stomach clenched at the thought of Sarah sitting in a doctor\u2019s chair, wondering where I had gone. I thought of months down the road, when we would get test results back saying she would need surgery and chemotherapy and radiation \u2014 neither of us knowing at the time that she would come through it and be fine.All I could see was Sarah reaching for my hand, and there I would be, locked up with my secrets, navigating a dark cave while wishing I had chosen the brighter path.A ding and a scratchy female voice announced that my flight was starting to board.I didn\u2019t want to escape, regardless of what may be hiding in the future. The flight passed unremarkably: I watched a movie, slept, ignored the wine cart at dinnertime. And in the morning, Sarah was waiting at my gate in Milan, cappuccino and croissant in hand.Liz Parker is a literary agent in New York City.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Beginner\u2019s Guide to Taking Great Video on Your Phone", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byToday, there are lots of reasons everyone from pro photographers to amateur shutterbugs are using phones to shoot video projects.Like many of his peers, Christian Nachtrieb, a Boston-based corporate and wedding photographer, finds phones aren\u2019t just continuing to improve in terms of quality, but they\u2019re also extremely convenient. \u201cIt\u2019s the readiness factor. Having a phone right in your pocket is a huge plus,\u201d says Mr. Nachtrieb, who might see a stunning sunset, capture it on his phone, and then splice it into a final wedding video. \u201cNo one in a million years could tell the difference between our main cameras and the iPhone.\u201dWhat do such improvements in video quality allow you to capture? In theory, a good video. But that can mean many things: Good on a technical level? Or, perhaps, a clip that\u2019s simply fun to watch? First, let\u2019s explore some of the basic elements that make up good video.Technical excellence in a good video can be pretty easy to spot: we see examples of it all the time on television. During the 2018 Olympics, for instance, you could watch skilled videographers shoot breathtaking videos of athletes in spectacular settings. From a technical standpoint, here are some common elements in those and other types of video that you can apply to video captured on your phone.A video can resonate for reasons other than exquisite technique. The subject might be funny, or the story simply thrilling, sad, or even chaotic. Sometimes, a powerful video, though technically flawed, still draws us in by other means. Two film sequences come to my mind that illustrate this point.So, good video obviously operates on a very visual level, but it can be driven in nonvisual ways, too. Keep your eyes open for such opportunities.Before taking video on your phone, set it up properly. One important setting is video resolution, which refers to how large your movie will be. Two common resolutions are 1080 HD and 4K, which is the larger of the two.Next, check the frame rate, which sets how many individual frames per second (fps) your video records. Common settings are 30 fps, 60 fps, and less commonly, 24 fps. The higher the number, the smoother-looking video you\u2019ll produce. Most video is shot at 30 fps or 29.97 fps (in the United States), although 60 fps will show smoother, less jittery video when depicting action. But some videographers, like Mr. Nachtrieb, prefer filming in 24 fps, which mimics the frame rate used in cinema films.Each of these two settings affects some visual or audio component of your project. They also can determine the final file size of the video. For instance, a five-second video shot at 4K-resolution will be roughly four times the size of the same segment shot in 1080 HD resolution. \u201cWhen it comes to resolution,\u201d says Mr. Nachtrieb, \u201cit\u2019s always going to be a compromise between your storage capacity on your phone and the quality resolution you want. I try to shoot 4K whenever possible.\u201dShooting video on a phone isn\u2019t the most intuitive experience. That\u2019s because phones were designed as multipurpose devices, which also means they lack some important features, like a handgrip or optical zoom, which gets you closer to your subject without degrading image quality. (Instead, phones mostly use digital zoom, which often degrades image quality. So, avoid zooming in digitally. Instead, \u201czoom with your feet\u201d or simply walk closer to your subject, if you can.) Here are several tips for getting better results.Here are two audio tricks: Borrow a second phone, start recording audio, and place the phone in your subject\u2019s pocket. \u201cThen, shoot video on your phone from far away,\u201d says Mr. Nachtrieb. \u201cYou can always sync up the audio tracks later in video editing.\u201d And when interviewing subjects, don\u2019t interrupt their replies, says Mr. Nachtrieb.If you\u2019re not happy with the hardware features on your phone, there are accessories to expand its capability and, in some cases, the quality of your video, particularly if you\u2019re interested in Vlogging.Here are a few products to consider, courtesy of our colleagues at Wirecutter, The New York Times Company\u2019s product review site:A stand-alone camera can really improve your video. When you\u2019re ready to shoot with something other than your phone, here are some models that earned top ratings from Wirecutter:Interchangeable-Lens Cameras: Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oprah, Rupert Murdoch, Harvard: Saudi Prince\u2019s U.S. Tour", "Date": "2018-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 He talked about the movie business with Michael Douglas, Morgan Freeman and Dwayne Johnson over dinner at Rupert Murdoch\u2019s house. He discussed space travel with Richard Branson in the California desert, and philanthropy with Bill Gates and technology with Jeff Bezos in Seattle. He visited Harvard and MIT, brokered arms deals with President Trump and sat down with Wall Street financiers. He even met with Oprah Winfrey.For nearly three weeks, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the 32-year-old heir to the Saudi throne, has crisscrossed the United States, on an ambitious, choreographed journey through modern American life, while under heavy guard because of his many enemies in the Middle East.The prince, who arrived in America with a reputation as an aggressive consolidator of power back home and a zealous interventionist abroad, is seeking to change the perception of Saudi Arabia from an opaque and conservative kingdom, where mosques promote extremist ideology and women are relegated to second-class status, to a modernist desert oasis.Prince Mohammed also has sought to attract American investors for industries going well beyond Saudi Arabia\u2019s Aramco petroleum giant. He is pressing what he has described as a transformative economic agenda, to wean the kingdom from reliance on oil and diversify its economy through public infrastructure investments and development of an entertainment industry \u2014 including theme parks along the lines of Six Flags and Disney.\u201cI think it\u2019s brilliant and I will tell you why,\u201d said Adam Aron, the chief executive of the movie theater chain AMC, who has met with the prince. \u201cThe crown prince is aware that Saudi Arabia has had a difficult image in the United States, because it\u2019s been such a conservative country for so many decades. He wants to transform Saudi society in ways that will be very appealing to Americans.\u201dMr. Aron spoke this week in a reception area of the Four Seasons in Los Angeles, as attendees of a Saudi conference on the entertainment business ate from a spread of Middle Eastern dishes \u2014 lamb kebabs, hummus, tabbouleh. They were entertained by an oud player. Officials spoke about plans to open up the country to concerts, jazz festivals and movies, all an attempt, in the words of one Saudi official, to \u201cdrive happiness\u201d in the kingdom, where 70 percent of the population is under 30, and many are glued to their smartphones.Mr. Aron said men and women would be able to attend films together, a revolutionary step in Saudi Arabia, where public space has long been strictly segregated by gender. He said Hollywood films would be censored in the same way they were in other places across the Middle East: sex out, violence in.\u201cEven then, the scope wasn\u2019t what you see today,\u201d said Mohammed K. Alyahya, a Saudi expert at the Atlantic Council in Washington. \u201cThis is really across the board. It signals that there is deep cooperation beyond just security for oil.\u201d\u201cFor the longest time the Saudis wouldn\u2019t explain themselves, and explain why things were happening in their country,\u201d Mr. Alyahya added. \u201cThat is changing dramatically.\u201dThe prince\u2019s American tour followed a similar visit to Britain, where he soaked in the royal treatment and dined with the queen. And as in the United States, local lobbying and public relations firms helped present an image of the prince as an economic and social reformer. In London, ads appeared on billboards and the sides of black cabs: \u201cHe is bringing change to Saudi Arabia.\u201d \u201cHe is empowering Saudi Arabian women.\u201d \u201cHe is opening Saudi Arabia to the world.\u201dFor decades, the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia could be distilled into one proposition: access to oil for the Americans, and a guarantee that the Americans would protect Saudi Arabia from enemies, especially its chief rival, Iran.Prince Mohammed\u2019s trip began in Washington, where he met with President Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who share the prince\u2019s antipathy for Iran and have deepened relations with the Saudis to counter Iran\u2019s growing influence in the Middle East.The trip ends this weekend in Texas, where the prince meets with oil executives and two former presidents, George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush.Prince Mohammed also has been sharply criticized by human rights activists for waging a bombing campaign in Yemen, where thousands of civilians have been killed, and for cracking down on dissent by jailing bloggers. And in playing to an American audience the prince has faced longstanding concerns over the efforts of Saudi Arabian clerics to export extremist Islamist ideology, beliefs that underpin terrorist groups like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State.Part of the prince\u2019s rebranding of his nation \u2014 and his attempt to address the issue of religious extremism for a country that was home to 15 of the 19 hijackers in the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 \u2014 is a piece of revisionism, say analysts. The prince has argued, in interviews around his trip, that extremism in Saudi Arabia is traceable to the 1979 revolution in Shiite Iran, whose rivalry with Sunni-dominated Saudi Arabia has inflamed sectarian tensions that divide the Middle East.\u201cIt\u2019s really a rewriting of Saudi history,\u201d said Karen E. Young, an expert on Saudi Arabia at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. Ms. Young said that conservative Muslim strains had always coursed through Saudi society, but that drawing a line between before 1979 and after \u201cplays into this rhetoric of the world against Iran.\u201dIt also plays to the sentiments of the Trump administration, which has taken a tougher line and has threatened to tear up the 2015 deal the Obama administration negotiated to curtail Iran\u2019s nuclear program.For the most part, human rights concerns have not overshadowed the prince\u2019s American journey. At the dinner at Mr. Murdoch\u2019s house, for instance, where guests \u2014 but not the prince himself \u2014 drank wine from the media mogul\u2019s vineyard, the prince spoke about empowering women in Saudi Arabia, where they will soon be able to drive for the first time in decades, and movie investments in the kingdom. He was not pressed on human rights issues, said one attendee, who described the evening as informal and the prince as \u201ccarefully candid.\u201dMayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles was one of the few Americans who met with Prince Mohammed and in public stressed human rights issues. In a statement, the mayor said he \u201curged the Crown Prince to continue his efforts to advance women\u2019s rights, and raised concerns about human rights and the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Yemen.\u201dIn Los Angeles, Prince Mohammed\u2019s visit drew a smattering of protests. \u201cHe\u2019s coming here under the guise that he\u2019s some great reformer and changing the country,\u201d said Michelle Modglin, 67, a retired nurse, demonstrating outside the Beverly Hills office of the William Morris Endeavor talent agency, which recently received a $400 million investment from Saudi Arabia. \u201cBut we know that\u2019s not true as long as he\u2019s bombing Yemen and killing innocent people.\u201dLater that evening, hundreds of Saudi students from nearby universities \u2014 many of whom receive educational scholarships from the Saudi government \u2014 packed a ballroom at the Beverly Hills Hotel for a TED-style event put on by the Misk Foundation, a nonprofit founded by Prince Mohammed. During the Misk Talk, successful Saudi men and women representing technology, entertainment and other industries sought to impart wisdom and inspiration to the young crowd.And on Tuesday night, Misk hosted an art exhibit in an industrial-style event space in the arts district of downtown Los Angeles, where women in miniskirts and leather pants mixed with young Saudi women in head scarves, while young Saudi men who live in Los Angeles worked as volunteer guides to Saudi art.Hala Alzuhayri, a Saudi woman at the University of San Diego who attended the Misk Talk, praised the prince for opening up the economy and said she was pleased about the new prospects for women, even as she worried about the pace of change. \u201cBut we are a Muslim society, so these kinds of big steps have to take time,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just shock society with big steps one after another. It\u2019s hard.\u201d\u201cIt was very disorganized,\u201d said Ms. Young, of the start of the trip. \u201cThere was a real lack of coordination.\u201dBut the operation soon stabilized, with a tightly controlled message managed by the Saudi Embassy in Washington with assistance from American lobbying and public relations firms. Almost daily, news releases were issued about the crown prince\u2019s dizzying schedule of meetings.\u201cIt sent a message that this could go very wrong,\u201d she said, of the early chaos. \u201cBut to their credit it\u2019s gone very well.\u201dReporting was contributed by Brooks Barnes and Louis Keene from Los Angeles, Nate Schweber from New York, Jack Nicas from San Francisco, and Kimiko de Freytas-Tamura from London.Advertisement"}

Don\u2019t Just Grab Them.", "Date": "2018-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixThis lesson applies to just about everything that touches your personal technology, including the apps that you download to your phone or computer and the free online services that you use. And, yes, it also includes those seemingly harmless personality tests run by some unfamiliar organization on Facebook \u2014 the kind that helped Cambridge Analytica get the data on users.\u201cWe don\u2019t really know why we\u2019re trusting that a particular company with access to our data won\u2019t do something like sell it or rent it or share it without our consent,\u201d said Lee Tien, a lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit that focuses on digital rights.Yet I am recommending taking extra caution with obscure tech brands because it is something under your control. You can take a pause. Don\u2019t immediately download every app you see in an app store or on the web just because it looks fun. Don\u2019t take every quiz you see on Facebook (even if you are dying to know which \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d character identifies with you). Don\u2019t impulse buy internet-connected devices from unfamiliar brands. Don\u2019t do any of this without first doing some research on the reputations of these vendors and their business models.Here are some examples of when unknown brands did us wrong \u2014 and the lessons we can learn.Here\u2019s the kicker: The truth was always laid out in the privacy policy, which said that \u201cwe may collect, use, transfer, sell and disclose nonpersonal information for any purpose\u201d and that data could be used \u201cto build anonymous market research products and services.\u201dIn response to the backlash, Unroll.me said it was \u201cheartbreaking\u201d to see that people were upset and pledged to be more transparent about its use of data. The app continues to operate.\u201cWe all need to know that whenever you\u2019re not paying for the thing, then you\u2019re paying for the thing in a nonmonetary way,\u201d Mr. Tien said.Last year, an app called Soniac was available for Android phones on the Google Play app store. Soniac marketed itself as a messaging app \u2014 and indeed, it included features for sending text messages. The less obvious features: The app was also capable of silently recording audio, taking photos with the camera, placing phone calls and downloading call logs among other features.Lookout, a security firm that follows malicious software for Android devices, alerted Google about Soniac\u2019s hidden abilities last year, and the app was quickly removed from the Play app store.The company that offered Soniac, Iraqwebservice, had published other spyware apps on the Play store. All of its apps have been removed from Play, but Lookout warned that the spyware would probably resurface in the future.For another, when installing an app, take a close look at what data it is accessing. Smartphone apps will ask for permission for access to certain data and sensors. If an app is asking for data that is unrelated to the product, don\u2019t install it. For example, you can reasonably expect a mapping app to ask for your location data, but it shouldn\u2019t need access to your camera.\u201cIf something seems outside of the scope, like if a calculator app tells you it needs to use your webcam, say, \u2018What, why?\u2019\u201d said Adam Kujawa, the head of malware intelligence at Malwarebytes, a security firm.Third, avoid downloading apps from unofficial app stores and sites that are not affiliated with large brands. And keep in mind that alternative app stores are particularly ripe for malware, because just about anything can be distributed there, similar to a flea market.Parents, beware: A number of internet products have specifically collected data about children. EchoMetrix is a notorious example. In 2009, the company issued a news release bragging that it had predicted the winner of that year\u2019s \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d singing competition.How did it do that? By looking at children\u2019s private information. The company started in 2004 with the name SearchHelp, offering a parental control app called FamilySafe for parents to monitor their children\u2019s online activities. Five years later, it rebranded itself as EchoMetrix and released Pulse, a tool for providing insight to third-party marketers on youths, by aggregating data from millions of teenagers\u2019 chat transcripts and blog posts, among other sources.Perhaps the most important lesson is to acknowledge that you don\u2019t know anything about the vast majority of brands you engage with on the internet. So tread carefully.\u201cThese threats aren\u2019t going away,\u201d Mr. Tien said. \u201cWith the expansion of data collection and the expansion of what\u2019s possible to collect, it\u2019s just going to continue to proliferate.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Fix Facebook. Replace It.", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Wu is the author of \u201cThe Attention Merchants: The Epic Struggle to Get Inside Our Heads.\u201dThe right question: What comes after Facebook? Yes, we have come to depend on social networks, but instead of accepting an inherently flawed Facebook monopoly, what we most need now is a new generation of social media platforms that are fundamentally different in their incentives and dedication to protecting user data. Barring a total overhaul of leadership and business model, Facebook will never be that platform.Every business has its founding DNA. Real corporate change is rare, especially when the same leaders remain in charge. In Facebook\u2019s case, we are not speaking of a few missteps here and there, the misbehavior of a few aberrant employees. The problems are central and structural, the predicted consequences of its business model. From the day it first sought revenue, Facebook prioritized growth over any other possible goal, maximizing the harvest of data and human attention. Its promises to investors have demanded an ever-improving ability to spy on and manipulate large populations of people. Facebook, at its core, is a surveillance machine, and to expect that to change is misplaced optimism.What the journalist Walter Lippmann said in 1959 of \u201cfree\u201d TV is also true of \u201cfree\u201d social media: It is ultimately \u201cthe creature, the servant and indeed the prostitute of merchandizing.\u201d But social media itself isn\u2019t going away. It has worked its way into our lives and has come to help satistify the basic human need to connect and catch up. Facebook, in fact, claims lofty goals, saying it seeks to \u201cbring us closer together\u201d and \u201cbuild a global community.\u201d Those are indeed noble purposes that social media can serve. But if they were Facebook\u2019s true goals, we would not be here.The ideal competitor and successor to Facebook would be a platform that actually puts such goals first. To do so, however, it cannot be just another data-hoarder, like Google Plus. If we have learned anything over the last decade, it is that advertising and data-collection models are incompatible with a trustworthy social media network. The conflicts are too formidable, the pressure to amass data and promise everything to advertisers is too strong for even the well-intentioned to resist.So what stands in the way of building a genuine alternative? It isn\u2019t the technology. A good Facebook competitor needs merely to build a platform that links you with friends and allows posting of thoughts, pictures and comments. No, the real challenge is gaining a critical mass of users. Facebook, with its 2.2 billion users, will not disappear, and it has a track record of buying or diminishing its rivals (see Instagram and Foursquare). But as Lyft is proving by stealing market share from Uber, and as Snapchat proved by taking taking younger audiences from Facebook, \u201cnetwork effects\u201d are not destiny. Now is the time for a new generation of Facebook competitors that challenge the mother ship.One set of Facebook alternatives might be provided by firms that are credibly privacy-protective, for which users would pay a small fee (perhaps 99 cents a month). In an age of \u201cfree\u201d social media, paying might sound implausible \u2014 but keep in mind that payment better aligns the incentives of the platform with those of its users. The payment and social network might be bundled with other products such as the iPhone or the Mozilla or Brave browser.Another \u201calt-Facebook\u201d could be a nonprofit that uses that status to signal its dedication to better practices, much as nonprofit hospitals and universities do. Wikipedia is a nonprofit, and it manages nearly as much traffic as Facebook, on a much smaller budget. An \u201calt-Facebook\u201d could be started by Wikimedia, or by former Facebook employees, many of whom have congregated at the Center for Humane Technology, a nonprofit for those looking to change Silicon Valley\u2019s culture. It could even be funded by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which was created in reaction to the failures of commercial television and whose mission includes ensuring access to \u201ctelecommunications services that are commercial free and free of charge.\u201dWhen a company fails, as Facebook has, it is natural for the government to demand that it fix itself or face regulation. But competition can also create pressure to do better. If today\u2019s privacy scandals lead us merely to install Facebook as a regulated monopolist, insulated from competition, we will have failed completely. The world does not need an established church of social media.Tim Wu is a law professor at Columbia, the author of \u201cThe Attention Merchants: The Epic Struggle to Get Inside Our Heads\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "G.E. Makes a Sharp \u2018Pivot\u2019 on Digital", "Date": "2018-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLast November, Mr. Flannery told investors that expenses at GE Digital would be cut this year by more than 25 percent, or about $400 million. While he insisted the digital initiatives at G.E. are \u201cvery key\u201d to the company, he added, \u201cwe want a much more focused strategy.\u201dBut the rethinking of GE Digital, with its future still under review by Mr. Flannery, points to the difficulty of producing modern software for industrial businesses as they adopt digital technology.No one disputes the overarching vision of the so-called industrial internet of things \u2014 which includes low-cost sensors and a flood of data and clever software that should deliver insights to cut costs, conserve fuel and design better products, faster. But the company greatly underestimated the challenges of creating all the software needed to achieve that grand vision, said analysts and former G.E. managers.G.E.\u2019s technical prowess, they said, lies in designing and manufacturing big machines like power-plant turbines, jet engines and medical-imaging equipment. Its traditional software skills have been in the specialized programs that control the machines and factory operations. GE Digital was a striking departure into cloud-based internet software, data analytics and artificial intelligence tools like machine learning.\u201cG.E. reached too far outside its expertise and too fast,\u201d said Steven Winoker, an analyst at UBS. \u201cAnd it became a financial black hole.\u201dG.E.\u2019s digital effort dates to 2011, when Mr. Immelt recruited William Ruh, an executive at Cisco Systems. Later that year, the company set up a center in San Ramon, Calif., east of San Francisco. At the time, Mr. Ruh announced big plans to hire as many as 400 software engineers to write code for the industrial internet.The San Ramon work force swelled sharply to 1,400 in the summer of 2016, and to a peak of 2,000 last summer \u2014 before coming down to about 1,800, after a round of cuts earlier this year.During the buildup, G.E. recruited veteran software managers who had worked at leading tech companies, including Google, Microsoft and Apple. With the cuts at GE Digital and its narrowed focus, some of them have departed.The product plan later broadened to include a cloud-based software platform for handling all kinds of sensor and machine data, and secure communications from the factory floor to data centers. G.E. even built its own data centers.The software platform under development was often referred to as an operating system for the industrial internet. When the product concept expanded, so did the Predix brand.Today, according to former G.E. engineers, Predix has been pared back to mainly a set of software tools to help write applications rather than being connected to layers of code for automating data analysis.The priority at GE Digital is now on selling products for specific industrial applications, sold as offerings in the \u201cPredix portfolio,\u201d and tailored for G.E.\u2019s roster of existing industrial customers. Less emphasis is being put on all-purpose software for the wider industrial world.In an interview, Mr. Ruh described the change at GE Digital as \u201ca pivot\u201d rather than a retreat. \u201cWe\u2019re still 1,000 percent behind our Predix portfolio,\u201d he said.The current strategy, Mr. Ruh said, \u201cis about industrial apps\u201d like those. It is a measured, step-by-step approach but one, Mr. Ruh said, that capitalizes on G.E.\u2019s strengths \u2014 its industry knowledge and deep customer relationships \u2014 and is lifting sales.GE Digital remains a large player in an increasingly crowded field of companies offering industrial internet software of various kinds, in different market niches. The entrants include the big cloud suppliers like Amazon, Microsoft and Google; major business software companies like Oracle, SAP, IBM and SAS Institute; G.E.\u2019s industrial peers such as Siemens, Honeywell and ABB; and start-ups like C3 IoT, Uptake and FogHorn Systems.The opportunity for G.E., analysts said, centers on its longstanding relationships with customers and selling to them. And so far, only 8 percent of its industrial customers are using Predix portfolio products, the company said.The New York Power Authority, the nation\u2019s largest state-owned utility, is one of them. The utility is working with GE Digital to build apps that improve the efficiency of its power generation and distribution network. In pilot projects, the partnership has saved or avoided $3 million in costs, said Gil Quiniones, chief executive of the state power authority. The goal is $500 million in savings over the next decade.But for a technology project to help its customers reduce energy consumption, the state authority went with a start-up, C3 IoT.Brian Hurst, chief analytics officer at Exelon Utilities, a large electric utility corporation based in Chicago, is also working on early-stage projects with GE Digital. Mr. Hurst said the progress was encouraging and he saw no evidence that the cuts at GE Digital had affected their joint work.But it is something he is watching closely. \u201cThe technology is moving so fast,\u201d Mr. Hurst said. \u201cToday\u2019s players may not be tomorrow\u2019s players.\u201dGE Digital, Mr. Ruh insisted, is building a business for the long term. Revenue from the Predix portfolio products reached $550 million last year, he said, and sales are growing rapidly. GE Digital\u2019s total revenue of $4 billion also includes all of G.E.\u2019s traditional industrial software, and the unit\u2019s global work force is more than 4,000.\u201cOur approach is heads-down,\u201d Mr. Ruh said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to show you success.\u201dFor his part, Mr. Flannery has consistently declared his support for G.E.\u2019s digital-industrial vision \u2014 but that does not guarantee the future for GE Digital. Mr. Flannery is selling off businesses to streamline the company. The lighting and railway locomotive divisions are up for sale, and others could follow.A smaller G.E. might not need a stand-alone digital unit. Some analysts recommend putting all the software in the industrial divisions, like power and aviation, closer to customers.\u201cSan Ramon shouldn\u2019t exist,\u201d said Scott Davis, chief executive of Melius Research, an independent financial analysis firm.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Amazon\u2019s New Headquarters Could Mean for Rents", "Date": "2018-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWinning the contest could mean a steeper increase in local housing costs over the next decade, a study finds. Nashville is already contemplating the impact.To some locals, Amazon represented something else: more people, more traffic and, most of all, higher rents in a city where a rising share of residents were already struggling to afford a place to live.Other cities could also see big increases if Amazon picks them. Monthly rents in Boston and Los Angeles could jump by even larger amounts in dollar terms \u2014 albeit from a higher starting point \u2014 reflecting a shortfall in rental housing construction. Denver \u2014 like Nashville, a midsize city that has seen brisk population growth in recent years \u2014 could see its already rapid rate of rent increases hit nearly 6 percent per year, triple the overall rate of inflation.Some potential locations would be less severely affected. Atlanta and Chicago, big cities that have made it relatively easy to build new housing in recent decades, would see only a small rent increase if they won the Amazon project. And Indianapolis, where population growth has been slow and housing is plentiful, would see no effect on its rents at all, according to Zillow\u2019s model. Even in those cities, however, neighborhoods near the Amazon campus would most likely see significant rent increases. (The study did not look at the effect on prices of owner-occupied homes.)Zillow cautions that its estimates are rough, based on a simple model that looks at how rents in each city have responded to past influxes of workers. If the cities respond differently to Amazon\u2019s arrival \u2014 for example, by building more housing \u2014 the impact on rents could be smaller than Zillow\u2019s model estimates. But there are also reasons to think Zillow\u2019s analysis could understate Amazon\u2019s potential impact. The model looks only at the effect of the jobs that the new campus is expected to create directly. If Amazon\u2019s presence draws other businesses to the area, rents could rise even faster.That\u2019s what has happened in Seattle, where a mini-Silicon Valley has sprung up around Amazon\u2019s downtown campus. Facebook, Google and other internet giants have opened satellite offices nearby, and start-ups \u2014 including Zillow itself \u2014 have their headquarters there. \u201cWhat\u2019s so important is once a city is selected that they start to get ahead of the curve,\u201d Mr. Terrazas said.In Nashville, the debate over HQ2 has gotten caught up in a broader discussion of gentrification, race and the consequences of growth. Residents long described Nashville as a small town disguised as a big city. But over the last decade, the city\u2019s tourism industry has taken off, and some of those tourists liked Nashville enough to stay. For years, the Nashville metropolitan area grew by more than 100 residents per day, with many of them moving into newly built downtown apartment complexes.\u201cIf we\u2019re only addressing housing, then I don\u2019t think we\u2019re getting to the root of the issue,\u201d Ms. Harris said. \u201cWage growth is critical in this conversation.\u201d\u201cWe welcome technology, we welcome great jobs to the city, and I think people would even welcome Amazon, but it would have to be a trade-off there,\u201d Mr. Bedne said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to sign a suicide pact.\u201dAmazon, Ms. Schuetz added, should also take housing costs, traffic congestion and related issues into account. After all, she said, Amazon won\u2019t benefit if its workers can\u2019t find places to live, or if they are viewed by existing residents as a hostile force.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long-term relationship,\u201d Ms. Schuetz said. \u201cTo retain good workers over the long haul, you should care about what housing costs could be.\u201dAdvertisement"}

YouTube said she had entered the courtyard through a parking garage. The gate between the parking garage and the courtyard was unlocked, according to Zach Vorhies, an engineer at YouTube. A former YouTube employee who used to handle threats from disgruntled video creators, but was not allowed to speak about it publicly, said his team repeatedly warned YouTube security about the risk of the parking garage and unlocked gate, but it was never fixed.YouTube said in a statement on Wednesday that Ms. Aghdam never entered the building itself thanks to other security protections. The company said it was \u201crevisiting this incident in detail\u201d and would be increasing security at all of its offices around the world.Workplace shootings have fueled a cottage industry of security consultants who show employees how to manage panic, when to run or hide, and how to fight as a last resort. Lesson plans identify which filing cabinets or pieces of furniture offer the best protection, and which office tools can become improvised weapons. A full day of training can cost companies thousands of dollars.Companies are sending their employees to self-defense classes and their security personnel to gun ranges to test active-shooter threats in virtual reality. Architects are designing offices with designated safe rooms. Insurance providers are offering lower premiums for corporate clients with stronger security.\u201cIf you can\u2019t protect the work force, you\u2019re putting your entire operation at risk,\u201d said Arnette Heintze, a former Secret Service agent who runs the security consulting firm Hillard Heintze, which posted record revenue in the most recent quarter.At Apple\u2019s new campus in Cupertino, Calif., visitors are required to enter through a single, guarded entrance. The headquarters have a large courtyard, but reaching it requires someone to pass through the building.One former Facebook employee who worked on the company\u2019s security protocols, who declined to be named because of Facebook\u2019s prohibition on discussing internal company matters, said the company received dozens of threats a week.In recent years, Facebook has increased security at the entrances to its headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., but its parking lots and surrounding areas remain accessible. \u201cThe safety of our employees is paramount, and we work hard every day to maintain a safe and secure environment for our community,\u201d Jamil Walker, a Facebook spokesman, said in an email.Some security experts instruct clients to shift their parking lots farther away from the main facility, giving more time for potential attackers to have second thoughts and for guards to act on a threat. Consultants recommend that executive offices remain unlabeled to make them less of a target.Companies of all kinds have stepped up security. General Mills said it made physical changes to its building in Minneapolis to better prepare for an active shooter situation, but did not provide specifics. Wendy\u2019s said it had installed upgraded security cameras throughout its headquarters in Dublin, Ohio; set up advanced access control systems that can lock down different parts of the facility; and upgraded its phone systems with emergency messaging capabilities.Hallmark and Hershey said they show employees a training video from the Center for Personal Protection and Safety that covers active shooter protocol. Some companies use a softer term \u2014 \u201chostile intruder\u201d \u2014 to describe the training, while others add customized introductions to the footage.Employees are being asked to download internal apps loaded with safety plans, maps and emergency alerts. Some are told that their bonuses will be withheld if they do not attend mandatory drills.And preventive tactics are gaining traction. Employers are hiring social media trackers and data analysts to search for warning signs in employee behavior. Accenture said it has a behavioral threat assessment team made up of human resources representatives, lawyers, on-call psychologists and others.But security remains a matter of balance.\u201cYou don\u2019t want a security program so restrictive that it hinders the company from doing the business it\u2019s in,\u201d Mr. Heintze said.Employees looking for convenience tend to prop open automatically locking doors. Some will pass a badge over a turnstile to a friend who forgot his or hers.One corporate client described its facility to John M. White, the chief executive of the Protection Management security consulting firm, as being fully secure. Within three hours, Mr. White found that he could waltz through most of the building\u2019s doors without being screened and that some were so old they would not lock.Another customer spent several hundred thousand dollars installing security cameras, only to find that their views were obstructed. Mr. White said he has spoken to employees who, in a theoretical attack, said they would be unwilling to break a window to escape out of fear of being fired later.\u201cYou can\u2019t just throw a million dollars at security and say that now the problem\u2019s gone,\u201d he said. \u201cIn some ways, it can be a facade \u2014 you could have the most secure facility in the world, and there will still be some risks you\u2019re going to have to accept and manage.\u201dSheera Frenkel contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Cobra Kai\u2019: This Rivalry Is Not Quite Ready for a Body Bag", "Date": "2018-04-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMARIETTA, Ga. \u2014 To hear William Zabka tell it, Johnny Lawrence was a victim of circumstance.It\u2019s a legacy he\u2019s fine with, he insisted on the set of \u201cCobra Kai.\u201d The 10-episode series, debuting May 2 on YouTube Red, the video portal\u2019s paid streaming service, picks up the \u201cKarate Kid\u201d story more than three decades later.But not everyone is convinced.\u201cHe was the biggest [expletive] of the \u201980s,\u201d Mr. Macchio said.Some grudges go dormant, but they don\u2019t go away. That\u2019s the idea animating \u201cCobra Kai,\u201d and it gives this latest TV revival more baked-in tension than the average nostalgia-fest.Created by Josh Heald (\u201cHot Tub Time Machine\u201d), Jonathan Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg (the \u201cHarold and Kumar\u201d films, \u201cBlockers\u201d), longtime friends and \u201cKarate Kid\u201d obsessives, the half-hour comedy flips the story to focus on Johnny. \u201cCobra Kai\u201d offers the young tough-turned-old deadbeat a chance at redemption while illuminating the reasons behind his behavior all those years ago. (They involve a stepfather played by Ed Asner.)\u201cIt\u2019s a karate opera,\u201d Mr. Schlossberg said. \u201cThere\u2019s a fun sort of Hatfields and McCoys vibe.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nice to be a big fish in a small pond,\u201d Mr. Hurwitz said, \u201cwhen the small pond is Google.\u201d\u201cThat kick to the head sent them on two different trajectories,\u201d Mr. Hurwitz said. \u201cDaniel on the upswing, and Johnny in the downward spiral that\u2019s been going for the last 30 years.\u201d\u201cThe good news is now I\u2019m sitting on the sidelines \u2014 I\u2019m not getting my ass kicked,\u201d Mr. Macchio said. \u201cAt 56, no matter how much hair and makeup help me, everything hurts more in the morning.\u201dEven off camera, both he and Mr. Zabka, 52, are remarkably well-preserved. This is key to maintaining the possibility that the story\u2019s old guys might actually fight, too \u2014 the will-they-or-won\u2019t-they of this particular sitcom. (\u201cMy kicks are still high,\u201d Mr. Zabka warned, grinning. \u201cNo mercy.\u201d)But neither was interested putting on a karate gi for a broad, nostalgic spoof. In separate interviews, the actors struck similar notes of protectiveness about the \u201cKarate Kid\u201d legacy, about how important it was for \u201cCobra Kai\u201d to spin the story forward and include some of the film\u2019s heart along with the clever callbacks, fan Easter eggs and \u201chumor that comes from the fact that these two guys have not moved past it,\u201d Mr. Macchio said.The actors long ago made peace with the fact that as far as the rest of the world is concerned, they\u2019ll never entirely move past \u201cThe Karate Kid.\u201dMr. Macchio had other indelible roles in movies like \u201cThe Outsiders,\u201d \u201cCrossroads\u201d and \u201cMy Cousin Vinny,\u201d and he has starred on Broadway. But he knows that any time he attends a sporting event, the arena will put him on the Jumbotron and play \u201cYou\u2019re the Best\u201d at some point.\u201cFor so long, I still felt that kick,\u201d he said.Kept mostly apart during filming, Mr. Macchio and Mr. Zabka never really became friends until later, on the fan convention circuit. But while it\u2019s an odd thing, being randomly but inextricably linked to another person for your entire adult life, there\u2019s something transporting about it, too.Mr. Macchio, for one, was stunned at how quickly the old fire came back once the actors finally faced off for the first time during filming for \u201cCobra Kai.\u201d\u201cIt just had all that tension \u2014 you look into his eyes, and he\u2019s looking at mine,\u201d he said. \u201cThe eyelids had a couple more wrinkles, but it felt like yesterday.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Vegan Bodybuilder\u2019: How YouTube Attacker, Nasim Aghdam, Went Viral in Iran", "Date": "2018-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN BRUNO, Calif. \u2014 In Iran, she was known as Green Nasim, a social media star with followings on YouTube, on Instagram and elsewhere.In the United States, she cast a very different profile, a proponent of vegan diets, animal rights and home exercise who had increasingly become agitated by one of the tech companies that helped give her a platform.\u201cPeople like me are not good for big business, like for animal business, medicine business and for many other businesses. That\u2019s why they are discriminating and censoring us,\u201d she said in a video posted online last year criticizing YouTube. \u201cThis is what they are doing to vegan activists and many other people who try to promote healthy, humane and smart living.\u201dInvestigators on Wednesday were still retracing Ms. Aghdam\u2019s steps. About 11 hours before the shooting, she was found sleeping in her car by the police in Mountain View., Calif., about 30 miles from San Bruno and home to YouTube\u2019s parent company, Google. After checking records on her license, they discovered that her family had reported her missing several days earlier.Ms. Aghdam told the Mountain View officers that she had been having issues with her family, and that she had come to Northern California to find a job. She didn\u2019t appear to the police to be a danger, to herself or others, so they soon let her go.Ms. Aghdam was in her late 30s. In several of her videos, she said she was born in Iran, in the city of Urmia, where most people also speak Turkish, as she does in some of her videos. Ms. Aghdam had YouTube pages in Persian, Turkish and English. She explained that she and her family were members of the Baha\u2019i faith, which faces persecution in Iran, a country with a Muslim majority.Several of her colorful \u2014 and sometimes bizarre \u2014 videos had gone viral in Iran. Her website, which said it was quoting Western news outlets, identified her as \u201cthe first Persian female vegan bodybuilder.\u201d\u201cNow the media will be faced with a new type of Iranian female which does not fit within any of their usual categorizations,\u201d a Twitter user named Katayoon said Wednesday.\u201cThis was shocking and saddening,\u201d one Iranian, Bahare, wrote on Twitter of Ms. Aghdam. \u201cWe laughed so much but now it turns out all those videos were so serious for herself.\u201dMs. Aghdam became especially famous for one clip in which she wears a revealing purple dress, showing cleavage, and begins to slowly strip off her clothes to reveal a pair of fake plastic breasts. \u201cDon\u2019t trust your eyes,\u201d read a caption in English on the clip.After letting her go, the Mountain View police spoke to Ms. Aghdam\u2019s father and brother and let them know she was safe. The police said there was no mention in that conversation of her issues with YouTube.But in a second call, her father said YouTube had recently done something that \u201chad caused her to become upset\u201d and that may have been why she was in the area. Still, the police said, the father did not seem concerned and \u201csimply wanted to let us know that may have been a reason for her to move up here.\u201dLater Tuesday morning, Ms. Aghdam went to a nearby shooting range. Then, just after noon, she parked at a business near YouTube\u2019s offices. She walked into one of YouTube\u2019s parking garages, and then emerged into an outdoor courtyard where employees were eating lunch.Emergency officials arrived at YouTube\u2019s offices two minutes after the police received 911 calls about shots being fired. When they arrived, they found Ms. Aghdam dead. A 9-millimeter semiautomatic handgun, registered in her name, was found at the scene.By Tuesday night, YouTube, as well as Instagram and Facebook, had taken down her pages and videos.Ed Barberini, the chief of the San Bruno Police Department, said: \u201cAt this point in the investigation, it is believed that the suspect was upset at the policies and practices of YouTube. This appears to be the motive for this incident.\u201dOn Wednesday, two of the people who were shot were released from Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital. A third was still in the hospital, but his condition was upgraded to serious from critical.Ms. Aghdam dedicated several of her videos to promoting animal rights, vegan diets and healthy living. In one video, she sat in front of a screen with a rabbit, as she tried to explain in Persian the differences between vegetarianism and veganism. In another, she presented her viewers with a papaya, extolling the benefits of the fruit. \u201cEat it when it turns yellow,\u201d she said, sporting dark sunglasses and a zebra-striped cowboy hat.But Ms. Aghdam\u2019s activism was accompanied by anger at YouTube and frustration with living in the United States.Her personal website and videos posted to YouTube and elsewhere were filled with complaints about YouTube. \u201cWhen searching for my website in google, at top of link they add \u2018an error occurred\u2019 but there is no error!\u201d a website under Ms. Aghdam\u2019s name, NasimeSabz.com, said in February 2016. \u201cThey add it to keep you from my visiting my site.\u201dLife in the United States had not been good, she said in one video from March 30. \u201cThere they kill you by ax,\u201d she said of Iran. \u201cHere they kill you with cotton,\u201d referring to an Iranian expression meaning dying by something that you do not know is dangerous.In another video, she responded to viewers who had begun to wonder if she was mentally ill: \u201cI don\u2019t have any special mental or physical disease, but I live on a planet filled with disease, disorders, perversions and injustices.\u201dThe American dream appeared to be tarnished for her after she began to face hurdles in the United States.\u201cIf you are superficial, you will think it is heaven here, that you can go naked outside and have sex left and right like other animals without any morality,\u201d she said in one video in Persian. \u201cBut if you enter the system, you will see that it is worse than Iran,\u201d she said. \u201cThose who want to inform people against the system and big companies get censored.\u201dOn her channel on Telegram, a social media network extremely popular in Iran, her last post is a childhood picture of herself standing among flowers. It has no caption.Daisuke Wakabayashi reported from San Bruno, Thomas Erdbrink from Tehran, and Matthew Haag from New York.

{"Headline": "Wanted at Chinese Start-Ups: Attractive Women to Ease Coders\u2019 Stress", "Date": "2018-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 China\u2019s vibrant technology scene is searching for people like Shen Yue. Qualifications: Must be attractive, know how to charm socially awkward programmers and give relaxing massages.Ms. Shen is a \u201cprogrammer motivator,\u201d as they are known in China. Part psychologist, part cheerleader, the women are hired to chat up and calm stressed-out coders. The jobs are proliferating in a society that largely adheres to gender stereotypes and believes that male programmers are \u201czhai,\u201d or nerds who have no social lives.\u201cThey really need someone to talk to them from time to time and to organize activities for them to ease some of the pressure,\u201d said Ms. Shen, a 25-year-old who has a degree in civil engineering from a university in Beijing.The country\u2019s laws against gender discrimination are not often enforced. Many companies are direct in their job ads. Males preferred. Only good-looking women need apply. With programmer motivators, it\u2019s more explicit, putting women in subservient positions to men.In tech, men dominate the top ranks. Just one woman sits on the 11-member board of Alibaba, the e-commerce giant. At Baidu, a search company, none of its five board members is a woman. At Tencent, a games and social media conglomerate, there are none. By comparison, Twitter has three women on its nine-person board. At Facebook, two of its nine directors are women.Like many other businesses, China\u2019s tech companies are blunt about gender bias in their job ads. Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent have repeatedly published recruitment ads boasting that there are \u201cbeautiful girls\u201d working for the companies, according to Human Rights Watch, a New York-based rights watchdog.In January, Alibaba said it was seeking a sales manager for Taobao, its e-commerce platform. Women were preferred, ages 28 to 35, \u201cwith a good personal image and class.\u201dIn November, Baidu advertised for a marketing position. Men were preferred \u201cbecause of business travel\u201d and other reasons.Both companies have since removed the references to specific genders in those ads.Alibaba said that the company has clear guidelines on providing equal opportunity regardless of gender and \u201cwill conduct stricter reviews of the recruiting advertisements to ensure compliance with our policy.\u201d It also said that one-third of the 18 founders of Alibaba are women and that female leaders account for one-third of the company\u2019s management positions.Baidu said that 45 percent of the company\u2019s 40,000 employees are female, which is reflected in midlevel and senior positions. \u201cWe value the important work that our female employees do across the organization,\u201d the company said in an emailed statement.In a statement, Tencent said it values diverse backgrounds and apologized for the ads.It is unclear how many companies employ programmer motivators. According to Baidu Baipin, a job search website run by Baidu, just seven companies are currently advertising for these jobs, mostly at smaller start-ups. There used to be more. Alibaba advertised for a programmer motivator with \u201crecognizably good looks\u201d in 2015 but deleted the ad after being criticized by Chinese internet users.Ms. Shen started work at Chainfin.com, a consumer finance company, in October. She declined to disclose her salary, but Zhang Jing, a human resources executive who hired Ms. Shen, said it was around $950 a month.Ms. Shen came to Beijing from the northeastern province of Heilongjiang. She has long black hair and pale skin and wears red eye shadow to the office, where she always has a ready smile for her colleagues. They call her by her nickname, Yueyue, which translates to Joy.At Chainfin.com, the bulk of her work is tending the front desk, organizing social events, ordering snacks for tea breaks and chatting with the programmers. She may call a programmer to a conference room and ask him, \u201cDid you have to work overtime?\u201d before listening to his various frustrations.\u201cI thought it was really novel,\u201d Ms. Shen said, \u201cbecause I had never seen such a job before.\u201dOn a recent Friday, she approached Guo Zhenjie, 28, who has a foldout bed next to his desk. Ms. Shen asked whether his waist was still hurting from the long hours at his desk. He said, yes, he had been working till 10 or 11 for the past few nights.\u201cThe company\u2019s intention is for me to give you a massage, though my technique might not be great,\u201d Ms. Shen told Mr. Guo.Both of them broke out in giggles.Ms. Shen stood over a seated Mr. Guo and started kneading his shoulders.\u201cIt really does feel good,\u201d Mr. Guo said, as Ms. Shen gently whacked his back with a massage clapper device.For some start-ups, having a programmer motivator on staff is one of the many perks to attract male coders, a job that is in high demand in China\u2019s booming tech scene.Feng Zhiyi, 31, who works in research and development at Chainfin.com, said he was envious when photos of female programmer motivators fanning male employees appeared on the internet.\u201cAnd now we have one, too,\u201d Mr. Feng said.Mr. Feng said Ms. Shen had improved the work environment by organizing birthday parties and getting the programmers active with games such as tug of war or sack races.He said he was open to the idea of male programmer motivators but somewhat skeptical. \u201cA man chatting with another man, it\u2019s like going out on a date with a guy,\u201d Mr. Feng said. \u201cA little awkward, isn\u2019t it?\u201dMs. Zhang, the human resources executive who was part of the panel that hired Ms. Shen, stressed that it is important for a programmer motivator to look good.

The way she saw it, it was a mere \u201cdivision of labor.\u201d But, with a smile, she said the company could consider hiring a man to motivate female programmers, too.China\u2019s tech industry is beginning to question such practices. Wang Jie, 40, the chief executive of Shanbay.com, an app that helps people learn English, has been vocal about the \u201cobjectification\u201d of women by other start-ups.He was so disturbed that some tech companies were using \u201cbeautiful women\u201d to draw male programmers to their companies that he wrote a post last October on Zhihu, China\u2019s version of Quora, the question and answer site, saying that Western companies would be sued back home if they posted similar ads.But Mr. Wang has found that attitudes are difficult to change.

{"Headline": "YouTube Says Computers Are Catching Problem Videos", "Date": "2018-04-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The vast majority of videos removed from YouTube toward the end of last year for violating the site\u2019s content guidelines had first been detected by machines instead of humans, the Google-owned company said on Monday.YouTube said it took down 8.28 million videos during the fourth quarter of 2017, and about 80 percent of those videos had initially been flagged by artificially intelligent computer systems.The new data highlighted the significant role machines \u2014 not just users, government agencies and other organizations \u2014 are taking in policing the service as it faces increased scrutiny over the spread of conspiracy videos, fake news and violent content from extremist organizations.Those videos are sometimes promoted by YouTube\u2019s recommendation system and unknowingly financed by advertisers, whose ads are placed next to them through an automated system.This was the first time that YouTube had publicly disclosed the number of videos it removed in a quarter, making it hard to judge how aggressive the platform has previously been in removing content, or the extent to which computers played a part in making those decisions.Figuring out how to remove unwanted videos \u2014 and balancing that with free speech \u2014 is a major challenge for the future of YouTube, said Eileen Donahoe, executive director at Stanford University\u2019s Global Digital Policy Incubator.\u201cIt\u2019s basically free expression on one side and the quality of discourse that\u2019s beneficial to society on the other side,\u201d Ms. Donahoe said. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard problem to solve.\u201dYouTube declined to disclose whether the number of videos it had removed had increased from the previous quarter or what percentage of its total uploads those 8.28 million videos represented. But the company said the takedowns represented \u201ca fraction of a percent\u201d of YouTube\u2019s total views during the quarter.YouTube has contended that the volume of videos uploaded to the site is too big of a challenge to rely only on human monitors.Still, YouTube said three-quarters of all videos flagged by computers had been removed before anyone had a chance to watch them.The company\u2019s machines can detect when a person tries to upload a video that has already been taken down and will prevent that video from reappearing on the site. And in some cases with videos containing nudity or misleading content, YouTube said its computer systems are adept enough to delete the video without requiring a human to review the decision.The company said its machines are also getting better at spotting violent extremist videos, which tend to be harder to identify and have fairly small audiences.At the start of 2017, before YouTube introduced so-called machine-learning technology to help computers identify videos associated with violent extremists, 8 percent of videos flagged and removed for that kind of content had fewer than 10 views. In the first quarter of 2018, the company said, more than half of the videos flagged and removed for violent extremism had fewer than 10 views.Even so, users still play a meaningful role in identifying problematic content. The top three reasons users flagged videos during the quarter involved content they considered sexual, misleading or spam, and hateful or abusive.YouTube said users had raised 30 million flags on roughly 9.3 million videos during the quarter. In total, 1.5 million videos were removed after first being flagged by users.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A.I. Researchers Are Making More Than $1 Million, Even at a Nonprofit", "Date": "2018-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 One of the poorest-kept secrets in Silicon Valley has been the huge salaries and bonuses that experts in artificial intelligence can command. Now, a little-noticed tax filing by a research lab called OpenAI has made some of those eye-popping figures public.OpenAI paid its top researcher, Ilya Sutskever, more than $1.9 million in 2016. It paid another leading researcher, Ian Goodfellow, more than $800,000 \u2014 even though he was not hired until March of that year. Both were recruited from Google.A third big name in the field, the roboticist Pieter Abbeel, made $425,000, though he did not join until June 2016, after taking a leave from his job as a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. Those figures all include signing bonuses.The figures listed on the tax forms, which OpenAI is required to release publicly because it is a nonprofit, provide new insight into what organizations around the world are paying for A.I. talent. But there is a caveat: The compensation at OpenAI may be underselling what these researchers can make, since as a nonprofit it can\u2019t offer stock options.Salaries for top A.I. researchers have skyrocketed because there are not many people who understand the technology and thousands of companies want to work with it. Element AI, an independent lab in Canada, estimates that 22,000 people worldwide have the skills needed to do serious A.I. research \u2014 about double from a year ago.\u201cThere is a mountain of demand and a trickle of supply,\u201d said Chris Nicholson, the chief executive and founder of Skymind, a start-up working on A.I.That raises significant issues for universities and governments. They also need A.I. expertise, both to teach the next generation of researchers and to put these technologies into practice in everything from the military to drug discovery. But they could never match the salaries being paid in the private sector.In 2015, Elon Musk, the chief executive of the electric-car maker Tesla, and other well-known figures in the tech industry created OpenAI and moved it into offices just north of Silicon Valley in San Francisco. They recruited several researchers with experience at Google and Facebook, two of the companies leading an industrywide push into artificial intelligence.In addition to salaries and signing bonuses, the internet giants typically compensate employees with sizable stock options \u2014 something that OpenAI does not do. But it has a recruiting message that appeals to idealists: It will share much of its work with the outside world, and it will consciously avoid creating technology that could be a danger to people.\u201cI turned down offers for multiple times the dollar amount I accepted at OpenAI,\u201d Mr. Sutskever said. \u201cOthers did the same.\u201d He said he expected salaries at OpenAI to increase as the organization pursued its \u201cmission of ensuring powerful A.I. benefits all of humanity.\u201dOpenAI spent about $11 million in its first year, with more than $7 million going to salaries and other employee benefits. It employed 52 people in 2016.At DeepMind, a London A.I. lab now owned by Google, costs for 400 employees totaled $138 million in 2016, according to the company\u2019s annual financial filings in Britain. That translates to $345,000 per employee, including researchers and other staff.Some researchers may command higher pay because their names carry weight across the A.I. community and they can help recruit other researchers.\u201cWhen you hire a star, you are not just hiring a star,\u201d Mr. Nicholson of the start-up Skymind said. \u201cYou are hiring everyone they attract. And you are paying for all the publicity they will attract.\u201dOther researchers at OpenAI, including Greg Brockman, who leads the lab alongside Mr. Sutskever, did not receive such high salaries during the lab\u2019s first year.In 2016, according to the tax forms, Mr. Brockman, who had served as chief technology officer at the financial technology start-up Stripe, made $175,000. As one of the founders of the organization, however, he most likely took a salary below market value. Two other researchers with more experience in the field \u2014 though still very young \u2014 made between $275,000 and $300,000 in salary alone in 2016, according to the forms.Though the pool of available A.I. researchers is growing, it is not growing fast enough. \u201cIf anything, demand for that talent is growing faster than the supply of new researchers, because A.I. is moving from early adopters to wider use,\u201d Mr. Nicholson said.In essence, Mr. Musk was poaching his own talent. Since then, he has stepped down from the OpenAI board, with the lab saying this would allow him to \u201celiminate a potential future conflict.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech Firms Sign \u2018Digital Geneva Accord\u2019 Not to Aid Governments in Cyberwar", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe principles, which have been circulating among senior executives in the tech industry for weeks, also commit the companies to come to the aid of any nation on the receiving end of such attacks, whether the motive for the attack is \u201ccriminal or geopolitical.\u201d Although the list of firms agreeing to the accord is lengthy, several companies have declined to sign on at least for now, including Google, Apple and Amazon.Perhaps as important, none of the signers come from the countries viewed as most responsible for what Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president, called in an interview \u201cthe devastating attacks of the past year.\u201d Those came chiefly from Russia, North Korea, Iran and, to a lesser degree, China.The impetus for the effort came largely from Mr. Smith, who has been arguing for several years that the world needs a \u201cdigital Geneva Convention\u201d that sets norms of behavior for cyberspace just as the Geneva Conventions set rules for the conduct of war in the physical world. Although there was some progress in setting basic norms of behavior in cyberspace through a United Nations-organized group of experts several years ago, the movement has since faltered.Mr. Smith said over the weekend that the first move needed to come from the American companies that often find themselves acting as the \u201cfirst responders\u201d when cyberattacks hit their customers. \u201cThis has become a much bigger problem, and I think what we have learned in the past few years is that we need to work together in much bigger ways,\u201d Mr. Smith said in an interview. \u201cWe need to approach this in a principled way, and if we expect to get governments to do that, we have to start with some principles ourselves.\u201dYet not all governments are likely to embrace the \u201cCybersecurity Tech Accord\u201d in part because the principles it espouses can run headlong into their own, usually secret efforts to develop cyberweapons.Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor who leaked documents about surveillance programs, revealed pictures suggesting that American officials intercepted some hardware that came out of Cisco Systems, a major manufacturer of the routers and switches that make up the spine of the internet, apparently so the equipment directed traffic back to American intelligence agencies. There is no evidence that Cisco cooperated, but the publication of the photos led some foreign customers to believe that American equipment had been broadly compromised by the N.S.A.Cisco is one of the firms that has signed the accord. Mark Chandler, Cisco\u2019s general counsel, said the company believed that \u201cwe need to say we will not be part of any effort that will undermine the security of the web, or undermine those who depend on it \u2014 our customers.\u201d Among the other signatories were Dell, Juniper Networks, the two parts of the recently-split Hewlett-Packard, Symantec and FireEye. Two foreign firms, Telephonica of Spain and Nokia of Finland, also signed. There are no Chinese or Russian companies on the list of initial signatories.The new technology accord vows that the 31 signers \u201cwill protect against tampering with and exploitation of technology products and services during their development, design, distribution and use.\u201d Among the companies that signed are Oracle, Symantec, FireEye and HP, along with the Finnish company Nokia and the Spanish company Telef\u00f3nica.The cybersecurity coordinator at the White House, Rob Joyce, is widely rumored to be considering leaving his post and returning to the National Security Agency, where he ran the most elite of the cyberforces that attack foreign networks. If Mr. Joyce departs, the White House will have lost its two most senior, and most knowledgeable, cybersecurity policymakers in the span of a few weeks.An earlier version of this story incorrectly referred to the name of one of the signatories on the technology accord.

{"Headline": "Looming China Trade Action Divides Industry and Roils Markets", "Date": "2018-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s promise to take tough action against China\u2019s unfair economic practices was one of his most popular campaign ideas. But as the United States prepares stiff trade measures and China retaliates, stock markets have plummeted and some of America\u2019s biggest companies are pushing back.Industry giants like General Electric and Goldman Sachs, as well as agricultural companies, have lodged objections with the White House, saying that tariffs on both sides of the Pacific and limitations on investments will cut off American companies from the world\u2019s most lucrative and rapidly growing market.Since then, the White House has announced another trade measure targeted at China that would place tariffs on at least $50 billion worth of products imported to the United States and would restrict investment flows between the two economic giants. This week, the Trump administration is expected to announce a list of Chinese imports subject to tariffs, which could include high-tech products like semiconductors as well as cheap electronics and other goods that many Americans buy.Josh Kallmer, the senior vice president for global policy at the Information Technology Industry Council, an advocate for companies like Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and IBM, said his group had been largely supportive of the administration\u2019s targeting of China\u2019s unfair trade practices. But the group had made it clear to the White House that it would not be pleased with any measure that had tariffs \u201cas the primary or even a significant remedy.\u201d\u201cThe reason is that it would be a tax on consumers,\u201d Mr. Kallmer said, \u201cprecisely the people we are trying to support.\u201dThat theory could make it more difficult for American companies to operate in a country that already puts up steep barriers.As Mr. Trump advances a series of tough trade measures to confront these behaviors, however, cracks have appeared in American industry\u2019s seemingly united front.Companies in technology, investment and other industries now say that the measures the administration is taking to help them may actually end up doing irreparable harm to supply chains they have built up over decades. Any American company that wants to be a global player cannot afford to lose access to China\u2019s growing market, executives say.The 25 percent tariff on pork that China imposed on Monday is expected to be particularly harmful, including in regions that supported the president, like Iowa, North Carolina and Indiana. Last year, American farmers sent more than a billion dollars\u2019 worth of pork to China, their largest export market by value after Japan and Mexico.\u201cBecause we\u2019re so blessed to have America feed the world, we\u2019re also the first industry to get slammed whenever there are trade difficulties between the U.S. and other countries,\u201d Denise Bode, the coordinator for the American Fruit and Vegetable Processors and Growers Coalition.\u201cAmerican farmers appear to be the first casualties of an escalating trade war,\u201d said Max Baucus, a former Democratic senator from Montana and a chairman of a group called Farmers for Free Trade. \u201cWith farm incomes already declining, farmers rely on export markets to stay above water. These new tariffs are a drag on their ability to make ends meet.\u201dHowever, analysts and companies involved in China said that these measures appeared unlikely to adequately resolve American concerns about China\u2019s longstanding encroachment on American intellectual property.Companies are waiting anxiously for the administration to release a list of Chinese products this week that will be subject to tariffs \u2014 most likely the kind of high-tech products that the administration has accused China of targeting. The retail industry, which lobbied the administration and Congress against an early plan to impose tariffs on Chinese-made apparel and footwear, is now cautiously optimistic that its products will be exempt.G.E. and IBM, which operate through joint ventures and other partnerships in China and around the world, have both lobbied against the expansion of Cfius over concerns that restrictions on joint ventures with foreign companies that include the transfer of valuable skills or technology could weaken the position of American companies abroad.Financial firms, including Goldman Sachs and the Carlyle Group, have also expressed concern about investment restrictions, saying they could provide a drag on the United States economy.White House advisers, in turn, have complained that previous approaches to dealing with China have not worked, and that companies are overreacting to legitimate trade measures.Speaking Monday on CNBC, the White House trade adviser, Peter Navarro, defended the administration\u2019s tough actions on China and said investors should not fear a trade war.\u201cEverybody needs to relax,\u201d Mr. Navarro said. \u201cThe economy is as strong as an ox.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sleeping in Car and Visiting Gun Range: How YouTube Attacker Spent Final Hours", "Date": "2018-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u25a0 Ms. Aghdam, who was in her late 30s and had lived in Southern California, often discussed Persian culture, veganism and animal cruelty; performed music parodies; and gave exercise tutorials on YouTube and on her personal website.The police in Mountain View, Calif., about 30 miles south of San Bruno, said they had found Ms. Aghdam sleeping in a car near a shopping center around 1:40 a.m. on Tuesday. The car was parked a few miles from the headquarters of Google, YouTube\u2019s parent company.The officers soon discovered that the vehicle was connected to a person who had been reported missing on March 31 in San Diego County, the Mountain View police said on Wednesday.Ms. Aghdam told Mountain View officers that she was not a danger to herself or to others and that she had traveled to the San Francisco area to look for a job, the police said. She was interviewed for about 20 minutes, the police said.\u201cAt no point during our roughly 20-minute interaction with her did she mention anything about YouTube, if she was upset with them, or that she had planned to harm herself or others,\u201d the Mountain View police said in a statement posted on the department\u2019s website. \u201cThroughout our entire interaction with her, she was calm and cooperative.\u201dAfter the conversation ended, the officers called Ms. Aghdam\u2019s family to say she had been located, the police said. The family did not mention anything about YouTube at the time, the police said. But her father and brother called back about an hour later and told the police she had made a series of videos about veganism that she had posted on YouTube.\u201cAt no point did her father or brother mention anything about potential acts of violence or a possibility of Aghdam lashing out as a result of her issues with her videos,\u201d the police said in the statement.Chief Barberini declined to comment on local reports that Ms. Aghdam\u2019s family had warned the police in Mountain View that she was headed toward YouTube\u2019s offices. But he said that it received no information in advance of the shooting.During the attack, Ms. Aghdam fired \u201cmultiple shots\u201d from a Smith & Wesson 9-millimeter, semiautomatic handgun, Ed Barberini, chief of the San Bruno police department, said on Wednesday. The gun, which was registered to her, was recovered at the scene.There is no evidence linking Ms. Aghdam to any of the shooting victims, Chief Barberini said. Investigators were searching two homes in Southern California associated with the suspect.On Tuesday morning, before driving to the YouTube offices, Ms. Aghdam visited a local gun range, the police said.Ms. Aghdam parked her car at a business near YouTube. She entered one of the company\u2019s parking garages, and then walked into an outdoor courtyard where employees were eating lunch. The chief said that investigators were still trying to determine what level of security there was in the area leading to the courtyard. Zach Vorhies, a YouTube engineer, said on Tuesday that the dining area was accessible from an adjacent parking structure without an employee badge.\u201cAt this point in the investigation, it is believed that the suspect was upset at the policies and practices of YouTube. This appears to be the motive for this incident,\u201d Mr. Barberini said.The chief said his department had worked with YouTube to develop security measures for the campus, including what to do in the case of an armed attacker.The three shooting victims were taken to Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital. Two women, a 32-year-old who was admitted in serious condition and a 27-year-old who was admitted in fair condition, were released late on Tuesday, a hospital spokesman said.The third shooting victim, a 36-year-old man, had improved from critical to serious condition and remained in the hospital.On Wednesday morning, the area around YouTube\u2019s office in San Bruno, a suburban community of 41,000 people that stretches into the hills above Silicon Valley, was quiet. Police officers, security guards, news reporters and a handful of employees milled around outside the building.Police had cordoned off the street in front of the offices, but company security guards were allowing small groups of employees into the building from a lower-level entrance.A few workers in hard hats and florescent yellow vests from a company called Restoration Management Company \u2014 a firm that specializes in services cleaning up \u201ctrauma scenes,\u201d according to its website \u2014 carried plastic bags of debris out of the building.YouTube employees on Wednesday appeared to spend no more than 10 minutes inside before exiting the building. A few employees, who asked not to be identified because they had been told not to speak to the news media, said they were picking up items left behind after they fled the building during the attack. Some said they were there to pick up their cars \u2014 a few people drove vehicles out of a closed parking garage that police said Ms. Aghdam used to enter the YouTube facility on Tuesday.But in other buildings in the YouTube complex, it appeared to be a regular work day. At a YouTube office across the street from the main headquarters, employees ate lunch in a fenced off courtyard.Ms. Aghdam had YouTube pages in Persian, Turkish and English. In several of her videos she stated that she had been born in Iran, in the city of Urmia, near the border with Turkey. She explained in videos that she and her family are members of the Baha\u2019i faith, a persecuted minority in majority Muslim Iran.It was perhaps her inability to easily fit a stereotype that drew her to so many in Iran, where she had tens of thousands of followers on social media. Several of her colorful \u2014 and sometimes bizarre \u2014 videos had gone viral.Life in the United States had not been good, she said in one video posted last week. \u201cThere they kill you by ax,\u201d she said of Iran. \u201cHere they kill you with cotton\u201d \u2014 an Iranian expression meaning to die by something that you do not know is dangerous.In another video, she responded to viewers who had begun to wonder if she was mentally ill: \u201cI don\u2019t have any special mental or physical disease, but I live on a planet filled with disease, disorders, perversions and injustices.\u201d\u201cWhen searching for my website in google, at top of link they add \u2018an error occurred\u2019 but there is no error!\u201d a website under her name, NasimeSabz.com, said in February 2016. \u201cThey add it to keep you from my visiting my site.\u201dMs. Aghdam\u2019s personal website included graphic photos of slaughtered animals and pleas not to wear fur jackets or have sex outside of marriage. More recently, she focused on what she perceived as discrimination by YouTube and Google. Ms. Aghdam had YouTube pages in Persian, Turkish and English.In February 2017, she criticized YouTube in a video on Facebook for restricting one of her workout videos to older audiences. \u201cThis is what they are doing to vegan activists and many other people who try to promote healthy, humane and smart living \u2014 people like me are not good for big business, like for animal business, medicine business and for many other businesses. That\u2019s why they are discriminating and censoring us,\u201d she said in the video.By Tuesday night, YouTube, Instagram and Facebook had all taken down her pages and videos. Ed Barberini, San Bruno\u2019s police chief, said on Wednesday that investigators were aware of Ms. Aghdam\u2019s criticism of YouTube and Google.\u201cWe are learning that Ms. Aghdam had a problem with the policies or practices that YouTube had employed,\u201d Chief Barberini said in an interview on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d \u201cObviously, she was upset.\u201dActive shooting incidents in the United States are increasingly common, but shootings by women are quite rare.A 2014 F.B.I. study of 160 active shooting incidents found that at least six involved a woman. Women were involved in three other incidents from 2014 to 2016, according to the bureau. The bureau defined such incidents as \u201can individual engaging in killing or attempting to kill people in a confined and populated area,\u201d and distinguished the events from murders or mass killings.Mass shootings are often regarded as incidents where at least four people are killed.In 2010, a woman who had been fired from her job at a Publix Supermarket in Florida returned to the store with a gun. In another instance the same year, a woman shot at co-workers after she had been suspended from her position at Kraft Foods in Philadelphia. Both women had handguns.Although Ms. Aghdam appeared to have a long-running grudge against YouTube, the police said that it did not appear that she knew any of the three shooting victims.An earlier version of this article misquoted a comment made by Nasim Najafi Aghdam in one of her YouTube videos.

{"Headline": "A Big Reason Wall Street Is Flocking to Spotify: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Good Tuesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Spotify\u2019s shares opened at $165.90.\u2022 If the markets fall again, we have some possible explanations.\u2022 Should Facebook offer \u201cWhy Me?\u201d buttons?\u2022 Disney has offered to buy Sky News to help Fox\u2019s Sky bid.Spotify is a loss-making company that might not report a profit until next decade, but that didn\u2019t stop investors from valuing the company at $30 billion when it debuted Tuesday on the United States stock market.Spotify is an impressive company. Its loyal, paying customer base is enormous and is expected to keep growing. Also, Spotify has so far held its own in the face of competition from Apple, Amazon and Google, all of which want to win new subscribers to their music streaming services.But there is an important reason that Wall Street is flocking to Spotify: It is doing a great job at getting record companies to roll over.Spotify\u2019s main cost is what it pays record companies for the music it streams to its customers. As Spotify has grown, that expense has fallen as a share of its total revenue, which shows that Spotify is negotiating increasingly advantageous deals with record companies.That has bolstered Spotify\u2019s gross profit margin, which measures how much money a company keeps after paying out the costs directly related to generating its revenue. Last year, that margin was 21 percent of revenue at Spotify, well up from 14 percent in 2016.Crucially, though, Spotify has said it expects its gross margin to expand to as much as 35 percent over the longer term. In other words, as Spotify\u2019s spending on music grows, so will its leverage over record companies. And it may well achieve its gross margin target. After all, Netflix, which occupies a similar position in the market for streaming video, has a gross margin of 35 percent.But Spotify\u2019s main rivals could complicate things. What if Amazon offered record companies better terms than Spotify? That would reduce Spotify\u2019s bargaining power, making it harder to deliver wider gross margins investors are expecting. And Amazon, along with Apple and Google, has far deeper pockets to slog it out over the long term.\u2014 Peter EavisSpotify\u2019s unusual path to the public markets was a success.On its first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the music streaming service finished with a valuation of $26.5 billion.Spotify\u2019s shares opened at $165.90 before closing at $149.01.That\u2019s well above the high of $132.50 that its shares changed hands at in private transactions this year. It\u2019s also well above the $137.50 the WSJ reported its private shares were trading at during the past week.Spotify had eschewed a typical initial public offering in favor of a direct listing. That meant there was no \u201cdeal price\u201d for investors to reference on the first day of trading and no underwriters acting as stabilizing agents if the stock began to plunge.Despite all that, Spotify\u2019s valuation at the close on Tuesday ranks among the highest for a tech company debuting on an American exchange.Here\u2019s a look at the tech companies with the 10 biggest market capitalizations after their first day of trading, courtesy of Dealogic:Alibaba \u2014 $233.9 billionFacebook \u2014 $81.7 billionPalm \u2014 $53.3 billionInfineon Technologies \u2014 $47.9 billionJD.com \u2014 $28.9 billionSnap \u2014 $28.9 billionGoogle \u2014 $27.2 billionSpotify \u2014 $26.5 billionTwitter \u2014 $24.9 billionAgilent \u2014 $20.1 billionTesla said:\u2022 It built 2,020 Model 3s in the past seven days. That fell short of its goal of 2,500 by the end of the quarter.\u2022 Tesla produced 9,766 Model 3s during the quarter.\u2022 In total, Tesla produced 35,000 cars in the first quarter.\u2022 It has delivered 8,800 Model 3s during the first quarter, below the 8,800 analysts expected according to Bloomberg.\u2022 In all, Tesla delivered a record 29,980 vehicles during the quarter.\u2022 The company said it expects Model 3 weekly production to reach 5,000 by the end of the second quarter.\u2022 The combined deliveries of the Model X and Model S came to 21,800 cars, the lowest total in several quarters.ContextTesla\u2019s stock and bond prices have plunged amid concerns about how much cash the company is using as it struggles to speed up assembly and sales of the Model 3. With a starting price of $35,000, the car is supposed to be more affordable than Tesla\u2019s other cars. The company has been counting on a quick expansion of its Model 3 business to increase revenue.The president reiterated his claim that Amazon is \u201ccosting the United States Postal Service massive amounts of money\u201d in a post to Twitter on Tuesday morning.Shares are essentially flat on the day.\u201cPackage delivery has been a bright spot for a service that\u2019s lost money for 11 straight years. The losses are mostly due to pension and health care costs \u2014 not the business deal for the Postal Service to deliver packages for Amazon. Boosted by e-commerce, the Postal Service has enjoyed double-digit increases in revenue from delivering packages, but that hasn\u2019t been enough to offset declines in first-class letters and marketing mail, which together make up more than two-thirds of postal revenue.\u201cWhile the Postal Service\u2019s losses can\u2019t be attributed to its package business, Trump\u2019s claim that it could get more bang for its buck may not be entirely far-fetched. A 2017 analysis by Citigroup concluded that the Postal Service was charging below-market rates as a whole for parcels. The post office does not use taxpayer money for its operations.\u201dCould Mr. Tump\u2019s criticism lead to action against Amazon?\u201cNothing can be certain, except death and taxes \u2026 and more Trump tweets on Amazon. We believe sales tax collection changes would have limited impact on consumer use of Amazon and could actually help Amazon\u2019s relative competitive positioning in domestic e-commerce.\u201dMore from Andrew:The \u201cWhy Me?\u201d button might create all sorts of problems for Facebook, and its advertisers, too. It would allow users \u2014 and rivals \u2014 to reverse engineer much of the way the system works. And advertisers would probably object to the idea of making their targeting plans public. But that would be the cost of using such large public platforms with such exact targeting.The bottom line: Disney wants Fox to have full control of Sky to support its $52.4 billion deal to buy most of Fox, and it wants to get ahead of Comcast\u2019s rival effort to buy that 39 percent of the British broadcaster.An earlier version of this article misstated the status of a Department of Defense contract for cloud computing services.

{"Headline": "Why Silicon Valley Shouldn\u2019t Work With the Pentagon", "Date": "2018-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMr. Malcomson is the author of \u201cSplinternet: How Geopolitics and Commerce Are Fragmenting the World Wide Web.\u201dIs Silicon Valley going to war? In 2013, Amazon beat IBM for a contract to host the United States intelligence community\u2019s data cloud. Microsoft now markets Azure Government Secret, its cloud-computing service designed specifically for federal and local governments, to the Defense Department and intelligence agencies. And last year, Google signed a contract with the Pentagon for Project Maven, a pilot program to accelerate the military\u2019s use of artificial intelligence.These partnerships might ease anxiety in the Defense Department about China\u2019s artificial-intelligence advances and ominous, state-led fusion of civil and military technology development. But a comparable fusion of the United States government and Silicon Valley would be a mistake.Narrowing the focus of the United States tech sector to the needs of the military would serve neither party. On the contrary, it would make the nation weaker.To be sure, defense contracts are hardly new in Silicon Valley, and Google\u2019s recent moves might be seen as heralding Silicon Valley\u2019s return to its natural home in defense contracting. But that would be to misunderstand both Silicon Valley history and today\u2019s technology.The internet and much of digital computing did indeed emerge from decades of United States defense contracts, beginning as long ago as World War I. Yet the Pentagon itself sloughed off the internet \u2014 not knowing quite what to do with it, and rightly judging it to be insecure \u2014 to the National Science Foundation. When the internet became a commercial concern, the National Science Foundation off-loaded it to the Department of Commerce. Government might have given birth to the internet, but it sure didn\u2019t raise it.The emergence of a civilian, entrepreneurial tech culture in the 1970s owed as much intellectually, if not (at first) financially, to the antiwar movement and the 1960s counterculture \u2014 hardly friends of the military-industrial complex. Out of this the dominant, highly creative ethos of geek antiauthoritarianism grew. It is hard to believe that closer ties with the military would perpetuate this culture of innovation.The technology involved in projects like Azure Government Secret and Project Maven is also very different from the data-sharing projects of the 1960s. Those older technologies would not have been created in the absence of government funding. Today\u2019s projects, in contrast, are all basically A.I. plays. Very little of this is defense-specific, but all of it is useful for defense and espionage. Unlike, say, weapons development, A.I. research is inherently dual-use. United States tech giants would be pursuing it with or without government contracts. Silicon Valley does not need the Pentagon to initiate these endeavors.The Pentagon is in a different position. It came around very reluctantly to the idea that it is dependent on private industry for the defense of the country and the projection of American power. But come around it has, in no small part thanks to China.The United States military seems to have been spooked. In a 2017 memo, the deputy secretary of defense, Robert O. Work, wrote that while the Defense Department had made \u201ctentative steps\u201d in A.I., \u201cwe need to do much more, and move much faster.\u201d The memo announced the formation of Project Maven to do just that. This month, Gen. Stephen Wilson, the vice chief of staff for the Air Force, said that China is taking a \u201cwhole of nation\u201d approach to A.I. and the United States should, too.Yet we shouldn\u2019t forget that civil-military antagonism and the deep American tradition of distrusting the state have been crucial to the United States\u2019 ability to innovate. There are good reasons why defense-tech giants of the 1960s, \u201970s and \u201980s like Raytheon and Grumman missed out on such major tech advances as Web protocols, the smartphone, personal computers and various types of encryption \u2014 all of which would eventually have great military significance. The biggest reason was that none of these advances were directed at waging war; indeed, many aimed at transcending the power of the state.After the Cold War, the Soviet Union\u2019s extraordinary technological capacity dissipated in large part because it had been so reactive: The Soviets had let their adversary determine the pace and scope of their own innovation. The United States should not make that mistake.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s Deal for Shazam Is Delayed in Europe Over Data Concerns", "Date": "2018-04-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 If data is the most valuable currency of the digital economy, at what point does a company have so much that it becomes unfair?That\u2019s a question antitrust experts are increasingly asking themselves as the world\u2019s biggest technology companies harvest more and more information about people and businesses. On Monday, European regulators pushed the idea forward, announcing an investigation into Apple\u2019s proposed acquisition of the song-identification app Shazam over concerns the iPhone maker would get access to data on competitors like Spotify.Ms. Vestager has said that with free services, customers pay with their data, and are not always getting a fair deal. This broader interpretation of antitrust law would have important consequences for future acquisitions made by companies such as Amazon, Facebook and Google.\u201cCompeting music streaming services could be put at a competitive disadvantage,\u201d the commission said. It added that it wanted to prevent Apple from blocking Shazam from referring users to other music services.The European Commission has until Sept. 4 to make a final decision on whether to block or approve the deal, or seek concessions from Apple.Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Ms. Vestager\u2019s office has also fined a number of other tech giants, including Amazon, Facebook, Google and Qualcomm. And a new data protection law taking effect next month is expected to bring even more scrutiny.Antitrust cases based on data will become more common as companies use customer information as a moat against competitors, according to Maurice Stucke, a law professor at the University of Tennessee, who has written in favor of broader enforcement of antitrust rules. He cited a potentially influential German investigation of Facebook over the use of data.The European inquiries are likely to influence governments elsewhere in the world, Mr. Stucke said. Governments, wary of the technology industry\u2019s power over the global economy, will develop rules to account for concerns that data can be used to build monopoly positions, even when companies buy businesses that wouldn\u2019t initially seem to be consequential, he said.\u201cYou\u2019re seeing significant changes over the last three to four years on data, privacy and competition policy,\u201d Mr. Stucke said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sea change.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Volkswagen Set to Oust Matthias M\u00fcller as C.E.O. After Diesel Scandal", "Date": "2018-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Volkswagen is set to oust its chief executive, Matthias M\u00fcller, as it grapples with a diesel emissions scandal that has cost it billions of dollars, led to the imprisonment of two executives, and scarred the German carmaker\u2019s reputation.Herbert Diess, who is in charge of the company\u2019s flagship Volkswagen brand, was likely to succeed Mr. M\u00fcller, according to two people with knowledge of the internal discussions. The company said earlier on Tuesday that it was considering a leadership change, and a final decision was expected by the end of the week.While there was no obvious trigger for Mr. M\u00fcller\u2019s departure at this moment, his efforts to lead the company beyond the 2015 emissions cheating scandal have stalled.The repercussions have continued to multiply, tainting not only Volkswagen but also its rivals BMW and Daimler just as they grapple with an industrywide shift toward electric and self-driving vehicles. Political leaders are pressing the German carmakers to compensate diesel owners who bought cars that turned out to be dirtier than advertised, which could add to the already astronomical cost of the scandal.In September 2015, Volkswagen was accused of evading emissions standards in the U.S. The scandal has hit the company hard.\u201cThis is a chance for Volkswagen to make a change,\u201d said Christian Strenger, the former chief executive of Deutsche Bank\u2019s wealth management division, who is suing Volkswagen because he said it violated its duty to shareholders by failing to be forthcoming about the emissions scandal. But Mr. Strenger said that Mr. Diess would have to \u201chave the guts to clean things up.\u201dVolkswagen is still the target of a wide-ranging criminal investigation that has included searches of Mr. M\u00fcller\u2019s offices. However, there has been no new information that would have prompted Mr. M\u00fcller to leave now, said Klaus Ziehe, a spokesman for the prosecutors in Braunschweig who are conducting the inquiry.German prosecutors have not charged anyone in the Volkswagen case, but they expect to complete their investigation this year. Two former Volkswagen executives, James Liang and Oliver Schmidt, are serving prison sentences in the United States after pleading guilty to charges including conspiracy to violate the Clean Air Act.Mr. M\u00fcller was a high-ranking executive involved in product development at the same time that the company was developing the illegal software and deploying it in vehicles. He also worked closely with some of the people under investigation over possible involvement in the emissions scandal. Mr. M\u00fcller has insisted he was ignorant of any wrongdoing, but he has nonetheless faced the accusation that he was part of a system that allowed it to take place.Mr. Diess has a shorter history at Volkswagen than most other members of the management board, but he would nonetheless satisfy the company\u2019s longtime preference for choosing chief executives from within its own ranks. He joined Volkswagen in July 2015 from BMW, where he had been a member of the management board in charge of product development. He has succeeded in improving the profitability of the division that makes Volkswagen brand cars like the Golf, Jetta and Passat. The division accounts for most of the cars that Volkswagen sells but is far less profitable than the company\u2019s Audi and Porsche luxury brands.Mr. Diess, who managed factories in Britain for BMW, is much more comfortable speaking English than Mr. M\u00fcller and will have an easier time communicating with investors and media outside Germany. Mr. Diess has also not spent his career steeped in Volkswagen culture and may be in a better position to change it.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.But he will most likely face resistance from entrenched interests within the company. He has already clashed with Volkswagen\u2019s powerful workers council, which has de facto veto power over major decisions.And Mr. Diess must answer to Hans Dieter P\u00f6tsch, the chairman of the supervisory board and former chief financial officer of Volkswagen. Mr. P\u00f6tsch is a confidant of the Porsche family, which via a holding company owns more than half of Volkswagen\u2019s shares. The family, descendants of the man who created the Volkswagen Beetle for Adolf Hitler, has been criticized by shareholders for failing to appoint more independent members of the supervisory board and resisting more sweeping change.The challenges that Mr. Diess faces are considerable. Even now, the diesel scandal continues to corrode Volkswagen\u2019s reputation.In January, The New York Times reported that the company had helped to finance experiments in which monkeys were forced to breathe diesel fumes at a lab in Albuquerque. The exposure of the research caused a furor in Germany and beyond. Chancellor Angela Merkel condemned the experiments, the German Parliament debated possible consequences, and animal rights activists demonstrated outside Volkswagen\u2019s headquarters in Wolfsburg.Volkswagen\u2019s cheating has also had an effect on the wider industry. Diesel was once the most popular engine option in Europe because of its fuel economy. But diesel vehicle sales have been dropping since Volkswagen\u2019s deception was uncovered.Volkswagen\u2019s stock price closed the day 3.1 percent higher, at 169 euros, or about $208, on the news of Mr. M\u00fcller\u2019s upcoming departure.Amie Tsang contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Investment Boom From Trump\u2019s Tax Cut Has Yet to Appear", "Date": "2018-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter years of costly layoffs and plant closings, things are looking up for the heavy-machinery giant Caterpillar, which forecasts solid global sales growth and increased demand this year. Yet despite the corporate investment incentives at the center of President Trump\u2019s tax overhaul, the company\u2019s executives have no plans to supercharge investment or expansion.Caterpillar\u2019s plans for new investment remain low by historical standards. Instead, the company has started using cash to repurchase its own stock as a way to return cash to shareholders, something it hadn\u2019t done since 2015.\u201cWe feel we have the necessary bricks-and-mortar capacity that we need,\u201d Brad Halverson, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, said in a post-earnings conference call last Tuesday.Republicans sold the 2017 tax law as \u201crocket fuel\u201d for American investment and growth, saying that corporations \u2014 flush with cash from lower tax rates \u2014 would channel money back into the economy by building factories and offices and investing in equipment, which would help companies grow and provide winnings for workers.Economists say that may happen as companies readjust their spending plans over the coming months to take advantage of the new law, and they note that it is too early to tell how much the tax law will spread into the broader economy.But, so far, hard evidence of such an acceleration has yet to appear in economic data, which show more of a steady investment roll than a rapid escalation. And while there are pockets of the economy where investment is picking up \u2014 among large tech companies and in shale oil business, for example \u2014 corporate spending on buying back stock is increasing at a far faster clip, prompting a debate about whether the law is returning money to the overall economy or just rewarding a small segment of investors.Data on the gross domestic product, released Friday, showed that business investment grew at a 6.1 percent annual clip during the first three months of 2018, down from 7.2 percent during the first quarter last year. Excluding oil and gas investment, which is particularly volatile, the investment pace grew slightly over the past year.While the first-quarter investment numbers were more robust than they were in 2015 and 2016 \u2014 when a bust in oil prices curtailed a large chunk of American corporate spending \u2014 they weren\u2019t radically different from the roughly 5 percent rate of growth for business investment that has prevailed since 2010.Representative Erik Paulsen, a Minnesota Republican who chairs the Congressional Joint Economic Committee, attributed the G.D.P. growth to the tax cuts. \u201cAmericans are better off today than they were 16 months ago,\u201d he said in a statement on Friday. \u201cBusiness investment is strong, wages are growing, and disposable income is climbing thanks to tax reform and pro-growth policies.\u201dAnalysts were more cautious in drawing conclusions.\u201cEven regardless of the tax plan kicker, we would have seen a pickup in business investment,\u201d said Keith Parker, head of United States equity strategy at UBS. Capital spending, he said, \u201ctypically follows profits with a lag.\u201dScott Greenberg, a tax analyst at the conservative Tax Foundation, warned that it was \u201calways difficult to identify an economic trend from just one quarter\u2019s data.\u201dSenator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, told The Economist in remarks published last week that after the tax cuts passed, corporations \u201cbought back shares, a few gave out bonuses; there\u2019s no evidence whatsoever that the money\u2019s been massively poured back into the American worker.\u201d A spokeswoman said Monday that Mr. Rubio\u2019s criticism was that the law could have done more to help working families while also stimulating corporate investment.While overall business investment in the American economy was up 6.1 percent in the first quarter, business spending by the larger corporations included in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index \u2014 as measured by their announcements of capital expenditures so far this earnings season \u2014 is up 23.5 percent from the first quarter of 2017, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. That would be the fastest pace since 2012.Large tech companies are among some of the biggest spenders. Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, nearly tripled its first-quarter capital spending to $7.3 billion on real estate and computing capacity and data centers. Amazon increased investment by more than 40 percent to more than $3 billion as it builds out its network of fulfillment centers.But with roughly a quarter of the companies in the S.&P. 500 having reported first-quarter results, their spending on buybacks is even higher, up 43 percent from the first quarter of 2017, to $43 billion, according to data from Howard Silverblatt, an analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.Traditionally when companies have more cash than they think they can invest productively, they return it to shareholders either by paying them cash dividends or by going into the market and repurchasing shares. Those buybacks tend to push the price of a stock up, making shareholders wealthier, at least on paper.Republicans, and some Democratic economists, say this can help the economy, if those shareholders sell their stock and then use their profits to make other investments. But critics argue that buybacks disproportionately benefit the wealthy \u2014 the richest 10 percent of Americans own 84 percent of all stock \u2014 and executives who are often compensated with shares.Boeing said it had bought back $3 billion worth of its stock in the first quarter. (It expects to buy $15 billion over the next two years.) Facebook expanded its plans to buy back its shares to the tune of $9 billion. the appliance maker Whirlpool said it would sell its Brazilian refrigerator compressor business for roughly $1 billion, and then use that money to buy its own shares. The railroad operator CSX said it had bought back more than $800 million in shares in the first quarter, as part of plans to buy $5 billion in shares by the first quarter of next year.As they anticipated a windfall from tax cuts, the nation\u2019s banks increased their pace of buybacks by more than 50 percent last year, to $77.5 billion from $51 billion in 2016, according to data compiled by S&P Global Market Intelligence. The 10 largest banks, led by JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup, accounted for 70 percent of those buybacks.Republicans have highlighted the buybacks as a boost for the economy, saying they will put money in the hands of investors who will find productive and widespread ways to use it. Many Democrats say those buybacks undermine Republican claims about the tax law and prove the overhaul will reward only corporations and the wealthy.\u201cThe whole theory was to lavish corporations and the already wealthy with tax cuts, and maybe the benefits will trickle down to everyone else,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, said in a floor speech in April. \u201cWe\u2019re already seeing the balloon burst on that idea, as corporations dedicate an enormous percentage of the tax savings to stock buybacks, and only a sliver to worker compensation.\u201dA recent surge in oil and gas investment is largely a result of the recovery in oil and gas prices and easing of regulations over the last year, rather than incentives put in place by the tax overhaul. Economists believe those incentives \u2014 such as allowing companies to immediately and fully deduct the cost of capital spending in order to lower their taxes \u2014 could help stimulate investment for companies.Verizon, in its quarterly earnings report last week, said it had increased capital expenditures to $4.6 billion in the first quarter, up $1.5 billion from the same period in 2017. But the company plans to stick to its target of spending at most $17.8 billion on investment this year \u2014 a level that has not budged much for the past four years.\u201cI don\u2019t see us having a massive acceleration in capex,\u201d Verizon\u2019s chief financial officer, Matt Ellis, told analysts on its post-earnings conference call.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Do Athletes\u2019 Brains Control Their Movements?", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "Book ExcerptA pair of neuroscientists are working with Major League Baseball to help measure the mental aspects of a batter\u2019s swing.Supported byThere was no indication that anything unusual was taking place on an early Saturday morning in August at the Hilton Garden Inn, of Avondale, Ariz., other than the piece of loose-leaf paper taped to the wall by the elevator bank. On it was scribbled in black Sharpie: DECERVO TESTING ROOM 307. The room number was underlined. The tone was \u201cno trespassing.\u201d Still, the housekeeper knocked on the door of Room 307 at 8:15 with an armful of fresh towels.No one answered, so she used her key to enter. When she did, she did a double take. The furniture in the dumbbell-shaped suite had been rearranged completely. The beds were still made and the blinds were drawn. Two scrawny, acne-pocked Latino teenagers in T-shirts and sandals were seated at matching desks on opposite sides of the room staring unblinking at laptop screens. Both wore a sort of thin metallic hairnet, with wires snaking down the back of their necks. A pile of plastic syringes and two padded briefcases lay scattered on the floor. The only sound came from soft, intermittent taps on the laptop keyboards. Neither of the teenagers looked up to see the housekeeper quickly drop the towels off and go.In the everlasting war for even the slightest competitive advantage in Major League Baseball, the battlefields have come to look a lot different from the playing fields. \u201cMoneyball\u201d changed things. Once the data-driven revolution started, it became difficult to contain, until every team started using advanced analytics to discover new players or rediscover old ones. Then the battle had to be moved someplace else. Those teams that were late to that data revolution had a chance to get ahead in this one. This data revolution required a new type of radar gun, one that could measure in milliseconds.At 8:25, there was another knock at the door of Room 307. A third baby-faced teenager appeared: Manny, a shortstop, wearing a gray T-shirt and sandals, his eyes puffy and reddened. The boys, they were really just boys, had played in a doubleheader the day before, in the searing Sonoran heat, as the playoffs neared. This being a rookie league team, below Single-A, even below Low-Single-A, every player had recently been drafted or acquired from overseas.They are currently chaperoned by Frank, the organization\u2019s director of sports science, who popped in and out of Room 307 with a list of the telephone numbers to each of the players\u2019 rooms, in case any of them tried to sleep in. A stocky man with soft blond hair, reddish cheeks and bright eyes, he is friendly, but with a no-nonsense mien, like a waiter at the end of his shift. Frank (who, like his employer, requested anonymity, so his name has been changed) did not seem to care that 8 a.m. for an 18-year-old on the Saturday morning after a late doubleheader is a considerable, if not downright malicious, request. But there was a lot to get done.Jason Sherwin and Jordan Muraskin, the co-founders of deCervo, were only in town for two days. Their sort of expertise is not easily replaceable. The club paid $2,000 to fly them to Arizona. As the ballplayers tapped on their keyboards, and Manny waited on the couch, Sherwin and Muraskin shushed about, adjusting the hairnets. They chatted idly with Frank about the upcoming fantasy football season, but there were giveaways that they were not members of a typical athletic entourage.Noticing the colorful symbol on the front of Manny\u2019s T-shirt, Muraskin asked him, \u201cIs that a Google shirt?\u201dNo, he replied sheepishly. \u201cWorld Baseball Classic.\u201dA spot opened up at one of the desks after the first player finished. Manny took a seat and waited as Sherwin prepared the laptop and Muraskin readied the headgear. He used an alcohol swab to dab behind the player\u2019s ears and fitted the strange translucent swim cap \u2014 an EEG headset \u2014 over Manny\u2019s short hair. Then he grabbed a syringe and squirted a pale creamy substance into the seams around the nine spots where the sensors were expected to maintain the closest contact with the skull. The cream, the consistency of toothpaste, is a conductive salve for the electrodes.\u201cYou remember this?\u201d he asked. Manny nodded. He quickly typed his user name and password into the system, and the screen went dark, with only a small rectangular box appearing in the center. A moment later Sherwin signaled the program was ready.\u201cIt\u2019ll take about 40 minutes,\u201d Muraskin said. \u201cDo you want any practice?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Manny said. \u201cI\u2019m good.\u201dThe simulation began. \u201cAnd we\u2019re off,\u201d Frank said.On the surface, the efforts by Sherwin and Muraskin were intended to help professional baseball teams scout and improve hitters, and since 2014, when they started, all but two M.L.B. franchises have spoken to them about the possibilities of their work with EEG. Several have signed consulting agreements.\u201cA lot of companies say they\u2019re doing neural,\u201d Muraskin said. \u201cThey\u2019re not doing neural.\u201d\u201cWe wanted to be the first company to measure the impact\u201d of a decision to swing, Sherwin said, \u201cand relate that mental side into performance outcomes.\u201dBut, to zoom out a bit, their endeavor seemed to be more like tracing the essential correlates of a skill. This skill could be anything that requires a rapid decision: passing to an open wide receiver, whistling a foul call, responding to gunfire after a report of breaking and entering. Those are outcomes, like the speed of a car as it zips down the highway. Sherwin and Muraskin encouraged me to reconsider what is going on beneath the hood.Hitting a baseball, to take one of the more straightforward outcomes, has been deemed \u201cthe most difficult thing to do in sport.\u201d The most proficient hitters are hardly at all cut from the same cloth. The two front-runners for the Most Valuable Player of the American League in 2017, in fact, were a Venezuelan infielder standing 5 feet 6 inches and weighing 165 pounds (Jose Altuve) and a Californian outfielder standing 6- 7 and weighing 282 pounds (Aaron Judge). We already know what distinguishes them; we can see it. So what relates them? What actually is responsible for their skill?It would seem to have almost nothing to do with their biceps muscles or fast-twitch fibers or even their vision, which, for most baseball players is largely the same. It would seem to have much more to do with the neural signals that impel our every movement. \u201cIt\u2019s like saying people who can speak French very well have a very dexterous tongue,\u201d John Krakauer, a neuroscientist at Johns Hopkins University, told me. \u201cIt would be the wrong place to assign the credit.\u201dHow do we move? A few people have looked into this. The Egyptians actually wrote of head injuries and movement disorders. Erasistratus and Herophilus explored the cerebella of fast-moving animals like deer and rabbits. Galen of Pergamon learned about the brain from tending to the wounds of the gladiators. The origin of movement had bewitched some of history\u2019s shrewdest minds: Alcmaeon, Plato, Aristotle, Posidonius, Al-Razi, Descartes, Newton, Franklin. When the brain\u2019s primary seat of voluntary action, the motor cortex, was finally discovered, by a pair of wayward Germans in 1870, the operation had been conducted on a dog sprawled across a dresser at the home of one of the men. The eureka moment howled from a living room in Berlin.Since then, most motor research has been conducted more quietly. But skilled performance remains a tough nut to crack. It can be surprising when you consider how good artificial intelligence has gotten at replicating and building upon strictly cognitive tasks like, say, strategizing in chess or winning on \u201cJeopardy!\u201d Yet a 5-year-old child can display a fluidity of dexterity and a range of motion that the most sophisticated computers cannot begin to replicate. Find videos of robots attempting to open a closed door, and you are almost guaranteed a good laugh. This is not a knock on the machinists. It is a reminder to step back and appreciate how we move.What Sherwin and Muraskin were able to show was a baseball version of what is known as rapid perceptual decision-making. This can be reduced, like most things related to the brain, to the patterns of spatially and temporally distinct and interdependent neuron activations. Baseball players, the really good ones, produce or respond to these activations in ways different from other people. The result is they can recognize certain pitches the same way automobile enthusiasts can recognize the make and model of a car as it disappears out of sight, or the way bird-watchers can detect an instantaneous flash of color or flight pattern. It is similar to the way a chess master can quickly visualize and interpret movements on the board.Sherwin and Muraskin did not care so much how the hitters developed their talent. They cared about describing it, in digestible data bites. But they had already begun to tread, perhaps even unwittingly, into a realm once reserved for poets and philosophers.Another prominent scientist in the field, Daniel Wolpert, has investigated the source of our differences down to the composition of the neural signals that fire. Neurons are like snowflakes; each has individual characteristics. Individually, neurons are almost impossible to classify. But grouped together they produce thoughts, actions, and everything in between. When they fire their action potentials, they can sound like tennis balls pounded against the strings of a racket. \u201cPop, pop, pop.\u201d They can sound like batting practice.Zach Schonbrun has been a contributing writer for The New York Times since 2011.

{"Headline": "The Mass-Shooting Survivor Network", "Date": "2018-04-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cTalking to others has helped me realize that I\u2019m not a crazy person.\u201d\u201cSo, you were shot too?\u201d she said. Two months earlier, Mr. Korellis had been in the front row of his oceanography class when a gunman burst into the lecture hall with a shotgun. Mr. Korellis ducked under his desk, waited for a pause between blasts and bolted for the door. He was hit in the back of the head and arm with shotgun pellets but managed to stagger out into the safety of the cold Midwestern winter. When he got to the hospital, he was bleeding and missing a shoe. Ms. Haas could relate. One year before, she had been in French class when a gunman had walked in and killed the teacher. Ms. Haas huddled under her desk as her classmates were shot, and two bullets grazed her head. The gunman left to terrorize other classrooms but returned several times to kill more students, and then himself. Eleven students died in that small room. The conversation between Mr. Korellis and Ms. Haas, which took place a decade ago, was the result of a specific kind of outreach: survivors reaching out to other survivors. More and more, those who have lived through mass shootings \u2014 which were defined by the Obama administration in 2013 as a shooting with three or more deaths \u2014 are connecting with new survivors to create support groups between communities.\u201cWe didn\u2019t know who else to talk to,\u201d said Mr. Korellis, 32, now a geographic information systems project manager for Walgreens. \u201cBut hearing about a different shooting from their perspective helped. It was like, \u2018Tell me how the next year is going to be, what am I going to be dealing with?\u2019\u201d Within the next few weeks, Mr. Korellis and nine other injured classmates traveled to Blacksburg, Va., for a memorial service that marked a year since the Virginia Tech shooting. On the morning of the service, students from both schools met, paired up and traded tips for dealing with the frustrations and worries they had in the aftermath of their separate traumas. The network of gun-violence support groups across the country is loose and sprawling, with ad hoc outfits that form and disband based on need. After a mass shooting there is an initial media blitz in which survivors are overwhelmed with attention. But after the TV camera crews pack up and leave, the affected communities are left to pick up the pieces. That\u2019s when the emotional support groups reach out. One of the largest is the Rebels Project, a nonprofit founded by survivors of the 1999 Columbine high school shooting. It was created in 2012 after the movie theater shooting in Aurora, Colo., which took place about 20 miles from Columbine. Today the group has over 770 members from roughly 40 different communities of people who have been affected by mass shootings.The Rebels Project began its outreach to the Aurora survivors through local TV news interviews, holding monthly meetings in a local church that offered its space for free. They had few attendees at first, but that wasn\u2019t unexpected. \u201cIn the immediate aftermath, you just want to be left alone,\u201d Ms. Martin said. \u201cThe media is everywhere, bothering everyone they can for a story.\u201d But the Rebels Project kept holding meetings, and attendance grew as word-of-mouth knowledge of the group spread. Whenever new survivors join the Rebels Project, Ms. Martin asks them about the specifics of the shooting they experienced \u2014 where were they, if they were injured, and what else was going on in their lives. She uses this information to coordinate between disparate members who have had similar experiences. \u201cWe have three members that were injured in shootings while they were pregnant, and all three of their babies survived,\u201d Ms. Martin said. \u201cKnowing that, I was able to connect them with each other.\u201d She also emphasized the importance of having survivors with different types of experiences talk with each other: for example, having someone who was injured connect with a family member of someone who died. That is because part of the process is accepting that there is no good way to define a so-called survivor of a mass shooting. The label can encompass those who were physically injured in attacks; those in the rooms or spaces where the shootings took place; those who were roiled by the intense confusion of police responses; and the families and loved ones of all those involved. The only people who can\u2019t be counted as survivors are the dead.\u201cOne of our core beliefs is that, while experiences are different, no one is worse than the other,\u201d Ms. Martin said. \u201cA big part of survivors\u2019 guilt is thinking you don\u2019t have the right to feel bad or traumatized because you weren\u2019t right there.\u201dMembers of support groups bounce specific questions off each other, and not just expected ones about handling the media, dealing with medical bills and insurance, or talking with employers about PTSD. One common query among survivors: How should one stay calm during the country\u2019s most triggering holiday? Stressors can be unexpected, and it helps to have sounding boards. \u201cI\u2019m not dissing Ikea, but it drives me nuts because I have no idea how to get out of there,\u201d said Zach Cartaya, a Columbine survivor and chief financial officer of the Rebels Project. \u201cTalking to others has helped me realize that I\u2019m not a crazy person for going into a small conference room and feeling anxious and uptight. Knowing I\u2019m not alone, and not insane, and it\u2019s O.K. to seek help and talk about this, it makes a really big difference.\u201d In a recent Facebook post, one member of a survivor support group simply asked if anyone else was having trouble sleeping. There were dozens of responses. \u201cWe know we don\u2019t have to be polite or overly protective of each other\u2019s feelings,\u201d Ms. Anderson said. Everyone has \u201cbeen through the same things we have.\u201dIn February, she and Ms. Martin went to DeKalb, Ill., to meet Mr. Korellis and other survivors of the 2008 Northern Illinois University shooting. It was the 10th anniversary, which meant that this memorial would be particularly stressful, with a heavy media footprint. To get a calming breath before the cameras rolled, the survivors and their supporters hunkered down in a conference room.They ate brownies and cookies shaped like dog bones (a reference to the Huskie, the college mascot) and spent a few quiet moments catching up on each other\u2019s lives. On display were five wreaths, one for each of those who had died 10 years before.Before long, Mr. Korellis began getting alerts on his phone, and he noticed other survivors checking notifications. Whatever they were reading was shocking; some reacted with tears. Finally, one member announced to the group that there were reports of another shooting, this one at a high school in Parkland, Fla. The N.I.U. survivors put their phones away and went outside. In front of a fleet of news cameras, they placed wreaths outside of Cole Hall and spoke words of remembrance. At 3:06 p.m., the minute when the shooting on their campus began a decade before, they observed a moment of silence. Advertisement"}

We Always Do.", "Date": "2018-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookThe reality is that when it comes to privacy, the trade-off has already been made: We decided long ago to give away our personal information in exchange for free content and the ability to interact seamlessly with others.The evidence is all too clear: After just about every big privacy hack over the past decade, people quickly returned to the scene of the crime, using the same store or online site that had been compromised. Remember the massive breaches at Home Depot, Target and Yahoo? The number of consumers who never went back is minuscule.Perhaps Facebook\u2019s latest privacy scandal \u2014 combined with its role in the spread of false news and in foreign interference in United States elections \u2014 will be a turning point in consumer behavior. But if history is any guide, we won\u2019t do anything differently, unless regulators take steps to save us from ourselves.For all the head-scratching and criticism over Facebook\u2019s slow response to various breaches and privacy fiascos, it wasn\u2019t completely irrational. The incentive for companies to go to great lengths to protect our data \u2014 with the exception of banks and financial firms \u2014 just isn\u2019t there.None of this is to suggest that Facebook handled these situations properly; it clearly did not. And over the past week, Mr. Zuckerberg has repeatedly said as much to just about anyone who would listen.The problem is that Mr. Zuckerberg has been apologizing for years for all sorts of breaches of trust with his \u201ccommunity.\u201d And guess what? After each mea culpa, the Facebook community has grown.Perhaps the biggest obstacle to behavioral change \u2014 besides our insatiable desire for all things \u201cfree\u201d \u2014 is that it is unusual for most consumers to truly feel the effects of a massive data breach. For most people, it\u2019s a theoretical problem \u2014 the way some people view climate change or the growing national debt.The people who are most directly affected by privacy breaches are those who have had money stolen or whose email was exposed. But in huge data breaches, those people are a statistical anomaly.But most people don\u2019t feel it.Over the weekend, I asked users on Twitter whether they had deleted their Facebook accounts or reduced their activity on it. Nearly 700 users replied. For every one saying they were spurning Facebook, there were more saying they were continuing to use it.\u201cUnderstand nothing in social media is truly private and recognize that in most areas of life someone is trying to sell you something or affect your behavior,\u201d one user wrote. Another wrote: \u201cPeople love the service they get from Facebook but forget nothing is free. We pay for using it by providing our demographic and personal information so that they can sell ads to businesses to better understand and target us. We benefit by getting more relevant ads sent to us.\u201dAnd while a number of people said they were distancing themselves from Facebook, they cited not only privacy concerns but said the service had become less relevant to them.\u201cPeople have really gotten comfortable not only sharing more information \u2014 and different kinds \u2014 but more openly with more people,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cAnd that social norm is just something that\u2019s evolved over time. And we view it as our role in the system to constantly be innovating and updating what our system is, to reflect what the current social norms are.\u201dUnless our social norms change, Facebook and other sites probably won\u2019t, either.An earlier version of this article misstated Google\u2019s policy on scanning the content of its Gmail service as a way of directing advertising to specific users.

{"Headline": "Grumpy Investors Can\u2019t Find Anything to Look Forward To", "Date": "2018-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe stock market is forward-looking. That\u2019s a problem when there\u2019s not much to look forward to.Stocks sank for the fourth-straight day on Tuesday, as investors looked past a series of outwardly positive earnings reports and fixated on threats to the nine-year-old bull market.Foremost among them is the Federal Reserve. Super-low interest rates from the central bank have fueled the rally, pushing up the prices of stocks and bonds since the Great Recession.But that was then. Now, the Fed is slowly withdrawing some of its support. It is shrinking its portfolio of government bonds and lifting interest rates. As a result, a yearslong tailwind for the stock market is disappearing.The new environment is evident in interest rates on government bonds, closely watched by many investors. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note touched 3 percent in trading early Tuesday. That benchmark interest rate \u2014 which influences the price of borrowing for both consumer loans and corporate bonds \u2014 has not been that high since early 2014.Other pressures rattled the markets, and worries began to set in after 3M and Caterpillar reported a gloomy outlook.The threat of a trade war, or even a real war, is unnerving investors. Oil prices have surged higher because of tensions in the Middle East, as well as President Trump\u2019s public musings about withdrawing the United States from its nuclear deal with Iran.Those rising commodity prices represent something of a double worry for investors. For one, they feed into price inflation, making it even more likely that the Fed will continue to raise interest rates. (One of the Fed\u2019s main objectives is keeping prices stable.) At the same time, higher commodity prices eat into profit margins for companies, which is bad for their stock prices.Last year, investors might have shrugged off those concerns, preferring to focus on the buoyant global economy and the prospect of a major reduction in American corporate tax rates.That tax cut came to fruition in December, and it supercharged corporate profits, but that was a one-time event.Investors were heartened by the tax cuts, said Evan Brown, director of asset allocation at UBS Asset Management. But their focus has shifted since then.\u201cThe market\u2019s attention is rotating to other things, and one of those things is rising inflation and rising yields,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cOne of those things is the potential for increasing trade tensions.\u201dOther events are looming, and investors see little to be excited about. With congressional elections later this year, the prospects of pro-business legislation \u2014 or any legislation, for that matter \u2014 are dim. The biggest economic action out of Washington might be the Fed raising interest rates \u2014 a clear negative for investors.In short, it\u2019s up to companies themselves to give investors reasons to believe their shares can keep climbing.Recent earnings reports suggest that is becoming harder to do. Shares of Alphabet, the parent of Google, dropped sharply Tuesday despite the company reporting Monday that quarterly profits rose 73 percent to $9.4 billion. Investors appeared concerned with a surge of spending at the company that hurt its profit margins.Earnings reports also provoked a sell-off in the industrial firms 3M and Caterpillar. Investors were rattled by lower sales and profit forecasts and by sluggish demand for the products that 3M sells to auto body shops. Its shares sank 6.8 percent.And investors, after initially applauding Caterpillar\u2019s first-quarter results, were unnerved when a Caterpillar executive told analysts that the first quarter might be a \u201chigh-water mark\u201d for the year. The shares fell 6.2 percent.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index sank 1.3 percent, and the Dow Jones industrial average finished with a loss of 1.7 percent. The Nasdaq composite dropped 1.7 percent.The decline in the S.&P. on Tuesday left the benchmark index down 1.5 percent for the year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Makes a Greeting Card Black?", "Date": "2018-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLove Is ...In 1991 the Hallmark greeting card company, based in Kansas City, Mo., decided it was time to get serious about diversity. America was changing, as was Hallmark\u2019s work force, and while the brand had dabbled in cards for black consumers since the 1960s, it didn\u2019t have a perennial line that addressed them directly.Over the years, businesses of all kinds have had to acknowledge blind spots for racial exclusion, including \u201cflesh-colored\u201d crayons mixed and melted in dusty peach shades to cosmetics lines that offer few to zero options for dark complexions. Hallmark realized that speaking authentically to black people would require a slight shift in its traditional tone and direction. And so, 81 years after its founding, the company created Mahogany, its first year-round imprint dedicated to cards for the African-American community.What makes a greeting card black? According to Dierdra Zollar, the editorial director for the Mahogany brand studio, sometimes it\u2019s explicit, like a Father\u2019s Day card bearing the silhouette of an African-American man, or a card touting \u201cblack love\u201d for romantic occasions. Others, however, are more subtle.Mrs. Zollar said that a black customer browsing the greeting card aisle at a CVS may notice on a Mahogany card \u201cfamiliar expressions,\u201d terms or phrases that hint at a shared history. \u201cI see these cultural signifiers that let me know you\u2019ve been to my house, you\u2019ve been in my neighborhood, you\u2019ve participated in some of these church affairs, you have that insider knowledge that really speaks to being known,\u201d she said.I saw it for myself while browsing cards for mothers on Hallmark\u2019s website on a recent afternoon. The 543 options covered a lot of what someone might want to say to a mother \u2014 barring more extreme cases of familial dysfunction \u2014 from a \u201cThank You for Your Love on Rosh Hashana\u201d card to one whose cover featured a drawing of an androgynous figure farting out Einstein\u2019s mass-energy equivalence formula. The inside read: \u201cHappy Birthday from your smartass kid.\u201dBut many of the Mahogany cards did indeed stand out from the rest. They addressed their intended recipients as \u201cMama\u201d and \u201cAuntie,\u201d and their covers said things like, \u201cBaby, your love game is tight.\u201d I found that if the inside of a card mentioned \u201cstrength\u201d or \u201cdignity\u201d in the face of obstacles, it was often a Mahogany product. One Mother\u2019s Day offering read, \u201cThere is something deep within black women that allows them to stand strong, carry on, and make it over \u2014 with their dignity, class, and courage intact \u2014 no matter what challenges they have to face in life.\u201dMrs. Zollar nevertheless balks at the notion that Mahogany cards touch on perseverance and fortitude more so than any other Hallmark brand.\u201cI do not think that embedded in Mahogany is the expectation or idea that, for whatever reason, African-Americans have this need to focus in on drama,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that what our Mahogany consumer wants to acknowledge is that, within the wide spectrum of experiences that African-Americans have, there is some of that. But that\u2019s in all cultures, I would say, and we also have many cards that don\u2019t speak to that.\u201dStill, in an America where the mothers of murdered black children lead protest rallies around the country, it\u2019s hard to miss the poignancy of a Mahogany Mother\u2019s Day card that reads, \u201cI know it must have been tough raising a son in this world.\u201dSeveral years ago, Mahogany did dip a toe into social issues \u2014 however unintentionally \u2014 with the Father\u2019s Day card \u201cFor Mom on Father\u2019s Day.\u201d Many customers thought the gesture to single mothers was in poor taste, exaggerating a stereotype that has dogged African-Americans for generations.Mrs. Zollar points out that other, race-neutral Hallmark imprints were offering similar cards at the time, as well as cards for single fathers. \u201cThere was not an intention to pigeonhole this caption to speak to a particular situation that was unique to African-American family dynamics,\u201d she said. Despite Hallmark\u2019s intentions, Mahogany has stopped printing the cards.The goal now, one would think, is to ensure Hallmark\u2019s enduring relevance under the cultural dominance of computers and other digital devices. Can snail mail compete with the speedy romantic overtures of swapping suggestive photos, sliding into DMs and faithfully liking your crush\u2019s SpongeBob anxiety memes on Instagram (even the ones you\u2019ve seen posted elsewhere)?Mrs. Zollar said Mahogany keeps up with the trends through constant market research, some of which involves watching online communities like Black Twitter. It\u2019s the reason Mahogany cards currently implore recipients to \u201cslay,\u201d \u201cgrind\u201d and wield their \u201cblack girl magic.\u201d The illustrations have changed as well. \u201cFor example, a few years back, as we noticed more and more blogs and websites devoted to natural hairstyles, we knew the aesthetic on our cards needed to reflect that,\u201d Mrs. Zollar said.Cord Jefferson is a TV writer and journalist in Los Angeles.Advertisement"}

Mayor Eric M.

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching.\u2022 Elon Musk finally responded to last week\u2019s bad news about Tesla.\u2022 Trump continues to go after Amazon.\u2022 China retaliated to President Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs.\u2022 Tech leaders have been keeping mum on Facebook.For months, the stock market rally seemed to have the strength to plow through the obstacles that the Trump administration threw in its way.But now, the S.&P. 500 index is down more than 10 percent from its all-time high.Too much blame can be placed on the White House, however.Before investors began fretting about tech and trade, the underpinnings of the stock market\u2019s ascent were perhaps not as robust as they looked. Wall Street analysts expect earnings for the companies in the S.&P. 500 to increase 25 percent this year, according to data compiled by Standard & Poor\u2019s, an unusually large jump that was reflected in the stock market valuations. Much of that projected earnings increase is coming from tax cuts and some from expectations that companies\u2019 revenue would grow at a nice clip as global growth stayed strong.\u2014 Peter EavisA little humor has not cleared the clouds over Tesla.The accident renews questions about Autopilot, a signature feature of Tesla vehicles, and whether the company has gone far enough to ensure that it keeps drivers and passengers safe.Raj Rajkumar, who researches autonomous driving at Carnegie Mellon University, thinks those assumptions concern one of Tesla\u2019s key sensors. \u201cThe radars they use are apparently meant for detecting moving objects (as typically used in adaptive cruise control systems), and seem to be not very good in detecting stationary objects,\u201d he says.Doubts about the fundamental capabilities of Tesla\u2019s Autopilot could crimp demand for its cars among a customer base that is often seeking the best technology.Out of respect for the privacy of our customer and his family, we do not plan to share any additional details until we conclude the investigation.- Peter EavisTech companies are again dragging down stocks on Wall Street.The S.&P. 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite are off 3.1 percent and 3.5 percent Monday. The continued fall in the share prices of some of the biggest tech companies is weighing heavily on the indexes.Amazon is down 5.4 percent, Netflix is off 5.9 percent, Facebook fell 3 percent, Google-parent Alphabet slipped 3.6 percent and Apple dropped 5.9 percent.After leading the market higher for much of the past two years, tech stocks have hit some turbulence. Since March 16, Facebook, Alphabet, Netflix and Amazon are all down more than 12 percent, while Apple is down 7.3 percent.Over that period the business models of those companies have come under increased scrutiny. News that Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm hired by President Trump\u2019s 2016 election campaign, gained access to private information on more than 50 million Facebook users has weighed not only on the shares of Facebook but on Alphabet as well. Amazon, meanwhile, has come under attack from President Trump.President Trump attacked the e-commerce again on Monday morning.Monday\u2019s tweet is the latest over the past five days from Mr. Trump criticizing Amazon. Over that period, Mr. Trump has accused Amazon of not paying enough taxes, of putting thousands of local retailers out of business and of using the United States Postal Service as its \u201cDelivery Boy.\u201dAmazon\u2019s shares are down 4 percent and are off nearly 11 percent since Axios reported on Wednesday about Mr. Trump\u2019s anger toward the company.Context\u2022 Amazon has said that the Postal Regulatory Commission, which oversees the service, has consistently found that its contracts with Amazon are profitable.Critic\u2019s cornerDA Davidson analyst Tom Forte wrote in a note via Reuters:\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s comments are consistent with industry sources we have spoken to in the shipping industry, who often label Amazon\u2019s deal with the USPS as a sweetheart deal. An argument, however, could be made that the USPS was losing billions before it expanded its service offerings for Amazon and would, still, likely lose billions if Amazon discontinued its use of the USPS tomorrow.\u201dCiting anonymous sources, Bloomberg\u2019s Ian King and Matt Gurman report:\u201cThe initiative, code named Kalamata, is still in the early developmental stages, but comes as part of a larger strategy to make all of Apple\u2019s devices \u2014 including Macs, iPhones, and iPads \u2014 work more similarly and seamlessly together.\u201dApple provides Intel with about 5 percent of its annual revenue.Kenneth C. Griffin\u2019s Citadel has just hired Phil Villhauer, a former top trader at Steven A. Cohen\u2019s investment firm. Mr. Villhauer will become deputy head of global equities at Citadel, a newly created position. He will officially join the Chicago-based hedge fund in the middle of April and work out of Citadel\u2019s office in New York, a Citadel spokesman confirmed.\u201cWe see this as a big hire for us,\u201d said Zia Ahmed, a Citadel spokesman.In January, Mr. Cohen reconfigured Point72 as a hedge fund after establishing it as a family office in 2014 to manage $11 billion of his personal wealth. Point72 has said it has raised between $2 billion and $4 billion in outside money.Mr. Villhauer had been with Mr. Cohen through both the good days and bad days. He was there when SAC turned into a powerhouse hedge fund, and he was there when the fund pleaded guilty to insider trading charges in 2013. The guilty plea required the firm to stop managing money for outside investors.When Mr. Villhauer left Point72, Mr. Cohen, in a letter to employees, called the departure a \u201cretirement\u201d and said he was sad to see Mr. Villhauer go.Now Mr. Villhauer will start a new chapter in his career at another well-known hedge fund firm.____________________________Part of the silence, people in the industry say, comes from a desire to avoid the business equivalent of bad karma \u2014 knowing that they, too, may one day face the buzz saw of public censure.Critic\u2019s corner More on data and privacy The Chinese government said on Monday that it would place tariffs on the imports of 128 American-made products in retaliation for to President Trump\u2019s tariffs on steel and aluminum.The Washington flyaroundWhen the Justice Department allowed Live Nation to merge with Ticketmaster, it tried to assuage concerns that the deal would cripple competitors.But critics have reason to be skeptical.

{"Headline": "Police Identify Woman Who Wounded 3 at YouTube and Killed Herself; Motive Is Unclear", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN BRUNO, Calif. \u2014 A woman opened fire with a handgun at YouTube\u2019s headquarters in California on Tuesday afternoon, shooting three people \u2014 one of whom was critically injured \u2014 before killing herself, the authorities said.The San Bruno Police Department identified the attacker late Tuesday as Nasim Najafi Aghdam, who was in her late 30s. The motivation for the shootings was under investigation, the police said, although her social media postings included criticisms of YouTube.Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital received three patients: a man, 36, in critical condition; a woman, 32, in serious condition; and a woman, 27, in fair condition, a hospital spokesman, Brent Andrew, said at a news conference. A fourth person had injuries that weren\u2019t from a gunshot, the police said.\u201cAt this time there is no evidence that the shooter knew the victims of this shooting or that individuals were specifically targeted,\u201d the San Bruno Police Department said in a written statement.Word of the attack in San Bruno at YouTube, which is owned by Google and is one of the world\u2019s largest social media companies, quickly spread online through employees\u2019 social media feeds.Vadim Lavrusik, a YouTube employee who formerly worked for The New York Times, tweeted just before 1 p.m. that there was an \u201cactive shooter at YouTube HQ\u201d and that he had \u201cheard shots and saw people running while at my desk.\u201d He was barricaded in a room with co-workers, he said, but moments later tweeted that he had been safely evacuated.The last known address for Ms. Aghdam was in Menifee, a city in Southern California about halfway between Los Angeles and San Diego.Ms. Aghdam was active on various social media outlets, including YouTube, where she had a number of channels in Persian, Turkish and English. On YouTube, she published an eclectic set of videos, including music parodies and workouts, on topics like animal cruelty and vegan cooking.In February 2017, she recorded a video on Facebook criticizing YouTube for taking measures that decreased the number of views on her videos.She said that she had contacted YouTube, but that the site\u2019s support staff told her that her workout videos contained inappropriate scenes and needed to be restricted from younger audiences.\u201cThis is what they are doing to vegan activists and many other people who try to promote healthy, humane and smart living \u2014 people like me are not good for big business, like for animal business, medicine business and for many other businesses. That\u2019s why they are discriminating and censoring us,\u201d she said in the video on Facebook.YouTube had pulled down all of her channels as of Tuesday night.\u201cFor me, animal rights equal human rights,\u201d said Ms. Aghdam, then 29, who attended the protest carrying a plastic sword and wearing a wig and jeans painted with drops of blood.The shootings on Tuesday took place in a courtyard at YouTube\u2019s offices, the police said. Those offices, like other Google facilities, maintain light security, with employees using badges to go through security gates or doors. Usually, the main lobby is attended by a receptionist. There are no visible metal detectors or armed guards.San Bruno is about nine miles south of San Francisco, with a population around 43,000. YouTube is the city\u2019s biggest employer, and many workers commute here from San Francisco. Though YouTube is owned by Google, it operates in a separate office, about 20 miles from Google\u2019s main campus in Mountain View, Calif.Outside the YouTube headquarters, armed police officers waded into a crowd of 200 or so employees who had evacuated to a nearby parking lot Tuesday afternoon. The police asked for employees who had witnessed something firsthand to come forward, and about two dozen, some visibly distraught, walked over to the officers.Many employees said they had initially thought the episode was a fire drill. Others said they had run when people started shouting that there was a shooter. Two hours after the attack, YouTube employees, including Susan Wojcicki, the chief executive, continued to stream slowly down the hill, away from the office.Footage broadcast by CNN showed people leaving the building in single file with their hands raised above their heads. Separate footage showed a large crowd lining up to be frisked, one by one, by the police.Zach Vorhies, 37, a senior software engineer at YouTube, said in an interview that he had been sitting at his desk when the fire alarm went off. He grabbed his electric skateboard and headed for a back exit, he said. As he rode down a gravel hill, he heard someone shouting and saw a man lying motionless in one of the office\u2019s outdoor dining areas.\u201cHe had a red spot on his stomach, and he was lying on his back, not moving,\u201d Mr. Vorhies said. \u201cI saw the blood soak through the shirt.\u201dAbout 25 feet away from the victim, he said, a man was shouting, \u201cCome at me!\u201d Mr. Vorhies thought the man was the attacker, but he did not see a gun and said it was possible that the man had actually \u201cbeen taunting the shooter.\u201dA moment later, an armed police officer entered the patio area, and Mr. Vorhies quickly left, he said.The dining area can be reached from an adjacent parking structure without an employee badge, Mr. Vorhies said.By 2:15 p.m., President Trump had been briefed on the attack. He tweeted a short time later: \u201cWas just briefed on the shooting at YouTube\u2019s HQ in San Bruno, California. Our thoughts and prayers are with everybody involved. Thank you to our phenomenal Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders that are currently on the scene.\u201dExecutives at other Silicon Valley companies took to Twitter to send their condolences to YouTube employees.Others, including a trauma surgeon at the hospital where shooting victims were taken, expressed anger at continued gun violence.\u201cYou\u2019d think that after we\u2019ve seen Las Vegas, Parkland, the Pulse nightclub shooting, that we would see an end to this, but we have not,\u201d the surgeon, Dr. Andre Campbell, told reporters Tuesday afternoon.An earlier version of this article misquoted a comment made by Nasim Najafi Aghdam in one of her YouTube videos. She said, \u201cThis is what they are doing to vegan activists and many other people who try to promote healthy, humane and smart living,\u201d not \u201cwhat they are doing the weekend activists.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the name of the city in California where Ms. Aghdam\u2019s last known address was.

I want people to get away from harsh language.Having said that, it is absolutely objectionable for people like Gavin Newsom and Jerry Brown to say they are not going to adhere to the federal law on immigration. Jerry Brown should not be acting like George Wallace in front of the schoolhouse in Alabama.Q: How much of an obstacle is Mr. Trump for you as you run for governor?A: I\u2019m at a forum a few weeks ago and I\u2019m listening to these Democrats ripping him up. I said: \u201cDonald Trump didn\u2019t create the housing crisis. Donald Trump didn\u2019t create a drought. Donald Trump didn\u2019t raise your taxes to ridiculous heights. You are sitting here making Donald Trump the issue.\u201d The issue on the ballot in 2018 is not going to be Donald Trump.Q: How do you think he is doing for president?A: I didn\u2019t vote for him. But I take great pains to say I like the tax cut. I like the regulations that he is streamlining. I like the judges he\u2019s appointing. I like moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem. So he\u2019s done some great things. I\u2019m not a huge fan of his Twittering.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Does it seem like everyone is always angry with you?These findings build on previous research indicating that depression, anxiety and irritability can affect how a person perceives other people\u2019s faces.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

It was a moment to remember in a conflict that has lasted for nearly seven decades.The summit meeting\u2019s location has come to symbolize the conflict. It is taking place in the truce village of Panmunjom, a cluster of buildings in what is known as the demilitarized zone, or DMZ, a strip of land along the 38th parallel that divides the Korean Peninsula. The meeting is reminiscent  of the talks in Panmunjom that yielded an armistice at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War,  but not a formal peace treaty.Everything from the choice of furniture to the food served is rich with meaning. The distance separating Mr. Moon and Mr. Kim at the oval-shaped negotiation table is 2,018 millimeters \u2013 a nod to the year of the meeting.NORTH KOREASepoNorthKoreaKumgangArea ofdetailSouthKoreaChorwonYangjuKumchonKaesongChuncheonYangjuSOUTH KOREAGoyang10 milesSeoulNORTH KOREASepoNorthKoreaKumgangArea ofdetailSouthKoreaChorwonYangjuKumchonKaesongChuncheonYangjuSOUTH KOREAGoyang10 milesSeoulArea ofdetailNORTH KOREASOUTH KOREASeoul20 milesArea ofdetailNORTH KOREASOUTH KOREASeoul20 milesNORTH KOREANorthKoreaSepoKumgangArea ofdetailSouthKoreaChorwonYangjuChuncheonYangjuSOUTH KOREAGoyangSeoul10 milesThe Joint Security Area in the truce village of Panmunjom is considered neutral territory. Previous discussions held over the years by negotiators for North and South have often stalled there.\u201cBoth sides have learned how to be very careful and circumspect in the language and symbolism they use,\u201d said Charles Armstrong, a historian and professor at Columbia University in New York.Panmunjom is sliced in two by the Military Demarcation Line. The summit meeting site in Panmunjom, the Peace House, is technically on the South Korean side of the line.Some of Panmunjom\u2019s buildings are administered by North Korea, some by the United Nations and some by South Korea. The village has had its share of tensions and violence over the years, including an ax attack by North Korean soldiers against an American soldier in 1976. Two men were killed, and a plaque in the Joint Security Area commemorates their deaths.North and South held a joint rehearsal of the summit meeting this week to go through every detail of the talks, according to Kwon Hyuk-ki, a spokesman for South Korea\u2019s government. A foot bridge that Mr. Moon and Mr. Kim are tol walk across together has been painted blue, a nod to the official color of the United Nations and of the Korean unification flag.The North Korean Panmungak Hall  dominates the North Korean side of the truce village. It is North Korea\u2019s operation center for the summit and the food preparation staff, including a chef from a Pyongyang restaurant specializing in a famous cold noodle dish, called naengmyeon, for the summit dinner.According to the South Korean government, President Moon suggested the dish, which required a noodle making machine from the restaurant to be brought in so the noodles could be served fresh.Mr. Kim and Mr. Moon are meeting in a blue-carpeted conference room on the second floor of the Peace House, seated at an oval-shaped table with legs that resemble two bridges merging. South Korea\u2019s government said in a statement that the design had been intended to \u201chelp bridge the psychological distance stemming from the physical boundary marked by the Military Demarcation Line and 65 years of division.\u201dEach side has seven seats. The two middle seats \u2013 for Mr. Moon and Mr. Kim \u2013 are larger than the others, but of equal size. The seatbacks are decorated with the outline of the Korean Peninsula.Next to the conference table is a South Korean artist\u2019s painting of Mount Kumgang in North Korea. The painting is intended to symbolize cooperation between the two Koreas, South Korean officials said.The mountain theme will also be reflected in a planned tree-planting ceremony, featuring a pine tree that dates to 1953, when the armistice was signed, planted in a mixture of soil from Mount Paektu in North Korea and Mount Halla in South Korea. According to North Korean lore, the founder of the nation, Kim Il-sung, Mr. Kim\u2019s grandfather, fought against the Japanese on Mount Paektu, and his son, Kim Jong-il, was born there. Mount Halla is South Korea\u2019s tallest peak.The summit meeting room in the Peace House was not the only part of the building updated for the occasion. An extensive renovation was undertaken to reflect the significance of the meeting. Each piece of furniture and art was chosen with purpose.A sofa for the two leaders displays the blue Korean unification flag. Other new pieces of furniture were made mostly from walnut \u2013 \u201cnot being prone to bending and warping over time,\u201d said a South Korean government statement.Special decorations on the first floor include traditional Korean mulberry paper, known as hanji, which officials say is a nod to the the stylings of a comfortable North Korean home.Other menu items pay homage to the biographies of Mr. Moon and Mr. Kim.  They include a John Dory fish -- the most popular fish in southeastern South Korea, where Mr. Moon spent his childhood, and a Korean version of a Swiss dish, rosti, a reference to Mr. Kim\u2019s childhood education at a school in Switzerland.Choe Sang-Hun contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "Audit Approved of Facebook Policies, Even After Cambridge Analytica Leak", "Date": "2018-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe accounting firm, formerly known as PricewaterhouseCoopers, effectively gave Facebook a clean bill of health. \u201cFacebook\u2019s privacy controls were operating with sufficient effectiveness to provide reasonable assurance to protect the privacy\u201d of users, said the assessment, which stretched from February 2015 to February 2017.\u201cWe considered it a closed case,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cIn retrospect, that was clearly a mistake.\u201dLike its competitors, PwC closely protects the inner workings of its review process. The public versions of the reports it submits to the F.T.C. redact both the names of the employees who performed the work and the tests the firm used to assess Facebook\u2019s privacy measures. It is not clear whether Facebook informed its auditors of the leak, or whether PwC knew about it.In a statement, Facebook\u2019s deputy chief privacy officer, Rob Sherman, said the company remained \u201cstrongly committed to protecting people\u2019s information\u201d and appreciated \u201cthe opportunity to answer questions the F.T.C. may have.\u201dA spokeswoman for PwC declined to comment.\u201cClearly, the F.T.C. needs to be more forthcoming with the contents of those reports,\u201d said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, which advocates more stringent privacy protections. \u201cThere is still too much that is not known about Facebook\u2019s business practices during that critical time period.\u201dThe 2011 decree \u2014 triggered in part by a complaint EPIC and other consumer groups filed \u2014 followed a two-year investigation that found Facebook had routinely ignored its users\u2019 privacy preferences and shared their data without their permission. Besides demanding that Facebook give users more control over their data, the decree required the company to assess potential privacy risks. Facebook has acknowledged that it did not sufficiently police how third parties with access to its data, like Mr. Kogan, used the information.F.T.C. officials hailed the consent decree as a new and powerful model for regulating tech giants like Facebook and Google, which in recent years have built immensely lucrative advertising businesses rooted in the vast quantities of data they collect from people who use their free services.But critics of the agreement said it reflected the essential weakness of relying on an outside firm to evaluate Facebook\u2019s compliance with the order. The F.T.C. is a relatively small agency, where even major investigations are handled by teams of just a few people. Instead of retaining a large staff of technology and data experts to monitor businesses, the agency makes companies hire outside accounting and consulting firms. These are paid by companies like Facebook and periodically report back to the F.T.C.According to the assessment documents, Facebook chooses which policies and procedures PwC reviews.\u201cA conversation has to be had about how the F.T.C. handles these assessments,\u201d said Joseph Jerome, policy counsel at the Center for Democracy and Technology, which is funded in part by Facebook and other tech companies. \u201cFacebook decides how they are being assessed. It really stacks the deck in their favor.\u201dGabriel J.X. Dance contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Facebook and Google Could Benefit From the G.D.P.R., Europe\u2019s New Privacy Law", "Date": "2018-04-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In Europe and the United States, the conventional wisdom is that regulation is needed to force Silicon Valley\u2019s digital giants to respect people\u2019s online privacy.But new rules may instead serve to strengthen Facebook\u2019s and Google\u2019s hegemony and extend their lead on the internet.In recent years, other regulatory attempts at strengthening online privacy rules have also had little effect at chipping away at the power of the largest tech companies, ultimately aiding internet giants rather than hurting them.At the same time, countries like Brazil and Argentina are exploring European-style privacy regulations that will further test the companies\u2019 advertising-based business models. United States lawmakers also showed more openness to regulating Silicon Valley during Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony this month.Yet past attempts at privacy regulation have done little to mitigate the power of tech firms. Consider what happened in Europe after earlier attempts at checking the power of Facebook, Google and others.Another 2011 European law requiring websites to alert visitors to \u201ccookie\u201d trackers that collect data on browsing history has largely turned into a distracting annoyance rather than changing how companies operate. People often accept the tracking to get rid of the pop-up warning without reading details about the tracking.Spokeswomen for Facebook and Google declined to comment.Lawyers, consultants and businesses preparing for the privacy laws said that reining in the large technology companies was not the primary goal of the European legislation.Some privacy advocates also bristle at the idea that these new restrictions would help already powerful internet companies, noting that is a well-worn argument employed by tech giants to try to prevent future regulation.But Nicolas Colin, a co-founder and director at the Family, a Paris-based start-up accelerator, argued that \u201cpeople tend to give that permission to companies they trust.\u201d He said that \u201cstricter rules strengthen companies because they have that key asset that is trust.\u201dThe European privacy laws may crimp targeted advertising by limiting the flow of personal data, but firms like Google and Facebook still have an advantage because advertisers are likely to turn to services with reach and enormous audiences \u2014 akin to buying an ad during the Super Bowl. Facebook has more than 2.2 billion monthly users, and Google\u2019s YouTube has 1.5 billion monthly users.Giovanni Buttarelli, the European data protection supervisor who was involved in the creation of privacy rules, said much of the impact would be determined by regulators who enact the law and who will be up against well-funded teams of lobbyists and lawyers. Google and Facebook will be overseen by the Irish data authority because their European headquarters are in Ireland. Mr. Buttarelli noted that Europe had staff of about 2,500 across all the countries working on the issue.\u201cThat\u2019s peanuts compared to the lobbyists in Brussels and Strasbourg,\u201d he said, referring to the cities where the European Commission and Parliament operate.He said large technology companies had advantages but would also be under a microscope. Enforcement of the law is skewed to companies that handle the most personal data.\u201cThere are pros and cons to being a tech giant,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to treat small and medium-sized businesses differently.\u201dYonatan Zunger, a former Google privacy engineer now working at human resources start-up Humu, said Europe was holding Google and Facebook to \u201ca much higher bar\u201d when it came to gaining consent from users. These companies now cannot make data sharing a condition of using their products because consent needs to be freely given, whereas smaller companies are not held to that same standard, he said.Still, there are already signs the big companies are adjusting to the new privacy norms.Google, which spent years preparing for the new rules, has stopped scanning Gmail messages for keywords used to target advertising. And it recently introduced a new marketing product for publishers that shows ads based on the context of other articles or content on a website, instead of relying on personal information.In response, privacy critics have challenged Facebook\u2019s new consent forms, saying they are intended to continue encouraging users to share information widely. And Google came under fire for an updated European user consent policy that has open-ended language, which critics said violated a tenet of European privacy rules that requires companies to ask for user consent in specific and explicit ways.\u201cI\u2019m worried that a lot of people have invested a lot of hope in G.D.P.R., and I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s going to deliver,\u201d said Ben Scott, a senior adviser to the Open Technology Institute at New America, a think tank based in Washington. \u201cIt will all depend on how it\u2019s going to be enforced.\u201dDaisuke Wakabayashi reported from San Francisco, and Adam Satariano from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Putin a C.I.A. Agent?", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistPresident Trump\u2019s steadfast reluctance to say anything negative about Russia is so striking that a former director of national intelligence, James Clapper, once observed that Vladimir Putin manages Trump as if he we were a Russian intelligence \u201casset.\u201d He may be. But if I were a Russian citizen, I\u2019d be asking this question: Is Putin a U.S. agent?Why? Because Putin has undertaken so many actions in recent years that contributed to the weakening of Russia\u2019s economy and human capital base that you have to wonder whether he\u2019s secretly on the C.I.A.\u2019s payroll.Beginning around 2007 or 2008, Putin appears to have decided that rebuilding Russia by nurturing its tremendous human talent and strengthening the rule of law was just too hard \u2014 it would have required sharing power, holding real, competitive elections and building a truly diverse, innovation-based economy.Instead, Putin decided to look for dignity for Russia in all the wrong places: by tapping his oil and gas wells, not his people; by strengthening the Russian military, instead of the rule of law; and by enriching himself and his circle of oligarchs while wrapping himself in a cloak of Russian Orthodoxy and Russian nationalism that appealed to his base.For all his shirtless bravado, and despite all the recent talk about how Putin is proving to be a successful authoritarian, I have one question: Then why is Putin so insecure about his real popularity in Russia that even after nearly 20 years at Russia\u2019s helm, he was afraid to allow a single credible independent candidate to run against him in the latest presidential election?Here\u2019s the real truth: Putin consistently acts like a farmer who sells his most valuable beef in return for cubes of sugar. That is, he looks for short-term sugar highs to boost his popularity with his Russian nationalist base because he is insecure, and pays for it by giving up real beef, leaving Russia weaker in the long term.Beef for sugar \u2014 not a good trade.For instance, in 2014 Putin seized Crimea and invaded Eastern Ukraine with disguised Russian troops \u2014 to get a short-term sugar boost with the Russian electorate \u2014 and in return, he has had to live with long-term economic banking sanctions imposed by the West that help to slow Russia\u2019s growth.In 2015, to prove that Russia was still a superpower \u2014 another short-term sugar high for his base \u2014 Putin sent advisers, Russian Air Force jets, special operations teams and surface-to-air missile batteries to Syria to prevent the toppling of Russia\u2019s Cold War ally, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Putin\u2019s support, along with the help of Iran, has just barely kept Assad upright, but for now Putin is stuck in the middle of Syria and can\u2019t get out, lest Assad falls and Putin looks foolish.In Syria, Russia is discovering that winning the war might be easier than winning the peace. Each time President Putin declares victory or announces a drawdown of Russian forces, like he did in December, the fighting flares up with a new intensity and Moscow is required to fly in reinforcements \u2026 Moscow is now struggling to parlay its military gains into an internationally legitimate political settlement that would help Russia recoup its investments in the conflict. For now, Syria remains ungovernable and splintered into fiefdoms run by regional players with their own interests.Putin\u2019s latest beef-for-sugar trade was his apparent ordering of the use of a military-grade nerve agent, produced only in Russia, to poison the former Russian spy Sergei V. Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, in the English city of Salisbury. The Western response has been what British Prime Minister Theresa May described as the biggest collective expulsion of alleged Russian intelligence officers ever \u2014 over 100 from more than 20 countries.Whether timed or coincidental, the poisoning attack and the Western backlash helped Putin run up his vote totals in his latest phony presidential re-election \u2014 another sugar high. But the morning after, Putin\u2019s Russia is more isolated than ever. Also, Putin\u2019s cronies and other Russian oligarchs \u2014 whose game is to make tons of dirty money in Russia and then take it to London, where it can be laundered for safekeeping \u2014 are now getting more scrutinized than ever by British authorities.Putin\u2019s troubles are nothing I celebrate. I was against NATO expansion; I wanted Russia integrated into the family of European democracies. A weak, isolated and humiliated Russia is a dangerous animal. But to thrive in the long term, Russia needs a \u201creset,\u201d and it can come only from within, but Putin won\u2019t press the button.It\u2019s sad to see a country that gave us Tchaikovsky, Tolstoy, Spassky, Sakharov, Stravinsky, Shishkin, Dostoyevsky, Solzhenitsyn, Pushkin, Nureyev and the Google co-founder Sergey Brin become better known for giving the world Novichok, the deadly Russian nerve agent used in Britain; \u201clittle green men,\u201d the disguised Russian soldiers who seized Eastern Ukraine; and Guccifer 2.0, the Russian cyberagent who hacked the Democratic National Committee in 2016.It\u2019s all beef for sugar \u2014 and that\u2019s Putin\u2019s legacy.Advertisement"}

With a newly liberated Van as our vehicle, we get a behind-the-scenes look at those A-list bashes that appear glamorous, but only when snapped from the right angles.Van and her friends, Tami, Candy and Nadine, are prepping for the ultimate girls\u2019 night out, a New Year\u2019s Eve party hosted by the \u201cChampagne Papi\u201d himself, Drake. They\u2019re dressed in the requisite bodycon dresses, fixing their faces and filling in their followers on every detail.After Insta-stalking Earn \u2014 who has clearly moved on to other women (or at least his posts would have us believe as much) \u2014 Van is determined to get on with her life as well. First, she needs to up her social stock by revamping her \u201cweak\u201d Instagram feed, which is all pictures of her daughter, Lotte, and chicken. A photo of her and Drake would be the ultimate boost.Before they head out into the night, they raise their shot glasses in a toast. \u201cTo partying with my girls!\u201d shouts Candy, the bubbly friend who\u2019s best described as \u201cextra.\u201dOf course, Candy is the first to ditch the squad. The girls had passed the necessary tests to gain entry to the exclusive party. They navigated the sketchy parking lot meet-up spot, delivered the secret code number and made it past an exacting security guard. Once they stepped their bootie-covered feet onto the mansion\u2019s marble floors and munched their mood-enhancing edible gummies, Candy figured it was every girl for herself.The director Amy Seimetz packed the scene with rap video clich\u00e9s. Women bop in bikinis and frolic in front of an oversized fireplace \u2014 there\u2019s even a slo-mo shot of a woman riding a mechanical bull.Tami sizes up her surroundings and, exasperated, dubs it a \u201cTHOT-a-thon.\u201d She sets her sights on Devyon Johnson, a (fictitious) black actor who attended the party with a white woman on his arm. \u201cI just need to talk some sense into him,\u201d she says, storming off.Then there\u2019s Nadine. The drug-laced gummy candy has hit her the wrong way and she\u2019s freaking out. She becomes that messy friend who requires babysitting throughout the night.Van is unbothered by her friends\u2019 issues. She\u2019s tightly wound and has a lot to prove (mainly, to Earn). \u201cI\u2019m just trying to get this photo with Drake,\u201d she says. \u201cI need to strategize.\u201dShe\u2019s dragged away from her mission by poor, bewildered Nadine, who called the police to report, \u201cI need your help. I\u2019m at this big party at Drake\u2019s house and I\u2019m dying.\u201dIn her attempts to calm her agitated friend, Van goes looking for a bottle of water and bumps into Brandon, who promises access to both an outlet for her dead cellphone and a private bathroom for her ailing friend. All she has to do is follow him down a spiral staircase.Here\u2019s the second time this evening that Van put good judgment on hold. The first was putting her trust in a lecherous shuttle bus driver who teased, \u201cY\u2019all pretty! I\u2019m gonna take y\u2019all home with me. Just kiddin\u2019.\u201d Now, she\u2019s blindly following a stranger and into the basement. She could have just as easily stumbled into a horrific mansion massacre of her own.As it was, she got lucky when the guy turned out to be harmless. He was just another of the party\u2019s many cling-ons. \u201cDrake\u2019s nutritionist is my cousin,\u201d he explains.She escapes his pestering and rejoins her efforts to track down Drake. While she doesn\u2019t find the rapper, she finds what appears to be his living quarters. A Muzak version of \u201cPassionfruit\u201d plays overhead as she roams through his gilded bathroom and well-appointed walk-in. She grins like a kid in a candy shop as she tries on his bomber jacket, sniffing it to get a whiff of his scent.\u201cReal fake,\u201d he replies.Meanwhile, unlike Van, the militant Tami has zeroed in on the celebrity she\u2019s been stalking. She watches in disgust as Devyon canoodles with his white plus-1 and unloads on the woman the moment he steps away. \u201cYou\u2019re saddled over there with your black man accessory and I\u2019m tired of that story, to be honest,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s basic.\u201dHer nameless, doe-eyed prey tries to de-escalate things. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m a good woman and I found a good man,\u201d she says.But that argument doesn\u2019t fly with Tami. She sees herself as going to the mat on behalf of every black woman who has ever felt jilted by the sight of a successful black man paired up with a white woman. \u201cType \u2018beautiful woman\u2019 in Google Images, honey! Then you can talk to me,\u201d Tami shouts.Devyon catches the tail end of all this drama, just as his girl retreats from it. Before he follows after her, he delivers a sheepish \u201cSorry.\u201d Whether he was apologizing for himself or for every man of his ilk, it\u2019s enough to placate Tami. She seems giddy just hearing it.Her dream of getting a picture with him is dashed. Or is it? She finds the source of all those party pictures that girls had been posting throughout the night. Two enterprising women have been staging shots with cardboard cutouts of Drake, all for the low, low cost of $20. An extra $10 would score you a pair of baby blue (probably bootleg) Puma slides.\u201cWhat? You thought you were going to have a meaningful convo with Drake?!\u201d one of the women asks a visibly disappointed Van.She makes her way to a now-enlightened Nadine, who reinforces what has, by now, become glaringly obvious: \u201cIt\u2019s a simulation, Van. It\u2019s all fake.\u201d\u2022 Not to nitpick, but this was supposed to be a New Year\u2019s Eve party? Where was the countdown? The champagne toasts and confetti? The kissing?\u2022 Though it was barely audible, Nadine spoke the most relatable line of the entire episode: \u201cI should\u2019ve worn pants.\u201d\u2022 The only thing real this week was the love that crying girl harbored for Drake. She thrust her wrinkled letter at the security guard like it was a permission slip, explaining, \u201cDrake invited me.\u201d It was hilariously heartbreaking to watch her get manhandled off the premises, all while she swore she was legit and wailed Drake lyrics. \u201cYou da, you da best!\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook Is Creepy. And Valuable.", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneOne of the most telling moments in the spectacle of Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s congressional testimony last week was when Representative Billy Long, a Missouri Republican, warned the co-founder of Facebook of what Congress was likely to do about its multiple concerns surrounding the social network. \u201cCongress is good at two things: doing nothing, and overreacting,\u201d he said. After years of the former, he said, \u201cwe\u2019re getting ready to overreact.\u201dThat sounds worrisome. But I sympathize. Doing nothing and overreacting make sense when you have no clue of what is going on. And we don\u2019t. The cloud of questions aimed at Mr. Zuckerberg \u2014 Is Facebook too dominant? Does it censor information? Whom does it share our data with? Does it help sell OxyContin? \u2014 suggests that we don\u2019t really know what the problem with Facebook is. It also suggests we don\u2019t understand what Facebook does.That goes for the entire data-driven ecosystem, from Google to the auto companies riddling your car with sensors that can tell where you\u2019ve been and how fast you got there. And that puts policymakers in an uncomfortable spot.The crucial issue for Congress, government regulators, members of the public and even Mr. Zuckerberg is how much all this data-driven stuff is worth to us. What do we stand to lose by, say, sharply limiting the data these companies can collect? What do we stand to gain?We don\u2019t know.\u201cWe don\u2019t understand the value to us of the new data economy nor the risks it entails,\u201d said Leonard Nakamura, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia who has studied the economic impact of data. \u201cWe just let it rip and now are trying to catch up.\u201d Unfortunately, we have only rudimentary tools to measure the good and the bad.As the data-driven economy continues evolving at breakneck speed, catching up may be beyond our reach; we will build the guardrails by trial and error. The risk is that policy will be driven mostly by fear.What is the problem with Facebook? Clearly Moscow\u2019s use of the platform to spread fake news and warp the 2016 elections is one problem. Allowing data from tens of millions of users to flow, without their knowledge, to a political consultancy working for Donald Trump is another.But the raw business models of the colossi of the data economy are creepy in and of themselves. Start with the sheer scale of personal data scooped up by Facebook, often without users\u2019 knowledge. The platform not only harvests the data you share with the platform, but also collects information about you from the files of other Facebook users you know. It buys data about your offline lives from data brokers \u2014 including sensitive stuff like your income and the credit cards you own. And testifying in the House, Mr. Zuckerberg admitted that Facebook sucks up information about people who are not even on Facebook, so it can aim ads at them.But policy cannot be determined only by the potential creepiness of what corporate America might do with our data. Maybe perfect price discrimination will never take off because consumers don\u2019t like it.Indeed, it is unclear to what extent consumers are repelled by any of this. Though surveys repeatedly find that Americans are concerned about their privacy, they rarely take action to stop cookies and other tools deployed to gather their data \u2014 leading scholars to coin the term \u201cprivacy paradox.\u201d As Sinan Aral of the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has noted, \u201cLots of the things that depend on ads we want as public goods.\u201dBut this must understate the data economy\u2019s contribution to our well-being. Facebook is an immensely valuable mode of communication and interaction for two billion people around the world. The company has published in-house research suggesting that people who do lots of sharing on the social network are happier and healthier.Facebook\u2019s advertising tools \u2014 the ones that use your data to figure out whether you should see an ad from the small shop in Connecticut that sells organic yarn \u2014 provide mom-and-pop operations with cost-effective marketing opportunities once reserved for large corporations.More broadly, Mr. Nakamura points out, the online economy powered by data collection and advertising is improving welfare in a way not properly captured in standard measures of economic output. This includes reams of \u201cfree\u201d music and the potential benefits from the artificial intelligence that will be trained using personal data. The consumer surplus \u2014 the benefit that we get from a good or service above and beyond the price we pay for it \u2014 is bigger than it ever was. And it will grow further.And yet if this sounds like an argument against touching the data-driven digital economy with even the slightest regulation, it is not. Worries that Facebook and some of its brethren may have become large enough to squelch innovation are legitimate. So are suspicions that it plays fast and loose with consumer data.Regulations to curb the power of the digital behemoths \u2014 say, barring them from buying up rising companies like Instagram and WhatsApp that might threaten their dominance in the future \u2014 make sense. So do policies that ensure responsible stewardship of the data they gather.\u201dI don\u2019t think the right policy position is to totally eliminate the business model, but instead to introduce some restraint,\u201d said Terrell McSweeny, the lone Democrat on the Federal Trade Commission. \u201cThe idea is to give people more control over the uses of their data and ensure companies are responsible for what is happening to it.\u201dSummoning Mr. Zuckerberg to testify suggests that Congress is no longer happy doing nothing. Hopefully, it can do better than simply overreact to its fears.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jamie Dimon\u2019s Letter \u2014 Handicapping a Run for President in 2020: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Good Thursday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Jamie Dimon chafes under liquidity rules.\u2022 Mark Zuckerberg has disclosed more on how much Facebook user data may have been accessed.\u2022 The White House is still talking tough on trade with China.\u2022 Blackstone\u2019s infrastructure fund isn\u2019t doing so well.On Wall Street, there\u2019s been a running parlor game about whether Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s chief executive, would try to run for president in 2020. His annual letters, filled with commentary on U.S. policy, have only increased the chatter, and this year\u2019s letter, released Thursday, is no different. It touches on everything from trade to immigration. While Mr. Dimon, who once called himself \u201cbarely a Democrat,\u201d says he plans to stay at the bank for the next five years, the question among political prognosticators is whether Mr. Dimon\u2019s policy views could ever find a home among voters in this politically polarized environment.Mr. Dimon\u2019s sensible letter was seemingly supportive of some of President Trump\u2019s policies, while taking the opposing side on others. Mr. Dimon particularly applauded the corporate tax cut and deregulation efforts. On China trade, Mr. Dimon writes: \u201cIt is not unreasonable for the United States to press ahead for more equivalency,\u201d and that \u201cone of the administration\u2019s best arguments is that negotiation alone has not worked.\u201d However, he said he would like to see more cooperation with U.S. allies on talks with China and added that the U.S. should \u201crevisit the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\u201dOn immigration, he called for tougher border control, writing, \u201cAmerican citizens have the right to complain that we have not successfully protected our borders since the last immigration reform in 1986.\u201d He also said, \u201cPeople immigrating to this country should be taught American history, our language and our principles.\u201d At the same time, he also advocated for \u201ca path to legal status and citizenship\u201d for \u201cDreamers\u201d and improving \u201cmerit-based immigration\u201d programs so that immigrants educated here can stay.Mr. Dimon made a point of saying that part of the problems facing the country is that too many people are talking past each other.\u201cWhen people argue as if there are binary solutions, the argument is almost always wrong,\u201d he wrote, advocating that people try to look at all sides of a situation. \u201cI tell my liberal friends to read columnists like Arthur Brooks and George Will. And I tell my conservative friends to read writers like Tom Friedman.\u201dIf Mr. Dimon were to run, he would likely have to do so as an independent. It is hard to see how liberal Democrats would embrace much of his deregulatory positions. And yet many of his positions \u2013 and especially some of his social positions not enunciated in his letter \u2014 may not be far right enough to capture the interest of Republicans.Maybe the country needs someone in the middle, but history has not been kind to third-party candidates.\u2014 Andrew Ross SorkinBut he also addressed a policy area much closer to home \u2013 bank regulation. Mr. Dimon often has expressed skepticism about aspects of the banking overhaul that took place in the wake of the financial crisis. But his remarks on regulation arguably carry more weight now. Congress is closer to modifying the post-crisis rules than at any point since Dodd-Frank was signed into law in 2010. An important regulatory requirement Mr. Dimon criticized, therefore, might become a focus for those wanting to roll back the rules.Mr. Dimon in this year\u2019s letter zeroed in on regulations that require banks to have a certain amount of liquidity, the financial term for access to cash or low-risk assets that can be easily sold for cash.In 2008, some large financial firms were crippled when customers, depositors and creditors withdrew their money. The Federal Reserve and taxpayers had to step in to support the banks. To help prevent a repeat of this, post-crisis rules require that banks hold a certain amount of liquid assets to cover a theoretical level of outflows. Mr. Dimon is in favor of banks having more liquidity than before the crisis, but in the letter, released Thursday, he wrote:Liquidity requirements, while much higher, now have an element of rigidity built in that did not exist before. Banks will be unable to use that liquidity when they most need to do so \u2014 to make loans or intermediate markets. They have a \u201cred line\u201d they cannot cross (they are required to maintain hard and fast liquidity requirements). As clients demand more liquidity from their banks, the banks essentially will be unable to provide it.First, a bank that lacks liquidity is in no position to lend. When a bank\u2019s creditors and customers fear it doesn\u2019t have enough cash in reserve, they will most likely withdraw their money. This not only deprives the bank of the money it needs to lend, it also sharply reduces its chance of survival. Or as Gregg Gelzinis of the left-leaning Center for American Progress puts it, \u201cYou won\u2019t be able to take this action if you fail.\u201dThe nation\u2019s largest bank holding companies have strong capital levels and retain their ability to lend to households and businesses during a severe recession.Andrew Gray, a JPMorgan spokesman, followed up with more material on Mr. Dimon\u2019s thinking on liquidity.He re-emphasized Mr. Dimon\u2019s point about having to tie up funds that could be used to make loans. Mr. Gray noted that a bank facing outflows would be expected to keep refilling its pool of liquid assets to be in compliance with a liquidity regulation. This would leave fewer funds for lending and making markets, Mr. Gray asserted.He also addressed the argument that higher capital levels, not liquidity, will largely determine the extent to which banks will lend through a downturn. Mr. Gray asserted that liquidity rules play an important role in ensuring banks have the resources to participate in wider financial markets. Rules forcing the hoarding of liquidity may, thus, crimp that activity.\u2014 Peter EavisMick Mulvaney, the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has complained that the regulator engages in \u201cwasteful spending.\u201d He even submitted a quarterly budget request recently of $0.That attitude apparently didn\u2019t apply to two of his recent hires.ContextThe consumer bureau, as well as fellow financial regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, is allowed under federal law to pay employees significantly more than other government agencies can pay. The rationale is that the higher salaries are necessary to recruit skilled employees who otherwise might land jobs on Wall Street.As a result, the C.F.P.B. is stocked with employees who earn more than the average Washington bureaucrat. Of the agency\u2019s 1,600 employees, 219 make more than $200,000, according to the records reviewed by The Times.\u2014 Stacy CowleyBlackRock, the world\u2019s largest money manager, plans to offer a series of new products allowing individuals and institutions to invest in market indexes without putting money into manufacturers and retailers of firearms.They include:\u2022 a new exchange-traded fund that will track the performance of the MSCI USA Small Cap Extended ESG Focus Index, composed of small stocks with favorable environmental, social and governance standards, while specifically excluding producers and large retailers of civilian firearms.\u2022 a similar credit-focused ETF that eschews the debt of gunmakers and distributors.\u2022 an option to take the guns out of institutional strategies tracking major market indexes, including the S&P 500, the Russell 2000 and three others.Critic\u2019s cornerRob Cox of Breakigviews writes:\u201cBlackRock\u2019s moves may spark criticism from gun-rights supporters, who lashed out at companies like Delta Air Lines that severed ties with the National Rifle Association. But it\u2019s hard to see how offering customers more choice is ever a bad idea. Moreover, by getting out early, BlackRock makes clear to those young people lobbying for tighter gun laws \u2013 who it hopes will be customers for decades to come \u2013 that it has something for them. Far from virtue signaling, it\u2019s simply good business.\u201d\u2022 Facebook said Cambridge Analytica harvested the data of 87 million users, not 50 million.\u2022 A vulnerability in search and account recovery functions may have exposed \u201cmost\u201d of Facebook\u2019s 2 billion users to unauthorized harvesting of their public profile information.A brighter note for Facebook: Its shares are up in premarket trading today, after Mr. Zuckerberg said that #DeleteFacebook didn\u2019t appear to be having much effect.The Facebook calendar\u2022 April 9: Alerts should start popping up for users whose information may have been shared with Cambridge Analytica.\u2022 April 10: Mr. Zuckerberg is scheduled to testify before the Senate\u2019s Commerce and Judiciary committees.\u2022 April 11: He will testify before the House Energy and Commerce Committee.People familiar with the negotiations say Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, and Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, have at times argued for more dialogue with the Chinese and quicker concessions that would help diminish the trade deficit. \u2026 Other top trade advisers, including longtime China critics like Robert Lighthizer and Peter Navarro, have taken a tougher stance.The United States trade deficit rose 1.6 percent to $57.6 billion, its highest level since October 2008. The deficit has now risen for six straight months, the longest such streak since 2000.The merchandise-trade gap with China narrowed to $34.7 billion in February from $35.5 billion. The Trump administration wants to cut $100 billion, or about 25 percent, from the annual deficit with China, Bloomberg points out. During President Trump\u2019s first year in office, the United States\u2019 trade deficit with China rose to $375.2 billion in 2017, a record high.Last May, Blackstone announced with great fanfare that it planned a $40 billion fund with Saudi Arabia to invest in U.S. infrastructure: up to $20 billion from the Saudis, who would match commitments by other outside partners. But as of now, Blackstone has secured just $575 million in such commitments \u2014 and missed two fund-raising deadlines.\u2022 The Saudis wanted the fund overseen by an investment committee, with a seat for them. Blackstone refused.\u2022 Many potential investors balked at committing money until an investment team was in place, a process that took some time.More from Scott Shane and Dai Wakabayashi of the NYT:That kind of idealistic stance, while certainly not shared by all Google employees, comes naturally to a company whose motto is \u201cDon\u2019t be evil,\u201d a phrase invoked in the protest letter. But it is distinctly foreign to Washington\u2019s massive defense industry and certainly to the Pentagon, where the defense secretary, Jim Mattis, has often said a central goal is to increase the \u201clethality\u201d of the United States military.The company line: \u201cWe\u2019re actively engaged across the company in a comprehensive discussion of this important topic.\u201dThe tech flyaround\u201cThe future of a combined Viacom and CBS is going to be driven by an increasing focus on international and scaling up,\u201d he wrote \u2014 an agenda better suited to Viacom\u2019s C.E.O., Bob Bakish.\u201cRetreating from the world is not the solution, nor is burning down the current system and starting anew.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google\u2019s Parent Company Spends Like It\u2019s Thinking of a Future Beyond Ads", "Date": "2018-04-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, is spending like it is beginning to prepare for life after advertising.Currently, Alphabet makes nearly 90 percent of its money from selling advertising on the internet, and gobbles up heaps of data about its users to help marketers target those ads more effectively.But a close reading of Alphabet\u2019s financial results for the first quarter of 2018, which were announced on Monday, showed that the Silicon Valley giant is accelerating its efforts to diversify into other businesses.Alphabet has made investments in areas like self-driving cars and online computer services for businesses for years, but spending in those areas was up dramatically in the first quarter. The company\u2019s capital expenditures, which included installing undersea cables and the construction of new data centers, were $7.7 billion \u2014 more than triple the same period last year.Ruth Porat, Alphabet\u2019s chief financial officer, said that increase reflected a \u201ccommitment to growth\u201d because the company had spent heavily on computing infrastructure, for both its own internal use and customer needs like Google Cloud \u2014 the unit that provides technology services to other companies.Alphabet\u2019s expenses rose 27 percent in the quarter. Ms. Porat said the heaviest spending came from research and development costs \u2014 mainly the hiring of additional technical staff. The company said its total employees had increased to 85,050 from 73,992 in the same period a year ago.Over all, Alphabet said its net income rose 73 percent, to $9.4 billion, from the same period a year earlier, boosted in part by an increase in the value of its outside investments. Revenue rose 26 percent to $31.1 billion.Ms. Porat also pointed out an increase in spending for advertising to promote newer products including Google\u2019s own hardware \u2014 a relatively new business manufacturing branded smartphones, laptops and smart speakers \u2014 and the company\u2019s artificially intelligent digital assistant.\u201cThey are thinking about their future,\u201d said Collin Colburn, an analyst at Forrester Research who focuses on search advertising. \u201cThey want to diversify beyond just advertising being such a big part of their business.\u201dStill, the search giant\u2019s core business showed no sign of slowing in the first quarter. Revenue from Google\u2019s advertising business, which includes ads shown on Google search and commercials running before YouTube videos, increased 24 percent during the quarter.However, Google\u2019s advertising profits were weighed down by an increase in traffic acquisition costs \u2014 the fees that it pays companies like Apple to make sure that its search engine is the default option when people open a browser on the iPhone.Also among the company\u2019s expenditures in the quarter: $2.4 billion to buy the Chelsea Market building in Manhattan, where the company had set up some of its New York offices.On a conference call with investment analysts, Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, avoided answering questions about the potential effects of new regulations concerning data privacy in Europe. The new law, which goes into effect on May 25, will restrict how companies like Google can collect, store and use personal data from users across Europe.Mr. Pichai said the company has been preparing for the law for more than 18 months, but didn\u2019t discuss how the new regulations may affect the company\u2019s bottom line.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Women Fighting Sexism in Jazz Have a Voice. And Now, a Code of Conduct.", "Date": "2018-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOver the past year a steady stream of public testimonials from female jazz musicians has made clear what most already knew privately: Sexism and harassment are deeply ingrained in the improvised-music world.The collective comprises 14 instrumentalists and vocalists and is working to ensure that predatory and sexist behavior is seen as aberrant, not as part of the cost of doing business in jazz.\u201cThe idea is to propose solutions, and also open the conversation to go further,\u201d the tenor saxophonist Mar\u00eda Grand, a member of the collective, said. \u201cHow do we change this culture? And not just in the dynamic of victims denouncing perpetrators, because that puts the victims at a lot of risk. What we\u2019re trying to do is change the cultural mind-set so that people know what to do when they suspect or see abuse.\u201dNine organizations \u2014 festivals, venues, educational institutions, labels and small media outlets \u2014 have signed on to the Code of Conduct, committing to abide by it. The collective hopes they will also display it prominently on their physical premises and websites.The code, which was collectively written over a period of months, is divided into two painstakingly written sections: commitments and definitions. The commitments are a series of specific answers to the question, \u201cHow can we commit to creating safe(r) spaces in the performing arts?\u201d The definitions offer a small, detailed glossary explaining the meaning of \u201csexual harassment,\u201d \u201cworkplace\u201d and \u201cconsent.\u201dWe Have Voice will be promoting the code and fostering further conversations during a slate of round tables scheduled for May, including one at the New School on May 7 and at the Vision Festival on May 24. (The collective will also convene a discussion at Harvard on May 9, and in Geneva on May 27.)A unified team began working via email and Google Hangouts, first focusing on the open letter. The participants soon began inviting other musicians in. Over a period of months the membership swelled to about 20, then settled down to the 14 in the collective now.We Have Voice features award-winning musicians like Ms. Mitchell and the drummer Terri Lyne Carrington as well as young musicians still completing their graduate studies. And it is diverse in terms of ethnic background \u2014 something that led to a constant stream of suggestions and refinements on the language.\u201cThe beauty of this collective is that everybody has different things they can offer, different experiences,\u201d Ms. Carrington said.The group plans to keep its makeup stable for now, not adding or subtracting members, and wants to become known as a resource for young musicians, perhaps creating an informal mentorship program in the process.In December, We Have Voice released the open letter, calling on their peers in the music community \u201cto speak up when witnessing or suspecting abusive or discriminatory behavior.\u201d Nearly 1,000 people have now signed it.\u201cLooking back on my accounts of sexual harassment and misogyny, it\u2019s difficult not to wish I had spoken up in the moment or confronted my peers or teachers directly after the misconduct, but I didn\u2019t have the guidance, knowledge, nor confidence to say something at the time,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be my responsibility \u2014 especially within the classroom \u2014 to say something.\u201dIt\u2019s this lack of support that the collective is aiming to confront \u2014 both by offering counsel and mentorship, and by codifying expectations for institutions.In jazz, power is not as centralized in the hands of corporations, which in turn employ pop producers and control entire creative supply chains. Rather, in the improvised-music business, the most important single entity is the musicians themselves. Beyond that, it is festivals and educational establishments.We Have Voice hopes many more such institutions will align with its code of conduct.\u201cWe\u2019re not really doing this for the branding, or trying to be part of the one time that this happens in the mainstream,\u201d said Rajna Swaminathan, a collective member. \u201cWe\u2019re really trying to do the groundwork and hold institutions accountable.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the collective member quoted at the end. She is Rajna Swaminathan, not Ganavya Doraiswamy. The article also misstated the date of the round table at the Vision Festival. It is May 24, not May 25.Advertisement"}

But YouTube has been raising the bar on qualifications for running ads.When YouTube pulls ads, it tells creators which videos violated the standards, though it doesn\u2019t elaborate very much on what they did wrong. It\u2019s unclear whether YouTube pulled ads from Ms. Aghdam\u2019s videos.The anger around demonetization has been growing for more than a year.In December, YouTube\u2019s chief executive, Susan Wojcicki, said the company would hire 10,000 people to enforce company policies regarding videos.Ms. Wojcicki said in January that YouTube was looking to hire an even bigger team of monitors to look more closely at the platform\u2019s content and decide what should belong.A wide spectrum of YouTube creators, from the conspiracy-minded to the most popular stars, have been vocal about what they see as censorship on YouTube.Luke Rudkowski, an independent journalist who describes conspiracy theories to his more than 500,000 subscribers on YouTube, has repeatedly complained about the site pulling ads from his videos.In August, he posted a video criticizing news that YouTube would start removing more terrorist content. \u201cWe are seeing the purging, the cleaning of this major online institution to be more favorable towards corporations and governments,\u201d Mr. Rudkowski said. \u201cNow that\u2019s why I think we\u2019re finally reaching the end time of this beautiful and amazing platform.\u201dA few days later, he said YouTube had pulled ads from 660 of his videos, \u201cbasically eviscerating my main source of revenue for this news organization.\u201dMr. Rudkowski has continued to upload videos to his YouTube channel, WeAreChange, every few days. In a message on Wednesday, he distanced himself and other YouTube creators from Ms. Aghdam.\u201cIn my opinion she was failing and blaming Youtube for her problems,\u201d he said. \u201cI dont think its actually about being censored but more about a delusional woman who couldn\u2019t accept failure.\u201dMs. Aghdam posted a video claiming that YouTube had set age restrictions, which would require many viewers to be over 18 years old, on a workout video even though videos from pop stars like Nicki Minaj were much more provocative.

{"Headline": "Washington Moves to Soften a Big Bank Capital Rule: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Tuesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Earnings are dragging stocks lower.\u2022 The yield on the 10-year Treasury note broke through 3 percent.\u2022 A new study found that female and male C.E.O.s tend to earn similar levels of compensation.\u2022 What does Eddie Lampert have in mind for Sears?\u2022 A thought experiment with Amazon\u2019s pay and profits.One of the simplest and strongest protections against another financial crisis could soon be weakened.Two federal banking regulators have in recent weeks proposed adjustments that could ease a stringent, no-frills bank capital requirement, much disliked on Wall Street, called the supplementary leverage ratio. The Trump administration\u2019s effort to loosen financial regulation is moving forward on several fronts, but the changes to the leverage ratio would arguably put the deepest dent in the post-crisis overhaul.Under the adjustment, the ratio would fall for all of the eight big banks that are subject to it. Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs stand to enjoy some of the biggest declines.Compared with the current rules, the new leverage ratio would reduce capital required at the eight banks by around $86 billion. But other capital rules would, for the time being at least, prevent the banks from cutting their capital by that amount.Not all regulators support the proposed adjustment.The new leverage ratio swaps a fixed capital requirement for one that is in part based on a bank\u2019s size and reach in the global financial system.Critics of the current leverage ratio said it was causing banks to reduce certain important activities.- Peter EavisBut they are dragging them lower on Tuesday.The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 500 points, or 2.1 percent, while the S.&P. 500 and the Nasdaq Composite slid more than 1.5 percent. For the Dow, Tuesday\u2019s move lower push the blue-chip index back down more than 10 percent. If its losses hold through the close, it will mark the Dow\u2019s fifth consecutive down day, its longest such streak since 2017.Disappointing earnings from some of the stock market\u2019s biggest companies are weighing heavily on stocks.\u2022 Despite a 73 percent jump in Alphabet\u2019s net profit, shares fell more than 4 percent as Wall Street analysts raised concerns that a jump in capital spending could crimp profitability\u2022 Travelers is off 4 percent after its earnings missed expectations.In all, Apple, 3M, Travelers and Caterpillar have accounted for 260 points of the Dow\u2019s decline.ContextAs of Friday, with 17 percent of companies in the S.&P. 500 having reported, profits were on pace to rise more than 18 percent, the high quarterly rate in seven years. So far, 80 percent of companies in the indexes have reported have beaten expectation.Peter Eavis\u2019s takeDespite all the bullish talk about earnings and the economy, stocks looked vulnerable going into the first-quarter earnings season. Analysts are expecting earnings for companies in the S.&P. 500 to grow 25 percent this year, an unusually large increase. At the 2018 forecast, the S.&P. 500 looks temperately valued at 17 times earnings. But looking back, stocks appear expensive, at 21 times the S.&P. 500\u2019s earnings for 2017. This large gap between future and historical valuations creates a chasm that stocks can fall into if profits disappoint. If companies, like 3M did on Tuesday, provide underwhelming earnings outlooks, investors will stop believing that stocks are cheap, based on 2018 earnings.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note broke through 3 percent early Tuesday, the first time since 2014 that the benchmark borrowing rate has carried a \u201cthree handle.\u201d Big picture, there\u2019s not much news here. Rates are rising on the back of solid global growth and a Federal Reserve that continues to gradually raise rates this year.No news, however, doesn\u2019t mean no worries. Nearly a decade after the worst of the Great Recession, no one knows exactly how reliant the American economy has become on rock-bottom interest rates. With average 30-year fixed mortgage rates now topping 4.4 percent, housing data has been persistently soft in recent months. And residential real estate is expected to be a drag on first quarter G.D.P. numbers when they\u2019re published on Friday, suggesting that if rising rates are no reason to panic, they shouldn\u2019t merely be shrugged off either.A number of prominent bond investors have long eyed the 3 percent level. Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive of DoubleLine Capital and manager of one of the largest U.S. bond funds, warned that hitting 3 percent would trigger bear market for bonds.A similar move higher in February caused stocks to tumble. So far, though, equities have taken Tuesday\u2019s climb above 3 percent in stride. The Dow Jones industrial average and the S.&P. 500 are essentially flat in early trading.That stunning conclusion, from a new study, could shake up discussions in boardrooms and C-suites everywhere. (The study tracked compensation at 2,282 companies from 1996 to 2014.)One of the most interesting theories about why women may have bridged the pay divide at the highest levels has been offered by previous studies and experts: that a premium has been applied because there is such a limited supply of women in the chief executive role. Some readers may find that an offensive idea on its face \u2014 that women in effect are being overpaid because of their scarcity \u2014 but it\u2019s one that has gained currency among some academics.Shares in Shire jumped in Tuesday trading, reaching 3,977.20 pence by late trading London time.\u2014 Michael de la MercedWhat does this mean for Uber?\u2022 Uber sold its business in China to Didi in 2016. As part of the deal, Uber and investors in its UberChina took a 20 percent stake in Didi and Didi invested $1 billion in Uber.ESL\u2019s argument: Buyers offering \u201cacceptable\u201d prices for the businesses haven\u2019t emerged, and Sears needs the cash for its self-help plan. Mr. Lampert, chairman and C.E.O. of Sears, would recuse himself from any board discussions over the bids, and a majority of Sears\u2019s non-ESL shareholders would have to approve any plan.Critics\u2019 argument: Mr. Lampert is trying to keep Sears\u2019s best assets for himself if the company files for bankruptcy protection, a fate most of the retail world think is a given. \u201cHe has been taking productive assets out of the company since Day 1,\u201d Mark Cohen, a former Sears executive, told the NYT.Sears is burning through more than $1 billion of cash a year and its sales continue to decline.The deals flyaroundWhat might happen to Amazon\u2019s bottom line if it paid its workers (median compensation: $28,466) more? If labor markets continue to tighten, the question soon won\u2019t be hypothetical.Since Amazon doesn\u2019t disclose its total compensation expense, Peter Eavis did some math. Multiplying that median pay number by the total number of employees gives a (hypothetical!) comp expense of $16.1 billion. Two more sums:By comparison, a 10 percent raise at Walmart would have cut annual pretax profit by 28 percent, and a 20 percent raise is a 56 percent hit.\u2022 Mr. Palihapitiya: Bet on Box.Advertisement"}

For several years now, his preferred target for that exercise has been New York City\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio. Despite the aura of insincerity that some feel surrounds the governor generally, his distaste for the mayor seems entirely genuine.The governor has positioned himself as a savior, declaring a state of emergency in the public housing system a few days ago, committing an additional $250 million in state resources to remediating some of the most urgent mechanical problems and public-health threats, and demanding an independent monitor to oversee the repairs. He is happy to assert his dominance and pick up the check.On Wednesday afternoon, I paid a visit to Rose Fernandez, who grew up in the Amsterdam Houses on the West Side of Manhattan and has spent 33 years in the Carver Houses in East Harlem, to gauge how the governor\u2019s move was playing out. Ms. Fernandez is a tenants\u2019 rights activist for the group Community Voices Heard. \u201cThe main thing I want to tell you about is my health,\u201d she began. \u201cI\u2019m depressed. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve seen those A.S.P.C.A. commercials, but I feel like one of those animals, suffering in a cage.\u201dShe has sued the housing authority twice, once over a broken sink that left her doing dishes in the tub for three months and a second time over a busted ceiling that revealed black mold. She has been dealing with the mold for three years despite her protestations, she told me, and it leaves her with headaches, nausea, vision issues and constant agitation. Her 30-year-old son, who lives with her, is similarly afflicted, she maintains.\u201cAside from being depressed, I\u2019m just angry,\u201d Ms. Fernandez said. Like many residents of public housing, she complained that elevators are always shutting down and garbage chutes are taped up and the city\u2019s maintenance people never come when they say they are going to come.She is thankful for the governor\u2019s attention and said that like many other residents she knows, she lays far more blame at the mayor\u2019s door than the governor\u2019s. She and other advocates are fighting for the mayor to include $2 billion for repairs in the next budget and $1 billion a year after that. It is not clear where that money would come from.

{"Headline": "Xi Jinping Promotes Openness at a China Forum Rife With Restrictions", "Date": "2018-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBOAO, China \u2014 The International Monetary Fund chief praised his openness. A senior British banker lauded his authoritarian rule. The Philippine president said he loves the man.Plaudits from foreign leaders like President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore, as well as leading figures of the economic and diplomatic world, have helped to cement this image.\u201cI congratulate you, Xi Jinping, for this new life that you have identified, for the openness that you have celebrated and advocated,\u201d Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said in a speech, \u201cfor the innovation and inclusiveness that you have encouraged.\u201dYet even as Ms. Lagarde and Mr. Xi talked about that openness, forum attendees were unable to use Google, log on to Facebook or post to Twitter about the event unless they found a way to bypass China\u2019s army of internet censors. In fact, aspects of the forum stand in stark contrast with the many ways China remains closed and intransigent.To some of the more cynical China watchers, there is a sense that the pledges Mr. Xi offered to the forum, and the world, may amount to less than they appear.The timing of reducing trade restrictions may not matter. China\u2019s tariffs in the automotive sector, for example, have already been successful in getting foreign companies to shift a large part of their supply chains to China, where they make most of the cars they sell in the country. In this respect, Mr. Xi\u2019s gesture is seen as too little too late. For many years, Chinese officials have said that they would reduce protectionist policies in the automotive industry when they are ready to move into Western markets in order to prevent the possibility of reciprocal tariffs.There was no chance for political maneuvering at the forum, though, as no American officials were present.On Wednesday, China\u2019s central bank governor, Yi Gang, also partly fleshed out how China plans to open the country\u2019s financial services sector to foreign investors.Mr. Yi did not go into details, but he said that restrictions on foreign insurers and on foreign ownership of securities would be loosened by the end of June. He added that China planned to create a connected stock market between Shanghai and London that would allow investors in either market to invest in the other, despite China\u2019s tight control on the flow of money over its border.\u201cThere is clearly a lot of room for improvement when it comes to opening up and creating level playing fields between China and the rest of the world,\u201d said Hans-Paul B\u00fcrkner, chairman of the Boston Consulting Group.\u201cChina is wonderful for us in business,\u201d Gerry Grimstone, deputy chairman of the British bank Barclays, told Bloomberg television on the sidelines of the forum. \u201cThe fact that Xi is prepared to give such strong authoritarian guidance within the context of a market economy is great for companies like mine.\u201dMany of the nearly 2,000 members of the news media \u2014 a figure cited by Boao organizers \u2014 who came to this sunny island for the three-day conference have dutifully carried similar messages of a strong and responsible China.Transcripts and state media clips were quickly available for those who missed out on any panels, and social media was overwhelmed with quotes from dignitaries and corporate executives about China\u2019s new position on the global stage.Mr. Duterte helped to set the tone just before heading to Boao, telling reporters back home: \u201cI need China. More than anybody else at this point, I need China.\u201dHe added: \u201cI simply love Xi Jinping. He understood, he understands my problem and is willing to help, so I would say thank you, China.\u201d\u201cChina will open up more to the whole world, but if America carries on with its protectionist measures, the U.S. will be left out,\u201d said Li Daokui, director of the Center for China in the World Economy at Tsinghua University.Should Mr. Trump follow through with threatened tariffs on $150 billion worth of Chinese exports, there would be an impact on the Chinese economy, said Xu Sitao, chief China economist for Deloitte China.\u201cIn the end, the effect will be some tax on the economy,\u201d Mr. Xu said.The telecommunications sectors, and specifically telecom equipment, would bear the brunt of the tariff, he added.If that spurred any concern among China\u2019s technology entrepreneurs, though, few expressed it at the forum. They broadly warned that closing borders would stifle innovation, but did not specify how a trade dispute with the United States could affect their bottom line.Shen Wei, president and chief executive of Vivo, a Chinese software company, urged companies like his to be more open with their technology. \u201cWe cannot survive without each other,\u201d he said.Baidu, China\u2019s biggest internet search company, has been a beneficiary of previous attempts by the Chinese government to protect domestic companies. Speaking at the Boao forum, Zhang Yaqin, Baidu\u2019s president, urged the United States to be more open and said that his company had not felt much impact from the growing trade tensions.\u201cI have not seen a significant influence on our basic work,\u201d Mr. Zhang said.\u201cI do not want to see this trade dispute escalate,\u201d he added. \u201cBut it will not affect the development of technology.\u201dKeith Bradsher contributed reporting from Beijing, and Cao Li contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Love Forged by the Threat of Deportation", "Date": "2018-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveA woman opens her heart to a relationship with a young immigrant from Colombia, despite the likelihood that it can\u2019t last.He and I first smiled at each other one night almost 20 years ago in Caf\u00e9 Remy, a favorite downtown Manhattan spot for the area\u2019s financial workers. With the humid August air making his dark thick hair a cherubic mess, I thought, \u201cHey, Angel Boy, you look so cute. Where did you get that crazy hair?\u201d I was feeling happy and bold because I was finally free from my previous boyfriend, who had broken up with me but kept me tethered with claims of \u201cI love you\u201d and \u201cI miss you\u201d and \u201cI just need time.\u201d He failed to mention that he needed time to pursue someone else. I spent the next few months rolling around on my floor, drinking wine and crying into my journals. But in his absence, I started to understand how stifled I had been with someone who was happiest staying at home with his computer and television shows. In social situations with my friends, he always seemed adorably awkward, until the day he said, \u201cI\u2019m not shy. I just don\u2019t want to expend my energy on them.\u201d Did I really want my ex to return to me? No. I wanted to go out and dance. Again the wavy-haired man and I exchanged looks.Then there were shouts in Spanish: \u201cLet\u2019s go dance!\u201d And everyone went up the staircase to the second floor, where there was another bar and a small dance floor. When the man looked at me for the third time, he did so with a subtle hand wave, beckoning me to the dance floor. So I went. His name was Eddie. He was the only man in the place with a book of literature tucked under his arm. A currency broker from Cali, Colombia, he spent his days with three phones to his ears, making multi-million-dollar trades between banks in the United States and Latin America. I assumed he had landed his coveted job as a member of a well-to-do family after studying at a prestigious American college and business school. Later, I would learn otherwise.We danced until we needed a break and sat with our legs casually entwined, telling each other funny stories. At the end of the night, when we reached the club\u2019s threshold, the moon hung bright next to the twin towers and the city air had become cool and breezy.With his hand across my back, we walked and talked and kissed. When I waved goodbye from the taxi, the driver said, \u201cYou will see him again.\u201d I did see him the following week, but only to say goodbye. He wanted to tell me in person that he was in an unhappy relationship with the mother of his two sons. And even though that relationship was ending, his return to Colombia was imminent. In one stressed-out ramble, he said, \u201cMy work permit expired and they\u2019re not going to renew it, and now, with my job, they told me don\u2019t bother coming back if I don\u2019t fix this by next week.\u201dNearly a decade before, he had arrived in New York via Mexico City, having crossed the Rio Grande into El Paso \u2014 a young man looking for a better life. He had worked poorly paid immigrant jobs: long days in sweatshops followed by late nights in catering halls. Then, through a friend, he lucked into a better-paying Wall Street job where, because he was bilingual, he was desperately needed to service Latin America\u2019s emerging foreign exchange market.There, with only a high school education, he calculated Uruguayan, Chilean and Colombian currency into dollars, sometimes simultaneously juggling all three in his head. He told me that most brokers handled no more than two.Eddie had received his United States work permit after marrying a citizen, but when it came time for their green-card interview, his wife (not the mother of his boys) refused to go and divorced him soon after. As such, there was no reason for the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service to renew his work permit. For Eddie to apply for it himself would mean presenting himself to I.N.S. and risking everything.On a warm September day, I accompanied him to 26 Federal Plaza in Lower Manhattan as his friend and witness, able to alert his family when his American dream devolved into a nightmare. I carried a leather briefcase and wore a couture military-style suit, balancing a professional look with a low-key sexiness for this man who I wanted to still lust after me no matter what happened next.I.N.S. was in an ugly slab of a building within a huge concrete courtyard. It\u2019s still there in all of its ugliness, but now it\u2019s called the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service and its plaza is filled with security officers and their apparatus. What had been a public space to prepare for or decompress from the drama within has become part of the entrance gantlet. Inside I.N.S. was a waiting room full of people, languages and unease. We checked in at a window, pushing papers through a small slot to an agent. There were many agents behind this glass, giving or receiving documents and telling people to sit and wait in the bolted-down plastic chairs. Eventually an agent called for Eddie. As we approached, I stared hard at the agent, as if to say: \u201cI see you. I\u2019m watching everything.\u201dAfter Eddie went off, I sat alone. Since I was pretending to look like his lawyer, I didn\u2019t kiss him goodbye. I felt sad I would never kiss him again. Now I would just be a link to his family, someone to deliver the bad news.\u201cSorry, they took him,\u201d I would say. \u201cHe wanted me to let you know.\u201d Maybe I would meet his sons. As I waited, my mind kept churning out \u201cWhat if?\u201d scenarios, all kinds of terrible possibilities, until I ambushed myself with one that felt impossibly sweet: \u201cWhat if he asked me to go with him, to Colombia or someplace else? What would I do?\u201dA small yet decisive voice inside me said yes. If he asked, I would go anywhere if it meant we could be together.This was love, I realized. Love forged by the urgency of his situation, perhaps, but love nonetheless. It felt so awful and absurd for me to discover it under these circumstances, though, because it would never happen.Then Eddie returned, overwhelming my circuitry by sidling up to me. I felt his body skim mine, and we looked at each other. His face was expressionless. We walked in silence until we were outside. \u201cThey just gave me this,\u201d he finally said, revealing his new employment authorization card, cupped inside his palm as if he had just performed a magic trick.It wasn\u2019t a magic trick but a bureaucratic mess.We wouldn\u2019t know the truth for two years, after we married, when, during our own green-card interview, we were told that Eddie\u2019s file had been lost back then. So when he had requested his work reauthorization on that warm September day, they didn\u2019t know about his divorce and its implications for his immigration status. They had simply stamped his papers and then sent him on his way.Now they were sending us on our way with Eddie\u2019s status in limbo until they found his file. Ten months later, in December 2001, I finally received Eddie\u2019s green card in the mail while holding our month-old son in my arms. Eddie wasn\u2019t there to receive it. He had died on Sept. 11, his second day at work as a senior broker at Cantor Fitzgerald. That was nearly 17 years ago. Our son is now a young man. My separation from Eddie is permanent and unbreachable.Meanwhile, I bear witness to the daily ruptures, the breaking of loving bonds between husbands and wives, parents and children, sisters and brothers. I see their pictures and watch their final embraces (if they are even allowed to have them). All of this love denied by a system and political view that turns what should be so easy and possible into something so cruel and impossible.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A High-Paying Job? Go to App Boot Camp.", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFixesCollege students who want high-paying, interesting jobs should choose a major in one of the STEM fields \u2014 science, tech, engineering and math. So says the conventional wisdom.\u201cComputer science is one industry where people can march back up to the middle class,\u201d said Ms. Saujani. But women and minorities aren\u2019t taking advantage of the opportunity. The resulting shortage of workers hurts companies, and the economy.\u201cIt takes months to hire a software engineer in New York City,\u201d said Ilia Papas, founder and chief technology officer of Blue Apron, a meal-kit delivery service. And it\u2019s costly. \u201cYou either have to have an in-house recruitment firm, which is expensive,\u201d he said, \u201cor pay a recruiting firm 20 to 30 percent of the first year\u2019s salary.\u201dThe students showed off web apps for saving money, booking art studio time and allowing people alarmed by the news they\u2019re reading to make quick donations to relevant charities, among other things.Tasilym Twinamaani and her four teammates presented an app called Chatterbox.\u201cHow many of you watch \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019?\u201d she asked the audience. \u201cIf you\u2019re like me, you probably had a lot to say about the recent season. And all those fans with passionate expressions of disbelief might want to share that with other people. So we offer free, specific space for fans of television to engage with other fans in real time.\u201dMs. Twinamaani, 29, attended Kean University in New Jersey, majoring in film and literature, but left one semester short of graduation when her money ran out. When her younger sister had a stroke in 2016, she quit her restaurant and post office jobs to take care of her sister\u2019s son \u2014 in addition to her own son, who is now 5. When her sister recovered, Ms. Twinamaani went back to work, first at a drugstore and then on the night shift packing boxes at Blue Apron\u2019s fulfillment center in Linden, N.J.\u201cWhen I was a kid I was always messing around with HTML and CSS for my Myspace page,\u201d she said. \u201cMaking websites has been in the back of my mind.\u201d She decided to look for a coding boot camp \u2014 an intensive course to learn the skills of web or smartphone app development.At the same time, Mr. Papas at Blue Apron was also looking for boot camps. He said that the company employed a thousand workers, the majority black or Latino, in the Linden center. \u201cLots of them are very smart, motivated and driven, but they didn\u2019t have the opportunity to pursue careers in different fields,\u201d Mr. Papas said. Training those with talent to be software engineers could bring needed ability and diversity to the company\u2019s largely white and Asian staff of 132 software developers in Manhattan.\u201cIt was difficult to find a boot camp taking people who didn\u2019t have a college education, or coming from underserved backgrounds, and giving them tools,\u201d Mr. Papas said.Then he found Access Code, a 10-month boot camp run by an organization called C4Q (formerly Coalition for Queens), which was designed to do exactly that. It offers a day or a nights-and-weekends program.\u201cNearly 70 percent of Americans don\u2019t graduate from college,\u201d said Jukay Hsu, C4Q\u2019s founder and chief executive. \u201cWhat are the meaningful pathways to advance their careers and create the companies of the future?\u201dBy June, the five-year-old program will have 483 graduates, all previously low-income. Half are female, half lack a college degree. Sixty percent are black or Latino, and 40 percent are immigrants.Instead of demanding traditional credentials, the program evaluates applicants as they solve logic puzzles and spend two days learning basic coding. One in 10 is accepted. C4Q says that upon entering, those students are earning an average of $18,000 a year, but when they graduate and find work in software engineering \u2014which almost all do \u2014 they make an average of $85,000.To finance this program, C4Q has experimented with different models. Originally, it charged students a price subsidized by philanthropy. Then it was free. But Mr. Hsu felt that the need for job training was spread among far too many people for donors to cover it all. Today, students pay nothing until they graduate and get a high-paying tech job. Then they pay C4Q 12 percent of their salary for three years.C4Q has also set up a \u201cjob-outcomes bond\u201d to finance the up-front costs. Two investors put up $750,000. They\u2019ll be repaid if enough students are paying tuition \u2014 in other words, if Access Code succeeds.The other is Ms. Twinamaani. She switched to a day job in Blue Apron\u2019s kitchens and commutes to Access Code in Queens at night and on the weekend \u2014 a three-hour, $20 round trip.Alongside tech skills, Access Code teaches students how to work in a corporate culture. They visit tech companies and meet engineers. And they grapple with the ways they might sabotage themselves.In the kitchens, Ms. Twinamaani\u2019s salary was just over $20,000. As a Blue Apron software engineer, she\u2019ll make at least $85,000 and potentially closer to six figures, Mr. Papas said. The first thing she intends to do is move her sister and their children out of their basement apartment in Elizabeth. \u201cIt\u2019s my dream to live in a place where my son can go outside and play on the lawn,\u201d she said.Boot camps are for adults who want to change jobs. But part of the struggle is getting a wider group to see a tech career as an option from the beginning. Several people I interviewed told me, \u201cYou can\u2019t be what you can\u2019t see.\u201dThe giant in that field is Girls Who Code; about 90,000 girls, from every state, have joined its afterschool clubs or taken summer courses, where they develop websites and apps to attack a problem they care about.Girls make up 20 percent of high school computer science classes, and there is likely to be only one black girl, if any. \u201cAt every stage of the pipeline it\u2019s leaky for women and people of color,\u201d said Ms. Saujani of Girls Who Code.Her organization is big enough and successful enough that it is changing the numbers. \u201cWe\u2019re on track to reach gender parity by 2027,\u201d said Ms. Saujani. \u201cWe\u2019re filling the pipeline with talent. Now my major problem is: Are you going to hire them?\u201dThe \u201cbro\u201d culture in many companies perpetuates itself. Ms. Saujani said the head of engineering at a major financial services firm told her he often starts his interviews with a question about baseball. \u201cHow many women are getting their Ph.D at M.I.T. or Stanford and can\u2019t get through the door at top-tier technology companies?\u201d Ms. Saujani said.Mentors can help. Paola Mata, an Access Code graduate who works at BuzzFeed, helped found a New York City group for Latinas in tech, with a few hundred members. They held hack nights and workshops on new skills, job searches and r\u00e9sum\u00e9-writing.More diversity among developers should mean more diversity in products. Affluent bros create apps for affluent bros: Bring me beer and burritos! Clean my apartment! Walk my dog!\u201cIt\u2019s only natural that we create things that reflect on some part of us,\u201d said Ms. Buchanan. Her app at Access Code mapped reports of sexual harassment. \u201cWe want more people working on these problems,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd for me, those problems don\u2019t include having pizza delivered to my house.\u201dAdvertisement"}
